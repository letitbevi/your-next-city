for UK holidaymakers. Airline staff queued up to go on strike, collapsed travel companies left clients stranded around the world, and holiday bookings wobbled as consumer confidence dipped. Mother Nature intervened in April as Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano spewed its innards across a\u00a0considerable chunk of the northern hemisphere, costing the airline industry $1.7bn in lost revenue. Then, predictably, Britain&apos;s transport system froze to a standstill as the snow arrived in December. But there are reasons to be cheerful in 2011. TripAdvisor&apos;s annual Travel Trends survey \u2013 which sampled 6,000 users \u2013 has revealed that Brits are hesitantly positive about their travelling prospects, with one in 10 planning to holiday more often this year. The Great British &quot;staycation&quot; also looks to be on the wane, with just 38% of those surveyed planning to stay at home for their holiday compared with 45% last year. Voluntourism and adventure travel are set to rise in popularity, our appetite for the Middle East is expected to grow apace with new flights to the region, and long-haul travel is fighting its way back against the dominance of European city breaks and mid-haul sun-seeking. 1. EasyJet enters Jordan     Photograph: PA    Spearheaded by the emergence of Dubai as one of the world&apos;s busiest flight hubs (the airport&apos;s capacity surpassed JFK last September), and the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council&apos;s prediction that the region&apos;s tourist growth will outstrip any other in 2011, British holidaymakers are expected to pour into the Middle East. Having entered the region with its first flights to Tel Aviv in 2009, easyJet is adding Jordan to its portfolio, with flights into Amman scheduled to begin in March, from a lead-in price of \u00a3105.98 return.

Trailblazing in Nepal     Photograph: Rex Features    A recent TUI study reported British travellers are more likely to book an adventure travel trip over the next three years. For those looking to sate their inner explorer this year, a groundbreaking new trail in Nepal should do the job. Australian Robin Boustead has spent 152 days traversing a series of routes winding beneath the world&apos;s highest peaks over the past few years, meticulously mapping the Great Himalayan Trail (thegreathimalayatrail.org) \u2013 the first continuous trail across the Nepalese Himalayan arc from Kanchenjunga on the eastern border, through the foothills of Everest, concluding on the Tibetan border in the west. The inaugural public expedition, led by Boustead himself, begins in February and will cost an eye-watering \u00a320,500 for the entire trip.

Libya is the last north African country to open up to European tourism and has seen steady rises in visitor numbers since the recent relaxation of visa requirements, making it possible for visitors to obtain visas at the point of entry.

Making an eco village in Sierra Leone     John Obey beach, Sierra Leone    Voluntourism is expected to continue to be one of the fastest-growing markets in global tourism, and a brand-new venture on a remote Sierra Leone beach is one of the most intriguing projects. As the country gears up for its 50th anniversary of political freedom in April, the John Obey beach community is the newest undertaking by Tribewanted \u2013 the social experiment that saw hundreds of volunteers build a sustainable eco resort from scratch in Fiji over the past three years. The first-footers arrived in October, and work is already under way, with locals and &quot;tribe members&quot; working together to build the first mud houses in the new eco village. The perks?

But in the high-rise shopping centres on the other side of town, bargain hunters in the winter sales are battling to get their hands on the real thing. Istanbul&apos;s covered market, an early shrine to shopaholism, is about to celebrate its 550th anniversary with a multimillion-pound facelift. In fact, the entire city is in the throes of a multibillion-pound makeover, as what was once an outpost on the edge of Europe rebrands itself as a regional magnet. The city is buzzing. Only a few years ago, when residents spoke of millennium domes it was not the O2 venue for the latest Lady Gaga concert they had in mind, but the thousand years separating the Church of Hagia Sofia and the Blue Mosque on the skyline of the city&apos;s historic peninsula. But now there are new skylines. At the European entrance to the Bosphorus bridge, work goes on through the night on the Zorlu Centre, a hotel-arts-shopping-residential-office complex. It is just down the road from the Sapphire skyscraper, which advertises itself as Istanbul&apos;s tallest building, and with a strong arm you could throw a stone at the new Trump\u00a0Towers. &quot;Istanbul is a country, not a city,&quot; says its mayor, Kadir Topbas, and the explanation of its modern boom is buried in the history of the past 30 years. In 1980 Istanbul could not afford the electricity to illuminate that famous skyline. The city, along with the rest of Turkey, was under martial law and there were midnight curfews and even shortages of Turkish coffee. Since then the city has elbowed its way into the global economy. The backstreet clip joints in the European neighbourhood of Beyoglu have turned into boutique hotels, fusion eateries and world music clubs. The smoke-filled coffee houses whose patrons once scrounged for the price of a glass of tea, now serve lattes \u2013 and if you try to light up, there is a \u00a330 fine. At the end of the second world war, when the iron curtain came down to isolate Istanbul from the rest of Europe, only a million people lived here. Since then, the city has increased its population by that amount every 10 years. &quot;Today&apos;s Istanbul is above all an immigrant city,&quot; says Murat Guvenc, city planner and curator of Istanbul 1910-2010, a remarkable exhibition that explains the pace of change. It is housed in santralistanbul \u2013 a converted power station more brutally chic than London&apos;s Tate Modern. Turkey is already a young country \u2013 the average age is 29 \u2013 but Istanbul is even younger. People come there to work and often retire somewhere else. And if Turkey is notoriously poor at getting women into formal employment, nearly half of them work in Istanbul. A recent study by the Washington-based Brookings Institution, in a joint investigation with the LSE Cities project, judged that Istanbul had beaten Beijing and Shanghai to claim the title of 2010&apos;s most dynamic city. &quot;Istanbul takes the top ranking for economic growth in the past year,&quot; wrote Alan Berube, director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Programme. &quot;Its economy expanded by 5.5% on a per capita basis, and employment rose an astonishing 7.3% between 2009 and 2010. Turkey&apos;s banking sector, which was less invested in risky financial instruments, became a safe haven for global capital fleeing established (and exposed) markets during the downturn.&quot; Economists may be just realising that Istanbul is the place to be. Couch surfers and Erasmus exchange students have known this for some time. If emerging markets are kick-starting the global economy, creative dynamism is ebbing away from the old centres to the new. Istanbul is fast resembling Henry Miller&apos;s Paris or the post-Soviet city-wide party in Prague where western twentysomethings can spend that critical time between university and life. &quot;You just can&apos;t just show up in New York or London and hope to fit in,&quot; says Katherine Ammirati, 23, from Berkeley, California. &quot;At least not without a plan bankrolled by well-heeled parents.&quot; She came to Istanbul, doing tutoring jobs and then clerical work at a law firm and will go home one day to become a lawyer herself. &quot;Istanbul still has rich and poor side by side, and that makes it feel like a real city,&quot; she says. The international art community, too, has put the city on its nomadic route, drawn in large measure by the success of the privately organised Istanbul Biennial, which will be held again this September. Sotheby&apos;s recently set up shop in Istanbul, motivated by a new generation of Turkish artists and the new purchasing power of Turkish patrons. In the opening-night crush at Contemporary Istanbul, the city&apos;s late autumn art fair, there was hardly elbow room to lift a glass. The frontiers are disappearing. New York galleries are opening up in Istanbul and Turkish collectors go abroad. Art Basel Miami Beach might not feel the competition yet, but the city founded by Constantine as the new Rome in 330 wasn&apos;t built in a\u00a0day. &quot;Istanbul&apos;s biggest problem is that we don&apos;t know what we&apos;re doing right,&quot; says Kasim Zoto, a hotel keeper who sits on the board of the Turkish Hotel Association. In 1955 a Hilton hotel opened up a new modernist skyline across from the Golden Horn and the hillside was soon littered with convention centres, concert halls and more five-star hotels. In the next two years, the number of hotel rooms in the city will rise by a third and two new Hiltons will\u00a0open. Not everyone approves of the consequences of such vertiginous growth. To some, gentrification appears out of control as &quot;real&quot; neighbourhoods, whether those of the Roma community by the old city walls, or the working-class districts around Beyoglu, are bulldozed for redevelopment. Only high-level lobbying last year stopped the city from being defrocked by Unesco as a world heritage site, as a row blew up over plans for an overland rail link for the city&apos;s metro system that would slice the view of the Suleymaniye Mosque. The city has so far failed to meet an undertaking to produce an inventory of historic buildings and a master plan to manage the peninsula \u2013 all measures that would get in the way of the developers&apos; axe. Environmentalists feel powerless to stop the construction of a third Bosphorus bridge which, if the precedents of bridges one and two are anything to go by, will lead to the destruction of the city&apos;s remaining green belt. Optimists and pessimists over Istanbul&apos;s future tend to be divided along political lines, according to Hakan Yilmaz, a political scientist at the city&apos;s Bosphorus University. Those who support the current religious-leaning government are inclined to see the glass half full. It is Turkey&apos;s ardent secularists, now losing their status, who feel less hopeful about the future. And while some Istanbulites might see themselves caught up in a clash of civilisations, between the pious and religious and a western-oriented elite, for others it is precisely this tension that makes the city come alive. &quot;There is a new culture being born,&quot; says Kutlug Ataman, a Turner prize finalist. The &quot;usual suspects&quot; \u2013 the food and the nightlife \u2013 are what make Istanbul such an attractive place, he argues, but it&apos;s the pace of change that makes the city so addictive. Having fled the country after the 1980 military coup, he sees Turkey&apos;s transformation evolving, however imperfectly, in the right direction. As if to make his point, alongside a retrospective of Ataman&apos;s own work in the Istanbul Modern museum is a celebration of the contribution of Armenian architects to the 19th and early 20th century city, an important step in allowing the city&apos;s remaining Armenian community to reclaim the space they created. &quot;We are becoming more democratic and you feel as an artist that you can make an impact,&quot; Ataman says. And if Istanbul feels despondent about surrendering its European capital of culture crown to Turku in Finland, it knows the cloud has a silver lining. In 2012, it will become European capital of sport.

Not since the last days of university \u2013 as you walked up those stairs with your friend  s , and all the textbook braggadocio and bald-faced lies (&quot;Oh I definitely flunked my finals, but I&apos;m not actually bothered because I came to university to discover myself and I&apos;ve done that, so...&quot;) of the few minutes previous morphed sharply into a silence that betrayed how much it meant \u2013 has the prospect of a 2:2 been so unnerving. England have been so manifestly superior in this series that, even though they have retained the Ashes, a drawn series will gnaw at their belly button until it smarts. For 95 per cent of this game they have again looked a class above Australia, yet a couple of very dodgy spells and an important toss mean the contest is precariously poised. England will resume on 167 for three in reply to Australia&apos;s 280, but on a pitch that should break up they&apos;ll want a three-figure lead. We have quite a day in prospect. Part of me doesn&apos;t really give a solitary one whether England lose this game, the more important task having been completed, but then another part has one recurring thought: they can&apos;t bloody draw with this rabble. It&apos;s unthinkable. For if England&apos;s dominance has been enormous on the pitch, it has been even greater on paper. (EDITOR&apos;S NOTE: THIS IS THE BORING BIT WHERE THE OBO WRITER GETS OVEREXCITED ABOUT SOME STATISTIC OR ANOTHER. YOU CAN PROBABLY SKIP IT.) They average 48.71 runs per wicket to Australia&apos;s 29.37 \u2013 and that difference of 19.34 runs per wicket is England&apos;s highest in any Ashes series, ever, ever. Higher than in 1985 (16.30 runs per wicket), higher than in 1956 (12.34); higher than in 1911-12 (10.98); higher than 1978-79 (a surprisingly low 6.45, given that England won the series 5-1). It&apos;s not the highest overall in any Ashes series, mind: Australia achieved that in 1989, when they averaged a laughable 30.15 runs per wicket more than the 29 men of England. If Australia steal a series draw here, it will \u2013 even allowing for the adjustment to average runs per wicket on both sides in the course of them winning this game \u2013 outdo those famous travesties of 1998 (when South Africa lost 2-1 despite averaging 6.03 runs per wicket more than England), 2003 (when South Africa drew 2-2 despite averaging 8.49 more than England) and 2009 (when Australia lost 2-1 despite averaging 6.49 more than England). For the record, the biggest difference in any Test series came in 2005, when England averaged an absurd 145.33 runs per wicket more than Bangladesh - or, if you prefer, 1453 runs per innings more than the Banglas. They won&apos;t match that this time round, but there&apos;s always 2013. Here&apos;s a list of the average runs per wicket in all Ashes series. For the first time in years, I had to go to the old Statsguru page to find this; it was nice to discover that, like old friends meeting up for the first time in ages, the chemistry was still there. We still have those rib-tickling in-jokes about Andy Ganteaume&apos;s Test average, and Don Bradman&apos;s record on the subcontinent. Good times.  The Fred Trueman Award for the email that proves it was definitely better in the old days goes to.... Nick Jones.  Andy mentioned Jim Swanton last night. Here&apos;s a lovely story, told by Christopher Martin-Jenkins. Swanton edited a cricketing magazine, whose offices were in Great Portland Street. Every lunchtime one of the staff was despatched to the local pub (it&apos;s a famous BBC watering hole, I can&apos;t remember its name) to purchase a smoked salmon sandwich and a large G&amp;T for the great man. This day the task fell to editorial understrapper CMJ. London was suffering from a massive heatwave and the pub had had no deliveries of ice. So when the barmaid gives CMJ the sandwich and drink she says &quot;Sorry dearie, but there&apos;s no ice today.&quot; CMJ hurries back to the office and duly delivers Jim&apos;s lunch, repeating the apology for the absence of ice in the drink. &quot;NO ICE?&quot; booms Swanton at a quaking CMJ. &quot;But didn&apos;t you tell them who it was FOR?&quot;  Oh man, I would give so much to have been a journalist back in the day, when 800-word masterpieces were constructed behind an almost deadly fug and on an exclusive diet of Embassy Regal and whisky. I don&apos;t even like smoking, but it&apos;d be worth the sacrifice to live in that era.  Another place I&apos;d like to have been was Cape Town earlier today. What a day of Test cricket that was, surely one of the great days of the modern era. As well as awe-inspiring performances from two true greats, Sachin Tendulkar and Dale Steyn, there was an amazing incident when Harbhajan Singh was caught at slip off the outside edge \u2013 the outside edge of off stump. The bails stayed in their groove and, although South Africa were convinced it was a catch, Ian Gould made a brilliant decision to give Harbhajan not out.  &quot;Morning statto,&quot; says Lord Selve, knowing that flattery will get his email published. &quot;Lovely stroll here this morning up Oxford Street. Looked for John Lewis and Selfridges but found only the Lick-Her-Shop, the Tool Shed and the House of Fetish. It is pink day at the SCG, in support of the Jane McGrath Breast Cancer Foundation. Brilliantly done and something that we should try at home. But I love irony and today&apos;s definition of irony is the couple, dressed in their pink T-shirts, with their anti-melanoma sunscreen slapped on, smoking like chimneys.&quot;  49th over: England 168-3 (Cook 62, Anderson 1) There are 98 overs to be bowled today, the first by Ben Hilfenhaus, who was unusually expensive yesterday. There&apos;s some encouraging early swing, and only a late inside edge stops Cook from being plumb to the second ball. Hilfenhaus has a big shout for LBW against Anderson turned down off the last ball. It looked like it was sliding down, so Clarke doesn&apos;t refer. The camera cuts to the Sky box, where Michael Holding is sporting a pink bandana. And, of course, he looks like the coolest pink-bandana-wearing motherflipper that ever there was. One from the over. &quot;Following on from the academic chat last night, I spent all day in the British Library researching my dissertation \u2013 topic: cricket in the USA pre-1860,&quot; says Gordon Macrae. &quot;I am now over-caffeinated, with a table-full of notes spread before me and an all-nighter with the OBO to look forward to. Colly to bag a ton!&quot; Could be his last Test innings, of course.  50th over: England 170-3 (Cook 64, Anderson 1) David Brent said &quot;always start with a joke&quot;, but Michael Clarke has given the ball to Peter Siddle rather than Mitchell Johnson. I jest. Johnson&apos;s spell at Perth is probably my favourite moment of the series, but my God, what a character. Anyway, Cook tucks Siddle off the pads for a couple in an otherwise uneventful over. &quot;Best Swanton comment came from Mike Carey, former Telegraph correspondent,&quot; says Lord Selvey. &quot;The &apos;e&apos; in EW swanton stood for Ernest, but he was never known as that. Instead, always the more cuddly &apos;Jim&apos;. Carey heard he was doing an autobiography, and said he thought it should be called &apos;The Importance of Not Being Ernest&apos;.&quot;  51st over: England 170-3 (Cook 64, Anderson 1) Hilfenhaus is trying to rough Anderson up with short stuff, a plan that is at best surprising and at worst Baldrickian. He slowly increases his length as the over progresses, and Anderson defends a maiden. A slow start to the day. England need to be careful that they don&apos;t dig a trench with Anderson at the crease. &quot;Talk of university days is ironic given your line of work,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;You have had to wait until you were employed to be pulling all-nighters.&quot; Insert your own &apos;he couldn&apos;t even pull an all-nighter at university&apos; gag here.  52nd over: England 176-3 (Cook 69, Anderson 2) Cook touches a straight delivery from Siddle off the pads for four. Siddle puts his hands to his head and growls at the injustice, because if Cook had missed it he was plumb. But he didn&apos;t miss it, so he wasn&apos;t. &quot;Surely Silvio Dante would wear the pink bandana better than Mikey,&quot; says Phil Rhodes. &quot;Now thats a site id like to see MIchael Holding bowling at Silvio Dante.&quot; Clearly. After a flawless first sentence you got so overexcited at the thought that you missed two apostrophes and a colon, capitalised one letter that should have been lower case, and had another lower case that should have been upper. Imagine if you&apos;d been thinking about Michael Holding bowling to Tina Fey!  53rd over: England 181-3 (Cook 69, Anderson 7) Maybe that&apos;s why Hilfenhaus was loath to pitch the ball up to Anderson, because when he does he is lashed through the covers for four. Shot, Jimmy! &quot;As he strolled up Oxford Street, Selve might also have noticed &apos;Hot Cuts&apos;, the topless barber shop,&quot; says Paul King, who may or may not be sporting a nice new haircut. &quot;No need for him to visit though!&quot; That nose hair won&apos;t remove itself.  WICKET! England 181-4 (Anderson b Siddle 7) Maybe that&apos;s why you should pitch the ball up to Anderson, because he has just missed a straight one. Full, straight and ramming into off stump with feeling as Anderson played down the wrong line.  54th over: England 183-4 (Cook 69, Collingwood 2) Here&apos;s Paul Collingwood. He was not supposed to play even one Test innings; this is his 115th and, just maybe, his last. I suspect I might shed a tear were he to get a hundred today. He gets off the mark with an assertive square drive for two off the second ball. In the Sky box, Nasser Hussain reckons he might play his strokes today \u2013 as he did in that career-saving hundred against South Africa in 2008. &quot;Since Selvey is so close by Oxford Street, I can strongly recommend Luccio&apos;s in Paddington a couple blocks off Oxford - that is if he can tear himself away from the Lick-Her-Shop,&quot; says Jeffrey Feim. &quot;Luccio&apos;s is frequently rated among the top restaurants in Australia. My best mate lives around the corner and I&apos;ve been lucky enough to dine at Luccio&apos;s a few times when visiting Sydney over the years. Wish I was there now because it is -1\u00b0C and snowing outside here in upstate New York.&quot; My heart bleeds!  55th over: England 186-4 (Cook 72, Collingwood 2) Cook works yet another one off middle stump, this time through midwicket for three off the bowling of Hilfenhaus. He looks very comfortable thus far. &quot;Dodgy shops?&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Humph, we&apos;re just as adventurous out here in the sticks of Lincoln. I go to a topless barber shop every month. Although sadly the years have not been kind to Alfred.&quot;  56th over: England 186-4 (Cook 72, Collingwood 2) Siddle tries a slower ball\u00a0\u2013\u00a0get him \u2013 and Cook defends. It&apos;s a maiden, so that&apos;s 19 runs from eight overs. A pretty sedate start, then. &quot;Rob,&quot; says Phil Rhodes, &quot;I have reflected on my errors and decided pink would not suit Silvio at all.&quot; No apology for those grammatical errors, I see. It&apos;s like when Tony Soprano beat Ralphie up and refused to apologise. Exactly like that.  57th over: England 189-4 (Cook 72, Collingwood 5) Hilfenhaus jags one back into Collingwood, who inside-edges onto his pads at the 11th hour. The next ball curves late and beats Collingwood, but he responds nicely with a cut through the covers for three. &quot;Before you start attacking Phil Rhodes for his errant English,&quot; begins Alastair Morrison, &quot;you may wish to sort out your spelling of Brian, as Mr Jacks should properly be.&quot; Bah!  58th over: England 195-4 (Cook 77, Collingwood 6) This is a good move from Michael Clarke. He has brought on Mitchell Johnson, who has dismissed Collingwood with both full and short deliveries in this series. The first ball is a well-directed short one to Collingwood that jams the fingers of the bottom hand against the bat handle, with the ball popping through the vacant short leg area. This will be a really tricky half-hour for Collingwood. Life looks much more comfortable for Cook, who uppercuts some sickening filth for four. &quot;Warne seems to be making a statement with his suit today - that being that he can&apos;t pick a tie,&quot; says James Andrews of Shane Warne&apos;s bright pink blazer. &quot;Sadly, Atherton got the &apos;all mouth no trousers&apos; comment in before me.&quot;  59th over: England 197-4 (Cook 79, Collingwood 6) Cook is playing really well, in his usual unobtrusive way. We take him for granted, but yesterday he became the second youngest player after Sachin Tendulkar to reach 5000 Test runs. What an achievement that is. By the time he retires, he will have smashed all the major records for English Test batting. While I was typing that, he so nearly fell to Hilfenhaus. It was a good ball that came back late and just zipped under the bat and onto the pad. Cook was outside the line so there was no LBW appeal, but he could easily have got into mischief there. &quot;Following yesterday&apos;s OBO feature on Ashes spearcarriers, I now know what Larry Booth is going to look like 15 years hence, having seen a BBC4 programme on Baroque Art earlier this evening: Waldemar Januszczak,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;The footwear is more A. Bull as a Callow Youth, though.&quot;  60th over: England 205-4 (Cook 86, Collingwood 7) I don&apos;t think Collingwood fancies Johnson, so he does the sensible thing and gets a single. I&apos;m surprised cricket publishers don&apos;t make more use of direct head-to-head stats, like Johnson v Collingwood. Sometimes they are nonsense, but other times they can be so revealing. I remember seeing that, before the 2002-03 Ashes series, Ricky Ponting had an average of 12 against Darren Gough and 160 against Andy Caddick. Moneyball for cricket. Anyway, Cook squirts Johnson to third man for four to take England past 200. &quot;Hello chaps,&quot; says Sarah Gillespie. &quot;Have got caught in the &apos;just watch the next over&apos; trap. I went to work with a full eight hours&apos; sleep today; isn&apos;t going to happen tomorrow. Anyway, Shane Warne on Sky \u2013 if he didn&apos;t have the matching pink trousers on already, where were they? What is the best alternative sartorial match to that jacket?&quot;  Scented leather chaps  No idea.  61st over: England 207-4 (Cook 87, Collingwood 8) Shane Watson is coming on replace Ben Hilfenhaus. Hmm. I would have let Siddle off the leash for another quick burst before Collingwood gets his eye in. And I am an idiot, because Watson so nearly struck with his last delivery. Cook, pushing with hard hands, edged this far short of Clarke, diving to his left at second slip. That&apos;s drinks. &quot;I almost got punched very hard during the filming of this so please link to it,&quot; says Sam Collins, proudly unveiling the latest Two Pricks at the Ashes. &quot;More Usmania, Tom Fordyce and Brad Haddin.&quot;  62nd over: England 209-4 (Cook 87, Collingwood 10) Collingwood works Johnson into the leg side to move into double figures. &quot;Just seen that Keith Miller&apos;s son will be presenting the Compton Miller medal to the Player of the Series after this match,&quot; says Simon Robinson. &quot;Who would you give it to \u2013 and who do you think it&apos;ll be given to? Can&apos;t see beyond Anderson or Cook, myself.&quot; Cook, and Cook. You can&apos;t argue with nearly 700 runs. Well, you can, and doubtless someone is about to, but I would give it to him.  63rd over: England 212-4 (Cook 90, Collingwood 10) Despicable filth from Watson, short, wide and slapped through the covers for three by Cook. That moves him in the nineties. Cook has fallen twice in the nineties in Tests, but never on a Wednesday to a man called Shane. &quot;I believe,&quot; says Lord Selvey, &quot;the Fetish Shop might be able to help.&quot; I assume this refers to Warne&apos;s jacket, but it might have something to do with Sam Collins and his near-beating. There&apos;s probably a bloody app for that as well.  64th over: England 217-4 (Cook 95, Collingwood 10) Cook pings Johnson through midwicket for two and then crunches a cut through extra cover for three more. Only three touring players have ever scored more runs in a series in Australia: Wally Hammond, Herbert Sutcliffe and Aubrey Faulkner. It&apos;s astonishing stuff even before you factor in his Ashes struggles in 2006-07 and 2009.  REVIEW! England 221-4 (Cook c Hughes b Beer 99) Cook is standing his ground. He worked the new bowler Michael Beer low to Hughes at short leg, and although Australia celebrated straight away Cook went nowhere. It isn&apos;t a review, just a check as to whether it carried. And it didn&apos;t. It bounced into his hands, so Cook is not out. Ian Botham is absolutely furious about Hughes&apos;s behaviour, and quite right too. But imagine how Michael Beer feels. What does he have to do to  kill this goddamn sunnabitch  get a first Test wicket?  65th over: England 221-4 (Cook 99, Collingwood 10) &quot;Cheating&quot; thunders Beefy. And he&apos;s right. Looking at the replays, Hughes&apos;s performance was pathetic. As he claimed the ball he let out a big &quot;ooooh&quot; \u2013 as in &quot;oooh, that was close&quot; \u2013 but then, when he saw a few of his teammates celebrating, tossed the ball up in triumph. Oh, man, that was a mighty loss of dignity.  66th over: England 221-4 (Cook 99, Collingwood 10) A maiden from Watson to Collingwood. &quot;You can&apos;t give a medal named after Compton and Miller to someone like Cook, just because he ground out 700 runs in a series,&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;Miller would&apos;ve got bored and got himself out long before he had half of those, whilst Compton&apos;s idea of a good night was a large meal and ten hours of drinking; Cook thinks it is a big night if he watches both of his Toy Story DVDs before bedtime.&quot; As enjoyable as this series has been in so many ways, it&apos;s not really been a Keith Miller kind of a series, has it? If 2005 was a Keith Miller series, this has been more of a Kenny Barrington series. Test cricket, bless it, takes all sorts.  67th over: England 225-4 (Cook 100, Collingwood 13) Alastair Cook has done it again! He reaches his 16th Test hundred, and his third of the series, with a work to leg off Beer. He was on the brink at The Oval last summer, and now he has had the series of his life: 677 runs at 135.40. Amazing. Apparently some of the Australian fielders pointedly declined to clap Cook, because of his two entirely legitimate escapes against Beer. If that&apos;s the case it&apos;s utterly pathetic, real unacceptable crap. &quot;Why would Hughes even do that?&quot; says Chris Lamb. &quot;He knows there are cameras watching him and millions watching the cameras. Really stupid.&quot;  68th over: England 225-4 (Cook 100, Collingwood 13) Another maiden from Watson to Collingwood, who has looked fairly comfortable since Johnson went off. Although he did have one daft mow at Beer that I forgot to describe. It flew off the bottom edge and between Haddin&apos;s getaway sticks for three runs. &quot;I&apos;ll confess that I&apos;d not heard of Aubrey Faulkner before you posted that list of highest aggregate scores in Australia, but what a sad tale,&quot; says David Hopkins. &quot; Is there any more evocative but tragic word than &apos;melancholia&apos;?&quot; It sure is a sad tale. And what a player. His numbers are outstanding. Of all the incredible all-rounders South Africa has produced, he is right up there and was a worthy inclusion in their all-time XI on Cricinfo.  WICKET! England 226-5 (Collingwood c Hilfenhaus b Beer 13) Michael Beer has his first Test wicket at last! Collingwood came down the track and tried to loft him over mid-on, but the ball was a bit too wide for the shot and he toe-ended it up in the air. Hilfenhaus ran back from mid-on to take a well-judged catch. Beer looks around for a few seconds, wondering what the catch is this time \u2013 12 fielders on the pitch, a little-known law of the game that says a man called Michael is not allowed to dismiss a man called Paul \u2013 before finally running to embrace Hilfenhaus. Well done to him. It looked a pretty ugly dismissal, but I wouldn&apos;t to be too critical of Collingwood: he decided to play positively and that was the right way to go in the circumstances. We can&apos;t have it both ways.  69th over: England 227-5 (Cook 101, Bell 0) So here&apos;s Ian Bell, at No7 again. Perversely, by failing Collingwood has probably ensured he&apos;ll have at least one more Test innings. Unless Cook and Bell add 700.  70th over: England 227-5 (Cook 101, Bell 0) A brilliant over from Watson. He almost nailed Cook with consecutive yorkers, and then wobbled and seamed a beauty past the outside edge. Wonderful bowling. &quot;Predicting events in the game is one thing, but I&apos;m going to try to predict an OBO reaction to them, too,&quot; says Josh Robinson. &quot;Namely: Bell b Beer 36, allowing you to recycle the &apos;he played for turn&apos; gag. Again.&quot; You know the saying: if it&apos;s broke, don&apos;t fix it. Beer looks good, actually. He clearly has healthy levels of mental strength, which is a good start.  71st over: England 232-5 (Cook 104, Bell 3) Bell gets off the mark confidently, cutting Beer through the covers for three. But Beer is causing problems for England and Cook, reaching around his front leg, chips just short of the man at short midwicket. There are a couple too many bad balls, but he has variety and plenty of ticker. This is no duff Beer.  72nd over: England 232-5 (Cook 104, Bell 3) Watson is bowling really well now and that&apos;s a tight, wicket-to-wicket maiden to Bell. &quot;The Aussie commentators were claiming good sportsmanship by Hughes on that catch that wasn&apos;t,&quot; says Jesse Linklater. &quot;They seem to think he knew it was close, but wasn&apos;t sure one way or the other and didn&apos;t really go for the appeal all that much.&quot; Hmm, maybe.  73rd over: England 234-5 (Cook 105, Bell 4) Beer v Bell should be a fascinating contest. Bell is wonderfully light-footed against slow bowlers but he is staying in his crease for now, getting a good look at Beer. &quot;My god I love Alistair Cook,&quot; says Qasa Alom. &quot;May he and Trott block and block and block their way to many more centuries over the next decade and give many nightmares to those marketing whizzes who try to make cricket trendy and hip for the younger generation.&quot;  74th over: England 239-5 (Cook 108, Bell 5) Cook squirts Watson to third man for three. In other news, Glenn McGrath has slipped into the Sky commentary box. He always comes across as such a good guy; just a gentle, shy soul. It&apos;s great to see such a response to the McGrath Foundation from everyone in this Test. The SCG is bathed in pink. Here&apos;s the link if you want to find out more about the McGrath Foundation. &quot;I&apos;m breaking out into a cold sweat just at the sight of him,&quot; chuckles Mike Atherton. We sometimes forget that McGrath was actually dropped after having a minor stinker in his first Ashes Test, at the Gabba in 1994-95. If only we knew.  75th over: England 243-5 (Cook 112, Bell 5) Beer overpitches and Cook spanks a cover-drive for four. The number of four-balls that Beer bowls would be the main concern from a nonetheless encouraging start. &quot;Perhaps not the greatest shot but at least Lord Colly played the match and not to save his own career,&quot; says Darren Haines. &quot;Unlike, say, one ML Hayden, Oval 2005. I hope the selfless ginger ninja&apos;s critics cut him some slack for it.&quot; I don&apos;t think people will be too hard on Collingwood. You just can&apos;t. It&apos;d be like using the bad word to a little old lady.  76th over: England 243-5 (Cook 112, Bell 5) Siddle is back, after that fine little spell from Watson. It&apos;s a maiden to Bell, who has started in a very circumspect fashion. Nobody has ever scored more Test fifties against one country without reaching a hundred \u2013 Bell has 11 \u2013 and he looks determined to sort that statistic out. &quot;Bit late in the convo, but re: anti-melanoma irony, Aussies are fanatical (admittedly with good reason),&quot; says Jennifer Roesler. &quot;Another example \u2013 a friend overheard a couple on the train discussing whether their eight-year-old daughter should be allowed to go along to a drug deal they were planning. &apos;No way,&apos; said the mother, &apos;She ain&apos;t got no sunscreen on.&apos;&quot; Is that a punchline or a genuine story? I can&apos;t tell the difference in this post-Barley age.  77th over: England 251-5 (Cook 120, Bell 5) Cook rifles another boundary through the covers off Beer. These are good runs ahead of the second new ball, and England are only 29 behind now. &quot;Save us the sanctimonious cheating crap,&quot; says Anthony Boge. &quot;As far as I am concerned, the introduction of technology simply means that fieldsmen will appeal for everything. After all, I seem to recall that Strauss appealed earlier in the match when the ball brushed an Australian&apos;s shirt. When the appeal was turned down Strauss didn&apos;t ask for a review and then clearly indicated to the bowler that the ball had brushed the batsman&apos;s shirt. If that what he thought, why did he appeal? Is that cheating?&quot; Well. I agree with the general point \u2013 that cricket is strangely lenient when it comes to some forms of cheating (not walking) and really hard on others (claiming catches) \u2013 but there&apos;s a fundamental difference in these two examples. Strauss simply could not know for certain whether it hit the batsmen&apos;s shirt; maybe he thought it was 80 per cent likely to have hit the shirt, but that still makes an appeal fair enough. Hughes was clearly 99-100 per cent sure that it bounced, and that&apos;s cheating.  78th over: England 254-5 (Cook 120, Bell 8) Siddle cuts Bell in half with a good delivery that jaggs back and keeps a touch low. England won&apos;t want to chase much more than 150 in the fourth innings on this. Bell responds with a good square drive that is pulled up just short of the rope. Talking of which... &quot;What&apos;s going on with the outfield here, eh?&quot; says Niall Harden. Talking of which... &quot;I&apos;ve not seen a single four, they seem to chase every ball down with ease. It&apos;s making me SO ANGRY.&quot;  79th over: England 254-5 (Cook 120, Bell 8) A maiden from Beer, played respectfully by Bell. He still hasn&apos;t really left his crease, which reflects well on Beer. No duff Beer this! I said no duff Beer this! &quot;I&apos;d say if it&apos;s above 87% chance of being an optimistic call, or above it&apos;s cheating,&quot; says Tom Munro. &quot;That&apos;s maths that is.&quot; Math.  80th over: England 259-5 (Cook 121, Bell 12) Siddle bangs in a short one wide of off stump and Bell uppercuts for four. That&apos;s his first boundary from his 32nd delivery. &quot;I for one would use the bad word to a little old lady!&quot; says Arron Wright, with pride. &quot;Sorry Rob. Before I go to bed I just want to say I&apos;ve had enough of the Colly worship. Last night people tucked into KP as per usual for getting out playing a silly shot \u2013 so on that basis how the hell was Colly &apos;playing the match&apos; with that stupid great hoik?&quot; I wouldn&apos;t really slag KP off for any of his dismissals. You can&apos;t celebrate the flamingos and then bemoan the bird-brained shots; the two go together. You can&apos;t, er, have your KP and eat it.  81st over: England 267-5 (Cook 129, Bell 12) Australia take the new ball immediately. Cook squeezes the first ball from Hilfenhaus past point for two, and that brings him to 700 runs in the series. Seven. Hundred. Runs. That&apos;s a mind-blowing performance. Actually, make it 706 runs, because he has pushed two through mid off and four through the covers. &quot;I&apos;m watching on an internet stream with Australian commentary,&quot; says Michael Meagher. &quot;They have now said about 143 times that they cannot believe Bell is so far down the order, in particular, below Collingwood. They want him at No3.&quot; I&apos;ll bet they do, in view of his record there. But, yes, he should and will bat No5 in the summer.  82nd over: England 274-5 (Cook 129, Bell 19) The risk with the new ball, of course, is that it will often go to the boundary even on Niall Harden&apos;s outfield, and Bell plays a sumptuous off-drive for four off the bowling off Siddle. He repeats the stroke two balls later, but Niall Harden&apos;s outfield wins and there are only three runs. Bell, as Ian Botham points out, is still only 28. He could score an eye-watering number of Test runs over the next five years. A prediction of 8000 Test runs @ 45 might start to look conservative. He currently has 4089 @ 43.50. &quot;Yep, all true,&quot; says Jennifer Roesler of her 76th-over anecdote. &quot;There is another one which doesn&apos;t work so well when written down, it&apos;s more in the verbal delivery, but definitely overheard on the train by my friend. Two guys this time. One says to the other: &apos;You see that house with that yard over there? Nearly got my head blown off the other day there, I did - this fella came out at me with a massive shot gun, he did&apos;. Then, without missing a beat: &apos;Oh look at the lovely jacaranda trees with all their lovely flowers, beautiful this time of year, they are.&apos;&quot; You&apos;re right:  it doesn&apos;t work so well when written down  that is a good one. I bet you&apos;re really craving the serene streets of Shepherd&apos;s Bush now.  83rd over: England 277-5 (Cook 130, Bell 20) Michael Clarke ends with a joke, bringing Mitchell Johnson on for the final over of this extended session. His first ball is a farcical off-side wide, and then Bell works a single to bring up a very calm fifty partnership. Cook tries to steal another single, but he would have been run out had Johnson, spinning to throw in his follow through, hit the stumps. That was superb athleticism from Johnson. Right, that&apos;s the end of the morning session. It&apos;s been an excellent one for England, who scored 110 for two relatively expendable wickets: the nightwatchman Jimmy Anderson and the out-of-form Paul Collingwood. They are only three runs behind and in a good position to take a decisive first-ininngs lead. But Australia have a ball that is only three overs old, so they won&apos;t be weeping into their salads just yet. Simon Burnton will talk you through the afternoon session; email him on simon.burnton@theguardian.com. Bye!  LUNCH  Ready for a bit more action, and I&apos;ve spent the lunch break trying to decide which out of Sky and 5 Live Sports Extra were broadcasting more interesting random padding. Have listened to both, alternately, for about five minutes at a time, and am thus fairly bewildered and have little idea what was happening on either of them. Anyway, shall we play some cricket?  84th over: England 277-5 (Cook 130, Bell 20) Siddle slings six balls across Cook, the first four of which are left alone, the remainder prodded not very far for not a sniff of a run. Can anyone help Julian follow the World Cricket League Division 3 matches at the end of January? He&apos;d like a live feed, ideally. Are there live feeds of Papua New Guinea v Oman from Hong Kong? Really?  85th over: England 283-5 (Cook 130, Bell 26) Bell flicks one off his pads for four to put England into the lead. &quot;Having had a 2am dip in the Med with Niall Charles Brendan Harden in our gonks in Nice, I&apos;d say his outfield could do with a trim too,&quot; reports William Morrow, AKA DJ Ment-ILL, apparently.  86th over: England 292-5 (Cook 132, Bell 33) 10 runs off Siddle&apos;s over: a four, one two, the rest singles - including Cook&apos;s first two runs since lunch.  87th over: England 295-5 (Cook 135, Bell 33) Cook nurdles three runs with last-moment prods into little holes in the close field. Hilfenhaus is the other bowler, incidentally. &quot;In light of the Cook/Hughes catch controversy, can I raise the issue of the last Test, and KP&apos;s ribbing Ponting about &quot;nicking&quot; his controversial catch,&quot; Kieron Shaw writes. You may, Kieron. Continue. &quot;I read (in The Guardian) that The Guardian &quot;broke&quot; this news. Not true \u2013 the Channel 9 commentary team reported it in real time and it makes brilliant listening/viewing. Here&apos;s the moment itself, very funny, although it really delivers best when you watch the whole farrago from the beginning. It just caps Ponting&apos;s frustration.&quot;  88th over: England 296-5 (Cook 136, Bell 33) Johnson comes on, to the considerable delight of the travelling England fans. His first delivery is miserably wide, basically begging to be dispatched to the boundary, but is unaccountably ignored by the charitable Cook. &quot;Anyone else think Michael Slater&apos;s had a heavy liquid lunch?&quot; asks TMS-listener Jack Savidge. &quot;He&apos;s been banging on about pigeons and doing shite Mark Nicholas-as-Austin Powers impressions. Poor bland old Simon Mann trying to bring him back to banal observations about how everyone&apos;s wearing hats.&quot;  89th over: England 296-5 (Cook 136, Bell 33) Watson replaces Hilfenhaus and it&apos;s a maiden \u2013 though Cook gets decent contact on a few occasions his strokes zip straight to fielders. We remain eagerly in wait of the first wicket-taking opportunity, or otherwise particularly interesting moment, of the session. The final word on who knew what and when during that fourth Test Pietersen-Ponting fandango from our own Mike Selvey: &quot;The Guardian knew it the previous evening but felt it inappropriate, in the interest of protecting a source, to disclose it. so there.&quot;  90th over: England 303-5 (Cook 142, Bell 34) Johnson continues to be considerably less parsimonious, and Cook cuts him away for an insouciant four to bring up 300 for England.  91st over: England 303-5 (Cook 142, Bell 34) The Guardian&apos;s swish Kings Cross bachelor pad has canny motion-sensitive lighting. I just made half of the entire floor&apos;s lights come back on simply by taking off my shoes. In other news, it&apos;s another maiden for the trundling Watson.  92nd over: England 311-5 (Cook 150, Bell 34) Johnson starts his over with the traditional hopeless loosener, and Cook watches it drift down the leg side, licks his lips and smacks the next three balls for eight to bring up his 150. &quot;&apos;Parsimonious&apos; and &apos;insouciant&apos; in one OBO entry? Bloody hell, its nearly 3am. Have a heart man,&quot; writes Alex Wilson. I do like &quot;insouciant&quot;. When it&apos;s right there&apos;s no word righter. Words are like that, sometimes. Sorry.  93rd over: England 315-5 (Cook 153, Bell 35) Watson having done his thing to little reward, from either team&apos;s perspective, Beer&apos;s having a go. It looked like they were going deliberately easy on Watson, preserving their energy for the most effective humiliation of Johnson. More from Mike Selvey: &quot;Re Michael Holding and whether he is wearing knickers on his head, I&apos;ve asked him and he says to tell you they were a souvenir from a lady last night.&quot;  94th over: England 318-5 (Cook 156, Bell 35) Watson was only changing ends, it turns out. Cook hits his second ball for three, allowing Bell to resume the deliberate defensive posturing with which he dealt with Watson&apos;s two previous overs. &quot;Re: Jack Savidge &amp; a refreshed Slats (over 88) - following a &apos;hilarious&apos; David Hasselhoff/Shane Warne anecdote Boycs has lumbered into the commentary box and announced his arrival with &quot;Michael Slater&apos;s messed up our commentary and now he&apos;s gone. He&apos;s very naughty. Very naughty.&quot; reports Richard Read.  95th over: England 323-5 (Cook 157, Bell 39) &quot;I think he&apos;s a good player,&quot; says Geoff Boycott of Cook on TMS. I think that&apos;s already been established, no? Beer finds Bell&apos;s edge, but the ball flies past the solitary slip and away for four.  96th over: England 327-5 (Cook 161, Bell 39) Unlike Bell, Cook is apparently happy to actually hit the occasional Watson delivery, and despite Khawaja&apos;s desperate diving efforts the resulting boundary brings up the 100 partnership. &quot;Parsimonious is nice, yes,&quot; concedes Steve Banjo. &quot;But abstemious is even better in the same circumstances. With the added bonus that it&apos;s one of only two words in the English language that have all the vowels, and in the correct order (a,e,i,o,u). I&apos;m not telling you the other. How&apos;s that for a 3am teaser?&quot; That does not please me.  97th over: England 329-5 (Cook 163, Bell 39) There is now just one Englishman in the whole of history who has scored more runs in a single Ashes series than Cook in this one. England&apos;s lead is 49, heading into a drinks break. And the other word with all the vowels in alphabetical order if facetious. Thanks to Simon Lacey and Paul Tooby for that one.  98th over: England 334-5 (Cook 164, Bell 41) Siddle&apos;s first ball, a bouncer, is called a wide. About a million other people also got facetious fractionally too late to get a name check. Samuel Riding gets a special mention for knowing many others, including fracedinous, arsenious, heriously and Phragelliorynchus, but I&apos;m pretty sure he made them all up. Does adventitious count? It&apos;s got two I&apos;s, but if it counts Tom McGrenery got it. And with that, I draw a line under these word games.  99th over: England 338-5 (Cook 165, Bell 45) You know that rising sense of excitement you get when the batsmen are under such sustained pressure that you can almost feel a wicket coming? I have never been further from it. &quot;I was just wondering, did Steve Smith win a contest to play in this match or is he there as mascot?&quot; asks Neil McGwyre. &quot;I know that the Aussie selection policy has been, shall we say, odd in this series but surely they haven&apos;t picked a specialist number 7 batsmen? Is he going to have a bowl or what?&quot;  100th over: England 339-5 (Cook 166, Bell 45) There was a run off that Siddle over. If it wasn&apos;t for that I&apos;d have missed it entirely. It just passed. One minute it hadn&apos;t happened, the next it had. &quot;Do the lights go back out if you put your shoes back on?&quot; wonders Sean Boiling. The lights are already off, it seems. Figuratively, at least.  101st over: England 344-5 (Cook 171, Bell 45) Beer&apos;s first ball is loose, and despatched for four by Cook to send yet more statisticians into a state of frenzied excitement. That&apos;s 1,000 first-class runs for him on this tour, I&apos;m told. &quot;I don&apos;t believe this. I&apos;m nursing a bottlle of wine, watching some illegal stream of channel 9 via india, and they&apos;ve stopped showing commentary to interview the bloody Australian Prime Minister,&quot; complains Jonathan Down. &quot;Full of bullshit of course - going on about the jayyyyyne mcgrath foundation and how much she&apos;s doing about the floods. For god&apos;s sake who cares!&quot; You&apos;ll never guess who&apos;s about to get a bowl.  102nd over: England 347-5 (Cook 173, Bell 46) Smith gets a rousing reception from fans who were surely starting to question his existence. &quot;I believe Smith said when he was initially selected that his brief was to have fun and make sure the team were enjoying themselves,&quot; wrote Scott Wilkinson, about two minutes before the ball was thrown to the young leg-spinner. &quot;One cant help but wonder when he will emerge from the dressing rooms sporting floppy shoes and a red nose.&quot;  103rd over: England 348-5 (Cook 174, Bell 46) Beer and Smith are now ready to exert a stranglehold of deadly spin on England&apos;s might batsmen. Or something. The main difference as far as I&apos;m concerned is that overs pass considerably more quickly, forcing me to do some high-speed nearly-4am-typing.  104th over: England 353-5 (Cook 175, Bell 50) Bell reaches his 50 with a lovely boff down the ground for four, and Australia seem entirely clueless as to how to stop England&apos;s relentless, chanceless accumulation of runs. &quot;I&apos;m following the OBO in my office in Hong Kong,&quot; writes Robert Russell. &quot;Can anyone advise me what to do during the uneventful minutes to stop myself staring at my young, beautiful colleague Shirley Smith (name changed to protect the innocent \u2013 sb) (aside from actually getting down to some work)?&quot;  105th over: England 354-5 (Cook 176, Bell 50) Another over passes with nothing by a single run and a faintly pleasant whooshing noise to show for itself.  106th over: England 355-5 (Cook 177, Bell 50) &quot;Have the minister for education visiting the school tomorrow to view the PE at the school,&quot; says John Woodberry, head of PE at Shanghai United International School. &quot;Not sure looking at OBO is the best preparation for this?&quot; Never fear, he&apos;ll have been reading too. Incidentally, Rob Smyth just made the entire floor&apos;s lights come on by adjusting his spectacles.  107th over: England 358-5 (Cook 180, Bell 50) &quot;Using the monkeys-banging-on-typewriters principle, if Johnson was made to bowl from the Randwick End until the end of time, would he collect the remaining five wickets by 2014?&quot; wonders Ranajit S Dam. Really, Australia might as well just ask England to name the score they&apos;d declare at and save us all a bit of time.  108th over: England 362-5 (Cook 183, Bell 51) Smith&apos;s four overs have passed without incident. Literally, none. Hilfenhaus is coming back now. &quot;I am also working at a school here in Hong Kong,&quot; writes Robert Russell. &quot;I would advise John Wodberry, rather than following the OBO, to stare at a young, beautiful colleague. It&apos;s far more uplifting.&quot;  109th over: England 366-5 (Cook 183, Bell 55) Four runs off the over, a terrifically straightforward four from Bell. &quot;You&apos;ve got to bowl to your field,&quot; rages Nasser Hussain. &quot;Two men on the drive and you&apos;re bowling cut balls to a batsman who likes the cut.&quot;  110th over: England 371-5 (Cook 184, Bell 59) Bell, whose innings thus far has been pretty much faultless under the very flimsiest examination, thwacks Smith&apos;s full toss for four. To be fair, he edges the last ball but it barely leaves the ground. &quot;Dormie in the series? they&apos;d never declare,&quot; says Mike Selvey, with unarguable and devastating logic. &quot;Well maybe after tea on the last day.&quot;  111th over: England 374-5 (Cook 186, Bell 60) Sky cut to a camera situated high in above the ground. &quot;You can just about see Sydney, those tall buildings in the distance,&quot; Michael Holding helpfully informs Sky&apos;s viewers, who might otherwise have been straining to identify the enormous metropolis just yards from the SCG. Thanks, Mike.  112th over: England 376-5 (Cook 187, Bell 61) Mike Hussey gets a bowl, to the absolute delight of many in the crowd, the vast majority of them presumably English. Mr Cricket certainly doesn&apos;t embarrass himself, though the two singles off it bring up the 150-run partnership. One over before tea. &quot;The channel 9 signal has failled here in Perth but the No Signal sign on the TV is only slightly more boring than the Aussie attack so I&apos;m not sureits worth complaining!&quot; notes Neil.  113th over: England 378-5 (Cook 188, Bell 62). England lead by 98 runs And that&apos;s the end of a fabulous session for England, bringing as it did 101 runs, though it was almost entirely bereft of dramatic incident. This game was on a knife-edge a few hours ago. No longer. Now it&apos;s on the edge of a very thick thing. It&apos;s on a land-mass edge.  TEA  Hello again. Given the pair&apos;s ubiquity, it&apos;s surprising how few Cook-and-Bell stories have been written for England over the last five years. This is only their second century partnership in Tests, and they are closing in on the 170 they added at Perth in 2006-07 (also the highest Test partnership by two men who still get asked for ID). The afternoon session was cherubic torture for Australia, and there might be more to come. Alastair Cook needs 12 more runs to become only the second Englishman, after the great Wally Hammond, to make two double-centuries in one Test series, while Ian Bell needs 38 more runs to make his first Test century against Australia. Bell currently has 12 fifties against the Aussies; hopefully in a couple of hours&apos; time he&apos;ll only have 11, because that will mean he has upgraded that 12th fifty to a first hundred. Most importantly of all, Bell needs another 124 runs to ensure that Lawrence Booth beats Barry Glendenning in a bet over how many he would score in the series.  114th over: England 380-5 (Cook 189, Bell 63) Shane Watson winces his way to the crease for the first ball after tea. It&apos;s short, wide and cut to the cover sweeper for one by Cook. Bell then rolls the wrists for another single, and that brings England&apos;s lead up to 100.  115th over: England 380-5 (Cook 189, Bell 63) A maiden from the willing but unable Hilfenhaus Here&apos;s a statistic: Australia have never conceded 500 four times in one series. In fact it&apos;s only happened three times in Tests, and West Indies were on the receiving end each time.  WICKET! England 380-6 (Cook c Hussey b Watson 189) Bah! That&apos;s a frustrating end for Alastair Cook, who reaches for a very wide delivery from Watson and edges it low to Hussey at gully. Very similar to his dismissal in the first innings at Perth. So Cook has missed out on a second double century, but it&apos;s been another epic innings. Simply immense. He has scored 766 runs in this series, and the Cook grandchildren are going to hear about each and every one in years to come. Cook walks off to a standing ovation from the crowd, although there is little applause from the Australian players. Hard to know whether that&apos;s just because the camera cut to them late, after they had applauded him, or whether they still have a sense of injustice over those Beer incidents. If it&apos;s the latter, they need to grow up.  116th over: England 380-6 (Bell 63, Prior 0) If they get in, the likes of Prior and Swann could flog this tired Australian attack. But if Australia can pick up the last four wickets for no more than 50, they won&apos;t be out of this game. (51 and they&apos;re doomed, obviously.) &quot;Smyth, you might complain now, but you&apos;ll be sad when it&apos;s over,&quot; says James Galloway. &quot;England are beating Australia in Australia - enjoy it. Revel in it. But for God&apos;s sake don&apos;t touch the Relentless.&quot; Clean since March, Galloway, clean since March.  117th over: England 384-6 (Bell 67, Prior 0) Nearly another one. Bell, driving at a delivery angled across him from around the wicket by Hilfenhaus, edges just short of Watson at around fifth slip. The ball scuttles away for four. &quot;I would send you some inspired witticism, or insightful epithet, but I slept through the whole of Bell&apos;s innings,&quot; says Duncan Smith. &quot;A good thing, it can&apos;t have been a riot on the radio. On another topic, you yearned for the great days of journalism earlier. Would the respect, power, women and money really have compensated for all the brilliant critique and snorting wit that you have the pleasure of enduring at 5am here?&quot; I&apos;m sorry I assumed that was a rhetorical question.  REVIEW! England 385-6 (Bell not out 67) This looks like a waste of a review. Or is it? Bell felt for a ball from Watson that cut back and apparently went off the inside edge through to Brad Haddin. He was given out and decided to review \u2013 but only after a chat with Matt Prior, which is very odd for a caught-behind decision. Either you know you hit it or you know you didn&apos;t. There is nothing at all on Hotspot but, as Mike Atherton says on Sky, is that sufficient to prove that the umpire has made a howler, because that&apos;s what the UDRS is for. This is a really interesting decision... and Bell is given not out. Hmm, I&apos;m not sure about that. Is Hotspot 100 per cent reliable? I don&apos;t think it is, and I wouldn&apos;t be at all surprised if, in a couple of overs&apos; time, Snicko showed an inside edge. Anyway, Bell survives.  118th over: England 385-6 (Bell 67, Prior 1) Another replay of that incident includes a big sound \u2013 and with Bell&apos;s bat away from his body, that could only have been an edge. And now Snicko does show an edge. That&apos;s a major failing \u2013 not of the UDRS, but of its implementation. The third umpire  Daryl Harper , the usually excellent Tony Hill, has buggered up really badly there. Australia&apos;s grievances are following the pattern of an OBOers friendships: first imaginary, and now real. &quot;Speaking of Relentless,&quot; says Oliver Pattenden, &quot;someone gave me a can of this stuff on New Year&apos;s Eve, called Four Loko, which has been banned in New York state (I think it&apos;s illegal in most of the states actually). It&apos;s essentially Relentless with 12% alcohol. Try and import some. It&apos;s genius.&quot;  119th over: England 393-6 (Bell 67, Prior 9) I wonder what Bell was thinking with that review. Was he reviewing for a no-ball? Anyway, Prior takes two boundaries off three deliveries from Hilfenhaus, a cover-drive and then an edge to third man. &quot;Middle of the night Smyth, middle of the night everybody,&quot; says Josh Robinson. &quot;I can&apos;t quite help wondering why they didn&apos;t stay with the decision of the on-field umpire for that one. Or why they don&apos;t use sound evidence as well as Hotspot, which as we&apos;ve already seen, is fallible. And if Snicko shows that Bell edged it, what does that say about (a) Bell and (b) the review system?&quot; I don&apos;t think the system is flawed, I just think it&apos;s been implemented wrongly by Tony Hill in this case. And I don&apos;t blame Bell at all.  120th over: England 397-6 (Bell 70, Prior 10) Poor old Belly. He&apos;s finally going to score a century against Australia at the 98th time of asking, and it will forever have an asterisk against it. &quot;If I may channel Mr. Geoffrey Boycott for an instant,&quot; begins Adam Gillett. &quot;&apos;You see, Cook was up for that 200, but you see, he wasn&apos;t quite into it. It&apos;s like playing chess - one moment you&apos;ve got your pawns and your bishops, and then, but you have to bat, you get 200, if you&apos;re me&apos;. I&apos;m a bitter man. A bitter man.&quot; Is that last bit you, Boycott, or both?  121st over: England 400-6 (Bell 70, Prior 13) Prior has started aggressively and pulls the new bowler Johnson for three. &quot;Why not blame Bell?&quot; asks Abhay Phadnis. &quot;He is surely the one person would know for sure whether there was an edge. One may not expect batsmen to walk any more, but to contest a decision knowing you are in the wrong - why would you not blame Bell for that?&quot; Everyone uses their reviews tactically, so why single Bell out?  122nd over: England 408-6 (Bell 77, Prior 14) Bell cover-drives Watson beautifully for four. &quot;So just to be clear, if Hughes appeals for a catch he knew he didn&apos;t take, he&apos;s a villain, but when Bell appeals an edge he knew he hit, it&apos;s the system at fault?&quot; says Matt Starr. This is the contradiction we mentioned earlier \u2013 that some things in cricket are seen as cheating (claiming catches that bounced) and others aren&apos;t (not walking) \u2013 but you can&apos;t pin a culture (of not walking) that has existed for 40 years on the gentle, beautiful shoulders of Ian Bell. That would be utterly ridiculous.  123rd over: England 409-6 (Bell 78, Prior 14) Johnson appears to have pulled something in his backside. Plenty of emails calling me an eff and a cee for defending Bell. All I would say is this: if Bell was reviewing in the hope of a no-ball \u2013 which I would not rule out \u2013 it would be a perfectly legitimate tactic in view of the fact that Australia&apos;s bowlers have been about as adept at keeping their front foot behind the line as John F Kennedy was at keeping it in his trousers.  124th over: England 417-6 (Bell 84, Prior 14) Bell takes a dodgy two into the leg side and would have been in the trouble had the throw from the deep not been well wide of the stumps. &quot;One solution here to improve UDRS, I think, is to reduce the number of (incorrect) challenges to 1 per team per innings,&quot; says Robert Speed. &quot;That will lessen the likelihood that challenges are used tactically - they would be used by teams only when they&apos;re pretty damned sure the umpire got it wrong, which is what the system was designed for.&quot; Precisely. This is Daniel Vettori&apos;s argument also. In principle I prefer this, but the only problem with that is an incident like the one in the first Test: England reviewed a caught behind that was given not out (I forget who the batsman was, but I bet those of you slagging off Bell today were equally critical of the Aussie batsman for not walking), and because Hotspot showed nothing the not-out decision was upheld. But everyone basically knew it was out. As a consequence, England then didn&apos;t have a review to use when Mike Hussey was wrongly given not out the following day. Hussey didn&apos;t walk either. And I bet those of you slagging off Bell were equally harsh on him. Course you were.  125th over: England 421-6 (Bell 86, Prior 16) Steve Smith drops Ian Bell off his own bowling. It was the second ball of Smith&apos;s second spell, and Bell scorched a half-volley back whence it came. Smith is usually superb off his own bowling, but that was a piping-hot chance and he couldn&apos;t quite hang on. &quot;Why on earth,&quot; says Duncan Groves, &quot;would JFK keep his foot in his trousers?&quot;  126th over: England 425-6 (Bell 88, Prior 18) Johnson is back into the attack, which is peculiar in view of his apparent buttock strain. England&apos;s lead inches closer to 150. &quot;No one is pinning a culture on Bell, simply stating that what he did on this occasion was wrong, and you might get fewer effs and cees if you&apos;d show some more sympathy for the wronged bowler and less for the &apos;tactical&apos; batsman,&quot; says Patrick O&apos;Brien. &quot;Still important to keep in mind that this England team have generally carried themselves very, very well throughout the whole series.&quot; I completely disagree. Until we can say with absolute certainty what Bell&apos;s motivation was \u2013 he could easily have been checking for that no-ball, which would have been an entirely legitimate and indeed sensible tactic against this rabble of serial oversteppers \u2013 there are no logical grounds to slag him off.  127th over: England 433-6 (Bell 89, Prior 25) Prior comes down the track and drives Smith right back over his head for six. That&apos;s a cracking shot, and it brings up a rapid fifty partnership. &quot;Surely, like most batsmen who have played the game know, sometimes you will get such a fine edge that you don&apos;t feel it,&quot; says Dan Richards. &quot;The edge was so fine in this case that it hasn&apos;t clearly shown up on Hotspot. If Bell knows he&apos;s nicked it he doesn&apos;t refer, simple as that. Therefore I don&apos;t think he has cheated in any way.&quot; I honestly don&apos;t know about this, as in my very limited career I was usually playing all over straight ones.  128th over: England 433-6 (Bell 89, Prior 25) Johnson gets one to pop from a length, and Bell does well to get on top of the ball so that it only goes to gully on the bounce. A maiden. &quot;Obvious answer is to only allow Hotspot to be used to give someone out (ie if umpire misses the snick) \u2013 it can&apos;t be used to save a batsman,&quot; says Ciaran Murphy. I thought that was the case anyway. If not, it surely will be after this.  129th over: England 437-6 (Bell 90, Prior 28) England continue to milk Smith with no problems, and Bell moves into the nineties for the first time against Australia. &quot;I&apos;m with you Smyth,&quot; says Mike Norton, marching towards me with a smile before turning round to see the slipstream of everyone else on the planet. &quot;The fact Bell walked down the wicket to ask Prior&apos;s opinion before the review suggests to me he was querying the no ball. Why would Prior have more of an idea than him about the edge? Tell all these dirty toe rags to stop whining and face defeat like men.&quot;  130th over: England 441-6 (Bell 94, Prior 28) Bell drives the new bowler Siddle gloriously through extra cover for four. He was briefly rattled after that fortunate escape, but it is coming right off the middle again now. &quot;In what way did Tony Hill bugger up?&quot; says Peter Hoare. &quot;His role is to advise the on-field umpire on what the technology reveals. In this case he reported that neither Hotspot (or Vodafone Hotspot as the C9 commentators irritatingly call it), nor any of the replays available showed any evidence of an edge. According to C9, who can hear the conversation betwen the umpires apparently, Tony Hill reported this accurately, but did did not say that it was definitely not out, leaving it to Aleem Dar to decide whether to reverse the decision. Tony Greig said that Aleem Dar should have stuck with his original decision, but no umpire will do that unsupported by the evidence. The problem is that Snicko is not immediately available. Maybe the slowed-down sound could be played to the third umpire. This had not been done when Hill&apos;s advice was given. What else could he have said?&quot; No, fair point. Tony Hill didn&apos;t bugger up; I did. I assumed Hill had told him &apos;not out&apos; based on Hotspot. Whether Aleem Dar also buggered up is hard to say without hearing the entire conversation between the two. It sounds like it could be a failing of the system, rather than its implementation, in that this might be an eventuality that had not been considered. Either that or I just can&apos;t accept that Aleem Dar made a mistake.  131st over: England 447-6 (Bell 98, Prior 30) Bell premeditates a lap at Smith \u2013 he can do what he wants against him, basically \u2013 and gets it very fine for three. Here&apos;s Andrew Latimer. &quot;How sickened is everyone going to be when this gigantic discussion on Bell is put to bed when the Sky interviewer will ask a fairly throwaway question about the review and Bell will say &apos;yeah I was just quickly checking in case of a no ball&apos; as he then proceeds to celebrate with his winning team.&quot;  132nd over: England 455-6 (Bell 99, Prior 37) Bell cuts Siddle for a single to move to 99. Which, coincidentally, is the square root of his heart rate as he contemplates a first century against Australia. Prior then checks a drive and the ball spoons just over Siddle and away for four. &quot;To be fair I think we Australians have faced you English retaining the Ashes fairly well by and large,&quot; says Josh Gerrard. &quot;Unfortunately we face blatant hypocrisy less well. I think there&apos;s a reasonable chance Bell just didn&apos;t feel it, but if he did it really is indefensible for about many reasons I&apos;ve mentioned in the 1,946 emails I&apos;ve sent you in the last 15 minutes. Sorry.&quot; How can it be blatant hypocrisy when a) the incidents are of a different nature, and b) nobody knows what Ian Bell&apos;s motivation was? What is this, the film Being Ian Bell? Where you pay $200 to sit in his head for 15 minutes? It&apos;s all guesswork at this stage, whereas Hughes&apos;s acting was so wooden that he&apos;d wouldn&apos;t even have got a role in Plan 9 From Outer Space.  133rd over: England 460-6 (Bell 102, Prior 39) Ian Bell has just removed King Kong from his back. After 11 half-centuries and over five years of being told he couldn&apos;t do it, he has made a Test hundred against Australia. He cuts Smith for two and then jumps to punch the air. &quot;He&apos;s graduated from the Shermanator to the Terminator,&quot; says Shane Warne. &quot;Ian Terminator Bell!&quot; He should have been given out on 67, but otherwise he has played another wonderful innings. &quot;I take no issue with Bell&apos;s review,&quot; says Adam Levine. &quot;My concern would be that they overturned an on-field decision without irrefutable evidence that it was wrong. Therefore we are now taking the element of umpire&apos;s judgement completely out of the game, which begs the question how long until umpires are entirely replaced by robots that make calls based entirely on the technology available and stand on one leg at Nelson&apos;s?&quot;  134th over: England 467-6 (Bell 109, Prior 39) Bell plays another gorgeous cover drive for four, this time off Siddle. The lead is 191. We can very nearly utter the words &apos;England have won the Ashes&apos;. But not yet. Don&apos;t you DARE MOVE THOSE LIPS. &quot;Surely if Bell is asking to check the no ball, then he knows that he hit it,&quot; says Patrick O&apos;Brien. &quot;Having confirmed that it was a legal delivery he then should accept the initial decision of out, otherwise he&apos;s as trustworthy as JFK&apos;s front foot.&quot; The mere thought of that moral maze is hurting my head. Because then we&apos;re back into walking territory, and those who criticise Bell purely for not walking don&apos;t even deserve a response. If you criticise him for reviewing a decision knowing he had hit it, and with no consideration about a no-ball \u2013 in other words, chancing his arm on Hotspot \u2013 then I wouldn&apos;t necessarily disagree with that, although I&apos;d want to think about it some more. But to criticise just for not walking is not on.  135th over: England 469-6 (Bell 109, Prior 41) Michael Beer (25-1-80-1) replaces Steve Smith (10-0-48-0). Two from the over. &quot;Talk of Being Ian Bell has reminded me of that freakish sequence in BJM where Malkovich goes through the portal himself,&quot; shudders Yemon Choi.  136th over: England 478-6 (Bell 114, Prior 45) A wonderful stroke from Bell, who waits for Siddle&apos;s bouncer and then guides it high over the cordon for four. Later in the over, Prior plays a not dissimilar stroke wide of the only slip for another boundary. These are free runs. &quot;BOYS!&quot; says Marcia Adair. &quot;If you don&apos;t stop fighting about that review, I&apos;m going to have to send you all to your respective rooms for the rest of the session. Go for a run around the block or something. Honestly.&quot; The lady has a point. Truce?  137th over: England 478-6 (Bell 114, Prior 45) &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;re into walking territory, which is indeed a moral maze, because I didn&apos;t say Bell should have walked, I said he shouldn&apos;t challenge the decision based on hope,&quot; says Patrick O&apos;Brien. But if you challenge an LBW decision you are doing so on hope as well. I just don&apos;t think we know enough about Bell&apos;s motivation to criticise him - and I&apos;m not entirely sure we should criticise him even if he was chancing his arm on the imperfection of Hotspot.  138th over: England 484-6 (Bell 114, Prior 51) &quot;Mitchell Johnson&apos;s spells have been 3, 6, 3, 4, 1, 3 and 2 overs,&quot; says Peter Hanes. &quot;It&apos;s like yanking the cord on a rusty lawnmower in the hope that it will sputter into life.&quot; Michael Clarke has had another yank, because here comes Johnson again. Prior drives his second ball through the covers for four to bring up the hundred partnership and the 200 lead. Later in the over he squeezes two behind square on the off side to reach a trademark Prior fifty, selfless and aggressive, from only 54 balls.  139th over: England 485-6 (Bell 115, Prior 52) &quot;I assume by &apos;rabble of serial oversteppers&apos; you are referring to the four no-balls in 128 overs,&quot; says Anthony Meulman. &quot;Bellyboy surely was rolling the dice there.&quot;  hyperbole(h\u012b-p\u00fbr&apos;b\u0259-l\u0113) pronunciationn.A figure of speech in which exaggeration is used for emphasis or effect, as in I could sleep for a year or This book weighs a ton.   WICKET! England 487-7 (Bell c Clarke b Johnson 115) Ian Bell has gone, edging Johnson low to Clarke in a wide slip position. Bell should have reviewed it, just for a laugh. He should have reviewed it with the most extravagant review signal there has ever been. Then he should have called for a new pair of gloves, and some new pads, and even a new box. Instead he walks off to a mixture of cheers and boos (about 70/30 I reckon). It was good bowling from Johnson, who switched to around the wicket and found the edge with the change of angle and just a little late movement.  140th over: England 487-7 (Prior 53, Bresnan 0) &quot;Sorry Rob, but you get the prize for the worse OBO commentator,&quot; says Martin French. &quot;We are witnessing a glorious England innings in Australia and you are ruining it with this never-ending Bell/Patrick O&apos;Bryan thing.&quot; Love you too, big guy. But you&apos;re right. It&apos;s like when they report bad news on the telly in the summer; it totally ruins the sunshine.  BAD LIGHT STOPS PLAY. England 488-7 (Prior 53, Bresnan 0) In fact, that&apos;s the end of the day&apos;s play because we are past the 5.30pm cut-off point. So England lead by 208 after a long, exhausting day. The 1989 England side would do well from here. The 2010-11 England side are this close to a series victory in Australia.

The 16-year-old, who scored seven perfect 10s \u2013 for the second time in his career \u2013 to take individual gold at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi last year, says he would not even contemplate stepping on to the diving board at the aquatics centre in the Olympic Park unless he was confident he could score a 10. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t like to compete a dive unless I know I can get a 10 on it,&quot; said Daley, reflecting on his approach to winning a medal in 2012. &quot;That&apos;s what my theory is. Sometimes in a competition you know that you have to score a 10 to win, but if you&apos;ve never scored it or done it in training then you would stand on the end of the board thinking that you can&apos;t do it. You have to go into it believing that you can score a 10 on every dive that you do.&quot; Daley, who for many years was unable to practise some of the more difficult dives because of his age, instead developed a reputation for a high level of execution. He will hope to rely on this strength while expanding his dive list in 2011 to include two new dives in preparation for 2012. These new moves he plans to road test at the national championships before working them into his routine to defend his world title in Shanghai in July. The world championships will form part of the qualification process for the Olympics. &quot;It&apos;s a massive year,&quot; Daley said. &quot;This\u00a0is where I&apos;m going to get my experience from. I have to use my new dives as much as possible because next year I&apos;ll only have a few competitions before the\u00a0Olympics.&quot; If he does manage to perfect the two new dives, Daley will be able to rival the best in the world not just in terms of execution, but also difficulty. &quot;As far as I know it will be the equal hardest that anyone will be doing, though this year you could well see some Chinese diver coming out and doing the most insane list. The way diving has come on \u2013 in the last five years even \u2013 is insane. The winning score at the Beijing Olympics was 538, at the world championships in Rome [2009] it was 539 but then to go into the World Cup it went up to 567. Everyone is really whacking out massive degrees of difficulty.&quot; Daley was presented with a BMW car yesterday, one of the perks of being chosen to be a part of the 25-athlete strong BMW London 2012 Performance Programme, despite not yet being old enough to drive. The Plymouth-based world champion will be given special under\u201117 driving lessons by a world champion rally driver to gear him up for passing his test. &quot;I can&apos;t wait to be driving because it gives you so much more freedom. I can get to training myself and give my dad a rest.&quot; Daley&apos;s father, Rob, who ferries his son to and from each training session, missed the double gold medal-winning performance at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October as he was undergoing chemotherapy for a brain tumour. &quot;He&apos;s finished his fourth round of chemo and has got two more to go,&quot; Daley said. &quot;He always carries a bowl around with him, just in case, but he&apos;s fine. He was only ill on the first two cycles of chemo but he&apos;s doing really well and the tumour is shrinking. &quot;The good thing is that I haven&apos;t seen him when he is really ill because I was in Singapore when he had his first treatment and then the second time he had treatment I was at the Commonwealth Games. Those were the ones where he was ill but I didn&apos;t see him then. By the time I got home, I think his body must have got used to the tablets he had to take.&quot; Asked whether the London Olympics are constantly on his mind, he smiled. &quot;It&apos;s hard to put it to the back of your mind,&quot; he said, &quot;but I&apos;m just going to be taking it one step at a time. The next thing I&apos;ve got to think about is my maths exam in six days&apos; time, my first module at A level. &quot;I know there is going to be a lot of expectation. But people who know sport know that it doesn&apos;t just happen and it&apos;s not a totally foregone conclusion that I&apos;m going to win gold in 2012. No way is that the case. Any of the top eight divers in the world could win the gold medal if they dive well on the day. It&apos;s just about who has got the\u00a0mentality.&quot;", "tags": ["Tom Daley", "Diving", "UK news", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-05T00:06:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/06/1", "sentences": ["P10France Telecom turns to Shanghai for low cost internet TV technology."], "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "article": "Top stories on MediaGuardian.co.uk     Sienna Miller is suing News Group, accusing them of breaching her privacy and of harassing her.

Her lawyers have been unable to meet her since she was sent to the re-education centre in central Henan province. In a letter to Twitter&apos;s chief executive officer, Dick Costolo, published on the website of the group Human Rights in China, Cheng&apos;s lawyers said they were &quot;encouraged and gratified from the bottom of their hearts&quot; when they saw that he had tweeted about the detention. Costolo wrote: &quot;Dear Chinese government, year-long detentions for sending a sarcastic tweet are neither the way forward nor the future of your great people.&quot; Teng Biao and Lan Zhixue said in their letter that the case set a precedent because Cheng, 46, was the first mainland Chinese Twitter user to be criminally punished for sending a normal tweet. They wrote that the decision amounted to infringement of Twitter&apos;s lawful business activities and urged Twitter to take legal action to protect its interests \u2013 although it is not clear how it could do so. They also called on Twitter to use its &quot;international influence&quot; to press for the unconditional release of Cheng, pointing out that world leaders such as Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama have accounts. Teng told the Guardian that although Twitter was blocked in China it was &quot;very important \u2026 and getting more and more important&quot;. &quot;The number of users is not huge compared with the Chinese population, just a bit more than 100,000, but this group includes people who are crucial to bring changes, such as journalists, lawyers and intellectuals. &quot;Wang Yi&apos;s case has certainly had an effect \u2026 People may not be using their real names on Twitter but it is very easy for the government to find who they really are. This will make people more cautious about what they say.&quot; Domestic microblog services have proved hugely popular in China, with an estimated 125 million users by the end of last October. But they are heavily censored. Cheng&apos;s fiance, Hua Chunhui, told Associated Press after her arrest: &quot;My personal opinion is that this sentencing wasn&apos;t about this one statement.

O&apos;Sullivan made all the right sporting noises: &quot;All credit to Mark ... he played a fantastic match\u201a&quot; and so on but Allen was closer to the truth: &quot;Ronnie&apos;s a genius but every now and then he isn&apos;t quite there,&quot; he said.

It is just as well that the Masters, as an invitation tournament, does not carry ranking points. He began unpropitiously.

NASSAU 1412 Classified By: CHARGE ROBERT M. WITAJEWSKI FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). SUMMARY 1. (SBU) Bahamian Prime Minister Perry Christie will lead an official government delegation to China on August 14-21, continuing a two-year upswing in diplomatic exchanges between The Bahamas and China. In addition to numerous cultural programs, the two nations have exchanged high-level delegations to explore business opportunities and strengthen diplomatic ties. The majority of the Bahamian cabinet visits have been hosted by the Chinese government -- nominally to discuss Chinese support of The Bahamas&apos; membership in the World Trade Organization. Despite being separated by two oceans and a continental landmass, China is one of only four countries that maintains a resident ambassador in The Bahamas. The Bahamas&apos; largest port facility in Freeport is owned and operated by Hong Kong-based Hutchison-Whampoa. The Bahamian press gives generally positive and extensive coverage to China and interprets the growing China-Bahamas relationship as a sign of The Bahamas&apos; increasing importance in the world and friendship with a potential superpower. END SUMMARY. BAHAMIAN DIGNITARIES &quot;FREQUENT FLYERS&quot; TO CHINA... 2. (C) Prime Minister Perry Christie is scheduled to visit Beijing and Shanghai from August 14 - 21, 2004. This will be the Prime Minister&apos;s first official trip to China. Accompanying Christie will be his wife and daughter, Minister of Foreign Affairs Fred Mitchell, Minister of State for Finance James Smith, the Prime Minister&apos;s Permanent Secretary Ronald Thompson, and two reporters. An advance team consisting of Chief of Protocol Andrew McKinney and Under Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Philip Miller SIPDIS has already departed for China. The Bahamian Foreign Ministry has been unwilling to provide details about the delegation&apos;s itinerary, schedule or meetings, or the purpose of the trip. 3. (U) The Prime Minister&apos;s trip to China is the latest is a stream of high-level Bahamian visitors to China since the PLP&apos;s electoral victory in May 2002. In the past year, a number of Bahamian government officials have visited China including Cabinet-level ministers and members of parliament. On August 30, 2003, Foreign Minister Fred Mitchell and Minister of Transport and Aviation Glenys Hanna-Martin both traveled to China. They met with the Chinese Minister of Commerce to discuss World Trade Organization (WTO) issues as the Bahamas prepares for WTO membership. Ministers Mitchell and Hanna-Martin also met with China&apos;s Minister of Culture. While there, the Chinese arranged for Minister Hanna-Martin to commission a Chinese-built ship that will be registered with the Bahamas&apos; ship registry. Just two months later in October, Minister of Trade and Industry Leslie Miller visited Beijing, again ostensibly to promote The Bahamas&apos; accession to the WTO. XXXXXXXXXXXX CHINESE PRESENCE IN THE BAHAMAS 7. (C) China is one of four countries to maintain resident ambassadors in The Bahamas. Ambassador Dongcun Jiao presented his credentials to Governor General Dame Ivy Dumont on August 21, 2003. During the swearing in, Governor General Dame Ivy Dumont thanked the Ambassador for his country&apos;s assistance in the areas of education, agriculture, fisheries and the arts. Ambassador Jiao noted that the Bahamas and China have coordinated with and supported each other in international affairs. He further stated that the Chinese government is ready to make concerted efforts with the Bahamian government to build a China-Bahamas relationship of all-round cooperation in the interest of mutual development. Currently, the exceptionally large Chinese embassy in The Bahamas, given the paucity of bilateral business to conduct, consists of an Ambassador and six accredited diplomats. For its part, The Bahamas maintains a Consul General in Hong Kong but has announced that, following PRC suggestions, it will be establishing an embassy in Beijing and closing its consulate in Hong Kong. 8. (C) The largest Chinese investment in The Bahamas is the $1 billion Freeport container port owned and operated by Hong Kong-based Hutchison-Whampoa. Chinese dignitaries traveling to the Bahamas always visit Freeport and the port. Hutchison-Whampoa employs only five Chinese citizens in its Freeport facility, all in a management capacity. 9. (U) Madam Wu Yi, State Councilor to the People&apos;s Republic of China accompanied by a delegation of 30 people, including six Chinese business leaders, visited The Bahamas in January 2003. During her visit to Nassau, Madam Wu presented the Bahamian government with a grant of $250,000 for various technical, agricultural, handicraft and cooperative projects. Additionally, a delegation of Chinese government officials visited Nassau on June 19, 2004, to finalize plans for the Chinese to grant the Bahamian government $20 million for construction of a national stadium. COMMENT 10. (C) The Bahamas&apos; political and economic ties to China remain modest. Bilateral trade flows have increased, reaching approximately $95 million for the first eight months of 2003, and investment projects such as the Freeport port facility are always welcome. Some local commentators would like to believe that The Bahamas should attempt to use China as a counter-balance to the U.S. It is more likely, however, that Bahamian officials are merely using their moment in the Chinese spotlight to push for kinder WTO accession terms (at least as a starting point for negotiations with the other members) and to pick up whatever spare trade and investment projects a country of over one billion people can offer. For their part, the Chinese in The Bahamas may be a strategic move preparing for a post-Castro Caribbean.

Classified By: CHARGE ROBERT WITAJEWSKI FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). SUMMARY 1. (C) On August 20, the Charge, and Economic Officer met with Mrs. Patricia Rogers, the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Leonard Archer, the Bahamian Ambassador to CARICOM, and Mr. Marco Rolle, Under Secretary in the International Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the upcoming visit of Bahamian officials to China. Although the Bahamians were extremely reluctant to provide information regarding the visit to China, Dr. Rogers promised the Charge, that she would give him a briefing upon their return on September 9th. Despite deliberate attempts at ambiguity in describing the agenda for the Foreign Minister,s trip, it appears that The Bahamas will accede to a Chinese request to close their consulate in Hong Kong and open an embassy in Beijing. We urged that the GCOB also raise the issue of Chinese alien smuggling operations through The Bahamas to the United States. Rogers claimed the China visit was simply to express gratitude for Chinese technical assistance to The Bahamas. End Summary. OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHINA BY GCOB OFFICIALS 2. (C) At a meeting with Mrs. Patricia Rogers, the Charge, inquired about the upcoming Bahamian high-level visit to China from August 22nd - September 9th. Mrs. Rogers said that Minister of Foreign Affairs, Fred Mitchell, and herself amongst others planned to travel to Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, plus Japan on their whirlwind tour to Asia. Bahamian Ambassador to Japan, Sir Sidney Poitier, is to accompany the Bahamian contingent on the Japanese segment of the trip since it is coinciding with his annual trip to Japan. Rogers laughingly noted that he was to be the &quot;star attraction&quot;, and the rest of them, including the Foreign Minister, were merely along for the ride. 3. (C) Framing it as simply a &quot;follow-up to an invitation&quot;, Mrs. Rogers attempted to minimize the significance of the official trip. But after further probing, she admitted that one of the purposes of the trip was to reassure China of The Bahamas commitment to their bilateral relationship. Rogers indicated that the Government felt that it needed to continue to solidify Chinese confidence due to &quot;lingering distaste&quot; left from the fact that The Bahamas maintained diplomatic relations with Taiwan, including permitting a Taiwanese Embassy in Nassau, until 1999. 4. (C) Mrs. Rogers and Ambassador Leonard Archer both made a point of expressing gratitude towards the Chinese for their technical assistance in The Bahamas. When questioned further about the precise details of this assistance, the two responded by citing Chinese support for Bahamian handicraft, agriculture and their offer to assist in the remodeling/rebuilding of the National Center for Performing Arts located in Nassau, not Mrs. Rogers insisted a new convention center for The Bahamas. (A Chinese offer to build a massive convention center in the Cable Beach area of New Providence Island has been widely rumored to be on the table.) Mrs. Rogers also mentioned that Bahamian officials were to participate in a christening and launch of one of the Clipper Group ships. The company, she obliquely noted, had decided to register many of its ships on the Bahamian ship registry, and this would be a reciprocal gesture of appreciation. &quot;NO&quot; AGENDA WHILE IN CHINA 5. (C) When asked by the Charge, as to what the Bahamian officials had arranged with their Chinese counterparts for the visit, Mrs. Rogers paused and said that the visit was to be very informal and denied that any agenda of discussion topics had been agreed to. Responding to the Charge,s skepticism that a major visit beginning in only two days remained so unfocused, Mrs. Rogers reluctantly admitted that it was &quot;feasible&quot; that some trade and cultural agreements might be signed, but insisted that the Bahamian delegation only planned to speak about general bilateral issues. SMUGGLING CHINESE TO THE US VIA THE BAHAMAS 6. (C) The Charge, specifically questioned the Bahamian government officials about whether the issue of smuggling Chinese aliens into the United States through The Bahamas would be raised when Mrs. Rogers and Minister of Foreign Affairs Fred Mitchell visit China. Mrs. Rogers, again reluctantly, responded by saying, &quot;it,s a tricky one, but one that will have to be brought up&quot;. The Bahamians would not provide further details. CLOSING HONG KONG; OPENING IN BEIJING 7. (C) During the conversation, Mrs. Rogers did reveal that The Bahamas would discuss with Chinese officials the possibility of &quot;deactivating&quot; their consulate in Hong Kong with the intention of establishing an Embassy in Beijing. She did not indicate if Foreign Minister Mitchell and his Chinese counterpart would make an announcement to this effect while on the upcoming trip. 8. (U) Currently, the Bahamian Consulate in Hong Kong does not process visas for CARICOM members, only for Bahamian citizens. Only the embassies of Guyana and Suriname in China have that ability presently. NEW CHINESE AMBASSADOR TO BAHAMAS 9. (C) Dr. Rogers mentioned that the new Chinese Ambassador to The Bahamas, Dongcon Jiao, will be formally presenting his credentials on August 21st. She made a point of noting that &quot;he speaks perfect English.&quot; (Note: The former Chinese Ambassador, Changsheng Wu, had limited English skills and was always accompanied in public by an interpreter. Changsheng was, however, proficient in Spanish.) The Charge, noted that the Embassy had not been contacted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about receiving the new Chinese Ambassador for an introductory courtesy call, observing that Andrew McKinney, Chief of Protocol for the Bahamas, did consider Charges of appropriate rank. Mrs. Rogers appeared genuinely embarrassed, and expressed the intent to rectify the situation. COMMENT 10. (C) Mrs. Rogers, and other Bahamian officials, are reluctant to discuss the details of their relationship with the Chinese. While it appears that the dynamics of the relationship are being driven by the Chinese, for their part the Bahamians have at least two reasons for acquiescing. First, there is the $1 billion investment by Hutchison Whampoa in the Freeport Container Port. Second, a Chinese presence does -even if symbolically- serve as a counterbalance to the U.S. The interest of the Chinese is more complex however, and we defer to Embassy Beijing for its analysis of Chinese strategic goals underlying its major presence in a country where apart from geography, there would seem to be few mutual cultural, tourist, economic, or political interests.

The very name, the aroma of spices, the history of Arab sultans and their harems have all fed into a successful modern tourist industry. But I first visited in 1984, when it was very different, a very nervous place. There was one government hotel (with no toilet paper) and no places to eat, just street food. I was there to survey the archaeology. With colonial guidebooks from the 1930s, a rundown Land Rover (which had been a mobile cinema until the equipment broke down) and an 1899 map, I hunted out ruined cities, ancient mosques and Arabian palaces. The charm overwhelmed me. Turquoise seas and white beaches, without a soul; cloves everywhere, laid out to dry. The bush was full of exotic flowers, and the trees were laden with mangoes and lemons. As we heaved our canvas tents from site to site, I felt like some 19th-century explorer, blundering into a Garden of Eden. Now, Zanzibar is a very different place: westernised, entrepreneurial and rather commercial. But I still go back to dig holes into those sites we rediscovered and seek out those places that haven&apos;t really changed that much. It&apos;s still Africa, and it still inspires.Mark Horton is professor in archaeology at Bristol University and a presenter on BBC2&apos;s Coast \u2022 Kuoni (01306 747002, kuoni.co.uk) has seven nights&apos; all-inclusive at the Sandies Mapenzi Beach Club from \u00a31,214pp Greenland, Sarah Gavron      Sarah Gavron in Greenland with daughter Lily.    It felt like we were journeying to the remotest place on earth, as a tiny collection of houses came into view on the Greenland ice: Niaqornat, home to 59 Inuits and 100 dogs. My Danish husband had persuaded me that living here would inspire a documentary. We stepped out of the helicopter with our six-year-old daughter and 11-month-old son: no accommodation, cafes, bars, shops or doctors. Our clapboard house had a mattress, a Calor Gas heater and a freezer full of reindeer legs. We stocked up on tins and seal meat. No fresh food: in this barren landscape nothing grows. The world&apos;s largest island has fewer than 60,000 inhabitants. Howling dogs and 24-hour daylight keep sleep in short supply. At night, we&apos;d stand on the beach watching hunters bring in their catch, while whales spouted 100m off the black strand. I was mesmerised by the icebergs, some as big as tower blocks, that danced in the bay, changing colour as the sun bounced off the horizon. Over the past 18 months, we&apos;ve been charting the villagers&apos; lives. Niaqornat is changing. In spring, the receding glacier scars the ground. Hunting quotas harm livelihoods. If the population falls below 50, the government talks of relocating them to a city. And Lars, the lone teenager, who&apos;s never been more than a few miles from home, is constantly on Facebook chatting to 200 friends across the globe.

The car pulled through the Belgrade traffic past dirty concrete apartment blocks, prostitutes in tight red tops working the roundabouts. So far, so post-communist. Then we crossed the river and sped up a cobbled hill, past baroque courtyards, Orthodox churches, crowds of students. Here was a city whose old heart was still splendid. This is a country that has drastically changed its identity three times in the space of a single human lifetime. It fought the Nazis, yet ended up as the bogeyman of Europe. It went from communism, and a national motto of &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot;, to tearing itself apart in the civil war of the 1990s. Then it accelerated into an extreme form of capitalism. Belgrade&apos;s uber-rich dress in Versace \u2013 yet average salaries are tiny and there is no social security. I was sitting in a cafe when it dawned on me. The character for whom I had been unable to find a home belonged here. Finally she, and my third novel, acquired a name \u2013 Dragana Savic \u2013 and her story is also the story of Belgrade. I went back last year. By then I had friends in the city. We ate from grill stands and smoked in secret bars. We watched a Gogol play in a car museum, and danced in nightclubs under the bridges. We talked books in a biker bar.

Photograph: Alamy    Ribblehead viaduct is beautiful and majestic. It was built to shorten the journey time from London to Glasgow on the Midland Railway. As a child, I was taken to witness its greatness by my father. My dad was a landscape painter and made several studies of it, which I cherish. For me, this kind of structure will always have more authority in the landscape than works of public art. This summer I took my wife and kids and camped just above Hawes on the Pennine Way. We visited the viaduct and walked up to the entrance to Blea Moor tunnel and thought about the men who died building this structure.

The route took two days and was an integral part of the experience: a series of trains, ferries and a touring bicycle carrying panniers stuffed with notebooks, clothes and tins of beans. Two trains, two ferries and 75 miles of challenging cycling later, an unmarked track led to Cabhalan Cottage. It overlooks a coastal inlet and has no neighbouring houses or nearby road. Being cocooned within the cottage&apos;s four-foot-thick walls provided the ultimate haven for reflection without distraction. The solitude became dangerously addictive. Harris is the personification of Mother Nature: the golden eagle that regularly took flight just feet from the front door, the deafening silence at the foot of M\u00e0s Garbh, and the infinitude of the golden beach at Losgaintir. A sense of privilege, heartfelt respect and almost penitence for being human manifested themselves throughout the two weeks I spent there.

Not so with Trinidad. I first went just after I was born, and have visited almost every year since. For a time I lived in south Trinidad; years scattered here and there at various points of crises. It was a place to heal, to recover. Trinidad has pulled stories right out of my heart. My first novel came from tales I heard as a child. What is it about this island? There are the rising hills at the back of my mother&apos;s house, the Northern Range, and the gold afternoon light burning through the leaves; the coarse grass underfoot, gigantic red ants, the shaggy heads of mango trees. There is the familiar song of Kiskadee birds; green parrots squabbling in the yard. And of course, the terrific heat that makes you want to fall to the ground. It is far from paradise. Just last night there was black smoke on the highway, and when we got close there were orange flames leaping high. I&apos;m going to write about this, I thought. But I had seen fires before \u2013 why was this so different? And then it came to me: there were no fire engines speeding through the traffic. This fire was burning freely, left to rage against the dark blue sky. And yet, later, somewhere in Port of Spain, we caught the tinkly rolling song of pan-playing in a dark back street and I was awed. The truth is this: Trinidad is a place where writers, musicians and artists are bursting through this beauty and darkness.

In the autumn, the maple trees flame red and orange, and the oak leaves bronze. Northampton, Massachusetts, home of Smith College, is a small city that grew up along the banks of the Connecticut. Nonotuck, its Indian name, means &quot;the midst of the river&quot;. In 1871, Miss Sophia Smith endowed a college for women, and it has flourished ever since. Its campus, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the architect of New York&apos;s Central Park, is a tree-shaded refuge. Smith educated the wives and daughters of presidents (Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Julie Nixon Eisenhower) and sent young women out confidently into the world to become politicians and teachers. It was at Smith that I began the journey that led me to the Bodleian Library \u2013 I am the first woman to lead the organisation since it opened 400 years ago. A chance job pasting bookplates in the library of Margaret Sanger, the early 20th-century advocate of birth control, became the first in a series of positions in great libraries.

A hot-air balloon lets you see the breathtaking moonscape from above. The first time I did this, I resisted. Grumpy and cranky, I woke early and let my friends drag me into this valley. Hot-air balloons of all colours were being filled with air. There was a strange silence, as if everyone felt the need to stop talking and start looking within. Then we began to ascend. As the sun rose, streaks of fiery red turned azure. The caves below resembled polished prehistoric eggs. The air was crisp and we could smell wild herbs wafting in the wind from the mountains. In a balloon you cannot change lanes, swerving left and right as you wish; you move up and down with the current, much like in life. I have been back, but the first time remains unforgettable. The place and its balloons helped me to rethink the notion of &quot;peaceful surrender&quot;, which played a central role in my latest novel, The Forty Rules of Love.

The very name clinched it: I loved the desolate melancholy it evoked. The place married beauty with bleakness, or something darker. Small wonder that not far from here Wordsworth conceived his concept of the sublime, a coming together of the exquisite and the terrifying.

Our walk in the High Atlas lasted only four days but with each passing day, those hills engulfed us further into the kind of natural embrace that makes you forget where you&apos;re from.The bus from Marrakech dropped us off in Asni, an unremarkable village at the foot of Mount Toubkal, teeming with crooks masquerading as mountain guides. One of them, Brahim, took our money and went to buy supplies. He invited us to wait in his house with his wife and five daughters and after several hours, returned fall-down drunk, carrying two plastic bags containing the following provisions: a tin of sardines, a box of laughing cow cheese, five tomatoes, some almonds and a pot of honey.He told us he was feeling unwell and that his cousin, Mohammed, would be our guide instead. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Mohammed was fitter, sunnier and more popular than Brahim, a quality that would prove invaluable on our trek. For with no money and our pathetic supplies, he had to cadge our bed and board from friends and relatives along our route.

Book by 25 January  Nigeria, Lola Shoneyin Last year, during a brief visit to Calabar, Nigeria, my host took me on a boat ride downriver. We set off mid-morning and sliced through the murky waters of the Cross River. On both sides, the river bank was crowded with palm trees that leaned in on the water as if their fronds were simultaneously fascinated and fearful of the deep, as I was.After about 40 minutes, we moored at the jetty of a quaint little town called Oron, which used to serve as a ferry terminal in the colonial days when roads shared their burden with the great rivers. It was like walking into the past.Wooden louvres favoured by colonial architects hung still from the windows. Clear inscriptions, from over 50 years ago, had resisted the warm winds that skim the tide and whirl around the old post office, the stopover inns and hotels (many of which are now brothels), the shacks and small bungalows on both sides of the narrow roads, and the pale yellow museum. In front of the museum, standing on a pedestal was the stone statue of a venerable colonial curator, complete with khaki trousers, thick-rimmed glasses and a safari hat.At a certain point during my meander through the town, I could now feel what was missing from a story I&apos;d given up on when I couldn&apos;t make the connection between the Nigeria I was familiar with and the Nigeria that primitively hounded children and labelled them child witches. I was suddenly struck by the primitiveness of my surroundings, as if this town had stubbornly decided to stay mired in the past. Although this wasn&apos;t entirely the case in Oron, I suddenly understood how it was possible for the collective spirit of a people to remain anchored to a darker age, despite substantial exposure to the inevitable tide of newness.Before leaving, we stopped by a shack on the river bed and tucked into bowls of fresh fish pepper soup. Watching the fishermen pulling their dug-outs ashore, my story came alive again.Lola Shoneyin is an author and poet.

The whole city buzzes at that time of year, the population doubles, and the air is filled with a tingling excitement. This can drive you nuts, so it&apos;s good to be able to get away from it. Fortunately the city provides for this by having a huge mountain, called Arthur&apos;s Seat, installed in the middle. It must have taken ages to build, for from its summit you can see the entire city and the Firth of the Forth beyond, on those rare days when it&apos;s not raining. I lost my virginity up there, and every year go back to look for it.

Murray, without Maclagan, beat Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer to win the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Federer to take the Shanghai Masters and lost narrowly to Nadal in the semi-final of the World Tour finals at the O2, widely regarded as the match of the\u00a0year. They were three of his defining performances, certainly in 2010, partly offsetting desperate form early in the season, a collapse on clay and ultimate disappointment at Wimbledon. There will always be blips and minor disasters with Murray. Whatever happens from now on, though, he will do it his way. In an otherwise routine reflection on the state of his career, as he prepares for the second round of the Australian Open, Murray confirmed he is not only happy with the long-distance mentoring of Alex Corretja \u2013 while leaning on the support of his mother, Judy, and his long-time friend Dani Vallverdu on tour \u2013 but that, for the time being at least, he might have found his ideal method. &quot;It can happen in sport that the people around you are also kind of in it for themselves,&quot; he said after seeing off his first-round opponent, Karol Beck, without much fuss, leading 6-3, 6-1, 4-2 when his opponent quit with a shoulder injury. &quot;Whereas right now the people who are with me are right behind me. They will do whatever it takes to get me ready in training and preparation, down to the small details. I enjoy it. Everyone is working in the right direction.&quot; It would be interesting to know which, if any, of his previous coaches \u2013 Leon Smith, Mark Petchey, Brad Gilbert or Maclagan \u2013 might be considered as &quot;in it for themselves&quot;, if that is, indeed, what he meant. ( \u2013 it is sometimes hard to tell. For now, Team Murray is a tight, smiling little unit. Vallverdu will work first-hand with him as he devises a strategy for tomorrow and the Ukrainian Illya Marchenko, one of the then obscure upstarts who routed Great Britain in the Davis Cup in March 2009 \u2013 a tie Murray was widely derided for missing. Marchenko, 23 and yet to win a senior title, looked good in disposing of Spain&apos;s Rub\u00e9n Ram\u00edrez Hidalgo 6-3, 6-4, 6-1. &quot;We&apos;re similar players,&quot; Marchenko said of Murray. &quot;He likes to defend. He&apos;s very solid on the baseline. He returns well, he serves well. Of course I know more about him than he knows about me but I don&apos;t think he really cares. A year and a half ago I qualified for the ATP tournament in Moscow and made the semi-finals. That changed my career a lot. I went into the top 100 at the beginning of last year. I had a lot of points to defend. Now I feel pretty comfortable and confident playing ATP events. If I can [play my own game] I think he will be in trouble, that&apos;s for sure.&quot; Judy Murray will, as ever, be a quiet, background presence when they dissect Marchenko&apos;s game, one based on a strong backhand and unflinching confidence. &quot;I talk at length with Dani about all the matches I play, for quite a while,&quot; Murray said. &quot;I find it a lot easier to communicate with him because I have known him such a long time and he knows me well. I find that good. &quot;There is a little bit more responsibility on my shoulders, because Dani has never really coached before. I do have to come up with some tactics myself but that&apos;s been the one thing that since I was young I was always quite good at. [I] always enjoyed working out how to play opponents. I trust him, I trust his judgment. If you talk to him, he knows a lot about tennis.&quot; Murray shares with Federer, more so than Nadal, the trait of wanting the final say in putting his game together. The Swiss has brought the professional touring coach Paul Annacone on board with great success in recent months, winning four out of five tournaments with the American, but he uses his staff as sounding boards more than instructors. Nadal, who has grown up on the circuit in the fold of his family, is considered more pliable to coaching \u2013 not that he has not had spectacular results with such an open-minded approach. What is clear is that, if Murray gets the ultimate prize here \u2013 one he must quietly reckon is as close to his grasp as it was 12 months ago \u2013 he will be in no rush to employ another full-time coach. That would be a most singular triumph, in every way.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australian Open 2011", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-18T22:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/19/roger-federer-australian-open-gilles-simon", "sentences": ["The only times he has lost after being two sets up were against Lleyton Hewitt in the Davis Cup in 2003, and against David Nalbandian in Shanghai in 2005."], "title": "Australian Open 2011: Roger Federer gets past Gilles Simon in five sets", "article": "As elegantly as he moves, as smoothly flow his delicate strokes and his five-language rhetoric, Roger Federer is no less vulnerable than his peers to the pressures of his sport. The difference is, as he demonstrated when surviving an intense examination of his composure by Gilles Simon in the second round of the Australian Open, he can still draw on powers that seem outrageous to everyone but himself. Foes and doubters will probably see further evidence of his gradual decline in this heart-stopper stretched over three hours and 19min, which ultimately went Federer&apos;s way 6-2, 6-2, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, and he too may feel under more pressure now than he did at the start of the tournament. Indeed those left on his side of the draw, including Novak Djokovic and his opponent in the third round on Friday, the Belgian Xavier Malisse, may be less uncomfortable when they look across the net at him from now on. Yet Federer remains a ruthless punisher of even minor mistakes. The Rod Laver Arena, filled with the Federer faithful, swayed to his every fightback in the fifth set, and he got the job done yet again as Simon wilted, even though it took every sinew of the Swiss&apos;s will and talent. &quot;Yes, I was tired,&quot; Simon said. &quot;I had to run everywhere for three hours. There are not too many players who can play longer than me, but Roger is one of them.&quot; Of the many astounding statistics that illuminate Federer&apos;s career, one still to be consigned to the past tense, is that of his nerveless ability to close out a match when in front. The only times he has lost after being two sets up were against Lleyton Hewitt in the Davis Cup in 2003, and against David Nalbandian in Shanghai in 2005. Nevertheless, for a long while in the middle of this match, that record was in jeopardy. The world No2 looked bereft of ideas. Simon had his measure in timing and tactics, as he drew him on to the punch at the net, only to pass and lob, sometimes with chilling ease. Federer likes to give the impression that he always plays within himself, but that was not consistently the case. From the moment in the third set when the Frenchman discovered a reservoir of self-belief that surprised even him until he was broken in the final stanza, there were no guarantees, no certainties that the favourite would prevail. The anxiety that invaded Federer&apos;s normally expressionless, sweat-free features when he was battling to save the set, the match and his aura, spoke far more eloquently than his post-match dismissal of the crisis as a passing danger \u2013 or even proof that he still has a fifth gear. &quot;Four or five sets, what&apos;s the difference really?&quot; he said, with mock flippancy. &quot;Doesn&apos;t matter if you win in straight or in five. Just keep on moving on in the draw.&quot; Federer&apos;s concerns were real enough \u2013 and not dissimilar to those that consumed him on Centre Court at Wimbledon last June, when the then world No60, Colombia&apos;s Alejandro Falla, took the first two sets in a first-round match that also jangled the nerves. Then, Federerslowly recovered his poise to win in five sets. Here, although he would not agree, he betrayed the sort of fear he has induced in others. It was not just the prospect of defeat, coming after some wayward performances last year, that reduced him to a toiling mortal. It was the excellence of his opponent. Nobody has a divine right to rule, not even a tennis god. &quot;He&apos;s a great player,&quot; Federer said of Simon. &quot;Matches against him don&apos;t come easy. It&apos;s my first win against him [in three attempts]; they always go the distance. Hopefully I don&apos;t play him any more. I really enjoyed myself out here tonight. I wasn&apos;t playing poorly to lose the third and fourth set \u2013 Gilles really took it to me. I got lucky and I&apos;m happy I&apos;m still in the tournament.&quot;", "tags": ["Australian Open", "Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australian Open 2011", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-19T16:03:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jan/19/china-barack-obama", "sentences": ["Yao Yang is a soft-spoken economist who met with me over lunch one day in Shanghai to discuss his research about the impact of local elections."], "title": "China's tentative steps towards democracy | Steven Hill", "article": "During the state visit for Chinese President Hu Jintao, President Barack Obama should not only press President Hu on human rights, but should push a message about the importance of spreading democracy in China. If he does that, he may be surprised at what he will hear. In September 2010, President Hu gave a speech in Hong Kong in which he called for new thinking about Chinese democracy. Said Hu:  &quot;There is a need to \u2026 hold democratic elections according to the law; have democratic decision-making, democratic management, as well as democratic supervision; safeguard people&apos;s right to know, to participate, to express and to supervise.&quot;  His remarks elaborated on previous comments from Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, delivered in Shenzhen, the coastal free enterprise zone at the forefront of China&apos;s economic revolution. Wen said that without reforms of the political system, gains from reforms of the economic system would go down the drain. Political reform is necessary, said Wen, to sustain the nation&apos;s breakneck economic growth, including opportunities for citizens to criticise and monitor the government.  Wen&apos;s remarks led to speculation that Shenzhen, which set the pace for China&apos;s economic development, could soon become a &quot;special political zone&quot;. Sino experts noted that a next step could be direct elections for the chiefs of the Special Economic Zone&apos;s six districts.  Yet when it comes to the subject of representative democracy in China, numerous sinologists continue to say, &quot;Don&apos;t hold your breath.&quot; But the notion may not be as far-fetched \u2013 or as far off \u2013 as the cynics believe. For example, most westerners will be surprised to learn that China already holds more elections than any other nation in the world. Under the Organic Law of the Village Committees, all of China&apos;s approximately 1 million villages \u2013 home to some 600 million voters \u2013 hold elections every three years for local village committees.  Critics scoff at these elections and say they are manipulated by local Communist party officials. But Robert Benewick, a research professor at the University of Sussex, says that village elections have been growing more competitive, with more independent candidates and use of the secret ballot becoming more common. For those elections where there has been real competition, researchers claim to have evidence of positive impacts.  Yao Yang is a soft-spoken economist who met with me over lunch one day in Shanghai to discuss his research about the impact of local elections. In a study that looked at 40 villages over 16 years, his research found that the introduction of elections had led to increased spending on public services by 20%, while reducing spending for &quot;administrative costs&quot; \u2013 bureaucratic-speak for corruption \u2013 by 18%. Premier Wen has indicated that village elections might be extended to the next highest government level \u2013 township administrations \u2013 over the next few years.  China&apos;s modest experiments with local elections have been supplemented with exercises in what is known as &quot;deliberative democracy&quot;. These take the shape of high-tech New England-style town hall meetings. China hired Stanford University professor James Fishkin to draft a randomly-selected, scientifically-representative sample of average citizens from the city of Zeguo to participate in an assembly using the internet, keypad polling devices and handheld computers to decide how their city should spend a $6m public works budget. The Zeguo exercise was considered hugely successful and has been replicated in other places.  Professor Yu Keping, who is deputy director of a Communist party institute and author of a prominent book called Democracy Is a Good Thing, is said to have the ear of President Hu. He and others have been nudging democracy forward in another direction that shows great promise \u2013 internal democracy within the ruling Communist party. Holding competitive elections for party posts already has begun at lower levels, with votes for provincial and national party congresses showing electoral slates with 15-30% more candidates than positions.  Given that the Communist party has a membership of 73 million people, such a &quot;democratic vanguard&quot; holds potential. If internal elections become widespread, the lines of ideological difference within elite circles might become more clearly drawn, which could further spur calls for some kind of representational structure. Rapid change in China already has resulted in a battle of ideas, pitting the coasts and cities against the countryside and inland provinces, and the rich against poor. Internal elections are increasingly seen by some as a healthy vehicle for airing these differences. Most sinologists believe that if Chinese democracy continues to develop, it is unlikely to be an exact copy of the western model. Many are intrigued by the vision promoted by Confucian-inspired intellectuals like Jiang Qing, who have put forward an innovative proposal for a tricameral legislature. Legislators in one chamber would be selected based on merit and competency, and in the others based on elections of some kind. One elected chamber may be reserved only for Communist party members, the other for representatives elected by everyday Chinese. Such a tricameral legislature, its proponents believe, would better ensure that political decisions are made by more educated and enlightened representatives, instead of the rank populism of western-style elected factions. It&apos;s intriguing to contemplate China evolving into some sort of innovative democratic experiment, combining tricameralism with all the high-tech features of deliberative democracy methods to mold a new type of political accountability, as well as separation of powers. Daniel Bell, a Canadian-born professor of political theory at Tsinghua University in Beijing, says China may be groping toward &quot;a political model that works better than western-style democracy&quot;. Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was quoted in 1987 as saying there would be national elections in 50 years. So China&apos;s democratic trajectory may be ahead of schedule.\u00a0President Obama should confidently engage President Hu on this most important subject.

After sliding back through the 6000 mark in late trading yesterday, the FTSE 100 dropped by another 94 points, or 1.5%, to 5882 this morning. Traders said the news that China grew by 10.3% last year, more than analysts had expected, had fuelled expectations of new fiscal tightening measures in the world&apos;s second-largest economy, David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index, said the Chinese GDP growth had &quot;alarmed markets somewhat&quot;, hitting mining stocks which are closely linked to the China&apos;s appetite for raw materials. &quot;China&apos;s GDP once again raised concerns that the Chinese government may impose measures to cool the economy in the near future,&quot; said Jones. Economists have warned that China&apos;s relatively loose monetary policy in 2009 and 2010 has created the danger of unsustainable bubbles, particularly in the housing sector. Inflation in China has hit 4.6%, adding to fears that the economy may be overheating. &quot;A new wave of credit expansion is driving inflationary pressure, in both consumer prices and asset markets,&quot; cautioned IHS analyst Alistair Thornton. European stock markets were also broadly lower, with Germany&apos;s DAX dropping by around 0.8%. China&apos;s main stockmarket, the Shanghai Composite Index, fell by 2.9%. David Buik of BGC Parners said that disappointing results from Goldman Sachs yesterday had hit banks across Europe. He added that traders were taking the opportunity to take profits following the FTSE 100&apos;s strong performance in recent months. London extended its early losses after the CBI released its latest healthcheck of Britain&apos;s manufacturing sector. The industrial trends survey painted a broadly positive picture, with 32% of manufacturers reporting an increase in output in January while just 16% said output had fallen. However, the survey also showed a worrying decline in orders, with 37% saying their order book was smaller than average while 21% had more work lined up than usual. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said the &quot;marked falling back in the orders balance&quot; to -16 was probably due to a drop in domestic demand rather than a decline in exports. He added that 2011 would be tough for manufacturers if retailers stopped restocking, tighter fiscal policy weighed down on domestic demand, and the Eurozone crisis threatened foreign orders. Ian McCafferty, CBI chief economic adviser, also warned that manufacturers have raised output prices markedly during the last three months. This trend is likely to continue, pushing up the cost of living. &quot;Manufacturers have come under intense pressure to pass on rising costs: they have increased prices markedly in this quarter, and expect to raise them at an even faster pace over the next three months,&quot; said McCafferty. &quot;This will drive further inflationary pressure in the wider economy.&quot;", "tags": ["Stock markets", "Business", "China", "World news", "Manufacturing data", "Economics", "Manufacturing sector", "Global economy", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-20T12:42:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/20/china-growth-spurt-fuels-overheating-fears", "sentences": ["Although the growth and inflation figures had been leaked in advance, China&apos;s main stock index, the Shanghai Composite, ended down 2.9%."], "title": "China's growth fuels overheating fears", "article": "Shares in London and other world markets fell sharply today amid growing concerns that the Chinese economy, now the second-largest in the world, is in danger of overheating.

Data from the Chinese national bureau of statistics this morning showed GDP growth of 10.3% for 2010, following a fourth-quarter increase was 9.8%. This was higher than economists had expected and was accompanied by news that inflation in China was a higher than expected 4.6%, which added to fears that the economy may be overheating. The inflation worries were underlined by news that Guangdong province, the sourthern manufacturing heartland of the country, increased its minimum wage by 18% to 26%, its second big increase in less than 12 months. Inflation was markedly lower than November&apos;s 28-month high of 5.1%, but analysts had expected it to fall to 4.4%. That took the year&apos;s rate to 3.3%. Although the growth and inflation figures had been leaked in advance, China&apos;s main stock index, the Shanghai Composite, ended down 2.9%. &quot;China&apos;s economy maintained relatively stable and rapid development, avoiding overheating while also avoiding a &apos;double dip&apos; that everyone was concerned about,&quot; said Ma Jiantang, head of the statistics bureau. He said the government had achieved &quot;remarkable results&quot; in tackling inflation, but said tightening the money supply would be crucial: &quot;The price trends in 2011 cannot be taken lightly.&quot; Bad weather and a surge in spending ahead of Chinese new year usually boost consumer inflation at the start of the year. China has tried to rein back growth by raising banks&apos; required reserves seven times in the last year and has raised interest rates twice. But Brian Jackson, an economist with Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, warned: &quot;Beijing still has more work to do to keep the economy on an even keel. Risks are skewed to more aggressive action.&quot; Pressure  In a report issued shortly after the figures were released, IHS analyst Alistair Thornton warned: &quot;A new wave of credit expansion is driving inflationary pressure, in both consumer prices and asset markets.&quot; He argued that inflationary pressures were spilling into non-food areas and that moves to rein in credit had been &quot;timid&quot;. &quot;There has been a lot of money created over the last two years and ultimately you are going to get some inflationary impact. [Secondly], for a year and a half, the labour market has been very tight and wages have been rising quite substantially,&quot; said Arthur Kroeber of the Beijing-based Dragonomics consultancy. While money creation is now rising at a slower rate, inflation usually lags it by six to nine months, he added. Economists polled by Reuters forecast that consumer inflation will average 4.3% this year, above the government&apos;s 4% target. State news agency Xinhua reported that premier Wen Jiabao told the state council \u2013 China&apos;s cabinet \u2013 that the government would focus on curbing rises in the price of food and housing. Some analysts fear last year&apos;s high growth reflects a property bubble, fuelled by heavy lending from banks. Investment in construction and other fixed assets was up 23.8% year on year, although the previous 12 months saw an even heftier increase of 30.1% due to stimulus spending. &quot;Because of the property bubble, risk exists almost everywhere in China&apos;s fragile financial system,&quot; said Yi Xianrong, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences&apos; finance research centre. But Andy Rothman, macro-economist at investment group CLSA, argued: &quot;Since the government&apos;s intervention in April, house price growth has been very moderate and much slower than growth in incomes: 0.4% month on month.&quot; Kroeber said that while major structural problems in the property market needed to be addressed, there was not a bubble. &quot;It is not going to pop [so that you have] two or three years where no one is building houses,&quot; he said, adding that much recent investment had been in desperately-needed social housing for those on lower incomes.

The stronger than expected data from China sent stock markets and the price of commodities falling as traders wrestled with the implications for growth and inflation in the rest of the world.

Analysts at Lombard Street Research said that the risk of China&apos;s economy overheating had worsened significantly in the fourth quarter as both domestic demand and export growth surged. &quot;Policymakers are behind the curve and need to act decisively if they are to curb inflation. The longer growth stays above trend, the worse the necessary downswing is set to be,&quot; said Lombard Street&apos;s Diana Choyleva. &quot;China&apos;s violent cycle could be highly destabilising for the world. Over the next 12 to 18 months, China is set to pay the &apos;growth price&apos; of its excessive policy stimulus.&quot; She said Beijing had engineered an unprecedented expansion in response to the 2008 recession. &quot;But \u2026 monetary and fiscal ease did more to accelerate inflation than to achieve a sustainable boost to growth.&quot; Two other analysts, Capital Economics and Evolution Securities, were more sanguine. Capital said the inflationary effects of the stimulus package were waning and that the economy would calm down. A steady exchange rate and declining internal demand would also keep inflation in check, it believed. In Washington, President Obama told his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao, who is on a four-day state visit, that the US would like to see China&apos;s currency, the yuan, rise in value to reflect the economy&apos;s success. Obama told a press conference that even though China had taken some steps to strengthen its currency, it remains undervalued. Hu indicated that Beijing was committed to letting market forces influence the yuan&apos;s value, Obama said, but &quot;not as fast as we&apos;d like&quot;. Obama is concerned that American companies are struggling to recover from recession while Chinese goods remain artificially under-priced. He is keen that the yuan be allowed to rise, which would have the effect of making imports to the US more expensive and US exports cheaper for Chinese consumers. European governments are more wary of pushing China down this road, as, unlike the US, they are worried about rising inflation, and more expensive Chinese imports would only make the situation worse. The Bank of England has come under pressure to raise rates following a rise in UK inflation this week to 3.7%, and the European Central Bank has already threatened to raise interest rates to calm inflation in the eurozone. Figures yesterday showed that consumer confidence across Europe had slipped for a second month, adding to fears that recovery was under threat across the continent, except in Germany, which has boomed on the back of exports to Asia. A CBI survey of British manufacturers found many sounding a warning about further inflationary pressure. The number of manufacturers that had put their prices up over the past three months hit its highest level since October 2008, according to the survey. Oil prices fell to near $90 a barrel, after almost reaching $100 this week, because of the fear that Beijing will be forced to implement higher taxes or lending constraints to calm growth. China is the world&apos;s largest importer after the US and its economic performance is regarded as a crucial factor in determining the demand for oil. China&apos;s 4.6% inflation in December was better than the 28-month high of the November figure, but analysts said it was still worse than expected and remained likely to rise again.", "tags": ["Global economy", "China", "World news", "Economics", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-21T07:00:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/22/internet-picks-of-the-week", "sentences": ["Elsewhere are feisty pieces on the cabinet office&apos;s behavioural insight team, the rise of Shanghai, ageism at the BBC, and music opinions that seem split between championing new acts and reprinting vintage music paper interviews with the likes of Nick Cave and Joe Strummer."], "title": "Internet picks of the week", "article": "Louder Than War Louder Than War is a music and pop culture site led by journalist and one-man punk rock army John Robb \u2013 late of riotous combos the Membranes and Goldblade.

With no raised catwalk and no high heels, the models seemed more approachable and human than is the norm at haute couture, where a pedestalled vision of feminine beauty is the norm. Emotion was allowed to permeate the casting: the show opened with Stella Tennant, a 40-year-old model with whom Lagerfeld has a longstanding friendship, and closed with 46-year-old Kristen McMenamy wearing a wedding dress, as is traditional for the finale of haute couture shows. Lagerfeld gave McMenamy away at her own wedding, 15 years ago. The dominant silhouette consisted of slim trousers worn under tunic-length dresses finishing at mid-thigh. As an ensemble it was reminiscent of traditional feminine silhouettes from the Middle East and Asia, while also being close to the skinny-jean-and-ballet-pump aesthetic much in evidence as the unofficial uniform of twentysomething Parisiennes. Jackets, usually so perky and prominent in a Chanel collection, were played down with flat, simple collars or replaced by simple T-shirt shapes. Lagerfeld&apos;s nod to sartorial traditions beyond Paris is a smart decision. Chanel is currently making a big effort to forge relationships with lucrative new clients who do not attend the Paris shows. After today&apos;s Parisian premiere this catwalk event will be reproduced in several other cities, including Shanghai. This being haute couture, even a message of modern understatement could not disguise the extraordinary accomplishment of the craft. The traditional gold buttons, Coco&apos;s instantly recognisable motif of feminine power dressing, were replaced by rows of tiny, looped crystal fastenings, while the customary glow of pearls around a neckline was substituted by rows of silver bugle beading, sewn so tight and flat that they glinted like silk ribbon. The show considerably shortened the odds on the 1920s soon replacing the 1950s as fashion&apos;s favourite decade of reference. The flat shoes and sequinned embroidery, along with the narrow, waistless shapes hemmed by straight-across necklines and adorned with drop-waisted gathers at the hips, nodded to the 20s eveningwear look, which is likely to gain an even higher profile when Boardwalk Empire, Martin Scorsese&apos;s lauded prohibition-era drama, hits British TV screens next week. Lagerfeld was wearing a navy suit at the show, having recently declared himself to have moved on from his onetime uniform of black. There were very few pieces in Coco&apos;s favourite colour in this collection, but the dreamy shades of pink, silver and lilac were sharpened with tiny accents of black: fingerless gloves, omnipresent pointy-toed black mule slippers and, most notably, black ribbon chokers of the type famously worn by Manet&apos;s Olympia, fastened into the models&apos; chignons at the nape of the neck with crystal hairpins.", "tags": ["Chanel", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Haute couture shows", "Fashion weeks", "Paris fashion week", "Haute couture shows spring/summer 2011", "Karl Lagerfeld"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-25T19:54:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/leeds/2011/jan/25/leeds-salon-debate-future-of-leeds", "sentences": ["He is now researching the impact of Expo 2010 on Shanghai&apos;s urban strategy."], "title": "Debate will ask: What is the future of Leeds?", "article": "After two decades of growth and change, Leeds is now at something of a crossroads, in search of direction and identity.  While other northern cities have had massive investment and public attention as &apos;cities of culture&apos;, hosting international athletic events, and the building or renovation of iconic buildings as national cultural venues, Leeds seems to have been left behind.  Development and regeneration seemed to have stuttered even before the recession hit.     West Yorkshire Playhouse will host the deabte    So where does Leeds go now, and how does it move forward? Does Leeds have anything unique to offer? Is the answer more of what it does already: attracting financial services and promoting itself as Yorkshire&apos;s premier shopping destination? Or could Leeds be the economic hub driving the future success of a huge city-region and attracting new and innovative industries?  And what about the arts and culture? Does Leeds have the facilities and resources to attract cultural entrepreneurs, creators and innovators? And how does Leeds keep and promote its own creative talent? What will, or how will, Leeds define itself as a city in the 21st century? How could it be the great regional capital it aspires to be? And, ultimately, what makes and defines a city?

It is an historic event, the first slam singles final, men&apos;s or women&apos;s, featuring a Chinese player. Yet she is not sure the achievement will inspire the tennis bonanza in China that most commentators imagine. &quot;Good for me,&quot; she agreed, &quot;good for my team \u2026 maybe good for China tennis. I&apos;m not sure. Maybe.&quot; Pressed on her reticence, Li said it would depend on how the media in China present what she has done and is about to do. A media student herself, she is well aware that China&apos;s press is unpredictable; there may well be a residue of resentment in the Chinese establishment about Li&apos;s flight from the state-run system. &quot;I mean, you have to see what they are write down for me,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything decide for the media.&quot; Even in her halting English, the message was clear. Clijsters, meanwhile, had a ridiculously easy time beating Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 6-3 to reach her eighth grand slam singles final. The Belgian, still called &quot;Aussie Kim&quot; from her time with Lleyton Hewitt, will start favourite on Saturday, but there is little doubt the two in-form players of the past fortnight are contesting the title. After saving match point in the second set to beat the world No1 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, Li carries not only the good wishes of many neutrals but surely the hopes of even those among her compatriots who might regard tennis as giant ping-pong. For Wozniacki, who made us laugh, just a little, this week with her quirky press conferences and a smiling demeanour that charmed even the cynics, tears were the immediate response to blowing a match that was hers for the taking. As Wozniacki hurried from the court, head down, the sun-bathed arena rose to acclaim the winner, a sturdy campaigner who has got stronger as she worked her way through the draw. When Wozniacki failed to convert match point at the end of the second set, she compounded her misery by double-faulting to hand the set to Li. The Dane, still without a slam to her name, was clearly so stunned that she surrendered the initiative and momentum to Li in a third set that went by in a blur. &quot;I&apos;m so happy to be the first Chinese player to a final,&quot; Li told Britain&apos;s Sam Smith, working courtside for the local broadcaster, Channel 7. &quot;I was a little bit nervous. And last night my husband, he sleep like this [making snoring noises]. I was waking up every hour.&quot; Her husband, Jiang Shan, is also her coach, and he beamed down from the stands as if suddenly pitched into I&apos;m A Celebrity&apos;s Husband \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here. Smith, in the fine tradition of TV gaffes at this tournament, wrongly announced to everyone that this was their fifth wedding anniversary. &quot;Is it?&quot; said a gobsmacked Li. &quot;Today? Not two days later? I thought it was the 29th!&quot; It is. &quot;The ground opened up on me a little,&quot; Smith said later. Li&apos;s answer as to what pulled her through when so close to losing was more straightforward: &quot;Prize money.&quot; Li&apos;s mother famously has never seen her play \u2013 and that is not about to change apparently. &quot;I think she prefer to stay home,&quot; she said. &quot;I ask her many times. [She says] No, no I have my life, I didn&apos;t want come with you.&quot; Li, who turns 29 next month, is in many ways the classic modern women&apos;s tennis player: experienced, full of perseverance and playing her best tennis after many years on the circuit. A childhood badminton star, she was persuaded to take up tennis at nine and turned professional 12 years ago. But the sport has not consumed her \u2013 which might explain her pragmatic approach. Li dropped out of tennis in 2002 for two years to study. She has had other spells away from the sport through injury but looks immensely fit and committed at the business end of this championship. Not everyone is as gloomy as Li about the future of tennis in China. Brad Drewett, a national junior champion in Australia who went on to reach 34th in the world in the 80s, is the ATP&apos;s tennis development officer in Asia. At the Shanghai Masters last year, he told me: &quot;The programmes here have developed significantly over the last five years and there are many very good junior players. &quot;Roger Federer held a clinic in Shanghai \u2026 with the best 11- and 12-year-olds. The feedback I got was there were a number of very exciting young prospects. &quot;I would hope in five, six to seven years we will have some significant players who are not just playing, but competing, and competing well, on the world tour. If that were to happen, the potential is unimaginable. It&apos;s not a matter of if, it&apos;s a matter of when.&quot; Whether Li starts the revolution is the most intriguing part of the narrative.", "tags": ["Australian Open", "Sport", "Tennis", "Kim Clijsters", "Australian Open 2011", "Australia sport", "Li Na"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-27T08:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/29/fa-cup-saturday-clockwatch-live", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;m sitting here in Shanghai watching Japan v Australia on TV."], "title": "FA Cup Saturday Clockwatch - as it happened | Evan Fanning", "article": " Ah the FA Cup. So much magic yet it still won&apos;t disappear; so much romance but nobody seems to love it anymore; so much glamour yet today&apos;s fixtures are about as shiny as a wet Wednesday night in Hereford, which incidentally is where one of the fourth-round replays will take place if it finishes level today at Sheffield Wednesday. Still, it&apos;s something to do, isn&apos;t it? Today&apos;s 3pm kick-offs may not be the most enticing on paper, but then the FA Cup is all about surprises so we may well be in for some quality action. Seriously. Below are all the fixtures which are about to get underway as well as team news from where I have it. Let&apos;s do this.

Subs: Poke, Battipiedi, Bennett, Baz, Holroyd, Sandaza, Dunk.Referee: Eddie Ilderton (Tyne &amp; Wear)  2.45pm: It&apos;s not even 3pm and we&apos;ve had our first bit of magic of the day. Leyton Orient have won 2-1 away at Championship side Swansea. I&apos;ve also just heard that the kick off between sunny Torquay and Crawley Town has been delayed by 15 minutes due to crowd congestion. In case you missed it Everton and Chelsea finished 1-1 while Aston Villa are 3-1 up at home to Blackburn. Sunderland have signed Sulley Muntari on loan until the end of the season. That&apos;s exciting.  2.52pm: Aston Villa have won 3-1. Gerard Houllier likes the FA Cup, doesn&apos;t he? Here&apos;s the report from Everton 1-1 Chelsea.  3.00pm: Peeep. The sound of simaltaneous whistles blowing sends the dogs in the street running and we&apos;re underway. Everywhere, that is, except for Torquay where kick off has been delayed by 15 minutes.  3.01pm: Aside from the FA Cup it&apos;s also the Asian Cup final, as Matt Stratford points out. &quot;Shout out for the Asian Cup final,&quot; he shouts. &quot;Just about to kick off in Qatar. Australia slight favourites I reckon, having only conceded one goal in the run-up to the final. But I secretly hope Keisuke Honda lights up the final and blitzes it for Japan like he did in the World Cup.&quot;  3.02pm: Early chance for Stevenage as David Bridges heads at goal but Reading manage to scramble it away.  3.03pm: &quot;Good to see Culture Club&apos;s old drummer swapping the sticks for a whistle and getting a run out at Turf Moor,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Officiating is getting very inclusive these days.&quot; It certainly is. Boy George is the fourth official at Southport v York.  3.08pm: And Boy George is witnessing a classic down at Haig Avenue. Southport are 1-0 up against York who are down to 10-men. Kris Commons has scored on his debut for Celtic who are 1-0 up at Aberdeen.  3.10pm: The first FA Cup goal of the 3pm games and it&apos;s come at Hillsborough. Jake Jervis crossed to his strike partner Stuart Fleetwood and while the Wednesday defence stood off he was able to finish. Great start for Hereford. It seems Matt Stratford is going to MBM the Asian Cup final for us. &quot;Could be goals in this,&quot; he writes. &quot;Australia should have been 1-0 up within 60 seconds but for a shanked finish. Japan had a legitimate claim for a penalty turned down a couple of minutes later. Qatar&apos;s stadium is getting a look over from Michel Platini, who is ensconced in what can only be called a velvet throne in the stands.&quot;  3.13pm: Celtic are 2-0 and it&apos;s Charlie Mulgrew&apos;s first goal and it&apos;s against his former club. Meanwhile Coventry have taken the lead at St Andrew&apos;s. Marlon King has scored the goal but Birmingham are furious and feel the game should have been stopped for a foul on Liam Ridgewell.  3.16pm: Sheffield Wednesday have equalised against Hereford and it&apos;s former Liverpool midfielder Darren Potter who has got it. If the score stays like it is that&apos;s three very valuable points for me in the office pick-the-score competition where a whopping \u00a39.70 is on offer for the winner which, coincidentally, is the same amount that the runner-up of the FA Cup gets.  3.19pm: &quot;Asian Cup update No3,&quot; says Matt Stratford. &quot;Australia nearly go ahead as Holman squares a ball across the six-yard box and Cahill nearly gets to it. Almost immediately after Carl Valeri is booked for a clumsy challenge on the counter-attacking Japanese.&quot; I have tried to find the Asian Cup final on television here in Guardian Towers but all I can find is some ski jumping. No goals so far in that.  3.22pm: Watford 0-1 Brighton Ashley Barnes has given Brighton the lead but it&apos;s a terrible mistake from Watford goalkeeper Rene Gilmartin who let Barnes&apos;s shot slip through his hands. Mikele Leigertwood has scored for Reading at Stevenage so it&apos;s Stevenage 0-1 Reading.  3.25pm: &quot;To be fair I&apos;m not sure we expect any goals in the ski jumping,&quot; says Andrew Rae. You say that, but then you never really know what to expect in ski jumping do you? &quot;Sheffield Wednesday are crap,&quot; says Phil Laing. &quot;Doesn&apos;t surprise me that Hereford are 1-0 up. Wednesday are crap, I saw Orient shellack them 4-0 last week. Thanks to the pod, I&apos;ve got an accumulator on Hereford, Crawley and Forest tomorrow, so fingers crossed...&quot; Bad news Phil. Sheffield Wednesday have equalised.  3.28pm: Speaking of betting, Nick (just Nick) has found an expensive way to watch the Asian Cup final. &quot;The match is live on the Bet365 website. The downside is that the screen is the size of a Casio watch face and you have to register and place a bet as well.&quot; Who really has time for that? Coventry have scored again at St Andrew&apos;s where Richard Wood&apos;s downward header beat Colin Doyle in the Birmingham goal. Birmingham 0-2 Coventry.  3.31pm: A long email from Ryan Dunne: &quot;A few weeks ago on the FA Cup MBM (I think Scott Murray was the celbrant) I argued that replays should be scrapped, primarily to increase drama, but also to increase the likelihood of genuine giant-killings (not a statto, but isn&apos;t it likely that big teams - due to their greater squad depth - triumph more often in replays than diddy ones?). I was roundly condemned (well, people disagreed with me) so am delighted to see David Lacey&apos;s piece today. Just look at today&apos;s big game : Chelsea will probably get a dressing room bollocking and do the business against Everton in the replay. Yet, if today&apos;s game was a genuine knock-out tie, surely Chelsea would have been more likely to pay for their lackadaisical performance? As it stands currently, teams can play for drams, replays, extra time and penalties, which to me is wholly contrary to the romance and excitement of a prestigious knock-out cup competition.&quot; I&apos;m with you Ryan. Scrap replays and move games to midweek. That&apos;s my motto.  3.32pm: Burney have taken the lead through Chris Eagles so it&apos;s Burnley 1-0 Burton Albion. Celtic are now three-up at Aberdeen thanks to Thomas Rogne. More from the Asian Cup final thanks to Matt Stratford. &quot;David Carney nods a header goalwards touched on by Harry Kewell which is well saved by the Japanese keeper. Australia are getting a lot of joy lobbing in crosses from deep. Neither Yasuhito Endo nor the Eurosport-renamed &quot;Kaisookie&quot; Honda are getting on the ball enough for Japan.&quot;  3.36pm: More from Matt Stratford. &quot;Honda feeds in Okazaki who hits a shot against the arm of an Aussie defender. Could hardly have got out of the way though, so it&apos;s rightly not given. At the other end Cahill and Kewell combine in the box to present Kewell with a decent chance on the volley, which he hits into the stands.&quot; Thanks also to Matt and Nick for the advice on where to find the game. I would tell you but I don&apos;t want you to leave. I need the company. Celtic are now 4-0 up at Aberdeen and as good as through to the next round. Still goalless between Torquay and Crawley.  3.38pm: Goal for Birmingham and it&apos;s David Bentley with his first since signing on loan from Tottenham. He shot from distance, it seemed to swerve in the air which deceived the usually excellent Keiren Westwood and flew into the net. Birmingham 1-2 Coventry.  3.40pm: &quot;Glad to see some English interest on the Asian Cup ...,&quot; says Mario Rustan presumably referring to Matt Stratford&apos;s sterling work. &quot; ... thanks to the Aussies and online betting. Watching this match live on Star Sports - Asian name for Fox/Sky Sports (yes, Richard Keys was there). If this is not final night, both ESPN Asia &amp; Star would opt for FA Cup instead like what happened last Saturday.&quot;  3.42pm: In the Championship it&apos;s still goalless between Crystal Palace and Norwich and Hull and QPR. In League One it&apos;s Brentford 1-1 Yeovil; Carlisle 0-2 Oldham; Plymouth 0-1 Bournemouth; Swindon 0-0 Exeter and Walsall 3-0 Bristol Rovers.  3.47pm: It&apos;s half time at Turf Moor and it&apos;s Burney 1-0 Burton Albion. Half time to at Tynecastle where Hearts lead St Johnstone by one goal to nil. It&apos;s into stoppage time at St Andrew&apos;s where Birmingham have come back into it after falling two-goals behind. It&apos;s still Birmingham 1-2 Coventry. Half time at Vicarage Road and it&apos;s Watford 0-1 Brighton.  3.50pm: I&apos;m going to share the Asian Cup final love aropund a bit. here&apos;s Mario Rustan&apos;s half-time update: &quot;0-0 at half time. Australia is arguably monotone, relying on right crosses from the midfield...while yeah, Japan seems to unable to operate in the penalty box. Australia have still only conceded one goal in this tournament.&quot; There you go. Half time in all the FA Cup games with the exception of Torquay which kicked off 15 minutes late.  4.00pm: Everton&apos;s Johnny Heitinga has taken to Twitter following their 1-1 draw with Everton. That scoreline is a crucial piece of information when you read this tweet. &quot;Thanks for all your support, to [sic] bad we lost, good performance of all of us...&quot; The magic of the cup. It makes draws feel like defeats.  4.03pm: Crawley have taken the lead at Torquay in the game which started 15 minutes late. Matt Tubbs (or Tubbsy as he is surely known) has scored for the Blue Square Premier side.  4.08pm: I&apos;m operating a rotation policy on the Asian Cup final. Here&apos;s Matt Stratford. &quot;Japan are extremely lucky to still be 0-0. Holman lobs in a cross-cum-shot towards the back post where it bounces off the woodwork, bounces off of Cahill and almost in, but Yoshida is there to chest it off the line.&quot;  4.08pm: &quot;Harry Kewell is, apparently, only 32 - I&apos;d have thought he would be at least 42 by now,&quot; writes Gary Naylor. &quot;Any other players younger than you expect.(Surely Alan Smith is past 30 by now?)&quot; I wonder how long we can do this before somebody mentions Patrick Vieira.  4.10pm: The netting on one of the goals at St Andrew&apos;s has had to be taped back into place before the second half can continue. Amateur hour. No second half goals yet in any of the FA Cup games.  4.15pm: &quot;Who says men can&apos;t multi-task?&quot; ask Nigel Pritchard risking never having a career with Sky Sports. &quot;I&apos;m sitting here in Shanghai watching Japan v Australia on TV. I&apos;m also watching the Blues v Coventry online and reading the clockwatch as well. Anyone else multitasking?&quot; But are you doing any of them well, Nigel? Are you?  4.18pm: Chris Kamara is full of praise for the Brighton centre-back pairing of Greer and El-Abd. At the same time he admits that Watford have been less that impressive up top. That&apos;s not a problem at the Asian Cup final where they know full well how to get the damn thing in the mixer. &quot;Midfielder Jungo Fujimoto, who has been anonymous, is hauled off for Daiki Iwamasa,&quot; says Matt Stratford who&apos;s getting good at this. &quot;He goes straight into the defence to help deal with Tim Cahill, who has been in the mixer causing the Japanese back line a lot of trouble.&quot;  4.22pm: Nothing much happening in the FA Cup so far this half. Plymouth should have equalised at home to Bournemouth, but Rory Fallon missed a great opportunity. Something odd is happening at Selhurst Park according to Phil Thompson. &quot;It looks like smoke on the pitch,&quot; he says. Well if it looks like smoke, and it smells like smoke, then it probably is smoke. That&apos;s what I was always taught. &quot;Shaun Wright Philips ages faster than everyone else due to his pace,&quot; says Ian Copestake. That may be true, but he&apos;s never got wise enough to know not to shank his cross into touch.  4.26pm: More from Mario Rustan ... &quot;Development. Zaccheroni replaced reserve midfielder Fujimoto with defender Iwamasa, while moving Stuttgart&apos;s hopeful Okazaki to right flank. Result: Japan finally attacks. Australia responds by sending in Emerton in place of South Africa scorer Holman. Oh, Okazaki just missed a header past Schwarzer&apos;s blind spot.&quot; Goal and a red card in the FA Cup. Joe Heath has been sent off for Hereford and Clinton Morrison has put away the ensuing penalty. It&apos;s now Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 Hereford.  4.28pm: Birmingham are really pushing for an equaliser at St Andrew&apos;s. Keiren Westwood has made a series of saves and now Chile international Jean Beausejour has missed the target with a header. In League One bottom club Walsall lead Bristol Rovers 5-1.  4.30pm: Stevenage have equalised against Reading as Darius Charles gives Adam Federici no chance with a header. Stevenage 1-1 Reading. Plymouth have equalised against Bournemouth as Rory Fallon grabs his third goal of the season.  4.32pm: Phil Laing seems to be satisfied with his lot. &quot;With Crawley taking the lead, Hereford just need to buck their ideas up a bit, and I can kick back tomorrow and (hopefully) watch Forest take the Hammers to the cleaners. Even if it doesn&apos;t come in, though, I&apos;ve still seen Orient beat their second high-flying Championship team of the season. Who needs an Olympic Stadium to succeed in East London?!?&quot; Birmingham have equalised as Stuart Parnaby gets his firsat goal in 678 years to make it Birmingham 2-2 Coventry.  4.33pm: Anyone thinking they could just watch a bit of telly and look at a few websites and call that multi-tasking is wrong. Dead wrong. Nick has just upped the ante. &quot;I think I&apos;m multi-tasking quite well. Doing some accounts and tax returns while watching Australia v Japan, drinking a mug of tea and keeping up with clockwatch. Masterful. Now to go and wash my hands after handling some dirty receipts.&quot;  4.35pm: &quot;I must stop emailing.&quot; says Phil Laing in a letter which has just arrived by carrier pidgeon. &quot;Every time I do, someone pops up to ruin my bet - this time it&apos;s Clinton Morrison, who couldn&apos;t hit a cow&apos;s arse with a banjo last week. Bah.&quot;  4.36pm: Bad news Phil. The letters are even worse than the emails. Jermaine Johnson has made it Sheffield Wednesday 3-1 Hereford. Torquay are diown to 10 men after Chris Zebroski handled in the area and received a second yellow card as well as giving away a penalty. Matt Tubbs took up to take it but Bevan pushed it round the post. I can&apos;t believe Tubbsy&apos;s missed that.  4.39pm: Birmingham have come from 2-0 down and now lead Coventry 3-2 and it&apos;s Kevin Phillips who has got the third. Sheffield Wednesday are home and dry. Clinton Morrison has got his second and they&apos;ve come from behind to lead 4-1. &quot;Asian Cup Updatew No11 from Matt Stratford. &quot;Emerton is sent scampering down the right flank by Harry Kewell, who is playing very well. He slides a ball in which Cahill is micrometres away from tumbling into the net despite being hustled by two defenders. Ten minutes of normal time remaining and one goal either way would surely win it.&quot; I would hate to know how many updates there would be if there were actually any goals.  4.41pm: Carrier pigeon, message in a bottle, doesn&apos;t seem to matter,&quot; says Phil Laing. &quot;Johnson&apos;s goal for Wednesday sends my bet down the drain. Ah well, \u00a310 was worth it for the mighty O&apos;s getting to the 5th round.&quot;  4.43pm: Calvin Zola has pulled a goal back for Burton so it&apos;s Burnley 2-1 Burton. Scott Bevan has saved his second penalty of the afternoon. Tubbsy was relieved of his duties after missing the last one. I&apos;m not sure who took this one but the outcome is the same - another save. Crawley still lead 1-0. Reading have gone back into the lead. McAnuff crossed from the left and goal machine Shane Long was on hand to finish, although there was a suspicion of offside.  4.46pm: &quot;That Kevin Phillips eh? Do you think Man City will be in with a bid on Monday?&quot; Or maybe Liverpool. They look like they&apos;ll need a goalscorer. Yeovil have gone 2-1 at Brentford through Paul Wotton.  4.47pm: It&apos;s full time in the Asian Cup final and it&apos;s still goalless so it&apos;s going to extra time. &quot;Harry Kewell,&quot; says Nick. &quot;Is there no beginning to his talents?&quot;  4.52pm: It&apos;s finished Aberdeen 1-4 Celtic in the CIS Cup semi final. Carlisle have scopred an injury time equaliser at home to Oldham. It&apos;s finished Bolton 0-0 Wigan in the FA Cup in a game that was every bit as dull as it sounds.  4.54pm: It&apos;s Burney 3-1 Burton Albion and John Paterson has got the third. Crawley are hanging on at Torquay. They&apos;re playing 10-men, have missed two penalties and there are still 10 minutes left.  4.55pm: Some FA Cup full time results: Sheff Wed 4-1 Hereford; Burnley 3-1 Burton Albion and Stevenage 1-2 Reading.  4.58pm: &quot;I&apos;m sure it&apos;s just me, but I&apos;m struggling to appreciate the relevance of Tony Blair getting a grilling about the Bulter report of 2004 to this MBM,&quot; writes Matthew of the related links at the side of the page. You need to read between the lines, Matthew. A good old-fashioned punch-up at Plainmoor according to the man from Sky. The end result is that Dean Howell has been sent off so it&apos;s 10v10 in what is the game of the day so far.  5.00pm: Full time at St Andrew&apos;s: Birmingham 3-2 Coventry and it&apos;s finished Watford 1-2 Brighton at Vicarage Road. Great result for Gus Poyet.  5.02pm: For a full list of today&apos;s results and scorers click here. It&apos;s all happening in the Asian Cup final. &quot;They&apos;ve just had a hilarious mis-kicking contest in the Japanese area leading to an Australian corner,&quot; says Nick. &quot;Either that or it was incredibly skilful and daring keepy-uppy. Predictably enough the corner was cleared easily.&quot;  5.04pm: Torquay have hit the crossbar with two minutes plus stoppage time remaining. Southampton v Manchester United is coming right up. You can follow it with Paolo Bandini here.  5.06pm: &quot;Matt Sratford has lost count of his Asian Cup updates. &quot;Extra time: Japan get possession of the ball for a couple of minutes and Wengerball it around in Australia&apos;s half without really looking threatening. Both teams look tired and there&apos;s a good chance this will go to penalties. That&apos;ll probably be goalless too, with Schwarzer&apos;s excellent penno-saving record and Kawashima looking in excellent nick.&quot;  5.09pm: &quot;I fear the Aussie coach has made a big mistake not starting with Robbie Fowler,&quot; says Ian Copestake. It&apos;s a huge mistake Ian. Huge.  5.10pm: It&apos;s finished at Plainmoor and it&apos;s Torquay 0-1 Crawley Town. Amazing result. It remains goalless in the Asian Cup final. That&apos;s heading for penalties. That&apos;s it from me. Thanks for all your emails and MBM entries. Some nice multi-tasking all-round. You can follow Southampton v Manchester United here.

Even for neutral observers, it is impossible to watch his talent undergo ball-by-ball scrutiny in a game that demands millimetric perfection without sharing his suffering and his joy \u2013 often within seconds of each other \u2013 so naked are his emotions. Inside the Rod Laver Arenatomorrow, we will all do it again. The pale Scot with a face of transparent anxiety will keep his audience in a state of suspense for possibly three hours or more in temperatures that threaten to touch 35C as he strives to win the Australian Open and lay a ghost who must by now be screaming for execution. If he were to beat Novak Djokovic \u2013 and he is in the mood and form to do so \u2013 he would deliver a grand slam that has famously eluded everyone from these islands since Alexander Obolensky beat the All Blacks single-handedly for England at Twickenham. That was in 1936, and the Russian prince shared what sporting limelight shone on athletes in those innocent times with Fred Perry, the son of a Labour MP, who won his third and final Wimbledon before fleeing the suffocating climate of English tennis for, among other places, Hollywood. Sport was not such a global concern then, and sportsmen were allowed almost normal lives, their deeds relayed in print and cinema newsreels up to a week later. But Perry&apos;s legend has grown in the national psyche to the point that, in 2011, an event that was of peripheral interest to a British audience 75 years ago has taken on the proportions of Hamlet. Murray, a proud 23-year-old Scot, rightly resists the hysteria, preferring to take on the burden critics lumber him with about his reluctance to play aggressively \u2013 a\u00a0charge that looks ludicrous on the evidence of his stirring fightback to beat David Ferrer in four sets on Friday night. Murray went to the net 56 times, 40 times making the Spaniard pay. So that is Murray&apos;s more immediate and significant baggage. It is heavy enough a load on its own, especially as he is in his third grand slam final, this time against an opponent he has known\u00a0since they were 13 years old and who shares his hunger to displace the two giants of the modern game, Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer, who, to the surprise of most observers, left Melbourne early. Consequently, there is a palpable sense of a new era, that catch-all concept,\u00a0about this final. Nadal limped home on one leg, beaten in the quarter-finals by his countryman Ferrer; Djokovic did not just account for Federer, he beat him even more thoroughly than he did at the same stage of the US Open last August. Murray had to fight much harder to defeat Ferrer in his semi-final, yet it could be argued that match was every bit as sound a preparation for the final as was Djokovic&apos;s assignment against the Swiss. The Scot dipped into his considerable resources of courage; Djokovic had his sometimes fragile confidence bolstered. What is clear is they will have no secrets. There will be no mind games between strangers, no second-guessing, no mysteries. They have met seven times, and Murray&apos;s three wins have come at the end of the sequence, all on hard courts, but the last of those was nearly two years ago. Two of Djokovic&apos;s four wins were on clay, in Monte Carlo three years ago and Madrid in 2006. So maybe there is a hint of the unknown about this one. They were born a week apart, in 1987, but have games as different as their accents. Murray, from Dunblane, has grown into a sublime touch player with a heart as big as a house. Djokovic, from Belgrade, still leans towards power tennis and is relentless when in front, but hates to have his rhythm disrupted. It is a dream fit. They first met on a tennis court 10 years ago, spotty prodigies in a tournament called Les Petits A&apos;s, in Tarbes in the foothills of the Pyrenees. Murray says he won &quot;6-0, 6-1 maybe&quot;. Djokovic say he cannot remember the score. &quot;A lot&apos;s changed since then,&quot; Murray said an hour after his semi-final on Friday night. &quot;I&apos;m sure it will be just a bit tougher than that on Sunday.&quot; There have been unsubstantiated whispers of jealousy between them as they developed their fledgling skills but that is what teenagers are for. They both confirm they are friends now. Surely, though, there had been some tension. &quot;When we&apos;ve seen each other off the courts, I&apos;ve never been jealous of him,&quot; said Murray. &quot;We have always got on well. When we were a bit younger, because we were the two trying to get ahead of Roger and Rafa, we wanting to push each other a little bit. So sometimes the matches were a little fiery, but now we get on very well. &quot;We played doubles here when I first came on the Tour. We spoke in Perth about maybe playing doubles a couple of times this year. We have never had a falling out and always got on well.&quot; For Djokovic, victory in a grand slam is a place he has already been \u2013 and he craves more such thrills. He is every bit as driven as Murray to take his place at the summit of the men&apos;s game, and few are better placed. &quot;We both know how difficult it is to make that final step and win a title,&quot; he said yesterday, &quot;especially if you have Nadal or Federer across the net. [Here] In 2008, I had [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga, who had played a great tournament.&quot; True. But he was Jo-Wilfried Tsonga; he still is. The Frenchman, born to entertain and perplex, faded in five sets against Alexandr Dolgopolov in the third round here \u2013 and the Ukrainian, dangerous as he was, could not match Murray in the quarter-finals. Djokovic and Murray, with Robin Soderling and Tomas Berdych in the mix, are the future, which might be closer than anyone imagines. Nadal shrugs off talk that his hamstring problem compounds the knee injuries that he looked to finally have beaten over the past year, but he is no doctor. Federer? The concerns about him are not clouded by health issues, just his failure to dominate as he once\u00a0did. Tennis etiquette and reluctance to create disharmony in the changing room dictate that none of their fellow professionals will dare utter in public what they might believe in private: at least one of these legends is fading, perhaps both. And, in the ruthless business of professional sport, the hunting pack will give them no peace. Picking a winner in this final is as tough as in any match since the quarter-finals, but the money will almost certainly move Djokovic&apos;s way on the evidence of his win over Federer. It is compelling. But since he folded so abjectly against Federer in last year&apos;s final, Murray has beaten the Swiss convincingly, twice, in Toronto and Shanghai. When it comes down to such minutiae, the call goes with the heart \u2013 and there is no denying the size of Murray&apos;s. It is agreed that finally getting his hands on a grand slam title would change his life substantially, although the player sees it a bit differently from the British tennis writers who went through a decade of serial disappointments with Tim Henman. What did he imagine the impact of his winning the title would be back in the UK? &quot;I&apos;ve no idea,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope if it happens, it will be a huge story.&quot; Tick that box. Well, how would he feel if his fame &quot;went through the roof&quot;? &quot;I don&apos;t know. We&apos;ll have to wait and see if it happens. If it doesn&apos;t happen, I&apos;ll go back to being the same person I was. If it does, I hope I don&apos;t change. I&apos;ll try and stay away from the attention as much as possible.&quot; Forget that one. It is a hope as forlorn as expecting fans to forget Henman. Murray&apos;s mother Judy said, in a Twitter message on Friday, &quot;A rather elderly lady has just stopped me and said &apos;We are praying that Tim will win.&apos; Clearly been out in the sun too long.&quot; Mrs Murray, and all those whom her son has held in the palm of his sweating hands for so long, should prepare for a little celebrationtomorrow.", "tags": ["Australian Open", "Andy Murray", "Novak Djokovic", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australian Open 2011", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-29T16:22:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/30/goldie-interview-the-alchemist", "sentences": ["When he tells me the story of how he met Mika, in Shanghai, he says: &quot;We were like two 12-year-olds."], "title": "Goldie interview: The alchemist", "article": "Has Goldie ever had an unexpressed thought? I&apos;m not entirely sure. He&apos;s just such a talker. He can talk and talk and talk, and two weeks after interviewing him, he rings me up when I&apos;m in the supermarket, and for reasons that escape me, I agree to accompany him to a darkened basement off Oxford Street where, for the best part of 90 minutes, I feel like I&apos;m about to die. Bikram, the extreme version of yoga, performed in a room heated to more than 100F, is Goldie&apos;s latest enthusiasm, and although I\u00a0do at one point wonder whether I&apos;m having a cardiac episode, I come to understand why he does it: afterwards he&apos;s strangely quiet and calm, like he&apos;s been stunned by a tranquilliser dart. (I&apos;m catatonic, but that&apos;s another story.) It&apos;s a relief, actually, to see that he can sit still, because interviewing him is not unlike spending several hours in the company of a toddler who&apos;s been overdoing the orange squash. When I arrive at his house he tells me he&apos;d been up until 2am the night before, painting, before starting again at 8am; he&apos;s already done the photo shoot and is now showing the awed photographer his trainers collection while simultaneously consulting with Chris, the engineer who works for his record label, Metalheadz, who is waiting patiently to get to work on their latest project, an orchestral arrangement of &quot;Timeless&quot;, the title track from his 1995 debut album. Mika, his wife of a\u00a0year, is in the kitchen baking scones and within 30 seconds of walking through the door, he thrusts one towards me: &quot;Taste that! Isn&apos;t that scontastic!&quot; before whisking me off up the stairs to show me the love letters he wrote to her, a great big box of them, all hand-written and intricately designed. Then it&apos;s back downstairs and into the kitchen, talking all the time, bouncing off the walls practically. &quot;Did you feel comfortable when you arrived here today?&quot; he asks me later. And I did. He can still look pretty menacing with the gold teeth and the tattoos and the bling, but he&apos;s also the perfect host, warm, friendly, generous with the scones (and the trainers \u2013 the photographer leaves with a pair and looks like he might burst with joy) and prone to spontaneous outbursts of hugging. &quot;I can&apos;t believe you ever needed to do drugs,&quot; I say, because he&apos;s 45 now, but in his younger days, hanging out with the likes of Noel Gallagher, he used to &quot;toot for England&quot;. In his case, he says, the drugs literally didn&apos;t work. &quot;They had a polarising effect. Cocaine would make me go very quiet and into myself.&quot; These days, Goldie says, he has just &quot;one vice left&quot; \u2013 he smokes \u2013 and for the most part lives quietly in a small village in the Hertfordshire commuter belt (just past the golf course, before the church), as unlikely a spot as you could ever think of to find the man who pioneered graffiti art in the UK and was one of the founding fathers of drum &apos;n&apos; bass. His daughter Chance (&quot;12 going on 26&quot;) lives with him during the week, and although he still flies around the world DJing, he&apos;s also, since the BBC2 series Maestro, in which he learned to conduct an orchestra, reinvented himself as a mainstream television performer, the latest incarnation of which can be seen in a new BBC2 series, Goldie&apos;s Band: By Royal Appointment. According to the BBC, it&apos;s about &quot;the transformative power of music in young people&apos;s lives&quot;, and in it he takes 12 youths aged 17 to 24, matches them up with musical mentors including Soweto Kinch and Cerys Matthews, and after three days of hothousing makes them perform a grand finale at Buckingham Palace in front of Prince Harry. It&apos;s a perfect piece of casting, because if anybody knows what it is to be a\u00a0troubled, directionless teenager, it&apos;s Goldie. &quot;When I think about these kids and look at them it&apos;s like a clock turning back,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s like looking in a mirror and having all these reflections of all these young kids. And I also think how fucking lucky that I am, how blessed that I am to be in this position.&quot; THIS ISN&apos;T HYPERBOLE. He was born Clifford Joseph Price in Walsall; his mother, Margaret, was a Scottish pub singer, and his father, Clement, an itinerant Jamaican, disappeared shortly after he was born. When he was three his mother put him into care, while his half-brothers remained at home. For the rest of his childhood he was bounced between foster carers and children&apos;s homes as, he says, &quot;this kid, Cliff, who no one paid much attention to&quot;. He could barely remember his mother, nor did he have any contact with her. &quot;But I knew what she smelled like. And I remember down to the day when the social worker came to take me away. Me and my brother rolled down this hill on a trolley, all the way to the bottom and we fell off and were laughing, and then we went back up the hill, and this car pulled up and a woman got out with a guy and they took me away.&quot; The fact he has such a vivid recall for events in his childhood \u2013 the smells and the sounds of it \u2013 and is able to conjure it up, decades on, means it&apos;s really not a stretch to empathise with the kids in the programme, whose lives, he believes, will be changed by the experience. &quot;It&apos;s like the opposite of the X Factor,&quot; he says. &quot;Think about the people who aren&apos;t making it on there. Think about how dysfunctional they feel, how failed they feel, a\u00a0panel of people going: &apos;Sorry, you&apos;re going to fail.&apos; I find it quite crushing. I can&apos;t watch it. I\u00a0actually physically want to vomit. It&apos;s a circus. Simon Cowell is the George Bush of the music industry. &quot;He doesn&apos;t know fuck all about music, I&apos;ll tell you that for a fact,&quot; he continues. &quot;I&apos;d rather sit down and have dinner with that guy from Korea, what&apos;s his name?&quot; &quot;Kim Jong-il?&quot; &quot;With Kim Jong-il. I&apos;d rather have dinner with him. I find the whole thing like the Nuremberg Rallies.&quot;     Goldie (right) with his Supreme Graffiti Team in 1985.  Photograph: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/Martin Jones    But then if Goldie is sensitive to the idea of kids being treated like failures, it&apos;s hardly surprising. Outcomes for children brought up in care are unremittingly bleak, and there was nobody in his life who expected anything of him, who thought he&apos;d ever amount to anything. Apart from one lone art teacher. &quot;In the programme we go back and I surprise him at his retirement party. It was such a poignant moment. It was the first time I&apos;d seen him since I was a teenager. He was completely in shock, and I just burst into tears. I felt you just need that one person. That one person who goes: &apos;C&apos;mon, man.&apos;&quot; It was because of that teacher that he got into art and because of art that he discovered graffiti and because of graffiti that he got into drum &apos;n&apos; bass and went on to have a major hit with his first album, and then founded his record label, Metalheadz. There was a time in the 1990s when he was on the cover of every magazine, he dated Naomi Campbell, was engaged to Bj\u00f6rk, played a Bond villain in The World is Not Enough and appeared in Guy Ritchie&apos;s Snatch. It all dates back to when he was 16 and ran away from the children&apos;s home to live with his mother on a high-rise estate in Walsall; by the time he was 17, he&apos;d become one of the most accomplished graffiti artists in the UK, covering the walls of his estate with 60 different murals. There&apos;s a curious circularity at work in his latest show, because it was a Channel 4 documentary made when he was still a teenager that had a profound and lasting effect upon his life. Bombin&apos;, a film by Dick Fontaine, brought some of the Bronx-based pioneers of hip hop, a culture that went on to conquer the world, to the UK, including the influential street artist Brim Fuentes, and then took a group which included Goldie and 3D (who went on to form Massive Attack) to New York. Brim became Goldie&apos;s artistic mentor, New York was the place that lifted his horizons, and America was where he would later become &quot;Goldie&quot;. What&apos;s more, the cameraman on the documentary, Gus Corral, became a substitute father figure: at one stage Goldie ended up living with him for several years. There&apos;s a record of all this: look on YouTube and you can find a rather sweet and sensitive-looking Clifford Price, age 16, holding a spray can and being interviewed on Pebble Mill. &quot;But is it art?&quot; the reporter asks him. &quot;Or is it vandalism?&quot; Then there he is, aged 17, on Bombin&apos;, still quiet and softly spoken and very obviously in awe of Brim and co. Fast forward 15 years and he shows up in another Channel 4 documentary, The Saturn Returnz, in which, at the height of his drum &apos;n&apos; bass fame, he goes in search of his roots.     Goldie with ex-fianc\u00e9e Bjork in 1996.  Photograph: Arlene Richie/Landmark Media    &quot;I was talking to [Goldie&apos;s Band director] Craig Blackhurst and he said to me: &apos;Has it ever occurred to you that your life has been like a reality TV show?&apos; And I said: &apos;How do you mean?&apos; And he said: &apos;Your life has been like The Truman Show.&apos; From the age of three, my life has been documented by social workers. There&apos;s a file somewhere in Walsall Social Services saying: &apos;He was a bit difficult today; he was trying to find out about his parents.&apos; Or: &apos;He locked himself in his room and is collecting beer mats.&apos;&quot; There is something slightly The Lives of Others about how his life has been officially recorded, and the documentaries themselves make compelling viewing. In The Saturn Returnz, he&apos;s a\u00a0grown man, 33 years of age, but watching him find his father in Miami and ask him about why he abandoned him, he looks like a\u00a0bewildered adolescent. In another sequence he goes and visits one of his foster carers, Mrs Newell, with whom he lived for three years. &quot;What went wrong?&quot; he asks her. &quot;You hated women,&quot; she says matter-of-factly. It was an epiphanic moment, he says. &quot;It was like this big bell in my head just went: &apos;Gong!&apos; And suddenly everything made sense.&quot; He had to leave Mrs Newell&apos;s because &quot;you started on Rita&quot;, her adopted daughter. &quot;I drove her mad,&quot; he says. &quot;She couldn&apos;t breathe. This thing appeared in her throat and she had to go and have an operation on it. I&apos;d just whisper, whisper, whisper at her.&quot; But then it was during this period, he tells me, that other stuff happened, too. It&apos;s not something he&apos;s ever talked about before, that he didn&apos;t even acknowledge to himself until a\u00a0few years ago, when he was in therapy at the Hoffman Institute, but between the ages of 10 and 12 he was sexually abused by an older girl. &quot;I think, in this awful Freudian way, that when this abuse was going on, I just wanted to be loved. I felt like I was climbing up inside her vagina, trying to get back into the belly. I\u00a0remember pubic hairs being stuck in my teeth. I know it&apos;s gross. That&apos;s gross, right? And afterwards, I remember suckling her breast, and then when she sent me away, I felt completely rejected. It was fucking awful, when I\u00a0think about it.&quot;     Goldie's son Jamie Price, 23, who was sentenced last September to life in prison for the gang murder of a disabled man. Photograph: West Midlands Police/PA    In spite of everything, he believes he was better off in care. Jo-Jo, the half-brother who stayed with his mother, &quot;does nothing&quot;. And Melvin, the other half-brother? &quot;Nothing.&quot; Although this is an improvement on when Melvin was doing something, namely armed robbery, for which he did various stints in jail. Goldie found a different outlet. &quot;I honestly believe art and music saved me,&quot; he says. &quot;Art and music saved my life. I am blessed.&quot; SADLY, IT COULDN&apos;T SAVE HIS SON. Last September, Jamie Price was jailed for life for stabbing and killing a rival gang member outside a Wolverhampton nightclub. It&apos;s incredibly difficult trying to get the story about Jamie&apos;s childhood straight. Goldie has had four children by four different women: &quot;We all ended up banging this bird one night, and my lucky number came up.&quot; And while there&apos;s no doubt that he&apos;s an attentive father to Chance, who&apos;s at a private girl&apos;s school down the road, it doesn&apos;t sound like he&apos;s played the biggest of roles in his older sons&apos; upbringing. Jamie was his second son by his then girlfriend Michelle, who he describes as &quot;my first love&quot;. Nine weeks after Jamie was born, &quot;Melvin [Goldie&apos;s brother] fucked her. There was nothing I could do. I just left to go to America. He was the guy who everyone was scared of. I&apos;d come back and found my family and then got fucked over by them again.&quot; He had little contact with Jamie as a child. &quot;They wouldn&apos;t let me. And then when he came of age, I said: &apos;Come and stay with me&apos;, and he came down here and stayed here, and I was trying to replace the lost years. But it just wouldn&apos;t stick. He started stealing. He took a\u00a0car and crashed it and lied blatantly. And I\u00a0said: &apos;That&apos;s it; it&apos;s time for you to go. I&apos;ve tried.&apos; And then I\u00a0let him back in again. I got him back here and he started doing the same thing. I told him: &apos;You have to be responsible for your actions.&apos;&quot; &quot;Some people would say the same, though, of the parents,&quot; I say. &quot;That you have to take responsibility for your children.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m bearing responsibility. But look: when they&apos;re young and they kick the ball next door and break the window, you go round and apologise. When they get to a certain age, they&apos;ve got to be responsible for the window that they&apos;ve broken. He rang me last week and apologised. And I said: &apos;Thank you, son, but you don&apos;t need to be sorry to me. You need to look inside yourself. Don&apos;t be sorry for me. Be sorry for that mother who woke up without a kid.&apos;&quot; One of the saddest things, I think, is that Goldie has the wit and talent to engage with street culture intelligently; to take the best parts and do something interesting with it, and ultimately he has brought it to a wider audience. Whereas Jamie engaged with street culture, too, but was simply seduced by the macho violence of it. &quot;I sat with my daughter Chance and I made her read the story about Jamie, and she was in fucking bits,&quot; Goldie says. &quot;And people can say that&apos;s cruel, but she&apos;d already heard about it. And I told her: &apos;That&apos;s what happens when you throw your life away.&apos;&quot; Goldie managed to escape the streets and the casual gang violence of his youth. His life is stable now, he says \u2013 and Mika, a designer, who&apos;s half-Japanese and grew up in Canada, seems to be as smart and sensible as they come \u2013 but it&apos;s taken him an awfully long time to get here. &quot;I had so much anger. So much anger. Particularly towards my mother. I was a really, really angry person, and it was ruining me.&quot; &quot;A lot of people would say that you had a lot to be angry about,&quot; I say. &quot;The thing is that it&apos;s all about empathy. I\u00a0thought: I&apos;ve just got to find empathy. Because I went through all these things, but so did she. And I love her. I love her in a different way from someone who grew up with her. I love her in a\u00a0certain way. It&apos;s an understanding.&quot; HIS MOTHER WAS HERE, staying with him a month ago, in this house, and it seems as if he&apos;s finally managed to bring all the parts of his life together. &quot;Your house,&quot; I say, &quot;reminds me of the kind of house a child would draw: it&apos;s square and solid, with a red door right in the middle of it and a pointed roof.&quot;     Goldie as Bond villain Bullion in The World is Not Enough. Photograph: Allstar/United Artists    &quot;You know, you&apos;re the first person who&apos;s said that. But it&apos;s exactly that.&quot; &quot;Is this the kind of family house you dreamed of as a child?&quot; &quot;It is. I wanted a happy home somewhere in the countryside. Somewhere I could play. And I&apos;ve kind of created that.&quot; At another point Goldie says he wanted somewhere &quot;to grow up&quot;. Growing up the first time around, without a mother or a father, in an institution, perpetually the new boy at a\u00a0new school, was so painful that he seems to be doing it all over again. When he tells me the story of how he met Mika, in Shanghai, he says: &quot;We were like two 12-year-olds. We were literally 12 for the next six months.&quot; &quot;Do you think you were having your adolescence again, but having it properly? &quot; &quot;Yes! I&apos;d never thought of it like that. But that&apos;s exactly what it was. It was like me finally getting to grow, healthily. We did the courtship, the whole six months, and then she came to London, and we still didn&apos;t sleep together.&quot; Really? Is this really the same Goldie who once told an interviewer that he&apos;d lost count of the number of women he&apos;d slept with? &quot;Yeah really, swear to God. And then she came back again, and it was like: this is going to be awkward, let&apos;s just get it out the way. And we did it and we were like: &apos;There&apos;s all this gooey stuff!&apos; We were like kids. It was so teenage. I&apos;d never had that. I&apos;d never had a real relationship.&quot; He&apos;s so open, Goldie, guileless in so many ways and when I say that to him, he says: &quot;The part of me you don&apos;t know is the part of me that hasn&apos;t happened yet.&quot; He did Celebrity Come Dine With Me recently, &quot;and they were saying to me: &apos;You&apos;re supposed to have your TV version of you and then you have your other version&apos;&quot;. &quot;That&apos;s what celebs do!&quot; I say. &quot;Don&apos;t you even know that?&quot; &quot;There&apos;s only one version. There&apos;s only me.&quot; &quot;Maybe it&apos;s because you have never had privacy,&quot; I say. &quot;I know. That&apos;s what I&apos;m learning now with Mika. We have our own language, and it&apos;s ours. It&apos;s us.&quot; It seems like finally, perhaps, Goldie&apos;s very own Truman Show might just be over.

I was talking to my classmate Jacob as we got changed to play cricket. Jacob was a weird kid. He had longer hair than the school rules allowed. He smelled funny and had peculiar facts at his disposal, to do with ancient languages and the sexual habits of dinosaurs. He made no secret of his scorn for cricket. He was, it goes without saying, not popular. I was telling him about the cosmic greatness of The Lord of the Rings, a book which at that point I considered the alpha and omega of world literature. &quot;It&apos;s good,&quot; Jacob allowed. &quot;But have you read Dune?&quot; I&apos;d never even heard of Frank Herbert, or his saga of rebellion on a desert planet. Jacob mentioned a couple of other writers, both unknown to me. &quot;You should go to Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed,&quot; he said. I was impressed. That was the name of a place? A shop, Jacob said, specialising in science fiction. Books and comics, fanzines. It was named, he told me, with the air of someone imparting vital knowledge, after a short story by Ray Bradbury. I don&apos;t know how long it was before I found my way to Dark They Were. At weekends I was allowed to take the tube up to central London, where I&apos;d wander round the British Museum or the trashy souvenir shops on the Tottenham Court Road. But I did find it, in an alley off Wardour Street. I have only the vaguest memory of what it was like, overlayed by other memories of the many such places I&apos;ve been in since \u2013 the grimy floor, the racks of publications, the supercilious staff, always ready with an acid remark or an eye-roll to show a prepubescent newbie his lowly place on the ladder of fandom. Almost certainly I didn&apos;t buy anything. I expect I self-consciously perused the shelves, made mental Christmas present notes, then left. It was my first experience of a subculture. I was hooked, not just by the content, but by the realisation there was stuff out there being made and thought and done that wasn&apos;t visible on the TV screens of suburban Essex. As I got older I became a kind of subcultural junkie, foraging around in music, street fashion and eventually art, politics and the freakier reaches of the internet, hunting the next discovery, the next seam of underground gold. But in my early teens, science fiction and fantasy had an almost-total hold over my imagination. Their outcast status was part of their appeal. The cool kids held them in disdain. It was territory I could own. When I wasn&apos;t reading about alternate realities I was trying to live inside one, playing Dungeons and Dragons or Traveller or Call of Cthulhu or Bushido, games that allowed me to inhabit ancient Japan or deep space or various arcane fantasy worlds. Most of my books came from charity shops or the Whipps Cross Hospital f\u00eate, where my dad \u2013 who as a doctor was expected to put his hand in his pocket on such occasions \u2013 would give me pound notes to convert into teetering piles of paperbacks. There was something so much more interesting about these books, fished out of crates and cardboard boxes, than the ones in the library, let alone the expensive, sensible fare which seemed to be on sale in ordinary bookshops. They were musty-smelling 10p messages from the futuristic past, complete with cover designs (and content) that were unlike anything I&apos;d seen before. I&apos;m fairly certain that this was how I first came across Michael Moorcock, in an early-70s Mayflower paperback, with a psychedelic cover by Bob Haberfield. Soon I was combing London for these editions, which I&apos;ve carried through numerous house-moves, keeping them even after I ditched the majority of my SF and fantasy collection in favour of student bookshelf-adornments intended to attract potential sexual partners. That first crucial title could well have been Moorcock&apos;s 1968 novel The Final Programme. Haberfield&apos;s cover for this is one part Bosch, one part pop-art and one part Tibetan tantra. A naked woman, hair in flames, lies in a kind of amniotic ocean, her breasts rising up with architectural impressiveness. From her open mouth pours a carnivalesque stream of figures \u2013 rock musicians, ringmasters, rapists and murderers, businessmen, freaks and addicts of all kinds. She&apos;s flanked by twin skeletons, a pope and a king. Behind her some kind of skyscraper is shattering under the influence of beams of cosmic energy. The writing behind this cover was itself an orgiastic riot, featuring the adventures of one Jerry Cornelius, a hipster secret agent in swinging London, who seemed to jump into bed with men and women, and who appeared, shockingly, to be aware of himself as a character in a novel. As far as I could follow the plot, it concerned Cornelius&apos;s attempt to rescue his brother from some kind of peril, but then diverted into something really weird, involving Cornelius being fused in mystical union with an evil sexpot called Miss Brunner, from which he emerged as a hermaphrodite, the world&apos;s &quot;first all-purpose human being&quot;. The Lord of the Rings it wasn&apos;t. In retrospect, it&apos;s easy to place The Final Programme as a product of the same culture (and period) that spawned Gravity&apos;s Rainbow, Trout Fishing in America, Giles Goat-Boy and The Atrocity Exhibition \u2013 part of the headspace opened up by the associative riffs and &quot;routines&quot; of William Burroughs&apos;s The Naked Lunch. But at the age of 12, this was my first clue that anything like it even existed. It blew (as they say) my tiny mind. Through Moorcock I was introduced to a whole set of countercultural possibilities, as well as to the idea that writing didn&apos;t have to conform to \u2013 well, to anything really. I soon discovered that the Cornelius novels were only a tiny corner of Moorcock&apos;s sprawling oeuvre. There seemed to be innumerable books, most of them with some kind of fantastical setting, often featuring heroes with names that appeared to echo Cornelius \u2013 Jherek Carnelian, Erekose, Elric, Corum. There were books that were straightforward genre works, books which fused, pastiched or even created genres (his 1971 novel Warlord of the Air, with its alternate-world Edwardian setting, can lay claim to being the first steampunk novel) and books that belonged to no genre at all. The quality varied \u2013 I later found out that Moorcock was capable of writing 15,000 words a day and had produced some of his slighter works in as little as three days. Other books are high literature. The Dancers at the End of Time trilogy is one of the great postwar English fantasies. In 1977 The Condition of Muzak was awarded the Guardian Fiction prize, and Mother London, an intricate and affecting love letter to the city, was shortlisted for the 1988 Whitbread award. Moorcock&apos;s biography reads like a rebuke to every wannabe novelist who&apos;s pottering through a creative writing MFA. At 16 he got a job editing Tarzan Adventures, moving on to write pulp detective fiction for Fleetway&apos;s Sexton Blake Library. His first novel was published in 1961, when he was 23, by which time he was already a veteran writer. In 1963 he became editor of New Worlds magazine, using it to transform science fiction, moving the genre away from the &quot;golden age&quot; of rayguns and spaceships towards a concern with psychology, the mass media and altered states of consciousness. By the late 60s he was a pivotal figure in London&apos;s underground scene, a point of contact between science fiction novelists such as JG Ballard and Brian Aldiss and the musicians and artists who were transforming British pop culture. He became a lyricist and occasional performer with the west London psychedelic band Hawkwind, while in New Worlds he was publishing writers such as Thomas Pynchon, Christopher Logue and George Macbeth alongside Ballard, Harlan Ellison, Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer and M John Harrison. Since the New Worlds days he has carried on writing at a furious pace, weaving an ever more complex web of novels and stories, filled with associations, refractions and knowing references, a delightful maze for his fans and a source of perplexity for bibliographers. This prolific, promiscuous output is perhaps one reason he&apos;s not accorded the status he deserves in the postwar canon of English literature. Unlike his friend Ballard, whose reputation has been transformed in recent years, Moorcock remains something of an outsider, regarded with trepidation (if he&apos;s known at all) by a literary establishment that prefers clear blue water between literature and genre writing. These days Moorcock lives in Texas, in the town of Bastrop, just outside Austin. It&apos;s always a risk to meet one&apos;s heroes, and a small Texas town seemed an inhospitable spot for a writer who, throughout all his multifarious work, has retained a specifically English sensibility. Mummery, the knowingly named central character of Mother London (who shares much biographical information with his creator), says &quot;London is my mother, source of most of my ambivalences and most of my loyalties.&quot; I wondered if I would find a writer in exile, or adrift. Instead, I discover Moorcock with his feet up in the den of a charming Victorian house, surrounded by books, cats and a clutter of antique furniture. He is tall, impressively bearded, though less Falstaffian than some of his publicity photos. Why did he and his wife move to Texas? &quot;We&apos;d lived in England for 15 years, and Linda was sick of it. She used to get shit all the time just for being American. I didn&apos;t want to live somewhere that was an enclave of the British abroad. I thought: where am I going to get the most experience and hear what people really think?&quot; I ask how he came to be an editor at such a young age. &quot;I&apos;d started doing fanzines from the age of nine. I&apos;d been doing as many copies as you can get carbon paper into an upright typewriter and I&apos;d try to sell them at school.&quot; He was a fan of school stories, particularly PG Wodehouse, and when he ran out of stories in book form he started buying old magazines from dealers, eventually coming into contact with a fan subculture, much as I did many years later. &quot;If you were interested in popular fiction, the only place where it was discussed at all was in fanzines. It gradually put you in touch with other people. It was like a very slow-working internet.&quot; These old-fashioned stories must have been remote from his own school experience. &quot;Oh, totally. I was expelled from a Rudolf Steiner school. I was the only person ever expelled until quite recently. I kept running away. Looking back it was pure separation anxiety. My father had buggered off at a very early age. I had this funny family. At one end they were breeding dogs in south-east London \u2013 for greyhound racing \u2013 and at the other my uncle was living in Downing Street. And I would actually go to Downing Street, which didn&apos;t strike me as funny. I&apos;d get on the number 15 bus.&quot; Moorcock then tells an anecdote about this uncle who&apos;d been Winston Churchill&apos;s secretary and served a succession of prime ministers. It&apos;s a piece of back story he gives to Mummery in Mother London. Throughout our conversation there&apos;s a kind of free-associative drift, as one thing tumbles into another. Biography melds with fiction. It&apos;s a quality one also finds in Moorcock&apos;s work. As he published at breakneck pace during the 1970s, he came up with the notion of the &quot;multiverse&quot;, a kaleidoscope of interconnected parallel realities. His various fictional heroes all became avatars of a single hero, the &quot;Eternal Champion&quot; who struggles for the cosmic balance between Law and Chaos. This metaphysics is sometimes explicit in his novels, often not. Moorcock soon invited other writers to set stories in his worlds, a cheerful openness which is one of his salient characteristics. Moorcock&apos;s &quot;funny family&quot; gave him an outsider&apos;s perspective on postwar England. He was a rebellious teenager, something he thinks of as a family trait. &quot;I really did have a very egalitarian upbringing.&quot; At Fleetway, the publisher of the Eagle, Look and Learn and innumerable cowboy, detective and superhero comics, Moorcock&apos;s anti-authoritarian streak continued. Violent second world war stories were a mainstay of Fleetway&apos;s output, featuring square-jawed Tommies bayoneting craven Germans while snarling xenophobic insults. When Moorcock refused to write for these titles, &quot;they decided I was a communist. But the boss of my department wouldn&apos;t fire me, because he was convinced the Red Army was going to come marching up Fleet Street any minute, and there I&apos;d be with my Makarov pistol and my rimless glasses, lining people up to be shot. They kept me on as a kind of insurance.&quot; Another Fleetway executive was &quot;a raging fascist&quot;, an ex-member of Mosley&apos;s blackshirts. Moorcock, who was a member of the West London Anti-fascist Youth Committee, once found him closeted in his office, drawing a world map to illustrate a proposed racial resettlement plan. The British got all of Africa. During this time, Moorcock also infiltrated Colin Jordan&apos;s British National party, posing as a young recruit and going for tea with the elderly widow of Arnold Leese, an infamous far-right politician who regarded his rival Mosley as a &quot;kosher fascist&quot;. &quot;It was a bit like The Man Who Was Thursday. There were three of us who&apos;d go and see her and we were all infiltrators. Not one of us was an actual follower. She&apos;d pour out the tea and say &apos;you know the Jews did so and so&apos; and we&apos;d pretend to agree with her.&quot; Moorcock has an initially perplexing relationship to literary Englishness. On the one hand, he&apos;s steeped in the conservative canon of popular fiction, from the boarding-school stories he loved as a child to the various upright chaps \u2013 from Sexton Blake to world war one flying aces \u2013 he channelled for Fleetway. On the other, he has a strong anarchist streak and is deeply hostile to the Christian pastoral fantasy tradition of JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis. His own fantasy writing has always delighted in ambiguity, in contrast to the nursery-school morality of much of the genre. In a 1978 essay he skewered The Lord of the Rings, calling it &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh, posing as an epic.&quot; He derided Tolkien&apos;s &quot;petit bourgeois&quot; artisan-hobbits, who are portrayed in the novel as a &quot;bulwark against chaos&quot;, standing for &quot;solid good sense&quot; against the evil industrial-worker orcs. Tolkien&apos;s work, he writes, is nothing more than &quot;a pernicious confirmation of the values of a morally bankrupt middle class&quot;, something not so far from the fascism he had agitated against as a young activist. Against Tolkien, Moorcock has always championed the work of Mervyn Peake, whose Gormenghast books were informed by his experience as one of the first civilians to enter the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen. Peake&apos;s work is shot through with an uncanny darkness, a tone which Moorcock (who as a young man was a friend of Peake) often adopts. I ask him why he dislikes Tolkien and the Inklings so much. &quot;It would be the same if we were talking about Warwick Deeping or RC Sherriff. It&apos;s the British character sentimentalised, the illusion of decency, that whole nonsense of &apos;no British boy would do this sort of thing&apos;. It was also the tone of the BBC when I was growing up. I hated it.&quot; In contrast to the rural decencies of Tolkien, Moorcock&apos;s writing belongs to an urban tradition, which celebrates the fantastical city as a place of chance and mystery. The wondrous spaces of M John Harrison, China Mi\u00e9ville, Fritz Leiber, Gene Wolfe and Alan Moore are all part of this, as are Iain Sinclair&apos;s London, Judge Dredd&apos;s Mega-City One, the part-virtual cyberpunk mazes of William Gibson and the decadent Paris of the Baudelarian fl\u00e2neur. Like these other urban fantasists, Moorcock delights in a kind of sublime palimpsest, in imagining an environment that through size, age, scale or complexity exceeds our comprehension, producing fear and awe. Crucially, the city isn&apos;t a place of moral clarity. Moorcock&apos;s dislike of authoritarian sentiment has led him in many directions: Jerry Cornelius&apos;s ambiguity is sexual, social and even ontological; one of Moorcock&apos;s most popular heroes, Elric, was written as a rebuke to the bluff, muscular goody-goodies that populate so much fantasy fiction. Elric, a decadent albino weakling, is amoral, perhaps even evil. As a not-so-metaphorical junkie, Elric allowed Moorcock to revel in unwholesomeness, and helped return fantasy to its roots in the late romanticism of the decadents, a literary school close to Moorcock&apos;s heart. In a recent introduction to The Dancers at the End of Time, which is set in a decadent far future, Moorcock claims to have sported Wildean green carnations as a teenager, not to mention &quot;the first pair of Edwardian flared trousers (made by Burton) as well as the first high-button frock coat to be seen in London since 1910&quot;. Elric, much less robust than his creator, who admits his dandyish threads gave him &quot;the bluff domestic air of a Hamburg Zeppelin commander&quot;, is part Maldoror, part Yellow Book poseur and part William Burroughs; within a few years of his first appearance in 1961, British culture suddenly seemed to be producing real-life Elrics by the dozen, as Keith Richards, Jimmy Page and others defined an image of the English rock star as an effeminate, velvet-clad lotus-eater. Moorcock was very popular among musicians, and it&apos;s tempting to see him as co-creator of the butterfly-on-a-wheel character, which still wanders the halls of English culture in guises ranging from Sebastian Horsley to Russell Brand. I ask him whether he felt at the time that the 60s rockers were living out a role he&apos;d imagined. He&apos;s too modest to agree, but tells an anecdote that seems to sum up psychedelic London&apos;s openness to fantasy of all kinds. &quot;I&apos;m in the Mountain grill on the Portobello Road, where everyone used to meet to get on the tour buses. I&apos;m sitting there, and this bloke called Geronimo is trying to sell me some dope. He says &apos;have you heard about the tunnel under Ladbroke Grove?&apos;. He starts to elaborate, about how it&apos;s under the Poor Clares nunnery, and you can go into that and come out in an entirely different world. I said to him, &apos;Geronimo, I think I wrote that&apos;. It didn&apos;t seem to bother him much.&quot; Younger than most of the writers who were remaking postwar British science fiction, Moorcock acted as an important conduit between the SF chaps (still, judging by contemporary pictures, pipe-smoking collar-and-tie types) and the denizens of the music and art scenes. &quot;At first I was the only one,&quot; he says. &quot;Then the people who worked on New Worlds started coming in. They shared the lifestyle. When I first met Tom Disch, he&apos;d got stuck in Spain because he contracted hepatitis from taking bad acid. Soon all of the really good writers on New Worlds apart from Jimmy [Ballard] and Brian [Aldiss] had basically had the same cultural experience as I did.&quot; Moorcock&apos;s good friend Ballard was reluctant to leave his suburban lair in Shepperton, and relied on Moorcock to introduce him to people and experiences useful for his fiction. In the early 80s, when Moorcock was living in LA, he wrote Ballard a series of long descriptive letters about the city, which were later published as Letters from Hollywood. &quot;I was,&quot; Moorcock says, &quot;his running-boy for experience.&quot; In the late-60s west London melting-pot, it was Moorcock who introduced Ballard to pop artists such as Eduardo Paolozzi and who brokered uneasy meetings between his whisky-drinking, socially-awkward friend and loon-panted extroverts like Hawkwind&apos;s Nik Turner, who had a predilection for make-up, strong drugs and ancient Egyptian stage outfits. Occasionally, Ballard would &quot;dip in&quot; to the scene, with mixed results. &quot;I got Jimmy some acid one time,&quot; Moorcock reminisces, with a grimace. &quot;He insisted. I got him a sugar cube and I said to him &apos;don&apos;t take it now&apos; because he was as drunk as a skunk. And of course, being Jimmy, he took it immediately. Appalling, psychotic \u2013 snakes all over the bed. Everything bad about Shanghai on top of everything bad about everything else. He didn&apos;t describe this. His girlfriend at the time told me about it. She was basically saying, for God&apos;s sake don&apos;t give him any more. And I didn&apos;t. It would have been a waste.&quot; The friendship between Ballard and Moorcock \u2013 two writers with overlapping but extremely different styles and concerns \u2013 is gradually emerging as one of the most important in the literary underground of late 60s and early 70s London. At a time when English fiction was dominated by well-crafted realism, the two of them were on a mission to revitalise it (or undermine it, depending on your point of view) through the medium of SF, which as the most despised of all literary genres, was also the most open to experiment. &quot;Jimmy did it from the point of view of surrealism, which was his great love, and I did it from absurdism, which was mine.&quot; Moorcock evidently has some difficulty with the post-mortem transformation of his old friend into a kind of cultural plaster saint. &quot;It&apos;s a pretty strange thing to see a friend turn into \u2013 he was somebody pretty different to the image the world&apos;s got.&quot; Moorcock&apos;s Ballard is a much darker and more damaged figure than the public image of the widowed father, dreaming his fantastical dreams between the morning and afternoon school runs. &quot;We were estranged for some time because of his treatment of women. I got sick of it. When I finally said something, this being Jimmy, he withdrew completely \u2013 bingo, I wasn&apos;t there any more.&quot; Much of Ballard&apos;s bad behaviour was related to his drinking, and it&apos;s evident that Moorcock feels he would have been better off with less scotch and more pot. However, &quot;he did come out of it. He eventually emerged on the other side. I have to say that most of his best writing was done during this particular period, when he was incredibly miserable.&quot; Moorcock steered New Worlds towards a set of concerns that chimed with the times; this was the period ruled by Marshal McLuhan and RD Laing, and the exploration of &quot;inner space&quot; seemed just as interesting as the &quot;outer space&quot; of satellites and moonshots. This turn was controversial, not just with die-hard pulp fans, but, surprisingly, with people such as the pop artist Richard Hamilton, another denizen of the London scene. &quot;He thought we were turning science fiction into something namby-pamby, losing its roots,&quot; Moorcock says. &quot;He wanted explosions and spaceships and robots.&quot; It also led to censorship troubles, as WH Smith refused to distribute the title, claiming that it was pornographic. The controversy eventually led to a question being asked in the House of Commons, concerning New Worlds&apos;s receipt of a small Arts Council grant. Moorcock considers it all rank hypocrisy, noting that at the time Smiths was perfectly happy to distribute actual soft porn. New Worlds was one of the few venues that brought experimental writing to a large audience. Many of the writers Moorcock was commissioning hadn&apos;t written science fiction before, and he also encouraged veteran SF writers to strip their stories of genre elements which they&apos;d included so conventional SF magazines would buy their work. There was a remarkable overlap with Ambit, the small-circulation literary magazine for which Ballard was fiction editor. Moorcock remembers parties where William Burroughs would be in the same room as Arthur C Clarke, not a combination that usually springs to mind. But Moorcock wanted New Worlds to be a commercial magazine and was scornful of the attempts of Ambit&apos;s high-cultural coterie to keep up with the rapid changes in the underground scene. &quot;It was like the mums and dads getting really enthusiastic about what their kids were into.&quot; He remembers being invited to UEA, where Malcolm Bradbury&apos;s crowd would pump him for news. &quot;I was like the barbarian, the vital outsider. I should have been playing a banjo.&quot; The literary culture in which Moorcock, Ballard and their peers could make a living from magazine serialisations seems as distant now, in the era of the internet, as the Grub Street of the 18th century to which it bears a more than passing resemblance. I ask Moorcock about his famous 15,000 daily word-rate. How on earth is it possible to produce so much? &quot;It&apos;s all planning. I&apos;d have been in bed for three days, during which I&apos;ve had time to sketch out the story. Then I spring out of bed and I&apos;ve got a straight nine to five \u2013 or nine to six or seven \u2013 regime, which frequently includes taking the kids to school, then I just sit down and go through with an hour break for lunch.&quot; He makes it sound deceptively simple, though not without its side-effects. &quot;When you write that fast the book really does start to write you, you get high on the book. It&apos;s partly lack of sleep, it&apos;s partly the sugar \u2013 in my case I only had strong black coffee because it kept me going.&quot; Apart from stimulants, the other key is &quot;formula. You have to have a formula that&apos;s absolutely strong enough to hold anything. That&apos;s where people like me are very fortunate. I have a kind of innate sense of structure, which also makes me a good mimic. It&apos;s very close to mathematics. When I wrote a computer game a few years ago, it was in some ways the easiest job I&apos;d ever had because it&apos;s all structure, and the guys know it has to be. If you&apos;re talking to a Hollywood person they never know what they&apos;re doing structurally. They ask for changes and everything falls apart, but computer game people are just perfect because they know the purpose of every element.&quot; After the manic productivity of the 60s and 70s, Moorcock slowed down (slightly) during the 80s and 90s, producing increasingly literary and complex picaresques, such as the tetralogy featuring Captain Pyat, an anti-hero whose peregrinations through the 20th century take him from the Russian revolution to a flat on the Portobello Road, where he tells his unlikely tale to a writer called Moorcock. However, despite productions like the Pyat books, which are maximalist fables of the type that have made global stars out of Pynchon or Rushdie, Moorcock has never shown any interest in eschewing genre. He seems to see little difference between his various kinds of production. I ask what he&apos;s working on now and he begins to frown, saying it&apos;s the hardest thing he&apos;s done for a while. &quot;It&apos;s not easy. And I didn&apos;t start it for a long time. It&apos;s their fault. They didn&apos;t send me a contract for ages. I can&apos;t write without a contract \u2013 old habit.&quot; Winningly, this turned out to be not some literary project, but a Doctor Who novel. Elements of Moorcock&apos;s multiverse have been incorporated by other writers into Doctor Who stories. Moorcock blends the two things together, adding yet another layer of complexity to his oeuvre. The plot of The Coming of the Terraphiles finds the Doctor &quot;abroad in the multiverse&quot;, and concerns &quot;an object which will save it, putting Law and Chaos back into synch. I&apos;ve tried to write much of it in a sub-Wodehousian style and with a musical comedy sub-plot involving a game that&apos;s a mixture of cricket and archery.&quot; In its skewed, carnivalesque Englishness, this sounds like vintage Moorcock. I note that the book includes a pirate called Cornelius. &quot;Yes, and incidentally one of the &apos;decent chaps&apos; is called Hari Agincourt. He&apos;s not a prince but he ends up an earl. Damn. It&apos;s all supposed to be embargoed. Now they&apos;ll probably have to kill us both.&quot;", "tags": ["Science fiction", "Culture", "Books", "Michael Moorcock", "Hari Kunzru"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-04T12:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/04/china-green-growth-boom-industry", "sentences": ["Cities including Shanghai and Beijing have begun restricting car ownership.", "In Shanghai there is no more land available for development."], "title": "China plots course for green growth amid a boom built on dirty industry", "article": "Whisper it, but could China be about to turn an environmental corner after more than three decades of filthy economic growth? Hopes for a cleaner future are rising ahead of a national blueprint to tackle pollution, waste and champion renewable technology. The five-year plan, due in March, is being hailed as the greenest strategy document in the country&apos;s history. Sceptics warn that one environmental threat \u2013 industrial pollution \u2013 may be replaced by another \u2013 excess consumption. The five-year economic plan, once an arcane exercise in communist fiat, has big implications for the outside world. It could affect the colour of the sky, the planet&apos;s temperature and the welfare of billions of people beyond the jurisdiction of the country&apos;s mandarins. An army of cadres, officials and academics have spent years laying groundwork for the plan \u2013 the 12th since Mao Zedong started Soviet-style strategising in 1953. They have one of the world&apos;s most ambitious administrative tasks: plotting a course for a continent-sized nation, a 1.4 billion population and a $5 trillion economy that is growing at double-digit speed every year. It has never been more important to the global environment. China is the world&apos;s biggest greenhouse gas emitter, number one energy user and arguably the most polluted nation on earth. The International Energy Agency noted that Europe&apos;s plan to extend 1990-2020 carbon dioxide cuts from 20% to 30% would equal only two weeks of China&apos;s emissions. The final document will include measures to curb pollution, promote clean technology and initiate an environment tax, the Guardian understands. &quot;The environment tax is going to happen. This is evident in the proposals for the next five-year plan,&quot; said Ma Zhong director of the school of environment and national resources at Renmin University. &quot;It is likely to be levied nationwide, but there is also a possibility it will initially be introduced in selected regions.&quot; Other radical measures still under discussion include a possible cap on energy use and a shift away from GDP-based performance evaluation, academics and government advisers say. Hu Angang, economics professor at Tsinghua University and a consultant on the plan, said he advised the government to set a cap on energy consumption, to influence when China&apos;s emissions might peak. With existing targets, this is not likely before 2030, by when carbon dioxide output will have more than doubled. Hu is pressing for more rapid reductions. &quot;For the first time, we will see a new model pioneered by a country that is not yet developed. This is a historical, critical change,&quot; he said. &quot;The new five-year plan is an opportunity for China to lead the green revolution, which will de-link growth and carbon dioxide emissions.&quot; It is far from certain his radical proposal will be adopted, though several NGOs and international institutions said the suggestion has had surprising traction. The five-year plan will see a growth in both black and green power consumption. Even as coal use rises, Beijing will blaze further along the trail towards a low-carbon economy. Its wind power generating capacity has doubled annually for four years and in 2010 became yet another field in which China surpassed the US to become number one. Seven of the planet&apos;s top 10 solar panel makers are now Chinese. The focus in future is likely to be nuclear energy, forecast to increase tenfold over the next 10 years, and hydroelectric power. Last month, the National Energy Agency said China plans to build an additional 140 gigawatts of hydropower capacity in the next five years, though this will have a dire impact on ecologically crucial sites. The country&apos;s high-speed rail network \u2013 non-existent in 2008 \u2013 will be bigger than the rest of the world combined within two years. According to one domestic carmaker, China will soon unveil plans for 10m electric car charge-and-park places by 2020. In these and other fields, such as eco-city development and public transport construction, the five-year plan is likely to set ambitious spending targets. Last year China invested $34bn in clean technology, compared to $18bn by the US. The contrast \u2013 which shocked many in Washington \u2013 is partly explained by different political systems, vested interests and stages of development. While the US is dominated by big oil and big money, China is run by big hydro and big brother \u2013 a dictatorship of engineers. The &quot;scientific development&quot; policy of President Hu Jintao, who started his career working for Sinohydro, the world&apos;s biggest dam builder, recognises the challenges posed by climate change and the investment opportunities of renewable energy. It has been far less successful in curbing the dirty side-effects of industrial development. Deborah Seligsohn of the World Resources Institute said there was a clear difference between China&apos;s record on pollution \u2013 where it lags far behind developed nations \u2013 and renewable technology, where it is ahead in many sectors. &quot;In clean energy, China is busy setting themselves up as a world leader. If they meet their most ambitious targets for 2020, they&apos;ll have the most wind, the most nuclear and the most hydro,&quot; she said. &quot;But China is still playing catch-up on pollution. The air quality in Beijing does not exactly feel like London or New York.&quot; That too should change. Sharp northern winds have helped Beijing to start this year with a record stretch of &quot;blue sky&quot; days. A longer term solution to the smog shrouding many Chinese cities will be tighter factory and vehicle controls. Last week, the government said it would widen pollution reduction targets by adding nitrogen oxide \u2013 roughly a third of whichcomes from vehicle exhausts \u2013 and ammonia, a source of water contamination from chemical and textile plants. Cities including Shanghai and Beijing have begun restricting car ownership. The authorities have also taken positive steps on the release of environmental data. For the past two years, the only real-time, publicly available air pollution monitor in Beijing was provided by tweets from the US embassy. From last month, up-to-the-minute air and water data from more than 100 cities in China has been available on the website of the environment ministry. Green technology and pollution controls should improve the quality of the air and water, but they do little to ease the bigger environmental threat from depleting wildlife, ecosystems and natural resources. Each year northern China faces a shortfall of 40bn cubic metres of water, forcing ever deeper drilling into non-replenishable aquifers. To address this, China plans to cap water use and double spending on water conservation projects. Government advisers say environmental talk will be greenwash unless local officials are persuaded to rethink their growth-at-all-costs mentality. Pan Jiahua, the executive director of the sustainable development research centre at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, expects this to happen naturally. &quot;GDP growth will have to be slowed down,&quot; said Pan. &quot;This is somewhat natural. In Shanghai there is no more land available for development. In the steel industry, we have the capacity to produce 750m tonnes, which is 40% of the global total. There is no need to grow further.&quot; While double-digit expansion has been the norm for the past five years, Pan expects the next target to be 8 or 9%. The plan will place greater priority on protecting arable land, food security, wildlife protection and the &quot;ecological restoration&quot; of areas damaged by construction of roads, rail and other infrastructure. Together, these would mark a turning point for China&apos;s environmental degradation. &quot;In the 12th five-year plan, we will go beyond the peak and start to go down,&quot; he said. That is optimistic. Previous attempts to give nature a breather by slowing the economy failed spectacularly. For the 10th and 11th five-year plans, the government aimed at 7-7.5% growth, but this was treated as a floor rather than a ceiling by overzealous local officials, who see GDP as a key measurement to compete with rival regions, get promoted and secure bribes. As a result, the economy surged forward at double-digit pace for most of this period \u2013 with dire consequences for coal consumption, pollution and habitat destruction. Once again, provincial governments appear unwilling to throttle back. Figures published late last month indicate most plan to double their GDPs during the next five years. To tackle this problem, planners are considering another radical measure, to de-link GDP figures from cadres&apos; performance evaluation. This may prove a step too far. While there is widespread praise for the proposals unveiled so far, there is scepticism about the government&apos;s ability to overcome business groups and corrupt officials who have benefited from growth. &quot;We are expecting to see a truly green five-year plan, which for the first time will contain really detailed measures and teeth in it,&quot; said Yang Ailun of Greenpeace. &quot;The next five years will be the defining moment for China&apos;s environmental movement. There will be more disasters and more of a struggle to impose tougher regulations. Local interests groups have grown quite strong. They won&apos;t accept change quietly.&quot; Ma Jun, of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs, said the government would take a big step forward if it set absolute limits on pollutants and resource consumption, rather than the incremental, economy-linked targets seen until now. &quot;This is the first major effort to translate words into actions. Before the government set targets and talked of improvement, but this is the first really major effort to integrate that into an economic plan. They should get credit for that,&quot; said Ma. China still had a long way to go, given the appallingly low level from which it starts and the lack of many of the tools used to improve the environment in the west, such as a strong civil society and regulatory obligations for factories to disclose a toxic release inventory. &quot;I don&apos;t consider this a turning point,&quot; said Ma. &quot;We haven&apos;t seen air and water really get clean yet. The measures under discussion are not sufficient at all. &quot; Beijing&apos;s claims to have turned over a green new leaf are also weakened by the continued destruction of the nation&apos;s ecosystems. Last month, the boundaries of the last fish wild sanctuary on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river were redrawn to make way for a dam that showed, say conservationists, the authorities lack a protection baseline. This highlights the greater longterm environmental threat facing China from the unsustainable use of resources, already visible in the depletion of water systems, biodiversity, energy, soil quality and arable land. To deal with this, environmentalists say even the most progressive top-down policies need to be balanced with greater awareness at the grassroots otherwise China will follow the west in looking clean but consuming dirty. &quot;I&apos;m hopeful about the next five-year plan,&quot; said Li Bo of Friends of Nature. &quot;The government is prepared to go further than before. But we should do more. Until now, low carbon concepts have been introduced only for industry. In the future, I hope those ideas can be adopted in the community so we see a change in lifestyles.&quot; \u2022 Additional reporting by Cui Zheng, Liu Yang and Han Cheng", "tags": ["Green economy", "China", "Pollution", "Waste", "Renewable energy", "Energy", "Environment", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-04T19:51:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/08/why-national-dream-foreign-concept", "sentences": ["Twenty-five years on, working- and middle-class skills and salaries are stagnant and declining while the wider world, which also admired the American Dream, decided they would build it at home in Shanghai or Bangalore rather than emigrate as their ancestors did."], "title": "Why national dream is a foreign concept", "article": "When Ed Miliband told Labour supporters in Gateshead about his fear that young people today were no longer sure of a better future than their parents had enjoyed he was careful to admit that Britain lacked an upbeat popular catchphrase to match &quot;the American Dream&quot;. But when he invoked the idea of a broken &quot;British promise&quot; as over-hasty coalition spending cuts bite deep into the delicate fabric of society that was clearly what Miliband meant to convey: the chance of decent education and jobs for all, a secure environment, free healthcare and confidence in a better tomorrow. It is a notion that comes more easily to Americans with a century of economic and, latterly, political global dominance behind them, though the half century of rising living standards that followed the Great Depression and second world war has given way to far greater uncertainty for millions. Until recently postwar Europeans have made similar assumptions, but they started from a different, darker place. The US had been peopled for 400 years by immigrants \u2013 all of them eager volunteers apart from African slaves \u2013 determined to make a new and freer life in the New World. By contrast most Europeans had vivid memories of war, tyranny and rigid class hierarchies. Mostly they admired America while also thinking Americans materialistic, uncouth and noisy. It was admiration which prompted France to donate Bartholdi&apos;s Statue of Liberty to New York in 1886, complete with Emma Lazarus&apos;s famous lines &quot;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free \u2026&quot; Reality was not always like that in the sweat shops of New York or on the thin soil of Nebraska. But the dream of self-betterment had been powerful since religious dissenters sought to build their &quot;shining city on a hill&quot; in New England or make a fast buck growing tobacco in Virginia. The idea was embodied in the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness pledge of the constitution of 1776 when Americans overthrew the British rule they thought stood in the way of their goal. Millions crossed the Atlantic to join the pursuit. In the 19th century the fertile inventor Thomas Edison&apos;s rise to fame and fortune was said to embody the American Dream. In fact the phrase only attracted capital letters after James Truslow Adams, himself a wealthy writer, wrote about it expressing the idea of limitless success for the hard-working. It was as late as 1931. Margaret Thatcher tried to foster a &quot;British Dream&quot; tradition, as did Tony Blair. Even the more prosaic Gordon Brown sought to blend European social democratic traditions of fairness with American entrepreneurial zeal. But Miliband gets it because the concept is in his blood. Like Emma Lazarus, a Jewish refugee from Russian pogroms, his own Jewish ancestors fled west to seek a better life. By 1940 they had reached Belgium where grandfather and his then-teenage father, Ralph, escaped to Britain from what would probably have been death in the camps. Britain gave them shelter, education and a chance to start afresh, he said \u2013 pure Americanism of the kind you do not hear in France, where patriotism is expressed in terms of republican virtue, though Nicholas Sarkozy, another child of Jewish refugees from Hungary, openly admires America as French leaders rarely do in public. The irony is that Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher&apos;s response to emerging globalisation deliberately sought to create more risk-prone unequal societies, theoretically more meritocratic but in reality restoring the advantages of privilege which the mid-century shook off. Twenty-five years on, working- and middle-class skills and salaries are stagnant and declining while the wider world, which also admired the American Dream, decided they would build it at home in Shanghai or Bangalore rather than emigrate as their ancestors did.

The marriage of international literary stars with local and expat audiences in exotic locations has inspired an unprecedented surge in book tourism, from Shanghai to Byron Bay, Australia. In Jaipur last month, for instance, you could bump into JM Coetzee, Richard Ford, Martin Amis and Candace Bushnell. With the export of festival UK, ambitious writers today are advised to carry a pen and a passport. The importance of this phenomenon is marked by the way successful festivals are getting bogged down in politico-cultural controversy. In 2009, in Dubai, there was a row about medieval censorship. Last week, in Jaipur, the organiser, William Dalrymple, was accused of neocolonialism, promoting English and American writing at the expense of Indian culture, a charge he swatted as if it were a lazy mosquito. A few hundred miles further south, in Sri Lanka, the Galle literary festival was also caught up in politics. The brutal regime that crushed the Tamil insurgency is rightly charged with repressing, &quot;disappearing&quot; and allegedly killing journalists. So Galle was accused of collaborating with an enemy of free speech. The Booker-shortlisted South African novelist Damon Galgut pulled out. Last weekend I attended the Galle festival as a guest. It would be difficult to miss the military tenor of Sri Lanka&apos;s government, but this friendly week of books and conversation in a world heritage site on the south-western tip of a magical island is also a showcase of international literary values and a haven of benign civility. Far from being the dupe of a dreadful regime, Galle represents the best of the amateur principle and provides an impressive voluntary programme of social and cultural renewal. First, just as Hay reflects the personality of its founder, Peter Florence, so Galle is made in the image of its creator, Geoffrey Dobbs. You might mistake him for a character from an Evelyn Waugh novel; actually, he is a courageous cultural entrepreneur who, like Dalrymple in Jaipur, is not afraid to stand up to cant. He started the Galle festival, singlehanded, and has worked tirelessly to raise audiences and sponsorship, develop local literary workshops and promote education. As well as attracting literary superstars, from Colin Thubron to Germaine Greer, the festival has championed local writers and addressed Sri Lankan issues. This year, there was a session, covered by BBC reporter Bridget Kendall: &quot;After the Shock: the Lingering Legacy of Civil War&quot;. The locals turned up in force. If you read Jon Lee Anderson in the New Yorker, you will know that President Mahinda Rajapaksa is an exceedingly brutal dictator. However, his people are not yet cowed into silence. Galle is obviously a world away from the 30-year war with the Tamil Tigers, but it has also known tragedy. The 2004 tsunami struck this corner of Sri Lanka with particular ferocity. Despite massive reconstruction, the coast road from Colombo still takes the visitor past ghost villages. The formerly Dutch Galle fort, protected by 17th-century stone ramparts, was unscathed. It remains an oasis of colonial history and is the focus of the festival. So the Galle festival has been at the heart of the socio-cultural renewal of a shattered community. Amid the oppressive gloom of Sri Lankan politics, it looks like a beacon of hope, optimism and good taste that will, with a bit of luck, shine for years to come. No one should mistake it for Sri Lankan reality, but at least it offers a little bit of literary freedom unintimidated by President Rajapaksa&apos;s autocratic regime.", "tags": ["Festivals", "Sri Lanka", "Books", "Culture", "South and Central Asia"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-06T00:05:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/06/chinas-economic-invasion-of-africa", "sentences": ["&quot;My friends who now work in Beijing and Shanghai are so tired,&quot; she\u00a0says."], "title": "China's economic invasion of Africa", "article": "In December 1999, a 24-year-old Chinese man called Zhang Hao left behind the freezing winter of his native Shenyang city to fly to Uganda. Zhang was nervous. He spoke no English. The journey was not even his idea, but that of his father, who had worked in Uganda a few years before on a fishing project involving the Chinese government. &quot;If you want to start something \u2013 and be the boss \u2013 Africa is the place to do it,&quot; Zhang&apos;s father had told him when he asked for business advice. Zhang had quit university to travel to east Africa, but he did not need a degree to spot easy money-making opportunities as soon as he set foot in Kampala: goods that were available cheaply in every city in China were either expensive here, or unavailable. He started by importing shoes. Then schoolbags. Then fishing nets, nails and bicycles. &quot;I imported everything. At that time they needed everything!&quot; recalls\u00a0Zhang, an affable man with rimless glasses. His business grew quickly; he made money and local friends. But after a few years he grew weary of the long buying trips to China. So he and his wife bought a large plot of land in Kampala. On it they constructed a spectacular Chinese-Korean restaurant, with private dining areas, karaoke rooms and a giant 500-seat dining hall. To the side of the restaurant they built a bedroom, which became their home. The business prospered, and soon he started additional enterprises including a bakery, a firm selling flat-screen televisions and a security company. &quot;Chinese don&apos;t think, they just try without studying the market too much. Otherwise, the chance is gone,&quot; he says. At the site of each new enterprise, Zhang built a room for his family \u2013 he had a son in 2007 \u2013 to sleep in. They literally live at work. It has paid off. Zhang says he is now the biggest Chinese employer in the country, with 1,200 local staff. He has even been offered a Ugandan passport, but has refused, just as he has declined to take an English first name. &quot;I am Chinese, and we need to build a Chinese name here \u2013 to let people know that our country is not like before. We are richer, catching up the world.&quot; Few Ugandans need reminding of that. When Zhang arrived in 1999 there were only a few hundred Chinese in the country, including embassy staff. Today, the most conservative estimate is 7,000, from the petty traders who have taken over whole blocks of the central business district to the construction engineers changing Kampala&apos;s skyline and the sharp-suited oil executives who frequent Zhang&apos;s restaurant. It is a similar story across the continent. Figures are hard to come by, but a decade ago there were probably no more than 100,000 Chinese people working in Africa. Today, there are around a million. The first Chinese reached Africa nearly 600 years ago during the Ming dynasty, when the armada of admiral Zheng He landed on the Kenyan coast. The next significant arrival was in the early 1900s, when 60,000 Chinese miners worked on the South African goldfields. Half a century on, Chairman Mao Zedong sent tens of thousands of agricultural and construction workers to Africa to enhance ties with countries emerging from colonialism. But post-cold war migration concerns economics rather than politics. China-Africa trade grew from $6bn in 1999 to more than $90bn (\u00a356bn) in 2009, roughly split equally between imports and exports: Africa&apos;s natural resources \u2013 oil, iron, platinum, copper, and timber \u2013 flowing east to feed China&apos;s factories, and finished goods, from flip-flops to trucks, travelling the\u00a0other way. Last year, the trade is estimated to have topped $100bn. Chinese state involvement in the trade is crucial. Each year Beijing provides billions of pounds in grants and loans to African governments as a sweetener to secure raw material deals or to finance infrastructure projects that could benefit its companies. That is what brought Liu Hui to Kenya. A slight, 41-year-old civil engineer, he was working for China Wuyi, a state-owned construction firm, in Fujian province in 2006 when he was called into his &quot;leader&apos;s&quot; office, and told he was needed on a project to upgrade Nairobi&apos;s main airport. Liu had never set foot outside China. He was reluctant to leave his wife and seven-year-old son. He knew as little about Kenya as Zheng He&apos;s sailors. &quot;My image was: very poor, dry and hot,&quot; says Liu. &quot;But if my company wanted to send me somewhere, what could I have done? You have to show your capacity for work.&quot; On arrival, Liu found that Nairobi was neither dry nor too hot. When the\u00a0airport contract finished, he was assigned to oversee the construction of a highway between Nairobi and Thika, a pineapple-growing district to the north-east. Liu lives at China Wuyi&apos;s main site office, a four-storey building alongside the highway. Though the commute to work consists of a flight of stairs, the day is long \u2013 from 7.15am to 6pm. The pace of work is often frustrating, and can be complicated by language difficulties; Liu speaks in halting English, and knows a few phrases of\u00a0Swahili. &quot;Chinese work very hard, very quickly,&quot; he says. &quot;But here we are training local people to do the work, and if someone does not understand, he works slowly. You have\u00a0to watch.&quot; Most evenings Liu and his Chinese colleagues \u2013 there are about 100 on the road project \u2013 watch DVDs on their laptops or chat to family and friends over the internet. But they do get out occasionally, for coffee or dinner in nearby malls. Liu says he intends to return to China for good \u2013 his bosses permitting \u2013 when the road project finishes, in order to spend more time with his family. But for Wang Lina, seated in her shop in downtown Nairobi, a few miles away, family is the reason she is here. The child of &quot;normal worker&quot; parents, Wang grew up with few thoughts of leaving Benxi, an industrial town nearly 600 miles north-east of Beijing. But in 2003, when she was 21 and newly married, her husband&apos;s uncle approached them with a proposition. A\u00a0few years before he had travelled to Kenya to set up a home furnishings company. Now his business was expanding fast, and he was looking for family members to help run it. Wang and her husband agreed to join him. But she missed her friends. In Kenya she could not find any clothes to fit her. She was too shy to talk to local people. So, after a year, she and her husband quit and returned to Benxi. But soon his uncle came calling again, begging them to give it another try. This time Wang found herself appreciating the upside of living in Nairobi. In Benxi, she had lived in a flat, but was now sharing a large house and garden with two other couples from the extended family. Instead of simply being a cashier in the store, Wang moved into design and sales. She works hard, often seven days a week, but has also found time to enjoy some of east Africa&apos;s best tourist attractions \u2013 a safari near Mount Kenya, a beach holiday in Zanzibar. She and her husband have saved enough to buy an apartment back home, which is the goal of many young Chinese who take jobs abroad, even though she has no intention of returning soon. &quot;My friends who now work in Beijing and Shanghai are so tired,&quot; she\u00a0says. &quot;There&apos;s no time to relax, it&apos;s always faster, faster! Things are slower here, and I like that. No hurry in Africa, that&apos;s what they say.&quot; China&apos;s move into Africa has not all been driven from the east. Countries such as Uganda have actively courted Chinese companies, to good effect: in 2010 China replaced the UK as the biggest source of foreign direct investment. One of the largest firms to have set up in Uganda is ZTE, China&apos;s second-biggest telecommunications equipment company. Zhu Zhenxing, 32, is its MD in Uganda. Growing up in Jiangsu, along China&apos;s east coast, Zhu was certain about two things: he wanted to learn English, and wanted to be an international businessman. He was recruited by ZTE at a job fair, with the promise of a job abroad. &quot;I did not want to stay in my home area, or even in China,&quot; he says, puffing on a Dunhill cigarette. &quot;I wanted to experience things, to grow. The further away the better.&quot; So when he was asked to go to Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, Zhu did not hesitate. &quot;Other people said: Africa\u00a0is like this and like that. But I\u00a0thought if other humans lived there, I\u00a0could too.&quot; He learned a lot. The corruption dismayed him. But Zhu liked Nigerians&apos; optimism, &quot;always talking and smiling, not worrying about tomorrow&quot;. He was so desperate to prove himself that he nearly burned out. He developed vitiligo, a disorder that causes loss of pigmentation. His face turned white &quot;like Michael Jackson&quot; and he was forced to return to China to recover. He returned to Africa via Vietnam. In Uganda, he has grown ZTE&apos;s business exponentially \u2013 the company sold more than 500,000 handsets this year. Zhu looks the modern high-flyer \u2013 smart shoes, trousers with a Mont Blanc belt, a dress shirt and trendy black glasses. At weekends he plays golf with clients and Chinese embassy staff. But beyond that his lifestyle is far more modest than that of most expats. He and his staff all live in the same apartment block. A company vehicle takes them to and from work each day.\u00a0His salary is good by Chinese standards but not comparable with those of his western competitors. Still, he has no complaints. &quot;We are still working towards being a world-class company,&quot; he says. &quot;Our core competency is our low costs, so we must keep expenses down.&quot; If there is one home comfort Chinese migrants in Africa can&apos;t do without it is their food. Most companies, including ZTE, bring over their own chefs. Xu Jianwen, 34, is one of them. Raised and trained in Sanhe, in northern China, he was working in a restaurant in Beijing when he heard that the China Road and Bridge Corporation, a state-owned construction giant, was hiring cooks. When he was offered a job in Uganda, his wife, with whom he has a young daughter, protested vehemently. But he won her over when he told her the salary \u2013 two and half times what he was earning in China. &quot;Salaries in China are not enough,&quot; he says. &quot;I had to come for the money.&quot; His first job was to cook for 20 Chinese workers in Soroti, a small town in eastern Uganda. He had two local assistants but, lacking English, no way to communicate with them. At least the cooking was uncomplicated. Only five vegetables were available locally \u2013\u00a0aubergine, cabbage, potatoes, green peppers and tomatoes. &quot;And there was\u00a0no spicy sauce,&quot; he says. &quot;I work every day, because people need to eat\u00a0every day. I wake up at six in the morning and finish at seven. Every day\u00a0is like that. I rest on Chinese public\u00a0holidays.&quot; Currently based at head office in Kampala, Xu plans to spend another two or three years overseas, saving all the while for &quot;housing, education and food&quot; for his family. He won&apos;t miss the mosquitoes, he says, but he will miss the people. &quot;They are very nice. Friendly to Chinese.&quot; That is not always the case. In parts of southern Africa there has been strong resentment towards Chinese traders, many of whom arrive on tourist visas and stay on illegally. In Zambia, the Chinese managers of a coal mine recently shot two Zambian employees who were protesting over pay, causing anger across the country. And in Sudan and Ethiopia, rebel groups have killed Chinese workers because they view them as proxies of the local government. In Kenya, home to up to 15,000 Chinese, the main problem for some of\u00a0the early migrants was a mistrust of their goods. Xu Hui gave up an editing position at the state news agency Xinhua to start a toy-import business in the mid-90s. But when he moved into computers, people did not trust the quality. He resorted to showing potential clients the labels on the computers they already owned that said: &quot;Made in China&quot;. Today Xu runs a successful business importing Great Wall-brand televisions and giant rolls of toilet paper that are repackaged locally. He regards Kenya as his home \u2013 he enjoys the &quot;simple, healthy lifestyle&quot;, playing badminton at a sports club every week \u2013 and only reluctantly sent his family back to China for educational reasons. But though the attitude to Xu&apos;s products may have changed, he is aware that western attitudes to China&apos;s push into Africa remain largely negative \u2013 something he struggles to understand. &quot;Western countries also buy oil, and have mines around the world. People don&apos;t talk about &apos;grabbing&apos;, or &apos;new colonialism&apos; there. So why is it different for Chinese? We are not sending our armies to places and saying: &apos;Now sell us this!&apos;&quot; Xu says. &quot;If\u00a0you can&apos;t compete with us, you find an excuse. It&apos;s like two children fighting, and the losing one crying to his parent about funny tricks.&quot; In fact, there is competition now on lots of levels. Every month thousands of African merchants travel to cities such as Guangzhou and Yiwu to buy wholesale goods. And other Chinese firms, including state-owned companies, battle for local tenders. This can be stressful for company managers. Just ask Dong Junxia, an earnest, smartly dressed woman. Since 2008 she has been in charge of the small Ugandan office of the China Railway Seventh Group Corporation, a subsidiary of CREC, one of the world&apos;s largest construction companies. She worked on road-building projects in difficult environments in Tanzania and\u00a0Liberia, with some success. But in\u00a0Uganda her company had yet to win\u00a0a large tender. Dong seemed ashamed, and insisted that her name and that of her company stay out of this story. &quot;I have progressed professionally [in Africa], but suffered loss in being away from my family. In western culture it&apos;s different. Being with the family is the priority. Chinese sacrifice themselves for the family. It is hard to decide which is more important.&quot; But a week later she called to say that her name could be used. She sounded exuberant: her company has\u00a0been awarded a large contract to build a road. &quot;After two years of hard work! You must understand how good that feels.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2011. The original said Shenyang was a province. It is a city.

She is appalled by the recent building work on the city&apos;s iconic river frontage, which she says has significantly diminished the Unesco world heritage site and besmirched the Edwardian &quot;Three Graces&quot; \u2013 the Royal Liver, Cunard and Port of Liverpool buildings \u2013 which have elegantly defined the skyline for almost a century. The next plan for the area, a proposed 50-storey skyscraper called the Shanghai Tower, simply fills her with dread. Cath, 46, whose real name is Cathy Roberts, looks from the dock towards the Mann Island development, a controversial black granite building: &quot;It&apos;s spoiled the view.&quot; She should know \u2013 her maritime home means she looks at it every day. The Liver Building is her kitchen clock. Finally residents have an opportunity to take a detailed look at the \u00a35.5bn planning application for the Shanghai Tower by Peel Holdings, the owner of Manchester&apos;s huge Trafford Centre shopping mall. The plans have been a long time coming \u2013 first mooted three years ago, a formal application was finally submitted to the council after discussions with heritage groups. Tonight the developers have organised a PR exercise to try and woo the doubters with an open public event at the Crowne Plaza Hotel at Princes Dock. New images of the scheme will be unveiled. The plans include a cruise ship terminal, shops, restaurants and 9,000 homes. Peel Holdings argues that the Liverpool Waters plan will regenerate former and currently disused dockland in north Liverpool to create a central, high quality waterfront zone. It will supposedly bring thousands of jobs. Across the Mersey a complementary \u00a34.5bn scheme, Wirral Waters, was granted planning permission in August before being granted final approval by the secretary of state. Cath saysnew buildings have already ruined the vista: &quot;One of the best views of the Three Graces has now gone. I call the new buildings the Three Disgraces. I&apos;m worried that Liverpool will lose character and it feels like the city&apos;s for sale. If these buildings keep going up, it will lose its soul.&quot; She concedes that new buildings will bring investment but fears the city is in danger of losing its uniqueness. &quot;Anything that breathes life into Liverpool is good,&quot; she adds. &quot;But I do worry that it is going to be homogenised. So much of Liverpool is associated with the waterfront. I think it&apos;s dreadful that the Three Graces are going to be dwarfed and I do not know how they have got the plans through. It is supposed to be a World Heritage site.&quot; Others are more positive. Besh Perez, 22, a civil engineering student-turned barman at Albert Dock, loves the idea of having the UK&apos;s tallest building outside London: &quot;Shanghai is my favourite city waterfront, it would be great if Liverpool is like Shanghai and that they can replicate its skyline. It would be a big improvement. &quot;I&apos;m not sure if it is because it is so familiar, but to me the Liverpool skyline looks dead industrial and worn down. I think it looks a bit poverty stricken.&quot; The leader of Liverpool&apos;s city council, Joe Anderson, has criticised English Heritage for objecting to the development. He is irked that the Shanghai Tower has already been shifted back from the waterfront and reduced in height. &quot;Every time there is talk of a new building, we have some form of interference by some group of heritage lobbyists,&quot; he told a local newspaper. &quot;The checks and balances have gone too far in their favour and restrict the council trying to create jobs and opportunities.&quot; Henry Owen-John, English Heritage&apos;s regional director for the north-west, says the debate with the council should have been dealt with away from the gaze of the media. &quot;I can quite understand that Joe has been elected as leader at a very difficult time. The Liverpool Waters development is far and away the most significant regeneration programme in the city at the moment and a huge amount hangs on it.&quot;", "tags": ["Regeneration", "Architecture", "Construction industry", "UK news", "Communities", "Society", "Liverpool"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-07T06:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/feb/07/1", "sentences": ["Sign up to Society daily email briefing Today&apos;s top SocietyGuardian stories \u2022 Health adviser sacked for speaking out in the Guardian \u2022 Cuts undermining &apos;big society&apos;, says senior charity chief \u2022 Super library arrives as hundreds of others face closure \u2022 Liverpool council attacked over plan for 50-storey Shanghai Towers \u2022 Research promises vaccine for all flus \u2022 Coalition faces backbench split over prisoners&apos; right to vote \u2022 Christmas charity appeal raises \u00a3428,000 \u2022 Adoption diary: Talking to the children about their life story \u2022 SocietyGuardian columnist Carlene Firmin becomes youngest black woman to receive MBE All today&apos;s SocietyGuardian stories Other news \u2022 Business organisation the Institute of Directors has called for collective bargaining to be scrapped for teachers and NHS staff, reports the BBC."], "title": "Society daily 07.02.11", "article": "Sign up to Society daily email briefing Today&apos;s top SocietyGuardian stories \u2022 Health adviser sacked for speaking out in the Guardian \u2022 Cuts undermining &apos;big society&apos;, says senior charity chief \u2022 Super library arrives as hundreds of others face closure \u2022 Liverpool council attacked over plan for 50-storey Shanghai Towers \u2022 Research promises vaccine for all flus \u2022 Coalition faces backbench split over prisoners&apos; right to vote \u2022 Christmas charity appeal raises \u00a3428,000 \u2022 Adoption diary: Talking to the children about their life story \u2022 SocietyGuardian columnist Carlene Firmin becomes youngest black woman to receive MBE All today&apos;s SocietyGuardian stories Other news \u2022 Business organisation the Institute of Directors has called for collective bargaining to be scrapped for teachers and NHS staff, reports the BBC.

But Jessie Tang thinks she has the answer. &quot;It&apos;s mostly the parents. Chinese parents tend to push their children a lot, and have really high expectations. I think it&apos;s maybe because they did not have the opportunities that we have these days. They want us to take advantage of them.&quot; Jessie, 18, an A-level student at Watford grammar school for girls, whose father arrived in England from Hong Kong, was being asked about what seems an amazing success story buried and barely commented upon within English schools&apos; results. The statistics relate to the achievement of pupils of Chinese ethnicity, revealed last autumn in a report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission on inequality in Britain. This showed not only that British Chinese youngsters are the highest performing ethnic group in England at GCSE, which has been known for years. It also showed that this group seemed to be singularly successful in achieving that goal of educational policy-makers everywhere: a narrow performance gap between those from the poorest homes, and the rest. Further evidence of the success of pupils of Chinese heritage came through the world&apos;s most well-known international testing study, Pisa. This found 15-year-olds from Shanghai, China, easily outperforming those of all other nationalities. The domestic statistics show that, at GCSE, children of Chinese ethnicity \u2013 classed simply as &quot;Chinese&quot; in the data \u2013 who are eligible for free school meals (FSM) perform better than the national average for all pupils, rich and poor. Not only that, but FSM Chinese pupils do better than those of most other ethnic backgrounds, even when compared with children from better-off homes (those not eligible for free school meals). A detailed look at the figures makes this clearer. Some 71% of Chinese FSM pupils achieved five good GCSEs, including English and maths, in 2009. For non-FSM Chinese pupils, the figure was 72%. Every other ethnic group had a gap of at least 10 percentage points between children who do not count as eligible for free meals, and those who do. The gap for white pupils stood at 32 percentage points. In 2010, the picture changed slightly, with the gap between Chinese FSM pupils (68%) and their non-FSM peers (76%) increasing to eight points. But it still compared very favourably with the equivalent gulf among white pupils, which was 33 percentage points. In primary schools, the picture is similar. Remarkably, in 2009, in English key stage 2 tests, Chinese FSM pupils outperformed not just their counterparts from other ethnic groups \u2013 easily outstripping white children \u2013 but even Chinese pupils not eligible for free meals. Michael Gove, the education secretary, told his party conference last autumn that the performance of FSM pupils as a whole was a &quot;reproach to our conscience&quot;. So what do Chinese pupils have going for them that other children do not? Anyone investigating this subject will be struck by the limited research available. Only one academic team seems to have looked into British Chinese pupils&apos; experience in detail in recent years. The team, who interviewed 80 Chinese pupils, 30 Chinese parents and 30 teachers in 2005, identified several factors behind the success, although they stress that not all British Chinese pupils achieve. One explanation, though, shines through their findings. Becky Francis, a visiting professor at King&apos;s College London, director of education at the Royal Society of Arts and one of the researchers, says: &quot;Our main argument is that families of Chinese heritage see taking education seriously as a fundamental pillar of their Chinese identity, and a way of differentiating themselves not just within their own group, but from other ethnic groups as well.&quot; Recent coverage of Amy Chua&apos;s book on &quot;tiger parenting&quot;, Battle Hymn of The Tiger Mother, has also focused attention on parenting styles promoting achievement in children of Chinese ethnicity. The argument that Chinese families put especial value on education is sensitive territory, of course, as most parents would profess a commitment to helping their child do well. Academics also stress that the numbers of pupils classed as &quot;Chinese&quot; are small \u2013 only 2,236 took GCSEs last year, from a total cohort of nearly 600,000 \u2013 and results should be interpreted cautiously. However, there is tentative evidence, both from interviews with parents and from analyses of background values existing in Chinese culture, that family commitment to education is particularly strong. Some 13 of the 30 British Chinese parents interviewed said their children were also being educated at Chinese &quot;supplementary schools&quot;. These offer tuition in Chinese language and culture at the weekends. Several of the parents also said they paid for tutoring outside school hours. Researchers found that among British Chinese families this was not related to social class: a number of working-class parents paid for this, too. Asked to respond to the question &quot;Is education important?&quot;, all 80 pupils agreed. High parental expectations also seem to have been a factor in many \u2013 though not all \u2013 children&apos;s experiences. One pupil is quoted saying: &quot;My parents expect me to get the best grades. And if I don&apos;t, then they&apos;ll continuously nag at me to do better ... Like if I get a B, they&apos;ll be like, &apos;Why didn&apos;t you get an A?&apos;&quot; A paper presented at last year&apos;s British Educational Research Association conference, covering performance across all ethnic groups, found no link between the occupation of Chinese pupils&apos; parents and their GCSE scores, unlike for children from all other ethnicities. Ramesh Kapadia, a visiting professor at London University&apos;s Institute of Education, who presented the paper, says: &quot;I think within Chinese society, there is an emphasis on practice. Children are told: &apos;If you want to learn something, practise, practise and practise it again and you will get better&apos;. It may be that this helps to motivate pupils when the rewards can seem a long way away.&quot; There is a mixed picture overall, though, as to how far this school success is being translated into employment prospects. The Equality and Human Rights Commission report found that British Chinese men and women were twice as likely to be in professional jobs as their white British counterparts. But average earnings remained around 11% lower throughout the population than for those classed as &quot;white Christian&quot;. Whether the Chinese experience can be replicated among other pupils is debatable. Some might see evidence that Chinese families emphasise hard work, and the results that follow, as simple proof that all can succeed, given the right attitude. However, Francis says such a view should be treated cautiously, the team&apos;s 2005 paper arguing that &quot;Chinese constructions of ethnic identity and education are very specific&quot;. Much research has shown links, generally, between poverty and underachievement. Jessie, whose father works in a takeaway restaurant and whose mother, originally from Malaysia, works at Heathrow airport, has 12 GCSEs including six A*s and an offer to read music at Royal Holloway, London. She attended a Chinese supplementary school from the age of five. She says many Chinese families are keen on their children pursuing careers in medicine, so she is &quot;rebelling a bit&quot;, but wanted to pursue a subject she enjoys. The Department for Education was unable to point to any particular study it has commissioned to look at British Chinese pupils&apos; success. Given the scale of that success, it seems surprising that the phenomenon has not been investigated further.", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "GCSEs", "Sats", "Communities", "Society", "Exams"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-07T17:01:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/feb/08/outcasts-are-brits-lost-in-space", "sentences": ["The Oslo talks have failed, the peace march in New York has achieved nothing and there has been an uprising in Shanghai."], "title": "Outcasts: are Brits lost in space?", "article": "It is 2040 and human life on Earth seems to have collapsed. The Oslo talks have failed, the peace march in New York has achieved nothing and there has been an uprising in Shanghai. Our world has become overpopulated and, if that wasn&apos;t inconvenient enough, an apparent nuclear apocalypse has seen &quot;people in Chicago \u2026become shadows on buildings&quot;. Around 50,000 pioneers have ventured into deep space and settled on a habitable planet in a Goldilocks Zone. If you watched the first episode of Outcasts last night, this should all be sounding familiar. It&apos;s everything you might expect from a new sci-fi show. The only surprise is that this particular show has been made (by Kudos) for BBC (Wales), rather than ABC (Los Angeles). Written by Spooks scribe Ben Richards, the accents are, for the most part, British. Question is: does Outcasts hold up \u2013 does it prove that Brits can do deep space sci-fi as decently as our cousins across the pond?  Richards used the programme&apos;s launch to admit he is not the most &quot;sci-fi literate&quot; writer around. Instead he set out to explore profound ideas such as original sin and utopia and whether humans are capable of building a new society from scratch. He was also on a personal mission to challenge Lord of the Flies author William Golding&apos;s apparent belief that humans are ultimately doomed by their own nature. Which sounds suspiciously like that age-old defence of British sci-fi \u2013 that while it has usually looked much cheaper than its American counterparts it has always been more cerebral and meaningful. But to my mind, that particular piece of sophistry has been blown out of the water in recent years, thanks to several brilliant US shows, especially Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009) which was something of a sci-fi game changer, not least in its thoughtful and subtle exploration of all the moral and philosophical issues surrounding the US war on terror. Indeed it would be safe to say that far from outclassing Battlestar, Outcasts seeks to ape that show in several important respects \u2013 not least in its look, the presence of ballsy women (Hermione Norris and Amy Manson mean business) and in its basic premise of following the remaining vestiges of humanity as they strike out alone. Oh, and the casting of Galactica alumnus Jamie Bamber of course. Richards admitted he wrote lines about lasers blasting through night skies only to be stymied by budget considerations. And here is the basic problem with British sci-fi \u2013 even one made like the eight-part Outcasts with a co-funding boost from BBC America. So the alien planet still looks very much like Earth (it was filmed \u2013 rather obviously \u2013 in South Africa), and the pistols appear to have been requisitioned from The Bill props department and painted an ungodly fluorescent orange. We have come a long way from the dark days of 1970s Doctor Who, outdoor shoots in Welsh gravel pits and monsters made from umbrellas or the inside of a sofa. But even British sci-fi shows such as ITV&apos;s Eleventh Hour or Primeval have, for all their ambition, been inevitably much cheaper affairs, hamstrung by shorter runs which make it much harder to build a sense of place and credibility about a new world. British sci-fi always looks that bit cheaper, while sci-fi jargon (&quot;I wanna DBB him&quot; from last night&apos;s episode, for instance) has always sounded to me, well, just a bit silly when delivered in my own accent. Outcasts is not all bad \u2013 the opening space sequence was beautifully done, the script is witty in places and the acting (with perhaps the rather shouty exception of Ashley Walters as the disgruntled macho expeditionary soldier) first rate. But it hasn&apos;t stopped my suspicions that Brits remain second best to the Americans when it comes to sci-fi.

Some 70 jobs will go in the UK and abroad as the agency reacts to a four-year fall of 34% in its government grant to just over \u00a321m in 2014-15.

The accused in turn point to international media bias and argue that sustainability standards are North Atlantic clubs dominated by businesses using NGOs to protect profitable markets. At stake is not just the fate of individual companies, but the impact of intensified global competition on our natural environment and communities.  Responsible leadership is not the preserve of western businesses: Brazilian body care innovator Natura, Indian conglomerate Tata, and South Africa&apos;s mining giant Anglo American are among a growing number of iconic companies in emerging markets that are matching or exceeding sustainability benchmarks set by their western counterparts. The &apos;Global 100&apos;, a prestigious ranking of the world&apos;s 100 most sustainable, publicly-listed companies includes 12 emerging economy companies in its 2010 list, up from zero in 2005.  Brazil&apos;s Instituto Ethos is the world&apos;s largest national business association focused on sustainability. African cellphone entrepreneur and billionaire, Mo Ibrahim, exemplifies the next &apos;Rockefeller&apos; generation of self-made philanthropists.  Emerging economies will also be central players in shaping tomorrow&apos;s international standards, challenging many of the sustainability standards that the west has established in the last two decades.  Post-apartheid South Africa has developed many &apos;voluntary&apos; social compacts between business, labour and civil society and the government, mainly focused on black empowerment, but also dealing with pervasive social and economic challenges such as HIV/AIDS. Emerging nations are moving quickly to becoming market-makers, not takers. Brazil has led the charge in developing ISO&apos;s new &apos;social responsibility standard&apos;, SR26000. And as one senior executive of a north American company based in Shanghai commented, &quot;China is developing 10,000 new standards with every intention of placing them at the heart of tomorrow&apos;s global markets \u2013 the question is not whether these standards will be influential, but rather what will be in them&quot;. Indeed, it is China that will be key to how tomorrow&apos;s markets factor in sustainability, given their growing importance in international markets and the centrality of the Chinese market to the success of all global business.  Leading Chinese businesses are certainly saying the right things about sustainability. Chinese companies published 600 corporate reports on sustainability performance last year, up from less than 10% of that figure in 2005. One recent report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences concluded that these reports are on average not just longer but of higher quality than those of their foreign competitors operating in China. 75% Chinese business managers in Fortune China&apos;s most recent annual survey said that integrating social impact considerations into corporate strategy was important, up from 36% the previous year. Improving governance has jumped in stated importance (from 46% to 70%) as has social and environmental impact management (from 41% to 63%).  High profile cases have influenced international perceptions of China&apos;s domestic approach to sustainability, such as Google&apos;s exit from the Chinese market in the face of state censorship of the internet, the conviction of four executives of the mining giant Rio Tinto for bribery and theft of commercial secrets, and the case of Sanlu Dairy, whose chief executive was sentenced to death following conviction for knowingly selling tainted milk that killed several children and sickened thousands more. Such cases highlight again the fact that emerging nations will shape their own future and how best to get there, as employees of the Netherlands-headquartered Clean Clothes Campaign discovered when summoned to appear in a Bangalore court in 2007 when their campaigning target, the international jeans suppliers Fibres and Fabrics International, turned on them accusing them of cyber crime, acts of racist and xenophobic nature and criminal defamation. Intense diplomacy at the highest levels eventually defused the situation and the international Interpol warrant for the arrest of the accused campaigners was withdrawn.  Emerging economy businesses are embracing the sustainability challenge, in their products and processes, through their measurement and reporting, and in how they see themselves and their future. As always, there are good, bad and ugly cases, and varied ambitions with diverse motives, which my blogs over the coming weeks and months will explore.

The Communist party&apos;s disciplinary watchdog has removed Liu Zhijun as party boss of the ministry. It is not clear if he still holds his ministerial role, the less important of the two. Liu, 58, is thought to be the most senior official to be investigated since a former Shanghai mayor, Chen Liangyu, was sacked in 2006. A report from the state news agency Xinhua gave no details of the investigation into Liu, but described it as part of the country&apos;s battle against corruption. Despite repeated government pledges to crack down on the problem, corruption remains rife and is one of the most potent sources of public anger. Liu&apos;s younger brother, Liu Zhixiang, who was also a railway official, was given a suspended death sentence five years ago for embezzlement, accepting bribes and hiring a hitman in a case surrounding a ticket-tout ring. The railways ministry, which has been largely unreformed in comparison to other government bodies, is hugely powerful. It controls property around train stations as well as overseeing massive amounts of freight and hundreds of millions of passengers. Liu Zhijun&apos;s empire \u2013 which he headed from 2003 \u2013 was further expanded by the country&apos;s multibillion-pound high-speed rail building programme. China&apos;s network already covers well over 8,000km (4,900 miles) and it plans to invest 3.5tn yuan by\u00a02015. The World Bank has described the initiative as &quot;the biggest single planned programme of passenger rail investment there has ever been in one country.&quot; The South China Morning Post suggested that the investigation might extend to other officials, noting that the railways ministry had removed the section about its leadership from its website and that an unnamed official at the ministry told it: &quot;There will be some changes in personnel.&quot; News of the inquiry into Liu came as the peak travel period for Chinese New Year \u2013 which was predicted to see 230 million rail passengers this year \u2013 draws to a close. Xinhua said Sheng Guangzu, 62, head of the general administration of customs, has been appointed to replace Liu. The last minister to be removed from office was Tian Fengshan, in 2003. He had been in charge of the land and resources ministry. Last year, 146,517 officials were punished for disciplinary violations and 804 were prosecuted, according to the Communist party&apos;s disciplinary body. They included Kang Rixin, former head of the China National Nuclear Corporation, who was expelled from the party and sentenced to life in prison late last year for taking 6.6m yuan in bribes. The former deputy director of the State Food and Drug Administration was sacked and expelled from the party last month for taking &quot;a large amount of money&quot; in bribes, Xinhua said, only three years after the agency&apos;s former director was executed for similar offences. But analysts say political manoeuvrings often play as significant a part in the survival or fall of officials as their misbehaviour. Most saw the departure of the Shanghai mayor as marking President Hu Jintao&apos;s consolidation of his authority; the city was his predecessor Jiang Zemin&apos;s power base.

What ingenious or world-changing object will capture the zeitgeist this year, I asked myself as I strolled through. Last year I was one of the judges and we awarded the prize to a folding plug by an unknown student. It felt like a good decision. No famous designers, no grand narratives. It was a vote for the small and perfectly formed, for the overlooked, for the everyday. The shortlist feels weaker this year, and I&apos;m not saying that because I&apos;m not on the panel. For one thing, there&apos;s less of the social and political engagement that has become the hallmark of the design of the year award. Previous years have seen it go to a laptop for children in the developing world and the Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster. And while those may have been crowd-pleasers, there were entries last year forcing bankers to confront the cost of food in Bangladesh or highlighting inflation in Zimbabwe. This show falls back on the idea of design as refined objects \u2013 as stuff. On those terms, the question is which ones stand out in this land of plenty.     Mimosa by Jason Bruges Studio. Photo: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images    Any prize that aims to collect the best across the varied fields of design \u2013 from architecture to furniture, from graphic design to transport \u2013 presents its judges with an unenviable task. It feels arbitrary pitting a Renault concept car against a new edition of Tristram Shandy. Neither does it make for the most coherent exhibition. What is inspiring about this annual snapshot approach, however, is the sense it offers of watching the design world evolve. Gradually, almost imperceptibly,\u00a0our material environment gets better, smarter and lighter. Especially lighter. In the 80s and 90s, everyone thought that the future was tiny. Led by the Japanese, we assumed our electronic appliances would miniaturise until we had cameras the size of wine gums. Today, we seem to be more preoccupied with lightness. New superlight materials such as carbon fibre \u2013 of which the exhibition&apos;s delicate display system is made \u2013 allow designers to achieve seemingly impossible feats. As a material property, lightness is not just elegant, it&apos;s more sustainable. The show features no category for something called &quot;sustainability&quot; \u2013 a good thing because, as I wrote recently, this should be a prerequisite of all design, not an add-on label. It was certainly the more mercurial ones to which I was drawn. And so if this year&apos;s judges find themselves furrowing their brows about the task ahead, perhaps they should simply choose the lightest. But which will the judges really go for? Let&apos;s start with the heaviest of the disciplines \u2013 architecture. The judges may quickly find themselves down to two candidates: Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, and Thomas Heatherwick&apos;s wildly popular UK Pavilion from last year&apos;s Shanghai Expo. There is no social imperative here. Both are frivolous pieces of national branding, and yet both have the capacity to leave the viewer awestruck. I&apos;m certain the judges will opt for Heatherwick to top this category, as this is not the moment to be celebrating a boom-and-bust white elephant like the Burj. However, a less orthodox and virtually weightless choice would be a series of experimental structures by the Croatian-Austrian collective Numen/For Use, which look like a silken cocoon or cobweb. You can imagine them as sci-fi architectural parasites strung buoyantly between the skyscrapers of a Miss Haversham city, its rigid glass and steel gradually returning to the chaos of nature. Of course, one hopes that it would be made of something a bit more sophisticated than sticky tape. How about the furniture category? Will the judges be seduced by an office chair inspired by a suspension bridge, designed by the ubiquitous Yves B\u00e9har, or a beautifully turned wooden chair by Industrial Facility? I found myself captivated, again, by the light choice \u2013 a featherweight stool by recent Royal College of Art graduate Seongyong Lee. Lee created an entirely new material by laminating wood veneer to produce a lighter, stronger and much more beautiful version of cardboard. Picking it up, it&apos;s as though the stool is full of helium. It&apos;s not just that he&apos;s created a perfect archetypal object, but a material that feels almost immaterial, and that can be used to make anything from tables to pavilions. The only object in the exhibition that stands out as a potential overall winner is in the product design category: the iPad. So successful has this game-changing piece of technology been that it should have its own category \u2013 indeed it pretty much does, since most of the entries in the interactive design section are apps for the iPad, displayed on iPads. But it&apos;s possible that the judges will avoid the obvious, popular, zeitgeisty choice and stick it to Apple \u2013 especially since one of the judges confessed, to me, &quot;I don&apos;t like the internet&quot;. I rather liked Ingo Maurer&apos;s Flying Future hanging light, a diaphanous membrane inserted with organic LEDs (OLEDs). So energy efficient that they last almost indefinitely, these films of organic semiconductor are the light source of the future. They hold the potential for light to be treated as a material in itself, like cloth, draped as luminous surfaces. With the relentless march of digital technology, the graphic design section of the show seems to be retreating into a world of nostalgia. It is wonderful to see the beauty of printed books reasserted, though I wondered why so many of those here are new editions of 18th- and 19th-century novels. Ironically, the work that jumps out here does so because it&apos;s miniscule (and, yes, light): Irma Boom&apos;s Boom. The most respected book designer in the world has produced a 704-page catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of her work, but it&apos;s just two inches high. One doesn&apos;t see that kind of modesty often. Or perhaps it&apos;s not modesty at all, but mystical devotion to her craft. The book is reminiscent of one of those medieval miniature Qur&apos;ans written with a horse&apos;s hair. Of all the disciplines, lightness is most a virtue when it comes to transport. For all the talk of electric cars and high-speed rail, we are realising now that only by reducing the weight of our modes of transport so that they consume less energy can we make them more sustainable. Here, there&apos;s another clear winner: an aluminium bicycle by Dutch brand Vanmoof. I&apos;ll take it any day over the YikeBike, an electric penny-farthing that could have been designed by HR Giger and appears, like some Sinclair C5 of bikes, to be dead on arrival. The fashion category is anyone&apos;s guess. There&apos;s a reason why the Design Museum calls on an international panel of experts to nominate all the entries, and that&apos;s because design is a bewilderingly broad field and no one&apos;s an expert on all of it. As a show, it&apos;s hit and miss and there may be no agenda, but I recommend you go and see it. There&apos;s bound to be something there that will surprise you.", "tags": ["Design", "Architecture", "Art and design", "iPad", "Technology", "Awards and prizes", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-17T09:51:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/18/new-york-fashion-week-calvin-klein", "sentences": ["While Forbes.com described the collection as coming &quot;direct from Shanghai-by way of Art Deco New York&quot;  L.A.M.B."], "title": "New York fashion week: Daily round-up", "article": "Today New York hands the baton over to London, but not before one final round-up of the three big shows that hit the runway last night.

Try down under", "article": "When Russell Jowett first arrived in Melbourne on a wet Saturday morning, he wondered whether he had made the right decision to leave the UK. The queasiness grew when he moved into a flat opposite a homeless hostel, on a noisy street in St Kilda beach \u2013 a 20-minute tram ride from the city \u2013 where the partying carried on until 3am. &quot;My initial impressions weren&apos;t very good,&quot; said Jowett, who arrived in October, having successfully responded to an ad in the Guardian placed by SMS Management &amp; Technology, an Australian consultancy company, which is sponsoring him. He is now weighing up whether to stay or return to his family home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. At the age of 50, Jowett had decided it was now or never to test the waters Down Under \u2013 an idea he and his wife, Suzanne, 49, had toyed with for some time. There were sound economic reasons. His consultancy projects at GCHQ, the eavesdropping centre in Cheltenham, and for the Serious Organised Crime Agency, were coming to an end in a tightening job market. Nor was he too thrilled at the prospect of living under a Conservative-Lib Dem government. &quot;I felt quite depressed at the election,&quot; says Jowett, as we chat on the 41st floor of an office tower with sweeping views of Melbourne. &quot;The political situation is not in line with my allegiances.&quot; Jowett&apos;s decision to give the southern hemisphere a try reflects the contrasting economic fortunes of Britain and Australia. As the British economy splutters \u2013 it shrank 0.5% in the last quarter of 2010 \u2013 Australia&apos;s is motoring and is expected to grow by 3.5% this year. Unlike the UK and US, Australia has weathered what Australians call &quot;the GFC&quot; (global financial crisis), thanks to solid banking supervision. Now it is riding high on the back of China&apos;s explosive growth and its demand for raw materials. Iron ore, coal, copper and wool account for more than 70% of Australia&apos;s exports to China \u2013 easily its biggest market. So while Britain&apos;s economy flounders, Australia&apos;s is flourishing \u2013 although some commentators caution that it could suffer should China&apos;s economy go off the boil. For the time being, Australia&apos;s boom brings its own problems. It has a skills shortage and is eager to recruit a wide range of professionals and tradespeople, from secondary school teachers to architects, computer experts to nurses and civil engineers to cartographers. It is a long list and the regional areas, in particular, suffer from shortages. The recent floods and hurricane damage in Queensland have only sharpened the need for construction workers. Older professionals such as Jowett should benefit from changes in Australia&apos;s points-based visa system due to come into force in July. The changes \u2013 which continue to give top priority to employers who want to sponsor individual migrants \u2013 will focus on better English language skills, more extensive skilled work experience, higher-level qualifications obtained in Australia and overseas and different age ranges. Australia realises that many people in their mid to late 40s are just reaching the peak of their careers, acquiring the level of expertise it needs. Australia has been a draw for Brits ever since the \u00a310 Poms, an Australian government scheme of assisted passage that brought more than 1 million British migrants. These days programmes such as the BBC&apos;s Wanted Down Under and Relocation: Phil Down Under on Channel 4 serve to pique British curiosity about moving to Australia, although as some of the programmes make clear, the roads in Australia are not necessarily paved with gold. Still, as recession bites, more Brits may be tempted to move abroad for work. It is not just Australia that wants skilled British workers. Singapore touts itself as a unique blend of east and west, a multicultural society with a global outlook where it is easy to adjust and adapt. After establishing itself as a centre for finance and IT, it is now seeking to attract those working in interactive and digital media, biomedical sciences and green technology. It has done a fair job in luring foreign labour, as about one in four skilled workers on the island come from overseas. In recent years, China has also attracted skilled British workers. A report last year called Global Brit, from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), estimated that the percentage of Britons living in China since 2006 jumped by 30% \u2013 albeit from a low base \u2013 and the British population in the UAE grew by 20% in the same period, probably reflecting the greater job opportunities, although Dubai&apos;s bubble burst during the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, other countries such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa are also in the market for skilled expats. Glotel, a recruitment firm for telecommunications engineers and project managers, finds a big demand in those countries for its experts. &quot;At present we are seeing a surge in opportunities within South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina,&quot; says Lee Wilsher, managing director of Glotel. &quot;We have seen a 25% increase year-on-year in the last three years of permanent placements in Brazil, while both Shanghai and Singapore are active markets and there are some great opportunities for the right candidates.&quot; While there are communities of more than 1,000 Britons in more than 100 countries around the world, the big expat populations are in Australia (more than a million), Spain, the US, Canada and France. The IPPR report says most British emigrants move abroad primarily to work \u2013 55% in 2008. They also tend to be younger, better educated and in higher-earning jobs than the general British population. In fact, latest figures show that emigration among professionals and the highly skilled has slowed recently, with greater numbers returning home \u2013 but the UK is still experiencing &quot;brain drain&quot;. On the plus side, though, the UK received about \u00a34.5bn in remittances from abroad in 2006 \u2013 which represents 0.3% of GDP. The drop reflects a waning in a British emigration boom that began in 2000. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the number of people leaving the UK for 12 months or more fell from 427,000 in 2008 to 368,000 in 2009, while an estimated 140,000 British citizens emigrated in 2009, the lowest number since 1999, down from 173,000 in 2008. The IPPR finds that people choose to emigrate mainly because they see opportunities. In other words, it is positive &quot;pull factors&quot; that encourage them to emigrate, not negative &quot;push factors&quot; such as the economic or political situation in the UK. Jowett says, however, that both apply to his case. He loves Melbourne and feels at home after his less than auspicious start in this fast-growing city of 4 million people, with its myriad bars, cafes and restaurants and its terrific, if overburdened, tram system. &quot;It feels very cosmopolitan and very European,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a bit cliched but everybody is friendly. I&apos;m a big sports fan, I&apos;ve watched the Ashes and I&apos;m a keen golfer, so this place really does appeal.&quot; His wife and two children came to visit for three weeks at Christmas and loved it, so the pressure is on him to stay, Jowett says. But there are downsides. Although his salary is higher than in the UK, he finds it counteracted by the cost of living, particularly the high rent. In fact, Melbourne is suffering from its success. A recent survey of housing affordability around the world listed Melbourne near the bottom \u2013 321st out of 325 markets. The Demographic International Housing Affordability Survey put the median Melbourne house price at $565,000 (\u00a3353,823) with the median household income at $63,000. Such prices have prompted some analysts to say Australia has gone from the exemplar of modestly priced, high-quality, middle-class housing to the least affordable housing market in the English-speaking world. A big emotional wrench The popularity of Australia has fluctuated over recent decades. After a drop in popularity during the 1990s, it rose in the 2000s. Australian immigration records show nearly 2,000 Britons a month settled permanently in Australia during the first half of 2006, accounting for one in five long-term immigrants to Australia and more than doubling the British arrival rate of 10 years ago. In 2008-09, 31,882 Britons settled permanently there, but the number dropped to 25,439 in 2009-10. So in thinking of settling permanently in Australia, Jowett is bucking the trend, although if the UK economy is stuck in the doldrums, others may follow his example. Going so far can be a big emotional wrench. Olivia Stuart moved to Australia with her Australian husband in 2009 from Linlithgow, Scotland, mainly for the sake of their three boys, aged nine, six and four. She works as a GP in Wangaratta, two-and-a-half hours from Melbourne. They love the outdoor life, Stuart enjoys her work and they feel relieved to be in a strong economy, unlike their friends and family back home. &quot;Every GP clinic in town would like another doctor,&quot; says Stuart. &quot;The hard bit is it&apos;s a long way back and it&apos;s expensive. We miss family and friends, but you just have to accept that.&quot; She also warns that dealing with the paperwork is an ordeal. &quot;If you don&apos;t like paperwork don&apos;t emigrate,&quot; she says. &quot;It took three months to become a GP, even though there is a big shortage. There are a lot of bureaucratic hoops.&quot; Jowett, who was born in Barnsley, says he misses walking in the Yorkshire Dales and Peak District and most of all watching Barnsley, his football team, where he had a season ticket. But overall, he has not been disappointed. &quot;We always wanted to travel and have done a lot of travelling,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;d been thinking of moving here and at this time of my life, it was either moving to Australia or buying a motor bike.&quot; How countries compare Singapore Population: 4.8 million. Outlook: Economy estimated to have expanded by 14.7% in 2010, surpassing even China&apos;s rate. Expansion in 2011 expected to be a more restrained 4.3%. Who they need: Digital media experts; bioscientists/engineers; accounting/financial managers. System of entry: Advance job offer needed to get a work permit or an employment pass. Downside: The government doesn&apos;t brook much argument over its policies. Canada Population: 33.4 million. Outlook: Recovering from recession, but strong growth forecasts threatened by a looming population shortage. Hence the urgent requirement for more workers and citizens generally. Who they need: Who don&apos;t they need? Healthcare, IT and skilled tradespeople among the most sought-after, but many more on the list. System of entry: Points-based. Downside: Isolation can be a problem in the world&apos;s second-biggest territory. Qatar Population: 1.4 million. Outlook: Has one of the world&apos;s highest per capita GDP rates and a fast rate of economic growth. Who they need: Healthcare workers; engineers to work on gas field expansion and 2022 World Cup stadiums. System of entry: Similar to Singapore \u2013 but spouses must get their own employment pass if they want to work too. Downside: 40C temperatures are common in the summer months. China Population: 1.3 billion. Outlook: Nouriel Roubini, the economist who saw the 2008 financial crisis coming, believes the world&apos;s second-biggest economy is overheating. Only a stronger yuan can help cool the economy and bring down inflation, he says. Who they need: English teachers; entrepreneurial people who can facilitate trade with western companies. System of entry: Z visa, normally issued once job has been offered. Downsides: As Singapore but worse; difficult language to learn.", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Job hunting", "Money", "Recession", "Business", "Australia holidays", "Travel", "Guardian Careers"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-19T00:01:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/19/blue-dragon-review", "sentences": ["Pierre Lamontagne, a conceptual artist in the trilogy, is now a Shanghai gallery owner who has fled what he sees as French-Canadian parochialism.", "Marie Michaud&apos;s Claire is an intelligent woman but one who brings her own consumerist values to Shanghai."], "title": "Blue Dragon - review", "article": "Robert Lepage made his name internationally with The Dragons&apos; Trilogy, created in 1985. Now he returns to the subject of the cultural collision of east and west in what he calls a spin-off rather than a sequel. As a two-hour, three-character piece, it is slimmer and subtler than its forbear; and, which is not always true of Lepage, it offers an ideal marriage of form and content. The focus of the story, written by Marie Michaud and Lepage himself, is a fraught triangular relationship. Pierre Lamontagne, a conceptual artist in the trilogy, is now a Shanghai gallery owner who has fled what he sees as French-Canadian parochialism. He is visited by former wife Claire, who comes to China to try to adopt a child. And she finds herself befriending Xiao Ling, who is Pierre&apos;s mistress and pregnant with his child. How this is resolved is an intricate business in which we are offered a choice of three possible endings. But the personal story acts as a metaphor for a critique of two cultures which shows modern China adopting some of the worst features of western capitalism. TV ads use heroic images of the past to promote Kentucky Fried Chicken, Xiao Ling is transformed from an artist into a copyist turning out endless versions of a Van Gogh self-portrait, and Pierre&apos;s apartment is being requisitioned for ruthless urban development. The play makes it clear we share the burden of guilt. Not only does Claire imagine she can turn up in China and buy a baby, but Pierre treats his mistress more as an exquisite doll than a sentient human being. Where the trilogy often felt like a decorative soap, this is a more slyly political piece. But Lepage&apos;s production and Michel Gauthier&apos;s design, while questioning eastern values, also have a consummate delicacy and cinematic fluency. Performed in French, English and Mandarin, the piece offers us Chinese calligraphy and dance, beautiful images of miniaturised, high-speed trains and traditional bicycles, and swift transitions from Pierre&apos;s studio flat to stations, airports and bars. You feel that Lepage, while critical of the east, is also hypnotised by its aesthetic. The piece gains greatly from being performed by its creators. Lepage lends Pierre a sense of isolation as if the character is using China as a refuge from his own artistic failures. Marie Michaud&apos;s Claire is an intelligent woman but one who brings her own consumerist values to Shanghai. And Tai Wei Foo is not only responsible for the choreography, but captures the dilemma of a woman bringing a child into a world where fertility is state-controlled. The result is a resonant fable in which neither eastern nor western values emerge unscathed.", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-19T00:26:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/20/intercontinental-hotels-china-expansion", "sentences": ["Everyone from Tesco to Diageo and Durex wants to get in on the economic boom in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.", "Last year, InterContinental opened 24 hotels in China \u2013 including one on Shanghai&apos;s Bund waterfront."], "title": "InterContinental Hotels has room for manoeuvre in China", "article": "Just about every decent hotel in the world offers a succulent hamburger on its room service menu. Before much longer, a Chinese dish could be a similar staple. The world&apos;s largest hotels company, InterContinental, is working on plans for a Chinese-style international brand in another signal of the importance of the yuan to global business. InterContinental reckons that Chinese demand for hotel rooms will overtake demand from the United States by 2025. The Chinese took an estimated 52m international trips last year and 2.1bn overnight trips within their own country \u2013 a figure likely to rise to 6bn by 2020. The British company doesn&apos;t want to divulge details. But perhaps a Chinese brand could look a little bit like the Hong Kong-based Shangri-La chain, which offers Asian flair and is to open a London hotel next year in the capital&apos;s new &quot;shard of glass&quot; skyscraper. The Chinese public can&apos;t get enough of labels \u2013 49% of them believe branded goods are superior to non-branded, compared to just 9% of Brits and 16% of Americans. A new chain would have hotels throughout China and in markets where the Chinese travel in numbers. The opportunity looks compelling: the proportion of hotel rooms to people in China is just 0.003, compared to 0.015 in the US. Buckinghamshire-based InterContinental, which was once part of the Bass brewing empire, is a curiously unheralded British success story. It spans 4,400 hotels around the world \u2013 including the global Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza chains \u2013 and has enough rooms to accommodate the population of Glasgow without anybody sharing. But the company tends not to shout about being British. It&apos;s quite happy for customers at Holiday Inns to sleep soundly in the belief that the brand is as American as apple pie. Of course, the folks in Buckinghamshire don&apos;t actually manage all those Holiday Inns. The vast majority of the group&apos;s hotels are franchised, run on a largely independent basis by owner-managers who simply pay a fee to use InterContinental&apos;s brands. So InterContinental&apos;s job is largely one of marketing, with a bit of quality control thrown in, and running an all-important global reservations system. The key to the hotels game is consistency. Wherever they may be, regular visitors who check in at a Holiday Inn or a Crowne Plaza want the same television channels, marble bathroom and room service staples. They can even sniff the same scent (a mixture of ginger, white tea, citrus and musk) in Holiday Inn reception areas. Robert Barnard, a hotels expert at the consultancy firm PKF, says: &quot;The broad standard is that a Holiday Inn in Buenos Aires should look the same as a Holiday Inn in Swindon.&quot; InterContinental seems to know what it&apos;s doing \u2013 its shares have surged 56% in a year and profits, announced this week, were up 24% to \u00a3239m. We&apos;ve heard any number of companies waffling about the fantastic opportunity of China and, indeed the rest of the Bric nations (Brazil, Russia and India). Everyone from Tesco to Diageo and Durex wants to get in on the economic boom in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Two decades ago, fewer than 10% of Americans had passports. The proportion has grown to more than 25%. Who&apos;s to say that something similar won&apos;t happen in China? Scale, marketing muscle and recognition are vital in the hotels business. Last year, InterContinental opened 24 hotels in China \u2013 including one on Shanghai&apos;s Bund waterfront. Here&apos;s a British company with a decent chance of cracking the yuan. UK Uncut doing what the Treasury will not As if we needed further proof that the government&apos;s Project Merlin pact with banks was nothing more than wishy-washy sophistry, news has broken this weekend that Barclays paid a paltry \u00a3113m of corporation tax on its \u00a311.6bn of annual profit. That&apos;s a rate of just 1% \u2013 a level far lower than the headline rate of corporation tax in Ireland or\u00a0Monaco. This has emerged at an awkward time for Barclays \u2013 the revelation, obtained by Labour MP Chuka Umunna, comes as UK Uncut tax protesters plan their latest assault on the bank&apos;s branches. Protests to date have included turning one London branch into a library to contrast high-rolling bank profits with the closure of local public services. A breakfast club for children and stand-up comedy are also being planned to liven up the usual cheque-cashing activities in other Barclays outlets. Barclays points out that it makes money all over the world \u2013 in more than 50 countries \u2013 and that by no means all its businesses are eligible for UK tax. And it has legitimate losses to offset against taxation, including bad loans and the cost of complying with requirements for a much deeper liquidity buffer. The bank&apos;s total bill from HM Revenue &amp; Customs was \u00a32bn \u2013 but the vast majority of this was payroll tax deducted from its employees&apos; wages. On George Osborne&apos;s watch, banks are getting a very light squeeze, equivalent to being pinched on their little fingers. The industry will be obliged to hand over \u00a32.5bn in a one-off levy on their assets. But Alistair Darling&apos;s bonus tax hasn&apos;t been revived. A bank, like any other major corporation, will always try to minimise its tax bill. There&apos;s nothing illegal about using complex ruses to shuffle around assets and filter certain transactions through offshore centres. But it&apos;s another respect in which the interests of banks&apos; shareholders diverge from the interests of the public. And UK Uncut&apos;s small army of campaigners dressed as Robin Hood are firing a much more effective warning shot across banks&apos; bows than any of the Treasury&apos;s policies. National Express back on track Hats off to Dean Finch, chief executive of National Express, who has steered the transport company back from a near-death experience when its east coast mainline rail franchise hit the financial buffers two years ago. The Birmingham-based firm is set to deliver a solid \u00a3160m of underlying 2010 profits this week, bouncing back from \u00a383.5m losses a year ago. It will restore dividends after a two-year gap. Since Finch came, National Express has made peace with the government \u2013 which had tried to run the company off the railways when it reneged on its London-to-Edinburgh franchise. Wisely, Finch opted to steer clear of more long-distance rail but National Express has won extensions to its East Anglia and c2c commuter franchises. New management is tidying up the local bus operation and expansion is on the cards in Spain and Morocco. The firm is even talking of bidding to run new rail links in Florida and Portugal. It&apos;s a far cry from a \u00a3350m rescue rights issue in 2009, when National Express struggled to fight off bidders. Finch should have enough gas in the tank to see off an opportunistic US hedge fund, Elliott Management, which has chosen an odd moment to start muttering about a break-up.", "tags": ["InterContinental Hotels", "Travel & leisure", "China", "Executive pay and bonuses", "Business", "National Express", "Barclays", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-20T00:01:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/feb/20/maggie-keswick-jencks-centres-cancer-design", "sentences": ["Her background was not only privileged, it was exotic \u2013 divided between Scotland, Shanghai and Hong Kong.", "Her father was a remarkable tycoon who, during the communist takeover of Shanghai, unlike most Europeans stayed on to help feed a starving population."], "title": "Maggie's centres: how one woman's vision is changing cancer treatment", "article": "When Maggie Keswick Jencks was 47 she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Five years later she started to have severe back pain and, after two misdiagnoses, went to her local GP&apos;s surgery in Dumfries where she was told the cancer had spread to her bones, liver and bone marrow. In a home video, made for her mother, she described what happened next. She and her husband were told to see a visiting Edinburgh consultant. They waited in an &quot;awful interior space&quot; with neon lighting and then the nurse told them to come in. They asked: &quot;How long have we got?&quot; To which the doctor said: &quot;Do you really want to know?&quot; &quot;Yes we really want to know.&quot; &quot;Two to three months.&quot; &quot;Oh\u2026!&quot; And then the nurse explained. &quot;I&apos;m very sorry, dear, but we&apos;ll have to move you out into the corridor, we have so many people waiting.&quot; They sat in a &quot;windowless corridor trying to deal with this business, having two to three months to live. And as we sat there, various nurses who I knew came up and said, very cheerfully, &apos;Hello dear, how are you?&apos; &apos;Well,&apos; managing a laugh, &apos;I&apos;m fine!&apos;&quot; This was the story that became Maggie&apos;s spur \u2013 the NHS corridor that would lead to her big idea. There might be no cure for Maggie&apos;s cancer but here was something that could be changed. Why shunt people with cancer into miserable surroundings? Didn&apos;t people need respect, time and space? With the support of her young nurse, Laura Lee, Maggie would devote the rest of her life to planning a cancer caring centre. She had a feel for what was needed and the drive and money, as daughter of the director of the Scottish trading company Jardine Matheson, to do something about it. She understood the need to feel in charge (not a helpless passenger in a hospital production line). She realised people might want to find out more about their treatment options. And she knew a beautiful space was needed in which to digest even the worst of news. She envisaged a room with a view \u2013 and a library. And she argued for an &quot;old-fashioned ladies&apos; room \u2013 not a partitioned toilet in a row&quot;. This would supply &quot;privacy for crying, water for washing the face, and a mirror for getting ready to deal with the world outside again&quot;. She knew that, in a crisis, everything counts, even \u2013 or especially \u2013 the little things. &quot;Little&quot; does not describe what has happened in the 15 years since her death: her idea has taken off. Today, there are 15 centres \u2013 seven up and running, seven in the pipeline (opening before 2012) and one online (a V&amp;A display this month celebrates the achievement). Yet Maggie&apos;s centres are anything but pushy: they are only ever built at the invitation of NHS Trusts and, usually, in the grounds of hospitals with oncology departments. Unsurprisingly, hospitals recognise they need them and architects are queuing up to build them. And the existing centres have tremendous architectural prestige (Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Page and Park have all designed one). But they are about far more than architecture for architecture&apos;s sake. Above all, they remind us that it is not frivolous to care about design. And this year the British Medical Association is also, at last, acknowledging architecture&apos;s importance as an ingredient in recovery. It is calling on healthcare organisations to &quot;prioritise design in future building projects&quot; after a new report showed that &quot;architectural environment can significantly affect patients&apos; recovery times.&quot; We are \u2013 to some extent \u2013 what we see. I visited London&apos;s Maggie&apos;s centre for the first time last summer. Designed by architects Richard Rogers and Ivan Harbour of Rogers Stirk Harbour, it is audaciously beautiful. When you approach it from Fulham Palace Road, you notice it has turned its back on the ugly facade of Charing Cross hospital. It is painted orange in defiance of London&apos;s greyness and bad news in all its forms. And its extraordinary roof looks as though it has levitated. The whole building is serenely irrepressible. What is so winning is that it feels like home (although more elegant than any I know) and yet is an in-between space. It is not a retreat or a hospice or a clinic \u2013 it is a drop-in centre and it is free. It offers information, advice on nutrition, relaxation classes and a psychologist for anyone needing to talk about the most intractable subjects (depression, fear of dying, dread of cancer returning and other issues not easy to address in a hospital environment). On the day I visited, the building was full of sunlight. I loved its attention to detail: the bowl of fruit on the kitchen table, the sunhats on pegs in the hall, the lack of signs bossily telling you where to go. And this is the key: you decide what to make of a Maggie&apos;s centre. You can walk in and out unnoticed if that is what you prefer. It is perfect for company \u2013 or contemplation. I visited at a time when one of my friends was dying of cancer in another country and kept thinking what it would mean to her to have such a place on her doorstep. While I was there, I also found myself thinking about Maggie, as anyone with even a scrap of curiosity visiting her centres must. I wanted to know more about her. Photographs show a slender, vivid woman with dark curly hair and a dreamer&apos;s face when not smiling to camera. One can see the pluck in Maggie, especially in a picture taken at a Scottish picnic, just after her diagnosis \u2013 a blaze of a smile on her face, no shadow in sight. I had four people in mind to help me bring her into view: her husband, the writer and landscape architect Charles Jencks, her former nurse, Laura Lee, one of her many friends, Anne Chisholm, and her daughter, Lily. But what I could not predict was that meeting Lily would turn out to be as close to encountering Maggie as could be imagined. Friends exclaim at the likeness between them. And this pleases Lily. She is also following in both her parents&apos; footsteps in having taken up landscape architecture as a career. She designed the garden for Frank Gehry&apos;s Hong Kong Maggie&apos;s centre and is now working, with Rotterdam architect Rem Koolhaas on the garden for Glasgow&apos;s second centre. Whenever she pictures her mother, she recalls her wearing a green velvet floppy hat &quot;like one of Jamiroquai&apos;s&quot;. She has the hat but never wears it. &quot;My friends try it on all the time.&quot; She ought, she says, laughing, to share it with her elder brother, John (who runs a film production company), as it is &quot;iconic&quot;. When I ask about the last two years of her mother&apos;s life, she remembers how hard it was to talk about cancer. In some ways, it still is. Lily is 30 now but was 13 then \u2013 a &quot;nightmarish&quot; age: &quot;You can&apos;t hide anything from a 13-year-old.&quot; No one told her what had been said in that Dumfries surgery. But she knew. &quot;Yet, as you know, my mother went on to live for another two years.&quot; She is gentle and unjudgmental about her mother and herself. She understands how hard it was for Maggie to know what to say. Lily remembers her coming into her bedroom to show her hair falling out in clumps. She tried to be honest. She wanted Lily to understand. Yet the need for reassurance was mutual. Lily remembers a car journey to family friends during which Maggie asked her daughter how she looked. Lily said &quot;healthy and full of life&quot;. It was only when she heard her mother repeating this verdict, with obvious pleasure, that &quot;I realised how sick she actually was&quot;. And there was no Maggie&apos;s centre to help them navigate (let alone what is now being piloted in Maggie&apos;s Dundee \u2013 a support programme specifically directed at teenagers). As a mother, Maggie was &quot;sensitive&quot; and &quot;careful to spend special time with us alone and was always trying to be aware of our feelings \u2013 in case that space got lost in everyday life&quot;. Lily remembers cycling with her mother at a time when the effort to be on a bike must have been great but she gave no sign of it. She also remembers how Maggie&apos;s bed was often strewn with papers when she was very sick. It is only now she realises they were her precious blueprints for the first centre. &quot;She was very concerned about them,&quot; Lily recalls. It is a tribute to Maggie that her family, her nurse and many friends (some of them architects) have all, after her death, become involved in the centres, as if to keep faith with her. Laura Lee was a young nurse working at the breast chemotherapy suite at the Western General in Edinburgh when they met. She is now CEO of the centres. She is warm and engaging. It is easy to see why Maggie loved her. She does her job impressively too. &quot;The landscape of cancer is changing,&quot; she explains, &quot;because more people are surviving. Those with a recurrence live longer. The need for these centres has never been greater because people are living with cancer as a part of life.&quot; Laura explains that the centres are funded by investors and public fundraising and tells me about the many and inventive initiatives (such as an annual, sponsored 20-mile night hike through London). Everyone says that Lee is a dynamo without whom the centres could not flourish as they do. Laura remembers the moment at which her friendship with Maggie became &quot;professional&quot; and a shared mission: they travelled the UK and USA researching cancer care centres. Looking back, Laura had no idea of the scale of what they were starting. Her first impression of Maggie and Charles as a couple was that they had tremendous presence. She found Maggie gentle, polite and &quot;not at all passive&quot;. She wanted to know whether she should &quot;go with the sense that her body was deteriorating and weak&quot;. She took an intense interest in her treatment. Understandably, her first reaction after the grim Dumfries prognosis had been to give up. But while she was retreating, her husband was in fast-forward, combing the world for cures. In her gallant essay &quot;A view from the front line&quot; (required reading for anyone interested in Maggie or in arming themselves against cancer), she describes the effort of will it took to fight on, and why it was hard: &quot;deciding to give up the certainty of death for the uncertain prospect of a stay of execution: if I got into the fighting mode, and it failed, would I ever get back to this precariously balanced acceptance?&quot; But there came a moment for Maggie and Charles when they, simultaneously, realised they would do everything they could to prolong her life. And Maggie wanted to win more time for her young children&apos;s sake as well as for her own. The breakthrough was discovering that Dr Robert Leonard, at the Western General, was conducting a trial in advanced metastatic breast cancer (high-dose chemo and stem-cell replacement), for which Maggie was suitable. This \u2013 and her whole-hearted and intelligent involvement in diet and complementary treatment alongside it \u2013 would win her almost two more years. Maggie tended to be positive. She once wrote that the goal for people in her situation \u2013 not easy to achieve \u2013 was to try not to &quot;lose the joy of living in the fear of dying&quot; \u2013 words that have become a catchphrase at her centres. Laura thinks that her focus was always on the luck she had in life. When first diagnosed with breast cancer, she saw the cancer almost as a paying of dues for her privileged life. Maggie was born in 1941. Her background was not only privileged, it was exotic \u2013 divided between Scotland, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Her father was a remarkable tycoon who, during the communist takeover of Shanghai, unlike most Europeans stayed on to help feed a starving population. He was rich but also philanthropic. And he spoke fluent Chinese. Maggie was an adored only child and might easily have been spoilt. But she never was. She was raised a Catholic (becoming, according to her husband, more of a Buddhist/Catholic later in life). She was educated at Woldingham in Surrey and at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she read English. Anne Chisholm met her at university and remembers her as &quot;light on her feet, buoyant, vividly alive. While the rest of us were creeping around in various stages of lumpishness, here was this dazzling creature \u2013 much more stylish than any of us, she could lift a room.&quot; Maggie would cook Chinese delicacies in the pantry at her college. The oriental drifted into her dress sense too. She would train a Chinese scarf across her chin, securing it with a knot (in the rum fashion of the time). She was clever, funny, a good listener and a performer (acting in student productions with Esther Rantzen as co-thespian). She sang well and could quote yards of poetry by heart. She was an attractive mixture: an empathetic extrovert. In 1965, after leaving university, she and a friend launched a boutique, Annacat (named after their dogs). The look, according to Chisholm, was &quot;daughter of Mary Quant&quot;. Jencks remembers it more as &quot;Victorian freestyle&quot; (like some outlandish swimming stroke). At that time, Maggie became &quot;a celebrity with the smallest of cs&quot; (in a photograph by David Bailey, she looks the embodiment of the Swinging 60s). But fashion would prove too insubstantial for her. In 1970, she joined the Architectural Association and met Charles Jencks, an American architectural writer and landscape architect teaching there. He remembers how vivacious she was. But he adds: &quot;The thing about Maggie is that she was vulnerable.&quot; She was insecure about her looks, did not believe in the beauty others saw in her. She&apos;d spend ages trying to get her clothes right \u2013 and be late for dinner. She tended to be late generally. But people warmed to her because as her husband says: &apos;More than almost anyone I&apos;ve met, she had a liking for people and they felt that in her.&quot; In 1978, the year in which she married, she published a scholarly book on Chinese gardens. Scotland was always important to her \u2013 but China was to be the defining influence. Jencks remembers she made several solo research trips to China, once bringing back for him memorably inconvenient souvenirs: Chinese bullet-hole rocks (called &quot;Scholars Rocks&quot;) and &quot;according to ancient custom&quot; a pet cricket in a tiny wooden box which she kept in her blouse and which, during its brief life, drove him crazy. Charles and Maggie understood each other well. Anne Chisholm says Maggie &quot;adored Charlie and his ideas&quot;. And she acknowledged that she would not have produced her book without his help. She described herself as a &quot;creative ditherer&quot; \u2013 a perfectionist. As she wrote in her acknowledgements, &quot;without his constant badgering and insistence, I should still be on Chapter One.&quot; Chinese gardens are seldom written about (Japanese gardens tend to steal the show) but Maggie put these gardens firmly on the map and lectured about them around the world. She described Chinese gardens as &quot;cosmic diagrams, revealing a profound and ancient view of the world, and of man&apos;s place in it&quot;. And, strange as it might seem, the passion for Chinese gardens has influenced the Maggie&apos;s centres. The sense of the cosmic diagram, the belief that architecture \u2013 and gardens \u2013 have meaning is essential to understanding Maggie, her husband and the way the centres have evolved. Charles Jencks is a man of tremendous charm and playful erudition (he has dubbed the game of looking round the house he shared with Maggie in London&apos;s Notting Hill as &quot;hunt the symbol&quot;.) He describes the home, which has become a postmodern landmark, as cosmic. And it is extraordinary to visit it because nothing in it is idly itself. The stairs are an &quot;abstract realisation of the solar year&quot;. Maggie&apos;s kitchen represents Indian summer. Even the loo has its story. It is wonderful in a way. But it must be exhaustingly inexhaustible to live in it. Apparently, Maggie once said: &quot;I understand, Charles, everything has to symbolise something but symbolism stops at my door.&quot; He followed her prohibition to the letter \u2013 literally. We inspect Maggie&apos;s door \u2013 with a carved letter M and open book. And then he shows me her desk which, to his delight, shows her breaking her own rule. She painted it in Johnston tartan: greens and blues with a yellow stripe \u2013 as symbolic as could be. Maggie&apos;s centres have their &quot;meaning&quot; too \u2013 but of a more instantly graspable sort. &quot;They are,&quot; Jencks says, &quot;to do with the way living and dying are part of one thing.&quot; There is, he goes on, nothing new about the overlap between health and culture. He cites Hospices de Beaunes and Stonehenge (now thought by some to have been a healing centre) in the sweep of his argument. And in his delightful new book The Architecture of Hope, you can see that each Maggie&apos;s centre is different \u2013 it is up to visitors to settle on individual meanings. Maggie would have loved unravelling the thinking behind each centre: Frank Gehry&apos;s homely centre in Dundee looks as if a child made its roof out of folded foil (you want to pat it); Zaha Hadid&apos;s in Fife, with its shark-like exterior made of sparkling silicone carbide grit, allows its visitors to move, in a boldly metaphorical way, from darkness to light; Page and Park&apos;s ingenious Inverness centre has a green copper roof and a design based on the idea of a dividing cell. And six new centres are planned to be built before 2012 \u2013 Wilkinson Eyre&apos;s tree house, which goes on site in Oxford next year, is my favourite: leafily escapist. But the place that is perhaps Maggie&apos;s most personal memorial is not one of her centres at all. It is Portrack, the 18th-century country house in Dumfriesshire she inherited from her parents where, with Charles, she designed a garden now dedicated to her memory. It is a most awe-inspiring place with 60ft manmade mounds and vast lakes, a dramatic discourse between water and land and a swirling exchange of shapes (the lakes were Maggie&apos;s design). And it is this place that keeps coming up in conversation. Anne recalls seeing Maggie at Portrack, in her last year and watching her &quot;running up one of the mounds as if she was 20 years old, with nothing wrong with her&quot;. Lily can still picture her mother, out in the garden, sketching. And Laura remembers sitting with Maggie at the top of one of the hills, with the sun on their faces. They didn&apos;t talk about death, she says, they did not need to, it was understood. Maggie died on 8 July, 1995. &quot;I remember running away from the hospital,&quot; Lily says. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe birds were still singing, the world turning. I remember watching, in disbelief, as someone crossed the road as if nothing had happened.&quot; Every morning, she would wake and, for a second, not know her mother had gone \u2013 and then the news would hit her again. Even now, she gets upset about it \u2013 although she never can predict when she will be ambushed. She would like to be able to ask her mother&apos;s advice about the big decisions in her life. She minds that, when she has children herself, they will not have a grandmother. She remembers now how tiring grief was. And, although that has lifted: &quot;I don&apos;t think the pain goes away, you just get used to it. There is a hole inside of me but I know it is part of me.&quot; It is winter when I return to the London centre. I walk through Dan Pearson&apos;s garden which is planted with 100 birches and runs parallel to one of London&apos;s most polluted roads \u2013 it seems an act of faith in itself. Some shy hellebores are flowering and Hannah Bennett&apos;s smooth sculptures stand out like polished melons \u2013 not stepping but sitting stones. Inside, there is a fire in a wood-burning stove and waiting logs, stacked neatly behind glass, are a heartening sight. It is marvellously peaceful. Lily tells me she is often asked, by visitors at the centres, about her mother. &quot;People are really happy to meet me which is so touching. They want to know what Maggie was like.&quot; And oddly enough, one of the visitors, while I am there, looks up from the computer \u2013 she must have heard me talking \u2013 and asks whether I knew Maggie. I hesitate. I am tempted to say: &quot;Yes.&quot;", "tags": ["Maggie's Cancer Caring Centres", "Architecture", "Cancer", "Art and design", "Culture", "Richard Rogers", "Frank Gehry", "Zaha Hadid", "Design", "Gardens", "Health", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-20T00:03:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/20/chinese-officials-detain-activists-protests", "sentences": ["Despite a huge police presence at the proposed demonstration locations, there were signs that at least a handful of people in Beijing and Shanghai had hoped to protest.", "Unusually, Xinhua reported that police had detained three people after crowds gathered at the People&apos;s Square in Shanghai."], "title": "China detains activists after online call for protests", "article": "Chinese security officials have questioned or detained scores of activists and warned others against staging protests after an online call was made for demonstrations in 13 cities, campaigners said.

The Xinhua state news agency said the meeting in Beijing was to help leaders to understand &quot;new changes and characteristics in the domestic and international situations&quot;. Despite a huge police presence at the proposed demonstration locations, there were signs that at least a handful of people in Beijing and Shanghai had hoped to protest.

The Hong Kong-based Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy estimated that more than 100 activists across the country were taken away by police, prevented from leaving home or were missing. Wang Songlian, of the Chinese Human Rights Defenders network, said more than 40 campaigners or dissidents had been summoned or questioned by police or placed under &quot;soft detention&quot; at home or elsewhere. In many more cases, police had visited people to ask them what they were doing or warn them not to take part, she said. &quot;[The message] linked it to the jasmine revolution and I guess that made the government nervous,&quot; she added. &quot;It really shows us how much the government has identified with regimes in the middle east where people are so aggrieved about social injustice.&quot; She added that the disappearance of some individuals, such as the lawyer Jiang Tianyong, might be linked to attempts to support the legal activist Chen Guangcheng rather than the call for protests. In Beijing, security officers attempted to detain one man holding jasmine flowers at the planned protest site, but let him go after he was swarmed by journalists. The Associated Press named him as 25-year-old Liu Xiaobai, who told them: &quot;I just put down some white flowers, what&apos;s wrong with that? I&apos;m just a normal citizen and I just want peace.&quot; Other witnesses said he had picked the flowers out of a rubbish bin a few moments before. Officers also took away two other people, one of whom was shouting, although it was not clear whether they were protestors. One bystander said: &quot;I was here for the demonstration, but there were so many police. &quot;There&apos;s no freedom, and the government don&apos;t care about us ordinary people. But what can you do?&quot; Another said: &quot;It didn&apos;t work. But it will happen. Maybe you have to look 10 years out in the future, but it will.&quot; But the majority of the large crowd appeared to be curious shoppers attracted by the large police and media presence. Unusually, Xinhua reported that police had detained three people after crowds gathered at the People&apos;s Square in Shanghai. China&apos;s most popular microblog blocked searches for &quot;jasmine&quot; and attempts to include the word in status updates on a social networking site were greeted with a warning to refrain from inappropriate postings. The rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, who said he was being followed, said: &quot;I personally think it&apos;s difficult to change a government in China. &quot;But today&apos;s gathering shows some changes in our society and also builds and strengthens people&apos;s minds. It doesn&apos;t help if the government controls some dissidents, because this gathering is self-organiaed. &quot;But I hope both protesters and police are peaceful. It&apos;s very important to be legal.&quot; Nicholas Bequelin, the Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;I think it is significant, not in terms of whether it is going to topple the political system, but in indicating China is not immune from larger global trends about the impact of new communications on people&apos;s aspirations.&quot; He pointed out that while there were a lot of protests in China, most related to specific grievances. But Li Jinsong, a rights lawyer, told AFP he did not believe the call had been serious. &quot;By taking this so seriously, police are showing how concerned they are that the jasmine revolution could influence China&apos;s social stability,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["China", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-20T14:34:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/20/unrest-morocco-iran-algeria-yemen-china", "sentences": ["&quot;It really shows us how much the government has identified with regimes in the Middle East where people are so aggrieved about social injustice.&quot; Despite a huge police presence at the proposed demonstration locations, there were signs that at least a handful of people in Beijing and Shanghai had hoped to protest."], "title": "Anger on the streets: unrest in Iran, Algeria, Yemen, Morocco and China", "article": "Morocco: Peaceful protests against prime minister Thousands took to the streets of Rabat, Casablanca, Tangier and Marrakech in peaceful protests demanding a new constitution, a change in government and an end to corruption. Sunday&apos;s protests were a test for King Mohamed VI&apos;s regime, which boasts that it is more liberal and tolerant than other countries in the region that have seen violence and revolution. Despite a heavy secret police presence, uniformed police stayed in the background as demonstrators carefully avoided overt criticism of the king or Islamist chanting. &quot;Where has the money gone?&quot;, &quot;The people of Morocco want change&quot; and &quot;We need a new constitution&quot; were among the cries of 5,000 marchers in the capital, Rabat. &quot;The atmosphere today is peaceful, as it is in our Moroccan nature to be peaceful,&quot; a 50-year-old doctor, Mohamed Bebakri, said. Said Benjibli, the creator of Facebook protest group and one of the few prepared to complain about the monarch, said: &quot;The king has too much power and he needs to distribute more money to the people.&quot; Much of the rage was directed against prime minister Abbas El Fassi and his many family members in government posts. Iran: Thousands dispersed with teargas and batons Riot police and plainclothed basiji militia fired teargas and wielded batons to disperse thousands of defiant protesters commemorating the death of two pro-democracy demonstrators killed during anti-government protests last week. Supporters of the Green Movement gathered in scattered groups for the second time within a week to denounce the death of Saane Zhaleh, 26, and Mohammadi Mokhtari, 22, who were killed in Tehran on Monday. An opposition website affiliated to Mehdi Karroubi, a former presidential candidate, said that one person had been killed in Haft-e-Tir square in central Tehran when security forces opened fire at protesters. Dozens were arrested. Iran&apos;s IRNA state news agency reported that Faezeh Rafsanjani, the daughter of influential cleric and former president Hashemi Rafsanjani, had been arrested in Tehran but semi-official FARS news agency reported later that she had been released. Iran had banned foreign media based in Tehran from reporting the protest. Instead, the opposition turned to social networking websites to spread their voice. Opposition websites claimed the protests reached other big cities, including Shiraz, Isfahan, Tabriz, Mashhad and Sanandaj with scenes similar to those in the capital, Tehran. The Green Wave opposition grouo announced that Ahmad Maleki, the vice-consulate at the consulate general of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Milan, had defected. He is the forth diplomat to defect since Iran&apos;s post-election unrest in 2009. Algeria: Police separate crowds with clubs and shields  Police thwarted a rally by thousands of pro-democracy supporters, breaking up the crowd into isolated groups to keep them from marching. Police brandishing clubs, but no firearms, weaved their way through the crowd in central Algiers, banging their shields, tackling some protesters and keeping traffic flowing through the planned march route. A demonstrating politician was hospitalised after suffering a head wound when he fell after police kicked and hit him, colleagues said. The gathering, organised by the Coordination for Democratic Change in Algeria, comes a week after a similar protest, which organisers said brought an estimated 10,000 people and up to 26,000 riot police on to the streets of Algiers. Algeria has also been hit by numerous strikes over the past month. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has promised to lift the state of emergency, which has been in place since early 1992 to combat a budding insurgency by Islamist extremists. The insurgency, which continues sporadically, has killed about 200,000 people. Bouteflika has warned, however, that a longstanding ban on protests in Algiers would remain in place, even once the state of emergency was lifted. Algeria has many of the ingredients for a popular revolt. It is riddled with corruption and has never successfully grappled with its soaring jobless rate among its youth, estimated by some to be up to 42% despite its oil and gas wealth. &quot;The people are for change, but peacefully,&quot; said sociologist Nasser Djebbi. &quot;We have paid a high price.&quot; Yemen: Unrest continues for ninth consecutive day The leader of Yemen&apos;s secessionist Southern Movement, Hasan Baoum, was arrested by an &quot;armed military group&quot; in an Aden hospital, according to his son, and shots were fired at a demonstration in the capital Sana&apos;a, as unrest continued for a ninth consecutive day. Thousands of people also staged sit-ins in the cities of Ibb and Taiz, demanding the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who renewed his call for opposition parties to pursue a dialogue with the government. Security in the southern port of Aden was stepped up with tanks and armoured vehicles out on the main streets. China: Crackdown after call for &apos;jasmine revolution&apos;  Chinese security officials questioned or detained scores of activists at the weekend and warned others against staging protests after an online call was made for demonstrations in 13 cities, campaigners said.

Or a container ship as long as the Empire State building and as wide as an eight-lane motorway that is able to carry more than 860m bananas or 18m flat-screen televisions in 18,000 containers. The sheer scale and capacity of what will be the largest vessels afloat \u2013 the first 10 of which were ordered on Monday by Danish shipping firm Maersk \u2013 is likely to change international shipping in the same way that the super-jumbo is revolutionising air transport or high-speed rail has changed the way people travel across continents. While at 400m long and 73m tall the new &quot;Triple-E&quot; container ships will be only marginally longer and taller than the current biggest class of vessel, the 160,000-tonne ships will be able to carry nearly 20% more containers than previously because of their width. Maersk has signed a $1.9bn (\u00a31.17bn) contract with Korean shipbuilders Daewoo for the first 10, with an option for 20 more. The first order will be completed in two to four years. The company hopes to be able to cut the cost of transporting a container from China to Europe by 26%. &quot;These are probably the largest ships you will see built for some years. We could have made them longer but ports would have had to be enlarged. We could not make them wider because port cranes can only reach across 23 or 24 containers,&quot; said Maersk chief executive officer Eivind Kolding in London. But the ships, which are nearly twice as large as the majority of the world&apos;s 9,000 container ships, were designed solely for the China-Europe route. Only Felixstowe in Britain, and Rotterdam and Bremerhaven in mainland Europe will have the facilities to handle them, along with Port Said in Egypt and just four ports in the east, including Shanghai and Hong Kong. &quot;They will definitely stimulate further trade between China and Europe, but they are too big for any ports in north or south America. Eventually we would like to be able to take them to the US but for the moment they would take four or five days to be unloaded there,&quot; said Kolding. Maersk admitted it had been stung by criticisms in the past few years that the global shipping industry, which it dominates, had failed to reduce its carbon emissions. Shipping is responsible for 3-4% of global emissions, largely because it traditionally burns cheap but heavily polluting &quot;bunker&quot; fuel. Yesterday Maersk sought to position itself as environmentally responsible, saying that $30m (\u00a318.45m), or one-sixth of the total cost of each vessel, would go towards fuel-saving and emissions reduction. The vessels&apos; twin engines have been designed to run slower, waste heat will be recovered and instead of using nearly 200 tonnes of fuel a day, the new ships should be able to run on around 100 tonnes. &quot;We have rethought the whole ship. We are setting a new bar, or standard. These ships will operate at fuel consumption of 50% less than the industry average and 20% better than the existing best. They will travel at 19 knots (21.8mph) rather than 23 knots (26.5mph) and the emissions will be 50% less [per container]. The ships could travel even slower but you reach a point when transit time becomes an issue,&quot; said Kolding. The improvement was cautiously welcomed by environment and development groups. &quot;Shipping is the lifeblood of international trade, but it is also a source of carbon emissions bigger than many industrialised countries, and set to treble by 2050. Efficiency improvements to engines are part of the solution, but only by setting a cap can governments really get a grip,&quot; said Tim Gore, Oxfam&apos;s climate change policy adviser. But the company could not say how much less air pollution the ships would emit. In international waters, sulphur and nitrogen emissions are barely regulated and the largest container ships have been found to emit as much sulphur and nitrogen pollutants as 50m cars. New laws will force reduction in some areas but the technology has not been developed yet to fully &quot;scrub&quot; the diesel emissions of mega ships like those planned by Maersk. In addition, European air quality standards are far more lax for shopping than those of the US. &quot;We are working hard on the technology but we do not know yet how it will have developed by the time these ships are delivered,&quot; said a Maersk spokesman. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 February 2011.

Demand from China&apos;s expanding economic elite has sparked optimism in an industry that risked being extinguished by recession and anti-smoking laws around the world. Cuban cigar sales rose 2% last year, according to the latest figures, reversing a downward trend. This is thanks to a jump in Asian sales as China overtook Germany as the third largest market for Habanos SA, the worldwide distributor of Cuban cigars. The distributor generated \u00a3228m in worldwide sales, a slight increase on the previous year rather than the much-anticipated drop, given bans in Europe and elsewhere on smoking in bars, restaurants and public spaces. Spain and France remain the biggest markets, but following the opening of Cuban cigar shops in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shanghai, China is catching up. Brands such as Montecristo, Cohiba and Patarg\u00e1s offer an image of luxury and sophistication, qualities sought by China&apos;s burgeoning middle class. These days, venues such as Havana Nirvana in Shanghai and Cohiba Atmosphere in Beijing allow the moneyed elite to relax with an expensive import and store prized purchases in rented humidors, ensuring their cigars remain in top condition. But some Chinese aficionados have been enjoying Cuban tobacco since before the current boom. When William Wang sampled his very first cigar, eight years ago, the domestic sector barely existed. He can still recall the aroma of the Davidoff he savoured in a Shanghai wine bar. &quot;My friends were all smoking cigars so I tried one too. It smelt really good and I felt very relaxed afterwards. So I kept on smoking them,&quot; he said. Marketing manager for Casa de Tobaco, which arranges cigar-related events, Wang added: &quot;In China, the people who smoke cigars are the upper class, the elite, or people who have come back from overseas. &quot;After people [who smoke] get rich, they want something nicer, something more upscale, something different. A cigar becomes their best choice. And in China, the number of people who become very rich is getting bigger and bigger.&quot; China is already the world&apos;s largest market for tobacco, with growing health concerns having little impact on the enormous demand. But of the roughly one in two Chinese men who smoke, the vast majority choose cigarettes. A 2008 report said the Chinese cigar market was worth around 2.2bn yuan \u2014 but 200m of the 370m cigars sold that year were poor quality domestic products sold at rockbottom prices. Industry sources say the market for imports is growing by around 30% a year or more.&quot;Foreigners were the first [cigar] smokers in China, then gift-senders began buying Cuban cigars for people they wanted to please, and later people started to smoke themselves,&quot; said KC Chan, manager of Hong Kong-based Infifon, Habanos SA&apos;s distributor to the mainland. &quot;Initially it was a form of showing off or conspicuous consumption. Now real consumption is kicking in, but there&apos;s a long way to go.&quot; He added: &quot;Cuban cigars are almost exclusively the prestige cigar that everyone is after. &quot;Firstly, people know the cigars are the best. Secondly, it&apos;s a symbol of luxury. And thirdly, because Cuba is a socialist country, Chinese people have more of a sense of closeness. It&apos;s easier for Chinese people to accept that it is from another socialist country. It raises their curiosity.&quot; This is welcome news for an industry shrouded in gloom when Habanos SA, a joint venture between Cuba and Imperial Tobacco Group, blamed an 8% fall in overseas sales last year on recession and bans. The figures were released by its marketing director, Ana Lopez, at a news conference opening its annual cigar festival. The company hopes smaller cigars, which are quicker to smoke, will appeal to smokers banished to the cold outdoors. &quot;We&apos;re trying to offer a combination of new products, but smaller cigars are more important than in the past because there are fewer places to smoke and less time,&quot; said Lopez. Part of the strategy is the Julieta, a smaller, milder version of the Romeo y Julieta cigar, to lure female smokers. Connoisseurs say Nicaraguan and Honduran cigars that emulate Cuban hand-rolling techniques can be equally smooth, but lack the romanticism of those from the Caribbean island. Churchill, a fan of Romeo y Julieta, had a long, fat variety named after him in 1947. John F Kennedy was so partial to Petit H Upmanns that he dispatched his press secretary to get 1,200 of them before slapping a US embargo on Cuba. Castro, who famously survived a CIA assassination plot involving an exploding cigar, liked to be photographed with a Cohiba Corona Especial clamped between his teeth, but he quit in 1985 for health reasons. However, life is becoming increasingly difficult for smokers everywhere.

That is a statement of the bleedin&apos; obvious but markets have been slow to react to the danger. Tuesday may have been the day when the penny started to drop: there was a rush towards the perceived safety of western government bonds, the dollar and gold. Stock markets also lost some of their previously nerveless poise. The FTSE 100 index may have fallen only 86 points in two days but the decline would have been greater without some bullish-looking data on US consumer confidence. But, by afternoon trading in New York, even US investors had started to wonder whether local consumers would remain so confident if another oil spike lies around the corner. Until now, stock market bulls have put their faith in central bankers&apos; soothing medicine of cheap money. Their argument has run like this: shares look like the best asset in town (or the least ugly) when interest rates are low, the global economy is recovering steadily and a couple of years of mild inflation, especially in the east, lie in prospect. The time to worry, they argue, will arrive only when interest rates are cranked up aggressively, thereby forcing western consumers and governments to confront their debt problems and the residents of Shanghai and Beijing to question the value of their houses and flats. That moment, the bulls contend, could still be a couple of years away, and, since there&apos;s no point accepting the current miserable-looking yields on government debt, shares are the place to be. This bullish thesis survived (albeit not without a few hiccups) last year&apos;s debt crisis in the eurozone \u2013 but an oil shock might represent a much more severe test. As the IEA puts it, the global economic recovery is &quot;very fragile \u2013 especially in OECD countries&quot;. How high would the price of oil have to go before it threatened a double-dip recession? That&apos;s anybody&apos;s guess. It is more useful to ask what, other than shrinking demand, could bring the oil price down. Increased supply is the usual answer but suddenly the political stability of the members of Opec \u2013 and not just Libya, the ninth largest producer within the cartel \u2013 is being questioned. It is always dangerous to call a turn in the markets. But it has been hard to understand why investors have been so sanguine about oil at $100-plus a barrel.

Is that the time? Yep, it&apos;s only 47 seconds since JP Duminy hit the winning runs against West Indies, and here we are again. This is one of the  only  more interesting fixtures of the group stages, although any excitement has been tempered by the tragedy in Christchurch. The healing power of sport is a remarkable thing, however, and if New Zealand end Australia&apos;s 30-match World Cup unbeaten run, it will make the country feel a little bit better.  Previously on Australia v New Zealand... This has been a cracking fixture in previous World Cups: the Thirty30 match in 1987, Dipak Patel opening the bowling in 1992, Shane Warne batting No4 in 1996, Roger Twose battering Australia in Cardiff in 1999, Shane Bond&apos;s six-for in defeat in 2003, and Australia&apos;s monstrous 215-run win in 2007.  What&apos;s this business about Ponting and the TV? A grown man, being told what he can and can&apos;t do in his own dressing room. A complete nonsense.  Australia have won the toss and will bowl first. There&apos;s a bit of moisture and a bit of cloud cover, so I suppose it makes sense to unleash the fast bowlers. Daniel Vettori says he would have batted anyway. Australia Watson, Haddin (wk), Ponting (c), Clarke, D Hussey, White, Smith, Johnson, Krejza, Lee, Tait. New Zealand Guptill, B McCullum (wk), Ryder, Taylor, Franklin, Styris, How, Vettori (c), N McCullum, Southee, Bennett.  Anyone out there? Anyone? Anyone?   1st over: New Zealand 0-0 (Guptill 0, B McCullum 0) Brett Lee, cricket&apos;s baby-faced assassin, will open the bowling. His second ball is a gem, full and seaming away past the edge of Martin Guptill. This could be a very tricky first hour for New Zealand. Guptill is beaten again by the fifth ball, which kept very low. That&apos;s a high-class start from Lee, a maiden. &quot;Rob, I&apos;m here,&quot; says David Naylor. &quot;Not that it&apos;s any consolation to you that it&apos;s only quarter of 10 over here in the States. First match I&apos;ve actually been around to catch of the CWC. What appliance do you think Ponting will go after should Australia lose this one?&quot; Maybe he&apos;ll do this. (NB: clip contains big boys&apos; language.)  2nd over: New Zealand 9-0 (Guptill 0, B McCullum 7) Shaun Tait starts with consecutive wides. What a fascinating and contrary character he is: part Bond villain, part William H Macy patsy. His third legitimate delivery is short, wide and slapped up and over backward point for a one-bounce four by Brendon McCullum, who then drives the next delivery through Ponting at mid off for three. In other news, here&apos;s Mac Millings to prove that hell hath no fury like a manchild scorned. &quot;Yeah, I&apos;m here, although it seems you&apos;ve been doing unsurprisingly well without me, with all your &apos;Ooh, Ian Copestake&apos;s on such good form&apos; and &apos;Let&apos;s reward the best World Cup emailer with an evening with Gary Naylor&apos;. I tell you what - reward the &apos;best&apos; emailer with an evening with me. My guess is that&apos;ll bring the standard back down to gutter level, where it should be. Or at the very least, I&apos;ll get the chance to ruin the evening of some funny effer&apos;s evening/life.&quot;  3rd over: New Zealand 10-0 (Guptill 0, B McCullum 8) Lee, 34 years young as David Brent would say, has started wonderfully here. Guptill fends off a nasty lifter and gets a bit of chat for his troubles. He has faced 11 deliveries without scoring, and there&apos;s just one from the over. &quot;Hi Mr Smyth,&quot; says a polite Arjoon Ashokkumaar, before getting down to brass tacks. &quot;It not his dressing room you know, it was just loaned out to him for a few hours. How would you like it if a guest broke the LCD TV in your living room. &apos;Nonsense&apos; is the not the word that comes to mind. The more appropriate word would be &apos;Pay Up&apos;.&quot; Don&apos;t reply &apos;That&apos;s two words&apos; Smyth you&apos;re better than that you must be able to think of a better comeback you&apos;re a paid journalist for Pete&apos;s sake don&apos;t do it don&apos;t do it don&apos;t do it That&apos;s two words. But seriously, of course he should be for the damage \u2013 there&apos;s no issue there. But a reprimand? That don&apos;t impress me much. What happened to the sanctity of the dressing room? And are we banning frustration now? Sport has become risibly sanitised, in my  humble  opinion.  WICKET! Australia 20-1 (B McCullum c Krejza b Tait 16) This is a vital wicket for Australia. Tait had taken some tap from McCullum, with boundaries to third man and fine leg in addition to a front-foot no-ball and a wide, but then McCullum slashed a big yahoo straight to third man. The umpires asked McCullum to hang around while they checked for the no-ball, but Tait was okay and so the dangerous McCullum is on his way, swishing his bat in frustration.  4th over: New Zealand 21-1 (Guptill 0, Ryder 1) Tait&apos;s figures are a typically eccentric 2-0-20-1. But the key is that last column. For all his faults, he is a wicket-taker. &quot;Oh no \u2013 this is a deep blow to Khawajamania,&quot; says Jonah Gadsby, who has apparently just realised that Usman Khawaja isn&apos;t in the Australia squad. Jonah also reports that Archduke Franz Ferdinand has just been shot, and the ICC have just this second outlawed underarm bowling.  5th over: New Zealand 25-1 (Guptill 0, Ryder 5) Another superb over from Lee is tarnished when, after five dot balls, Ryder cuts a slightly wide delivery for four. &quot;I have a sneaky feeling NZ might, you know, do something at this World Cup,&quot; says Scott W. &quot;And by &apos;do something&apos; I do mean getting past the quarter-finals. I know there&apos;s questions about their spinners as an attacking unit, and their batsmen can blow hot and cold, but this is the kind of hunch that stems from some deep-seated, almost mystical, reverence for the hazy thing known as team spirit. And that boy Southee&apos;s got something about him. In fact, compare the two bowling attacks today and the Kiwis have a better balance between defence and attack than the Aussies (though that&apos;s not saying much). I reckon they can do it. It would almost justify the utter negligence with which they have treated the five-day version of the game.&quot; It&apos;s an immutable law of World Cups that New Zealand will overachieve: reaching the semi-finals in 1975, 1979, 1992, 1999 and 2007 is a really good effort. This time? It all depends on the quarter-final draw really. They wouldn&apos;t beat India, but they&apos;d have a puncher&apos;s chance against South Africa and a decent chance against the rest.  6th over: New Zealand 25-1 (Guptill 0, Ryder 5) A two-over spell is usually enough for Shaun Tait, so he is replaced by Mitchell Johnson, who is sporting the same buzzcut as his old friend Stuart Broad. His &apos;n&apos; his haircuts. Bless. He is right on the money straight away in an excellent maiden. Guptill has to dig out a yorker and then misses a cut at a trampolining short ball. Guptill has 0 from 17 balls and is more than halfway towards Runako Morton&apos;s record for the longest ODI duck. &quot;There are more people in one suburb of Bombay than in the whole of New Zealand,&quot; says Chidananda. &quot;A side representing the former, though, would not lose to Bangladesh.&quot; A-hem.  7th over: New Zealand 32-1 (Guptill 6, Ryder 5) It is, as the ever excellent Mike Atherton says on Sky, nice to watch a proper pace attack at work. The last time the World Cup was on the subcontinent we had Ambrose and Walsh and Wasim and Waqar and Donald (well, most of the time) and Pollock and Srinath and Prasad and McGrath and Fleming. Mind you, the tournament was won by the side that opened the bowling with Pramodya Wickramasinghe, so I&apos;m not sure what the moral of the story is. Anyhow, Guptill finally gets off the mark from his 19th delivery, cover-driving Lee for two, and then makes room to guide the 20th over the slips for four. &quot;Currently sat at work doing some mind numbing crap parked in front of my computer in sunny Brisbane,&quot; says Kieron. &quot;Sigh\u2026 Maybe Punter should bring his own appliance in the throw his box at\u2026 A sandwich toaster that&apos;s past its prime surely wouldn&apos;t upset the Indians would it?&quot; That&apos;s a great idea. Instead of recycling your knackered old electrical goods, donate them to the Ricky Ponting Funk Fund. I have a very old George Foreman at home; he can do what he likes to that.  8th over: New Zealand 36-1 (Guptill 6, Ryder 9) Johnson finally concedes his first runs from his 10th delivery, when Ryder stands tall and plays a storming angled-bat thrash through the covers for four. &quot;Given all the (deserved) criticism of Mac Millings&apos;s social capabilities,&quot; begins Oliver Bevan, &quot;it&apos;s worth noting that he has single-handedly stumbled on one of the most foolproof methods for guaranteeing a date: have yourself as the &apos;prize&apos; for some meaningless competition, with the date paid for by the sponsors.&quot; Millings doesn&apos;t need dates. He has a wife, and two kids. Yeah I know. Twice.  WICKET! New Zealand 40-2 (Guptill b Watson 10) Shane Watson strikes in his first over. That ball kept very low, skidding under Martin Guptill&apos;s defensive stroke and into the stumps Not that Guptill was blameless: he misread the length and was struck on the crease when he should have been forward. A number of deliveries have kept low already, although none have yet replicated this beauty.  9th over: New Zealand 40-2 (Ryder 9, Taylor 0) &quot;Only a few short hours ago, Rob, you were wondering why so many people hate Ricky Ponting,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;Surely you have answered your own question this morning. Not only do you refer to his latest little chuntering disciplinary problem, but you&apos;ve put his sulky face up at the top of the OBO. Really don&apos;t need that at this time of the day. Why not a close-up of Mitchell&apos;s interesting and manly tattoos? You know the one that says &apos;fragile&apos;?&quot;  10th over: New Zealand 49-2 (Ryder 17, Taylor 0) Ryder puts Johnson away for consecutive boundaries with a thumping pull and then a tuck off the pads. He is such a talented player, maybe even blessed with a smidgin of genius. A rattled Johnson spears the next ball down the leg side for his wide, but it&apos;s accurate stuff for the rest of the over. &quot;I&apos;m 85,661st in the Fantasy Cricket World Cup league!&quot; says Jeremy Theobald. &quot;Gary Naylor you ask? Erm, (cough), 11th. Millings is somewhere in between.&quot; As usual.  11th over: New Zealand 49-2 (Ryder 17, Taylor 0) Australia take their bowling Powerplay at the first opportunity. I am getting really bored of typing that sentence at the start of the 11th over in every single match. Anyhow, Taylor, a fine player who is in a bad trot in ODIs, plays out a maiden from the accurate Watson. &quot;I assume that writing an OBO for a match that doesn&apos;t involve your own country at some ungodly hour would be a thankless enough task even if you knew people were reading, let alone while you were wondering if your literary gems were going unappreciated, so I&apos;m going to answer your question and say &apos;I&apos;m here&apos;,&quot; says Thomas Kingaroy. &quot;Given that &apos;here&apos; is Melbourne, Australia, and I&apos;m supposed to be working as it&apos;s just after 3pm, I&apos;ve clearly used a pseudonym for this message, but rest assured that yes, your work is/will be appreciated by me at the very least. And that guy in the States who just beat me to it.&quot; Literary gems! Ho-honk!  12th over: New Zealand 57-2 (Ryder 25, Taylor 0) Johnson has lost his line a bit after an excellent start and Ryder flap-pulls him for consecutive boundaries, the second a beautifully timed stroke through backward square leg. Ryder is dealing in boundaries at the moment, with six of them in his 25. &quot;Is this OBO really going out LIVE, or is it just a very unfulfilling dream?&quot; says Chris Milner. &quot;As a long time reader I can hear the usual names, but they sound distant. SomethingorotherNaylor, etcetc Copestake, but who is this Mac Millings? And plus, post-apocalyptic-Ashes innings defeat extravaganza I don&apos;t care enough about Australia to wish them ill. NZ to win by 3462 tho if poss.&quot; Good job you&apos;re not wishing them ill.  13th over: New Zealand 66-2 (Ryder 25, Taylor 4) Taylor gets off the mark from his 11th delivery, gloving a short one to fine leg for four. Two balls later Watson spears one onto the pads and it flies away for four. So New Zealand are getting enough runs, but astonishingly they have not scored a single off the bat since the fourth over.  WICKET! New Zealand 66-3 (Ryder c Haddin b Johnson 25) This is lovely bowling from Mitchell Johnson. The line and length were perfect, just outside off stump and ensuring that Ryder had to play. He pushed forward defensively, with no foot movement, and snicks it through to Haddin. That&apos;s a huge wicket as Ryder was playing nicely. As Ian Chappell says on Sky, that&apos;s what happens when you don&apos;t rotate the strike, because it allows a bowler to line you up over a period of time.  WICKET! New Zealand 66-4 (Franklin c Haddin b Johnson 0) Mitchell Johnson is ripping through New Zealand. Franklin threw the kitchen sink and the television at a wide, fullish delivery, again with no foot movement, and could only edge it through to Haddin. That&apos;s a really poor stroke to play at the best of times, never mind third ball, and New Zealand are in all sorts of trouble now.  14th over: New Zealand 66-4 (Taylor 4, Styris 0) A double-wicket maiden for Mitchell Johnson. The little girl with the little curl has got nothing on this man. Johnson is the leading wicket-taker in the tournament so far, with six at an average of 6.66. Help!  WICKET! New Zealand 67-5 (Styris c Haddin b Tait 0) Madon, this is pathetic. It&apos;s lovely, aggressive captaincy from Ricky Ponting, who wants to finish this game here and now and so brings back Shaun Tait, but it&apos;s awful batting from New Zealand. Taylor gloves a lifter just over slip and then Styris, like Franklin, has a leaden-footed waft at a very wide delivery before he has scored. The result is the same, an edge through to Brad Haddin. The umpires checked for the no-ball, as they did with Tait&apos;s first wicket, but again he was just about okay.  15th over: New Zealand 68-5 (Taylor 5, How 1) &quot;Blimey, you guys don&apos;t mind giving Ponting a hard time,&quot; says Peter Morris. &quot;I suggest all Ponting (and other good qulity opponents) bashing ceases. You&apos;re just tempting fate. If you continue to carry on like this it will be Ponting scoring the winning runs against England in the WCF in three months time or whenever it all ends.&quot; Hang on a minute, I&apos;ve been defending Ponting for years!  16th over: New Zealand 70-5 (Taylor 6, How 2) Two from Mitchell Johnson&apos;s over, so his figures are now 6-2-23-2. &quot;I&apos;m back and so are you,&quot; says Jeffrey Feim. &quot;Once again, life has this nasty habit of imitating art. And we should all admire and respect the exceptional on-field accomplishments of the Australian captain, notwithstanding his famously acerbic personality. So having genuflected appropriately, the big question now is whether this is the first time in living memory that the idiot&apos;s box has inflicted damage upon an idiot box? I&apos;m just asking.&quot; Arf, very good.  WICKET! New Zealand 73-6 (Taylor b Tait 7) Tait cleans Taylor up with a fine delivery: fast, full and battering into off stump via the pad as Taylor whipped hopelessly across the line. It wasn&apos;t a good shot but it was a good piece of bowling.  17th over: New Zealand 73-6 (How 3, N McCullum 0) The one good thing for New Zealand is they bat all the way down to Tim Southee at No10, but this game will take a deal of winning. Mind you, there is precedent. In this fixture at the 2003 World Cup, Australia were 84 for seven and still won at a canter. Then again, they had Michael Bevan. Isn&apos;t it amazing, by the way, how many times Bevan is excluded when folk pick their all-time ODI XI? Am I the only one who finds this completely ridiculous?  18th over: New Zealand 73-6 (How 3, N McCullum 0) Another maiden for Johnson. &quot;Is the New Zealand cricketing fraternity so talent-deficient that they have to resort to playing guys who have long outlived their utility and would rather be sitting at home applying for tax and old-age benefits,&quot; says Nisarg Kamdar. &quot;I&apos;m looking at you Scott Styris.&quot;  19th over: New Zealand 78-6 (How 4, N McCullum 3) Five from Tait&apos;s over. &quot;I also find it ridiculous (scandalous even) that people leave him out of all-time one-day teams,&quot; says Scott Nixon. &quot;He would be the first person picked in my side. With the crash &amp; bang of today&apos;s game you still need a cool and calculated head to guide you home. I can think of so many times Australia would have lost if they had to contend with Bevan when defending a total \u2013 rather then a lesser batsman who often wilted under pressure.&quot; Christian Ryan wrote the perfect line on Bevan, that he had a &quot;calculator for a brain and a tweezer for a bat&quot;. He&apos;s the best finisher of all time, followed by a lot of daylight.  20th over: New Zealand 83-6 (How 6, N McCullum 6) Here comes Jason Krejza, on the ground where he took 12 for 741 on his Test debut in 2008. He is surely Australia&apos;s weak link in this tournament. Still, this is what they call a nice time to bowl, and a gentle first over goes for five singles. &quot;Scott Styris averages 87 in World Cup games, you can&apos;t chastise him for one bad day!&quot; says Kabira Namit. &quot;Especially since the entire team is in disarray.&quot;  21st over: New Zealand 85-6 (How 7, N McCullum 6) Ponting takes one foot off the throat and then applies another, replacing Johnson with Lee. A nice over costs just a couple. &quot;I wonder if the Kiwis will score more than 98,&quot; begins JMA, &quot;which was what Australia scored in the first innings of the Boxing Day Test of the recent Ashes series won 3-1 by England IN Australia.&quot; Passed me by, that one; I got lost in X-Factor for the winter.  22nd over: New Zealand 89-6 (How 9, N McCullum 9) McCullum, beaten in the flight, drives in the air and just wide of the bowler Krejza, diving to his right. If New Zealand are to post anything resembling a competitive total, they will have to go after Krejza at some stage. For now, however, they are settling for singles \u2013 five of them in fact. Thanks to Swaroop Swaminathan for this clip of Bevan&apos;s finest hour. Bevan batted 45 times in successful ODI run-chases, and was still there at the end in 25 of them. Amazing, really, although statistically speaking he has nothing on Jeremy Coney, who did it 12 times out of 12.  23rd over: New Zealand 97-6 (How 12, N McCullum 18) When How drops Lee at his feet, Lee charges down the track to collect the ball before spinning to hit the stumps at the bowler&apos;s end. How was home but it was a marvellous piece of athleticism. And that&apos;s another excellent over, even though McCullum steers the last ball over the keeper for four. Lee has probably been the best bowler today, even though he remains wicketless. &quot;I suppose the main reason that most people forget about Bevan is the fact that he never played a single Test match, which is amazing really,&quot; says Don Wilson. &quot;I have never understood why he was never given a chance, but most people would for some reason select their best ODI team from the best Test players.&quot; He did play a few, and started very well in Pakistan in 1994-95, but then had all sorts of trouble with the short ball against England in particular. For a time he was playing at No7, as one of four bowlers, and cleaned up both West Indies and South Africa with the ball in 1996-97. Here&apos;s his list of Test scores.  24th over: New Zealand 100-6 (How 13, N McCullum 16) Krejza puts down a sharp, very low caught-and-bowled chance when How drives the ball back whence it came. He&apos;ll go for a few, but he&apos;ll also take wickets, and later in the over McCullum chips him only just short of deep midwicket. This is a remarkably aggressive Australian bowling line-up, in fact, particularly when compared to most of the others in this tournament. &quot;Just checked in from San Francisco,&quot; says Charlie Talbot. &quot;After four months abroad, including following the Ashes from South America among unmoved locals, the silver lining to the cloud of returning home on Sunday will be finally being in a country gripped by cricket fever and glued to ball-by-ball updates all day every day. Eh? Oh.&quot;  25th over: New Zealand 100-6 (How 13, N McCullum 16) How is beaten by a nasty grubber from Lee, the first ball of an excellent maiden. We&apos;re at the halfway point of the innings, and New Zealand are in the malodorous stuff. &quot;Yeah, Bevan was a performance artist alright,&quot; says Jeffrey Feim. &quot;But it didn&apos;t hurt having a couple of blokes named Lee and McGrath on the flip side of the ledger. The match you cite had this once dynamic duo carding 8 wickets off of 15.1 overs for the princely sum of 71 runs. Even I would be prepared to pad up against the Kiwi&apos;s with these terrors on my side.&quot;  26th over: New Zealand 105-6 (How 15, N McCullum 18) &quot;You know Rob, I was really looking forward to this game,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;But it&apos;s pretty rubbish. Tait and Johnson are mainly bowling very badly indeed, but getting wickets.&quot; That&apos;s the beauty of this attack. And it&apos;s a darn sight more entertaining than some of the defensive bowling we&apos;ve had to endure in the other matches. I&apos;m enjoying this a lot, even if it&apos;s no sort of contest.  27th over: New Zealand 108-6 (How 17, N McCullum 19) Steven Smith comes into the attack, and How edges a drive on the bounce to backward point. A good over, three from it. For the first time, the match is drifting a little.  28th over: New Zealand 118-6 (How 21, N McCullum 19) A poor delivery from Krejza goes for five wides down the leg side, and then How edges through the vacant slip area for four. Ten from the over. These two are making a decent fist of a pretty onerous task; the partnership is 45 from 66 balls.  WICKET! New Zealand 121-7 (How LBW b Smith 22) As I said, these two are making a decent fist of things. That was a good delivery from Steven Smith, skidding straight on and into the front pad as How prodded defensively. It looked plumb and, although How reviewed it more in hope than expectation, replays confirmed that it was hitting the top of middle and leg.  29th over: New Zealand 121-7 (N McCullum 22, Vettori 0) &quot;Will I be a bit crude if I suggest that this is bigger than the current match?&quot; says Swaroop Swaminathan. &quot;Hope it&apos;s just a minor bruise.&quot; Me too. It will take the gloss off England&apos;s 147-run victory if it&apos;s not against India&apos;s best XI.  30th over: New Zealand 125-7 (N McCullum 24, Vettori 2) Daniel Vettori is far too good to be batting at No9. In fact only Brett Le eand Chaminda Vaas have scored more ODI runs in this position. Mind you, he&apos;s no Lance Klusener. Look at his average when he batted at No9. What a magnificent freak he was.  31st over: New Zealand 127-7 (N McCullum 25, Vettori 3) Two from Smith&apos;s over. New Zealand are going nowhere, and they&apos;re not even doing it fast.  32nd over: New Zealand 130-7 (N McCullum 27, Vettori 3) Some more aggressive captaincy from Ponting, who brings Tait back in place of Krejza. McCullum is beaten twice and, inbwetween, squirts two to third man. &quot;West Indies and New Zealand really need to get their act together,&quot; says Kabira Namit. &quot;At the moment, you only have six teams competing for the &apos;World&apos; Cup.&quot; Well, six out of 14 is a decent ratio \u2013 compare that to the football or rugby tournaments \u2013 but I would make it five. England can&apos;t win this, not without Eoin.  33rd over: New Zealand 135-7 (N McCullum 30, Vettori 5) Five very easy singles in that Smith over.  34th over: New Zealand 138-7 (N McCullum 32, Vettori 5) McCullum is beaten for pace three times in a good over from Tait. Australia will want to bowl New Zealand out, because their over-rate is shocking. The innings is due to end in 42 minutes&apos; time and there are still 16 overs remaining.  35th over: New Zealand 144-7 (N McCullum 34, Vettori 8) New Zealand are still playing risk-free cricket against the spin of Smith, dealing exclusively in singles. &quot;I thought Holland might have been the sixth team that Kabira Namit was referring to (over 32), not England,&quot; says Peter Morris.  36th over: New Zealand 150-7 (N McCullum 39, Vettori 9) Krejza replaces Tait (7-0-35-3) and has a huge shout for LBW against Vettori. It is turned down by Billy Doctrove, but Ponting goes for the review. It was very full, and hit Vettori almost on the half volley, so you can see why it was given not out. And replays show it was slipping down leg. The ball didn&apos;t travel far enough off the pitch before hitting the pad for us (or Billy Doctrove, or Hawkeye) to know how much it was going to turn. McCullum then pulls a filthy delivery for four, the first boundary for eight overs.  37th over: New Zealand 152-7 (N McCullum 40, Vettori 10) Two more singles from Smith&apos;s over. If NZ really believe they can win this they should get after Smith, but at the moment their main concern seems to be net run-rate.  38th over: New Zealand 156-7 (N McCullum 42, Vettori 12) Tom Lutz has arrived in the office, wearing life at a jaunty angle, and thank heavens for that because I was starting to flag during these boring late-middle overs. Four singles in that one from Krejza.  39th over: New Zealand 163-7 (N McCullum 49, Vettori 12) McCullum pulls some rubbish from Smith for four. That&apos;s the first rank bad delivery of a good spell from Smith. Two balls later he drives through Ponting at cover, and his wrings his recently broken finger in pain. He&apos;s struggling here. When Ponting shows pain you know it&apos;s serious.  40th over: New Zealand 169-7 (N McCullum 50, Vettori 17) McCullum pushes Krejza into the off side to reach a good half-century, from 72 balls and with three fours. Well played. He scored no half-centuries in his first 14 ODI innings, and now he has three in the last over. Vettori makes it a decent over for New Zealand by reaching a long way to slog-sweep Krejza for four. Much more of this and New Zealand might just lose by a respectable margin.  41st over: New Zealand 174-7 (N McCullum 52, Vettori 20) Five singles from Smith&apos;s over. Anyone still out there? Or is it just me, myself and my unclean glasses?  WICKET! New Zealand 175-8 (N McCullum LBW b Johnson 52) Mitchell Johnson strikes with his second ball. Nathan McCullum walked across his stumps and played around his pads at a straight one. Billy Doctrove gave it out and, although New Zealand used their second and final review, replays showed it pitched in line and would have hit off stump. That&apos;s the end of a good innings from McCullum, 52 from 76 balls, and Johnson has his third wicket.  42nd over: New Zealand 177-8 (Vettori 22, Southee 1) The new beatuty Southee edges a beauty from Johnson just short of White at slip.  43rd over: New Zealand 188-8 (Vettori 33, Southee 1) Vettori reverse sweeps Smith wide of short fine leg for four. Smith looks unimpressed, as if he&apos;s been hard done by and the world is against him, but that was very well played. The next ball is a travesty, a loopy full toss that Vettori pulls through midwicket for four more. &quot;I&apos;m here,&quot; says Michelle Christensen. &quot;I&apos;m watching the cricket in front of my TV from Melbourne. Following your blog. I don&apos;t know why. It&apos;s entertaining.&quot; No it&apos;s not.  44th over: New Zealand 196-8 (Vettori 39, Southee 1) New Zealand have taken their batting Powerplay. By the standards of this tournament, doing so in the 43rd over, while a mere eight wickets down, is positively proactive. Vettori makes room to drive Johnson through mid off for four, a marvellous shot. He walks miles across his stumps to the next delivery, and Johnson spears a farcical full toss down the leg side for a wide. Then Vettori takes a suicidal single to Clarke at midwicket; he would have been miles out had Clarke hit the stumps. He missed. &quot;I&apos;m still here, Rob,&quot; says Jonathan Siu. &quot;So it&apos;s not just you and your unclean glasses. Although hopefully you have a bit more than that; I know the Guardian has a liberal reputation but when I was last living in London it gets quite cold in February.&quot;  WICKET! New Zealand 206-9 (Vettori c Haddin b Lee 44) Vettori&apos;s excellent, unorthodox innings ends when he walks a long way across his stumps and gloves Lee round the corner to Haddin.  45th over: New Zealand 206-8 (Vettori 44, Southee 6) There were ten runs from that Lee over but that&apos;s a fair trade for the wicket of Vettori, who was starting to look very dangerous. &quot;It&apos;s nearly beer time here in Shanghai,&quot; says Andy Brittain. &quot;I used to work in a pub where the guv&apos;nor would put his specs in the dishwasher with all the glasses. They came out sparkling clean but very hot. It was very funny watching him walk into things, talking to the hatstand and knocking everyone&apos;s drinks over while his specs went through the cycle.&quot; Actually, there&apos;s an American Car Wash place just down the road. Every time I walk past and hear those brushes going to work, I think about putting my glasses, or indeed myself, through them.  WICKET! New Zealand 206 all out (Southee c Ponting b Johnson 6) That&apos;s it. Southee slogs Johnson up in the air and Ponting takes an awkward catch nicely. That gives Mitchell Johnson back-to-back four-fors, and also saves Australia a fine for their dodgy over-rate. New Zealand left 29 balls of their innings unused \u2013 17 of those in the Powerplay \u2013 and Australia need 207 to win. It&apos;s another mismatch I&apos;m afraid. See you in 40 minutes.  INNINGS BREAK  Things to plug between innings 1. The Ashes OBO book.2. Andy Bull on Twitter. He has fewer followers than Gloucestershire County Council. Sort it out!3. The best song of 2010.4. A damn fine cup of tea.  In the other match in Mirpur, which starts at 8.30am, Bangladesh have won the toss and will bat against Ireland.  1st over: Australia 9-0 (target 207; Watson 2, Haddin 5) Tim Southee starts the innings with a wide to man-love&apos;s Shane Watson. There&apos;s another three balls later, and then he beats Brad Haddin with a good delivery that moves away off the seam. New Zealand were very full in length against Kenya, and Southee has started that way here. Haddin backs away to the final delivery and laces it through extra cover for four. &quot;This doesn&apos;t feel like a World Cup,&quot; says Shankar Kalyanaraman. &quot;Blame it on the pointlessness of the first few matches, or the lack of actual bat vs. ball contests, or the somber context to the tournament (Libya, Egypt, Christchurch), or just my greying self, but somehow I can&apos;t seem to summon the same excitement for this edition as I did for South Africa 2003, England 1999, and even the subcontinent 1996. And I have an odd feeling it&apos;s the same way with most of the teams themselves; as if these fixtures are being rammed down their throats.&quot; Thank you ICC!  2nd over: Australia 12-0 (target 207; Watson 4, Haddin 6) Once again, a slow bowler is going to open the bowling. This time it&apos;s Daniel Vettori, and there are three runs from a very accurate over. By the way, there&apos;s a  night with Mac Millings  gold star for anyone who can name the first spinner to open the bowling in an ODI. &quot;I see you&apos;ve selected something from the Gossip Girl soundtrack as the best song of 2010,&quot; says Dan Smith. &quot;XOXO.&quot; I see you watch Gossip Girl. Mwah.  3rd over: Australia 18-0 (target 207; Watson 5, Haddin 11) Haddin flicks Southee wristily for four more, and Australia are off to a much better start than against Zimbabwe, when they crawled to 28 for 0 after 10 overs I think. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be a bore,&quot; says Rod Lyall, &quot;but you guys are doing a full OBO blog on the Ireland game, aren&apos;t you? Or does the Guardian no longer regard Northern Ireland as part of its catchment area?&quot; I assume we&apos;re not, but I don&apos;t know for certain.  4th over: Australia 27-0 (target 207; Watson 8, Haddin 17) Haddin drives Vettori lazily back over his head for four for his third boundary. He is motoring and has 17 from 11 balls. Meanwhile, Rashmin Gandhi and Sriaghavan B suggest that Dipak Patel might have been the first spinner to open the bowling in an ODI. He was the first to do it on a regular basis, throughout the 1992 World Cup \u2013 but, according to my Statsguruing, he was the fifth overall. Before him came two Pakistanis, an Indian and another New Zealander.  5th over: Australia 34-0 (target 207; Watson 10, Haddin 22) Shane Watson has an LBW decision overturned on review. He pushed around his front pad at a delivery that was angled in from wide of the crease by Southee, and replays showed it was slipping down the leg side. Earlier in the over Brad Haddin had got his one boundary for the over, flat-batting a terrible delivery through the covers. In Mirpur, Tamim Iqbal has got off to a slow start, larruping 10 from the first over of the innings.  6th over: Australia 37-0 (target 207; Watson 10, Haddin 24) Doug Bollinger is out of the World Cup with an ankle injury. Australia have not named a replacement yet. I wonder whether they might take a big risk and replace him with Mike Hussey. Probably not, but it&apos;s worth considering. Hamish Bennett, a huge man who bowls like an even more open-chested Steve Harmison, has come on to replace Daniel Vettori. Like Harmison, he has the sort of raw materials that make coaches giddy with excitement, and there are just three runs from the first over: two to Haddin and a wide. &quot;Working late here in Auckland for Telecom helping our friends in Christchurch,&quot; says Peter Conway. &quot;Yes! Southee you beauty!!!!!!&quot; Oh.  7th over: Australia 39-0 (target 207; Watson 11, Haddin 25) Southee has another big LBW shout against Watson, who was saved by an inside edge. Meanwhile, Ireland are being mangled in Mirpur, where Tamim Iqbal is 40 for none after 3.3 overs. &quot;I naively assumed you were joking when you&apos;d said you&apos;d be back for 4am,&quot; says Lee Rodwell. &quot;More importantly, which Corporate Salaryman has got their picture in Big Paper today above Andy Bull&apos;s name? It&apos;s a scandal.&quot; He&apos;s changed. He&apos;s shaved.  8th over: Australia 58-0 (target 207; Watson 18, Haddin 32) The Bennett/Harmison comparison goes beyond their bowling action, as Bennett shows with an appalling second over that disappears for 19. His line in that over was diabolical. There were five wides down the leg side, a boundary off the pads for each batsman, and another drive down the ground from Watson that would have been four were it not for a stunning piece of fielding from Nathan McCullum.  9th over: Australia 67-0 (target 207; Watson 19, Haddin 40) This is carnage. Haddin uppercuts Southee for four and then drags another boundary over midwicket. Anyway, according to Statsguru \u2013 which is wrong about as often than the speaking clock \u2013 the first spinner to open the bowling in an ODI was Bishan Bedi, at Headingley of all places in 1979. The others Before Patel were Wasim Raja, John Bracewell and Akram Raza. England&apos;s first was Richard Illingworth in the 1996 quarter-final, just a couple of years after the rest of the world had binned the tactic. Illingworth took a wicket with his third ball, but he&apos;d already conceded eight by that stage. He ended with figures of 10-1-72-1 and was never picked again. A triumph, then.  10th over: Australia 74-0 (target 207; Watson 20, Haddin 46) Ireland have got a wicket, although it&apos;s not Tamim Iqbal. Imrul Kayes has been stumped off John Mooney for 12, and Bangladesh are 53 for one after 6.3 overs. Back in this here games, New Zealand have replaced Hamish Bennett with the off-spinner Nathan McCullum. Haddin helps himself to another boundary, feathered nicely through extra cover. Australia are in total control, so I&apos;m off for a short break. Tom Lutz will be with you for overs 11-20. Email him. Please.  11th over: Australia 80-0 (target 207; Watson 21, Haddin 46) Jesse Ryder lumbers up for a bowl \u2013 and immediately becomes New Zealand&apos;s best bowler by sending down five \u2013 five! \u2013 dot balls in a row. Carry on like this and they may not be utterly destroyed. The sixth ball goes for five wides though.  12th over: Australia 82-0 (target 207; Watson 22, Haddin 47) Watson nicks a quick single of the first ball of the over: Vettori rearranges the stumps with a good throw but Watson is comfortably home.  13th over: Australia 87-0 (target 207; Watson 23, Haddin 50) Haddin brings up his half-century with a single. It came off 39 balls \u2013 as poorly as New Zealand have bowled it&apos;s been a brilliant display of hitting.  14th over: Australia 100-0 (target 207; Watson 35, Haddin 51) Watson smacks the first ball of the over to the boundary. Brilliant work off the back foot a few balls later as he sends the ball straight into the crowd. &quot;It strikes me a little strange that I can be following your obo, whilst unable to flush my toilet, charge my electric toothbrush or burn some toast, let alone watch the game on the telly,&quot; says Ian Johnson in Christchurch. &quot;I was hoping we might witness a cricket miracle tonight.&quot;  15th over: Australia 108-0 (target 207; Watson 40, Haddin 51) Bennett is back in the attack, which may not be the best news for anyone wanting this to last longer than 30 overs. He&apos;s not helped by his fielders as a fumble gifts Watson a couple. But he doesn&apos;t help himself with a huge wide either. &quot;How about a four-team World Cup?&quot; says Rod Lyall. &quot;Would that keep the CEOs of India, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka - and the ICC&apos;s commercial partners - happy? They could play each other 12 times, and then have best-of-three (or five, or seven) semi-finals. That way, the ICC could still stretch it out over two months, and there would be no &apos;mismatches&apos;. Or only a few.&quot;  16th over: Australia 121-0 (target 207; Watson 53, Haddin 51) Vettori is on but even he can&apos;t stem the flow. Watson slams his first ball to the boundary. The third ball is hit flat off one knee and goes for a one bounce four. Another boundary brings up Watson&apos;s 50 and he&apos;s flying now. &quot;Fair to say that both New Zealand&apos;s and Ireland&apos;s chances of winning the world cups in both cricket and rugby this year are not looking good right now,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst, correctly. &quot;Leaving the only serious contenders who could do it as Australia and South Africa. And apparently one other, though I can&apos;t see that myself.&quot;  17th over: Australia 128-0 (target 207; Watson 58, Haddin 52) Doug Bollinger is out of the World Cup with an ankle injury. The over is going pretty well \u2013 and that&apos;s a relative description \u2013 for the Kiwis until Watson clips a wayward ball fine to the boundary. &quot;There seems to be a an increasing chance that the Aussies will win this thing,&quot; says Phil Withall, wiping away a tear as he remembers the glory days of January. &quot;I may have to get divorced, sell up and head home to England if they do. I&apos;ll miss the wife and kids but at least I&apos;ll be able to live a normal life.&quot;  18th over: Australia 133-0 (target 207; Watson 60, Haddin 55) Vettori manages to get Haddin&apos;s outside edge but there&apos;s no slip. There&apos;s then another chance as Watson&apos;s hoik drops just short of Williamson who looked like he didn&apos;t pick the ball up from the crowd.  WICKET! Haddin (b Bennett c Franklin 55) Australia 133-1 Haddin&apos;s eyes light up as Bennett sends down a slow bouncer but it loops up in the air and it&apos;s a simple catch. That came around 100 runs or so too late for New Zealand.  WICKET! Watson (b Bennett 62) Australia 136-2 Bennett looks a lot more comfortable after the wicket. Until he sends down a wide. Then he gets Watson! It&apos;s a wild shot, chopped onto his stumps, from a man who&apos;s been enjoying himself a bit too much and has forgotten that he&apos;s playing against a professional cricketer  19th over: Australia 139-2 (target 207; Ponting 1, Clarke 1) Ponting and Clarke see out the over. Both Aussie batsmen got themselves out that over and should be furious with themselves.  20th over: Australia 141-2 (target 207; Ponting 2, Clarke 2) In today&apos;s other game, Bangladesh are in a spot of trouble after a good start and are 89-4 against Ireland. It&apos;s safe to assume the Aussies won&apos;t go the same way.  21st over: Australia 149-2 (target 207; Ponting 5, Clarke 6) Hello, Smyth again. Sorry. With New Zealand taking some tap this morning, it&apos;s a good excuse to link to this monstrous six by John Davison against them in 2003. What a shot! Anyway, Bennett bowls another wide and is then pulled for four by Clarke in the course of another expensive over. His figures are a deviant 6-0-49-2. &quot;I&apos;m still seething at the fact that you guys aren&apos;t doing an Ireland OBO,&quot; says Rod Lyall. &quot;No wonder Ireland, Scotland and Wales mutter about the Anglocentrism of the &apos;British&apos; media!!!!!!&quot; And no wonder the use of multiple exclamation marks has such a bad rep?!!!!!!!!?!!! But yes, sorry about the OBO.  I&apos;m not passing the buck it was someone else&apos;s decision!!!!  Assume it&apos;s a resource issue. I would hang around and do the second innings of the Ireland game unpaid, but I don&apos;t love the OBO, or Bangladeshi cricket, that much.  22nd over: Australia 153-2 (target 207; Ponting 9, Clarke 6) Ponting, attempted to cut Vettori, squirts it wide of slip for four. Australia beat New Zealand by 215 runs at the last World Cup, and this isn&apos;t going to be too far behind on the thrashometer. Talking of ometers... &quot;My underdogometer is broken,&quot; says Rene Kita. &quot;I can&apos;t decide whether to root for Bangladesh or Ireland. Now Bangladesh is doing one of their charming collapses (89 for 4 after 18 overs) and I&apos;m not sure whether to celebrate or gnash my teeth. Guess I&apos;ll better stick to the predictable thrashing you&apos;re describing. At least it&apos;ll be over soon.&quot;  23rd over: Australia 156-2 (target 207; Ponting 11, Clarke 7) Ricky Ponting survives two huge appeals from consecutive deliveries by Tim Southee. The first is for a catch down the leg side; it&apos;s turned down but New Zealand decide to go for the review. Ponting fell over as he tried to tickle a full delivery to fine leg, and of course he was out twice like that during the Ashes. But this time replays suggest the ball flicked the trouser leg rather than the edge, so Ponting continues \u2013 and then survives an equally big LBW appeal. I reckon he got outside the line, and New Zealand decide not to review that one. They should have done, however: replays show that the ball hit Ponting on the line of off stump and would have hit middle halfway up. So had that been reviewed, Ponting would have been given out. It&apos;s UDRS torture out there!  24th over: Australia 159-2 (target 207; Ponting 12, Clarke 8) Three from Vettori&apos;s over. &quot;An evening with Mac Millings will be complicated by the restraining orders that restrict his movements,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Best make it an audience with Mac Millings.&quot; Copestake 1-0 Millings. In fact, I believe tomorrow&apos;s poll in the Guardian sport section is going to be: Has Ian Copestake usurped Mac Millings? I think we all know the answer.  25th over: Australia 159-2 (target 207; Ponting 12, Clarke 8) Ponting doesn&apos;t look in great nick, but the nice thing about this tournament is that he has 54 games to feel his way into form before the quarter-finals. He plays out a maiden from Southee, who is in a decent groove. &quot;I&apos;m not doing much work anyway today,&quot; P45s Piers Barclay, &quot;so if you load up a page somewhere in a dusty corner of the Guardian website, it wouldn&apos;t be that much worse for me to sit writing  meaningless filler  literary gems about the Bangladesh v Ireland game. I&apos;ll wait for your call\u2026&quot;  26th over: Australia 160-2 (target 207; Ponting 12, Clarke 9) Jesse Ryder is on to bowl some dobbers. It&apos;s filth, essentially, but parsimonious filth \u2013 just one from the over. &quot;Do you mean to imply,&quot; begins Josh Robinson, &quot;that Copestake and Millings aren&apos;t actually the same person?&quot; Are you suggesting all OBOers have the same personality? That&apos;s OBOist.  WICKET! Australia 167-3 (st B McCullum b Southee 12) Lock up your boob tubes: Ricky Ponting&apos;s grim little innings has come to an end. And in a winter of weird and wonderful dismissals for Ponting, here is another \u2013 stumped off a wide from a seam bowler. It was a glorious piece of work from Brendon McCullum, mind you. Ponting overbalanced as he pushed at a delivery bowled from around the wicket by Tim Southee, and McCullum had the bails off before you could say, well, &apos;bails&apos;. That was a breathtaking piece of glovework.  27th over: Australia 167-3 (target 207; Clarke 10, White 0) Southee beats the new batsman Cameron White with a lovely outswinger. &quot;It would be a great victory for the Associate nations if Ireland manage to win against Bangladesh,&quot; says Kabira Namit. &quot;Particularly on the slow turning pitches of Dhaka. Let&apos;s see what the ICC will have to say then...&quot; Bangladesh are now 115 for four in the 26th, with Ireland&apos;s impressive teenage spinner George Dockrell in the middle of an economical spell.  28th over: Australia 177-3 (target 207; Clarke 14, White 4) A boundary apiece for Clarke and White in a thoroughly harmless over of medium pace from Ryder. Clarke worked one off the pads and White feathered an extra-cover drive to get off the mark. &quot;Given that I can&apos;t afford/don&apos;t have time to fly to London in order to punch somebody in the Guardian office, the only way I could do justice to my outrage was multiple exclamation marks,&quot; says Rod Lyall. &quot;Sorry if they offended your sense of punctuational good taste, but they made me feel marginally better.&quot; You heard it here first \u2013 multiple exclamation marks are the new right hook  29th over: Australia 177-3 (target 207; Clarke 14, White 4) &quot;I&apos;m getting fairly bored of people being stumped off leg-side wides,&quot; says Piers Barclay. &quot;I know it&apos;s good work by the keeper, but it&apos;s not exactly bowler skill, is it? Seems a little unfair on the batsman. Can we ban them please?&quot; You should start a Facebook group. Don&apos;t start a Facebook group.  30th over: Australia 179-3 (target 207; Clarke 14, White 6) A drinks break, and then two from Ryder&apos;s over. Australia are almost home. &quot;Since this game is a bit lame, can you switch to the Ireland game?&quot; says Andrew Banks. &quot;That traitor Booth has just said on Twitter - &apos;Cracking game in propsect in Mirpur - Ireland are in with a real chance...&apos;. (I know the powers that be have decreed you follow Australia, but I doubt they check back to see what you did anyway\u2026 no one will notice a crafty switch. Go on \u2013 I won&apos;t tell anyone.)&quot; I would love to, Andrew, but  I am going to sprint as fast as possible out of this office the moment the clock ticks up to midday, maybe even a few seconds before if I&apos;m feeling brave  I think it&apos;s important for the very fabric of society that an employee should follow the instructions of his employer.  31st over: Australia 181-3 (target 207; Clarke 15, White 7) Southee ends with figures of 10-1-45-1. He pulled it back well after being assaulted in the first 10 overs. &quot;If they&apos;re going to get rid of the Associates from the World Cup, why doesn&apos;t the ICC just go the whole hog and abolish the World Cup altogether, and let the sides compete for the glory of the Champions Trophy every two years?&quot; asks Josh Robinson. &quot;In fact, perhaps this attempt to make the WC and the CT indistinguishable from one another is a cunning wheeze to abolish one of them, or even to bring about a medium-term reduction in the number of meaningless 50-over games.&quot; Yes, I bet that&apos;s exactly what they&apos;re up to.  32nd over: Australia 187-3 (target 207; Clarke 16, White 12) James Franklin is going to bowl for the first time in the tournament, and is milked for six. In Mirpur, George Dockrell has picked up Mushfiqur Rahim, so Bangladesh are now 147 for five in 34th. That looks like a cracking match.  33rd over: Australia 202-3 (target 207; Clarke 24, White 17) Hamish Bennett replaces Tim Southee and serves up some rubbish, I&apos;m afraid. In his defence, he is struggling with a calf problem. His first ball is pulled for four by Clarke, his second brings two wides and his third \u2013 short and wide outside off \u2013 is belaboured for four more by White. Bennett then dupes White with an excellent slower ball, which is flicked just wide of midwicket, before a slower full toss is whapped behind square leg for another boundary by Clarke. Fifteen from the over, so Bennett&apos;s figures are 7-0-63-2. The big man has had a bad day. Australia need five to win.  33.5 overs: Australia 207-3 (target 207; Clarke 24, White 21). AUSTRALIA WIN BY SEVEN WICKETS White snicks Franklin for four to bring the scores level and then squirts the winning run to third man. It&apos;s been a full-scale evisceration, completed with seven wickets and 97 balls to spare. So Australia are now unbeaten in 31 World Cup games: 30 wins and a winning tie against South Africa in 1999. They looked in decent order, although it&apos;s hard to read too much into the game because New Zealand were not at the races. Thanks for your emails. I would hang around and do Bangladesh v Ireland, but my eyes are closing. See you tomorrow for Pakistan v Sri Lanka.", "tags": ["Cricket World Cup 2011", "New Zealand cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport", "Over by over reports"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-25T01:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/25/milan-fashion-week-italy", "sentences": ["Dresses that will semaphore those ideas from magazine covers and red carpets; and, via the high street&apos;s knock-offs, from offices and train carriages from Milan to Shanghai."], "title": "Prada at Milan fashion week does the innocent lady look", "article": "  Miuccia Prada, unlike most fashion designers, says she is happy when the high street copies her clothes. This is because, for Prada, fashion is about turning the ideas in her head \u2013 about herself, about women in general, about the world \u2013 into dresses. Dresses that will semaphore those ideas from magazine covers and red carpets; and, via the high street&apos;s knock-offs, from offices and train carriages from Milan to Shanghai. The idea behind her stunning Prada collection, the designer said backstage after the show, was &quot;not a girl dressed like a lady, but a lady rediscovering her innocence&quot;. After last season&apos;s brightly coloured, wacky collection (Josephine Baker goes to Rio carnival?), it was a return to what Prada does best: unpicking the kind of clothes we think we understand, and putting them back together in a way that is slightly unsettling. The look owed something to the 1960s air hostess. The silhouette \u2013 a drop-waisted, big-buttoned coat dress to mid-thigh, with a knee-high boot \u2013 seemed to signal a kind of innocent, ladylike competence. The invitations for the show were printed on the spongy, shiny white paper that protects the top layer of a box of chocolates; the canapes were rounds of white bread topped with quails&apos; eggs dyed pink, yellow or blue, so that the tray resembled a plate of iced gem biscuits. Both seemed to promise an uncomplicated sweetness which wasn&apos;t quite what they delivered. The subverted sedate is Prada&apos;s home territory, and this was a terrific show which will be bought \u2013 and copied \u2013 worldwide. It began over an hour late, an unusually lengthy delay in the age of catwalk shows streamed live on the internet to waiting fashion-watchers worldwide. But Prada, quizzed backstage about the long holdup, was unapologetic. &quot;It takes a long time to make things charming,&quot; she said. Prada chief executive Patrizio Bertelli, who is married to Miuccia Prada, confirmed that the company was planning an initial public offering in Hong Kong in June or July this year. He told La Repubblica newspaper that the offering would list between 15% and 20% of the shares, most of which would come from the family owners. If the deal goes ahead, Prada will become the first Italian company to be listed in Hong Kong. Bertelli credited the favourable regulatory terms of Hong Kong with sealing the deal. The Asian focus is consistent with the trajectory of growth at Prada, where sales in Asia rose 48% in 2010. Prada plans to open 17 stores in China this year and a further 11 in 2012. Sales in China and Hong Kong now amount to twice the size of the American market for Prada. Miuccia Prada, who has a degree in political science and in her youth was a member of the Communist party, recently told Womenswear Daily that she eventually has plans to move into politics. Backstage, she reaffirmed this plan, but with a wave of her hand consigned it to the distant future. &quot;This is something for when I am older,&quot; she said. &quot;For now, I still love fashion; and fashion and politics don&apos;t mix.&quot;", "tags": ["Prada", "Gucci", "Milan fashion week", "Italy", "Dresses", "Fashion", "Fashion weeks", "Milan fashion week autumn/winter 2009", "Milan fashion week autumn/winter 2011", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-25T02:13:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/25/lord-oakeshott-peer-banks", "sentences": ["When he was six weeks old \u2013 in 1947 \u2013 his family moved to Shanghai with his diplomat father, only to leave two years later in a flying boat."], "title": "Lord Oakeshott \u2013 the outspoken peer still up for the fight", "article": "Lord Oakeshott is the master of the one-liner. Treasury officials, in his opinion, &quot;couldn&apos;t negotiate themselves out of a paper bag&quot;. Bankers&apos; pay particularly irks him: &quot;If this is bonus restraint, my name is Bob Diamond,&quot; is one of the most memorable remarks uttered by any politician this year. But earlier this month his excoriating wit came back to bite him. His verbal assault on the Project Merlin deal between the banks and the government led to his resignation as a Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman in the Lords. Nick Clegg was &quot;upset&quot; at his latest outburst and a message was sent via Lord McNally, the party leader in the upper house. Oakeshott, a canny political player who had been an adviser to the late Roy Jenkins before embarking on a successful City career, did not listen to McNally&apos;s phone call for long before deciding he could make his views known better from the backbenches. The resignation of the 64-year-old was also regarded as significant because he is a friend and unofficial adviser to the business secretary, Vince Cable. The pair have been bedfellows since the 1970s, when the young Oakeshott \u2013 then simply known as Matthew \u2013 occupied the bed vacated by Cable when he succeeded him on an assignment in Kenya from Oxford University. But it was another decade before they met, and two more before Cable entered government as business secretary with Oakeshott at his side. Despite his frustration at the Project Merlin deal, Oakeshott still supports the coalition agreement, hammered out for the Lib Dems by Chris Huhne \u2013 whom he had backed in the leadership race \u2013 and David Laws. &quot;You can see why Chris Huhne and David Laws earned millions in the City. They negotiated a great deal. That&apos;s why we must stick to it.&quot; Even so, Oakeshott admits: &quot;Most of us in the Lib Dems, including me, would rather we did a deal with Labour.&quot; Oakeshott joined the Labour party aged 16, was a Labour councillor in Oxford in the early 1970s, stood in the October 1974 election, lost, stood again in 1981 for the Alliance (the beginning of the modern Lib Dems) and lost again. A wealthy property investor who began his City career at Warburg before a spell running the pension fund at Courtaulds, Oakeshott is the O in the investment management firm OLIM, which runs the Value and Income Trust, which\u00a0invests in stocks and property. He set up OLIM after promising his wife, Pippa \u2013 they now have three adult children \u2013 that he would not mortgage their house, and funded the business from the profits from a property deal, for which he had borrowed \u00a35m from the banks after putting in \u00a350,000 of his own money. &quot;From then on, I&apos;ve been coming to work for the rest of my life because I enjoy it,&quot; he said. His skill is knowing the &quot;demographics of towns&quot;. &quot;I can tell you where the 100% pitch is, the busiest site.&quot; Through OLIM he leases buildings to businesses ranging from banks to retailers. There is a \u00a340m sale-and-leaseback deal with Lloyds for 70 branches, for instance. A forthright supporter of the Guardian&apos;s tax gap campaign \u2013 he read out in the Lords statements that Barclays had enjoined, and which could be revealed only because of parliamentary privilege \u2013 he is keeping up the pressure on tax avoidance, non-doms and banks. His knack for plain speaking can rub up many of his opponents the wrong way \u2013 at Barclays he is known as Lord Overshoot for his bold pronouncements, and while he was at Courtaulds stockbrokers who dealt with him voted him the most unpopular fund manager, in a survey by Punch. Prone to pomposity and with a tendency to interrupt, Oakeshott is unrepentant. &quot;When you&apos;ve been given your first job in government by Roy Jenkins and your first job in the City by Siegmund Warburg, you can see Bob Diamond or the odd political parvenu in perspective,&quot; he said. Despite his disappointment over Project Merlin, he reckons: &quot;There is still everything to play for with the banks \u2013 that was just halfway.&quot; Sir John Vickers is chairing an independent commission on banking that may lead to radical reshaping of the banking system when it reports in September. Born in postwar Britain, Oakeshott reckons his earliest memory is bumping around in the back of an Austin 7 while his mother campaigned for Labour in the 1951 general election. Even before that, he had an unconventional start in life. When he was six weeks old \u2013 in 1947 \u2013 his family moved to Shanghai with his diplomat father, only to leave two years later in a flying boat. Installed at a prep school \u2013 and later Charterhouse, despite his parent&apos;s belief in a state education \u2013 he was taken by his globe-trotting father to Burma, Moscow and Havana. In Moscow, their home was bugged and they were followed by KGB agents in the obligatory brown car. In Havana, he recalls himself and his sister being the only passengers on the daily plane from Miami to Havana \u2013 on the return, it was full of refugees entering the US. &quot;You learn about freedom pretty quickly as a diplomat&apos;s child,&quot; he said. Precocious \u2013 he was writing verse in Greek at the age of 12 \u2013 he got a scholarship to Charterhouse and a first in political philosophy and economics from Nuffield college, Oxford. He studied classics before economics. &quot;I&apos;m very lucky I had such a wonderful education and that I learned the classics \u2013 it helps you. You know where the subject, the verb and the object are in a sentence. You also know which the Latin root words are. If there is one real test [of a good speech] it is a low Latin word count. You have the confidence to use short, sharp Anglo-Saxon words.&quot; As a 25-year-old he was a &quot;chocolate solider&quot; \u2013 funded by the Rowntree trust \u2013 to work for Jenkins. But the Labour minister resigned a week after employing Oakeshott, in protest at Europe. Oakeshott stayed anyway and admits to learning his ability for catchy quotes from John \u2013 later Lord \u2013 Harris, a former journalist, one-time Labour party head of press and adviser to Jenkins. Oakeshott may be on the backbenches but shows no sign of growing tired of the Liberal struggle. He quotes economist John Maynard Keynes, who in 1926, wrote: &quot;Possibly the Liberal party cannot serve the state in any better way than by supplying Conservative governments with cabinets and Labour governments with ideas.&quot; &quot;We can do much better than that,&quot; Oakeshott said.", "tags": ["Liberal Democrats", "Economic policy", "Project Merlin", "Banking", "UK news", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-25T20:19:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/26/how-west-was-lost-consumptionomics-review", "sentences": ["China can build a city like Shanghai in a few years, she says; China can change the weather and turn the deserts green; China can take streamlined decisions; China can save trillions of dollars; China can have 100 billion cars and win the world cup, too."], "title": "How the West Was Lost by Dambisa Moyo and Consumptionomics by Chandran Nair \u2013 review", "article": "Dambisa Moyo is a young Zambian-born economist who made her money at Goldman Sachs and her name with Dead Aid, a provocative book about western aid which claimed that rich countries only make things worse for the poor. On this basis she was picked by Time magazine to be one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2010. That was absurd, and should have been enough to end any promising career, but she has soldiered on and has now written a post-wreck treatise examining how the US economy has collapsed. In its favour, How the West Was Lost is more interesting, wider in scale and more important than Dead Aid. It sketches how, in under 50 years, successive administrations have not just lost America&apos;s way but have wilfully handed leadership to the rest of the world in a series of flawed economic policies. Moyo shows well how fundamental economic liberalisation espoused by what she calls the profligate, greedy, self-interested west has come back to bite it. She clearly despises western free market capitalism, whose economies, she says, are based on ruthlessness, self-interest, and an ability to exploit resources and people from other countries, but her fawning admiration for the state-sponsored Chinese version of capitalism wears thin. China can build a city like Shanghai in a few years, she says; China can change the weather and turn the deserts green; China can take streamlined decisions; China can save trillions of dollars; China can have 100 billion cars and win the world cup, too. She doesn&apos;t actually say that last bit, but you get the idea. For all her brio and glamour, Moyo is a very orthodox thinker, unable to consider a world beyond free markets and underpriced resources and blind to the social effects of what she proposes and celebrates. GDP is her best measure of a country&apos;s success or failure; growth is her grail. Her prose is littered with images of winning and losing races, conflict, aggression, submission, domination, victory, violence and triumphs. She sees the US as locked in a fight to the death with China, she advocates that states take &quot;nuclear&quot; options and she sees countries being &quot;strangled&quot; by each other. But she pays little attention to the ecological constraints of capitalism or to what may or may not be desirable. For Moyo, the great game of making money, preferably by technological advances, is all. Unsurprisingly, then, her choices for the US in these miserable times are pretty stark: to retreat into protectionism, become effectively a socialist state, or to default on its massive debt to China. The stock markets would crash, she says, the dollar would turn into Monopoly money, and there would be uproar, but America would wipe its slate clean. She reckons that America&apos;s reputation would take a knock, but it could start growing all over again pretty soon. Chandran Nair&apos;s book, Consumptionomics: Asia&apos;s Role in Reshaping Capitalism (Infinite Ideas, \u00a319.99), is altogether more subtle. Unlike Moyo, he is not part of the elite discussion groups convened at Davos or the Aspen Institute. The head of the Global Institute for Tomorrow, a think tank that tries to make sense of globalisation, he follows creative development thinkers such as Jonathon Porritt, Eduardo Galeano and Lester Brown. Without being a Malthusian fear-monger, he dares to ask calmly what may happen if Asia continues to develop along western lines and adopts the same old consumption-driven capitalism that Moyo and other economists like. What we get is not an attack on the west so much as a powerful critique of the development path that Asia, and especially China, is taking and a healthy questioning of markets. Nair questions the assumptions that everyone in China and India should \u2013 or needs to \u2013 have a car, live and work in air-conditioned buildings and consume food and goods shipped from everywhere in the world. He argues that Asian capitalism must be reshaped for a resource-constrained world rather than be replaced. There must be a better way to live, he says. But like the Guardian&apos;s Asia environment correspondent, John Watts, Nair warns that the kind of growth that propelled the west to global dominance can only lead to ecological and political crises if repeated in Asia. The have-it-all life of abundance now being adopted by hundreds of millions of Asians will create further tensions, resource disputes and environmental and social disasters. It is in the interests of a confident China, India, Thailand and Korea to consider the true costs of their countries&apos; growth, set limits, exploit resources less and constrain their consumerism. Where Moyo and Nair converge is on the role of the state. The west has blown its chance, they each suggest, by fatally abdicating responsibility to the free market and the bankers, but China and other Asian countries are being led by strong governments with both the power and the confidence to take the hard decisions to avoid the west&apos;s mistakes.

It takes me a while to realise that these glamorous teenagers aren&apos;t here to see Public Enemies or Ghosts of Girlfriends Past; they&apos;ve come to the cinema lobby just to make the scene. I&apos;d heard for years that Istanbul, which was one of the European Capitals of Culture for 2010, calls itself &quot;Europe&apos;s coolest city&quot;. It&apos;s certainly one of the most complex \u2013 the centre of a country that is 98% Islamic yet increasingly famous for its watermelon martinis. Here is a place whose Blue Mosque has an LCD screen flashing the time in Paris and Tokyo. Turkey&apos;s most cosmopolitan metropolis has more billionaires than any city other than New York, Moscow and London, and when I\u00a0went to its Istinye Park mall, it was to see Aston Martin DB9s and Bentleys jammed outside a gilded avenue of fortresses labelled &quot;Armani&quot;, &quot;Gucci&quot;, &quot;Vuitton&quot; and &quot;Dior&quot;. To my friends in business, and to many proud Istanbulians, this city is where the Islamic world meets the global order, serving as a bridge \u2013 literal and metaphorical \u2013 between Europe and the outer edges of Asia. But still nothing had prepared me for the flash and glitter of it all. We foreigners like to recall that Istanbul is the only city on earth with one shore in Asia and one in Europe. But its real heart, according to its eloquent son, Orhan Pamuk, in his evocative memoir Istanbul: Memories of a City, lies rather in the division between the old (which is usually the local and the Islamic) and the new (generally the western and the secular). The relation between the two is still tense: I had to walk through a security machine just to go to the movies. And Pamuk himself, though Turkey&apos;s most famous modern citizen, was brought to trial in 2005 simply for mentioning his country&apos;s brutal treatment of Armenians in 1915 (the next year, perhaps in response, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature).     The Basilica Cistern. Photograph: Yadid Levy/Alamy    Istanbul today seems as compressed and vital a model of the larger globe as you could find; one morning, when I\u00a0awoke just before dawn, I could hear the call to Islamic prayer from every minaret, even as I could faintly make out the sound of hip-hop pounding along the streets. I&apos;ve always been something of a global creature: I was born in England to parents from India and I grew up in California, though I\u00a0now live in Japan \u2013 and for much of my life I&apos;ve sought out global places that are trying to piece together, as I\u00a0am, disparate cultures and identities, to make a stained-glass whole. Istanbul is most attractive to many for its complex, layered past \u2013 its harems and mosques and cemeteries and bazaars; but for me it&apos;s intriguing as an image of the future. It was no surprise, I thought, that President Obama visited the city within three months of taking office. The minute I arrived in town \u2013 my first trip back in more than 20 years \u2013 I could feel the contemporary excitement that makes Istanbul one of the hottest destinations around. The narrow, cobblestoned streets around Ortak\u00f6y Mosque were so crowded on a\u00a0Saturday evening, close to midnight, that I could hardly walk. Little boys were letting off neon-blue paper dragonflies, like homemade fireworks, and local girls whose tiny skirts and wild blonde tresses suggested Shakira were slipping past black-clad doormen at the Angelique nightspot. A small stall was offering tarot readings and tattoos, and behind it the Bosphorus Bridge was bathed in red hues, then blue, then yellow, so it seemed more a giant Slinky than a thoroughfare between two continents.     Restaurants lining the Galata Bridge. Photograph: Jorg Greuel/Getty Images    The particular promise and confidence of the city today lies to some extent in the fact that it has been three times the centre of the world; for centuries it has known how to talk and trade with Russia to the north, Iran to the east, Central Asia just behind and Europe all around. Unlike, say, a Dubai or an Abu Dhabi it can be in tune with the future precisely because it has so rich a sense of the past and such seasoned wisdom about the cycles of culture and history. I walked into the spice bazaar one day and found LCD signs in Japanese (though the merchants there were fast-talking in French and Portuguese and Spanish). And the most commonly seen couples in the backpacker area of the old district of Sultanahmet were beaming young Korean women on the arms of leather-jacketed young Turks who&apos;d just won them over. Around them, the handful of restored Ottoman boutique hotels that had greeted me in 1986 now numbered 200. Everywhere there seemed to be a natural savoir faire that reminded me of cities such as Mumbai and Shanghai, able to rise from every setback to put themselves in sync with the moment. Even the 6th-century caverns at the Basilica Cistern are lit now in nightclub colours with &quot;Summertime, and the livin&apos; is easy&quot; piped incongruously around its Medusa columns.     Istinye Park mall. Photograph: Peter Horree/Alamy    Yet for all the racy Italian fashion ads (on the Asian side of town) and for all the salesmen (on the European side) laying down carpets on the streets at 9pm from which to sell toys and electric shavers, the city can seem to the anxious as if it&apos;s on its way to becoming the next trendy, but perennially torn, Beirut. To this day, more than 97% of Turkey is Asian, which makes Istanbul an anomaly as well as a beacon. And a city of 500,000 souls in 1920 now contains up to 25\u00a0times that many as people flood in from the Anatolian heartland, perhaps unsure themselves whether the economic opportunities the city offers are worth embracing if they also bring with them secular European values. The newspapers were all talking, when I visited, about a new &quot;hip&quot; mosque in the \u00dcsk\u00fcdar area, said to be the first such building designed by a\u00a0woman. But it seemed a fair guess that the silent majority across the country, away from the imported surfaces, still saw &quot;hipness&quot; and mosques as pointing in opposite directions. &quot;It&apos;s the most eastern part of the west and the most western part of the east,&quot; a Turkish student said when I asked a class in the smallish city of Isparta (through its American teacher) what they thought of Istanbul. He didn&apos;t add that that could result in collision as much as in collusion. I kept trying to remember how Istanbul might look to a Turk, for whom it is an invigorating model of the future. If foreigners are always drawn to what is &quot;Turkish&quot; about the place, the Turks who pour in from the interior are, for equally good reason, drawn towards everything that seems cutting-edge and international. One of the students I&apos;d questioned told me: &quot;People in Turkey say: &apos;The earth of Istanbul is made of gold.&apos;&quot;     Taksim neighbourhood. Photograph: Peter Turnley/Corbis    It certainly can seem that way around the boutiques and caf\u00e9s of the privileged quarters. After staying across the street from the Blue Mosque in Sultanahmet, I moved one day over to the Bentley Hotel, near Nisantasi, and walked into a\u00a0minimalist white-and-black lobby with fashion magazines from Sweden laid out on a table. A framed letter next to the front desk expressed the thanks of a cardinal who had stayed here recently while travelling with the Pope. And after checking into a designer room there, I took a\u00a0taxi down to the Istanbul Modern Art Museum, whose in-your-face canvases shout out that Turkey today refuses to be boxed inside a\u00a0foreigner&apos;s quaint notions of it. Since the summer day was buoyant and warm, I boarded a cruise ship travelling up the Bosphorus, and as we passed the yali summer houses set along the water, I was forcibly reminded that affluence and style are nothing new here; novelist Gustave Flaubert, visiting in 1850, had said that Istanbul, a century hence, would be the capital of the world. At the Sakip Sabanci Museum, much of fortunate Istanbul was reclining on the museum&apos;s lawns listening to live jazz as men in polo shirts picked nonchalantly at slices of watermelon; the museum&apos;s restaurant had, in 2007, been named by Wallpaper* magazine as one of the hottest new eateries on the planet. In the old wooden houses of Arnavutk\u00f6y, not far away, trendy couples were dining on terraces filled with bright flowers, as if posing for a vision of what many young Turks in the countryside might see as the good life. &quot;Turkey managed to live through, in 2007, the paradox of an elected party rooted in Islamic tradition stating that it wishes to maintain the secular republic set up by Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in 1923,&quot; Manoutchehr Eskandari-Qajar, a political science professor in California, told me, and it survived the further paradox of the nation&apos;s military, determined to protect that secularism, refraining from taking over the new government by force. If Turkey could maintain such a balance, my friend, an expert on the Middle East, had said, he had high hopes for it. But culturally the whole country seems to be perched on a tightrope. Just three weeks before I arrived, the city had placed a ban on smoking in its coffeehouses and eating places; this seemed about as plausible as banning red wine in Paris or noodles on the streets of Beijing. By the time I began walking around, angry proprietors were already launching loud protests in the streets, claiming that the ruling had stripped them of up to 80% of their business. And for those who love Istanbul, the small change seemed symptomatic of a city that was eager to show how European and modern it was, even though its heart \u2013 and character \u2013 lie in its very pungency and closeness to its eastern roots. &quot;Istanbul has always been about raw life, from the murderous driving and yawning potholes in the roads to the street brawls and the smoke-filled teahouses,&quot; Nigel McGilchrist, a sometime resident of Turkey and author of the Blue Guide Greece: The Aegean Islands told me of the city he has known for more than 30 years. &quot;It&apos;s not Belgium or suburban Gloucestershire; it&apos;s the nearest thing to India in the west.&quot;     The city's modern art museum. Photograph: Jordi Cami/Alamy    Even as Turkey cherishes its almost half-century-long wish to become a formal part of Europe, it seems reluctant to leave behind the ancient identity it still so proudly maintains. For centuries Istanbul has taken in Greeks and Armenians and Jews, and in areas such as Balat and Fener the echoes of their presence are what give the streets their savour. Yet none of those groups seems to have affected &quot;Turkishness&quot; at the core or coloured the city&apos;s sense of itself. After a week visiting every corner, I realised I had not seen a\u00a0single woman working in a\u00a0hotel or restaurant or caf\u00e9. &quot;I worry,&quot; McGilchrist went on, &quot;that Turkey wants to become European in all the stale, bureaucratic ways, without embracing important, deep-rooted values of Europe, such as respecting the rights of dissenting writers to express their views.&quot; And as I walked past the Robinson Crusoe bookshop, boasting its large selection of English-language books, as I sat in a little room in the orthodox area of Fatih, where a sheikh was leading followers in passionate Sufi chants to the sound of a tambourine, I began to feel that the power of the city lay precisely in the fact that its next move could never be anticipated. The true nature of Istanbul seems always in dispute \u2013 or in passage, at least, like the boats constantly crisscrossing its waterways.     Asmalimescit, with its hip cafes.  Photograph: Alamy    I had seen more chadors and head scarves here than I had noticed in Syria or Egypt \u2013 but the women with blonde ponytails were still sipping $20 cosmopolitans among the trendy caf\u00e9s of Asmalimescit. There were few signs of the poverty I was used to in places like Jakarta or Marrakech. Yet outside the glamorous areas, Istanbul did not seem a wealthy city \u2013 especially for the millions who stream in and end up in drab apartment blocks without the new lives they dreamed of. Statistically it claims to be one of the safest cities in Europe, but it didn&apos;t strike me as particularly friendly. Watchful and guarded, Istanbul seemed the place where the age-old reserve of Greece runs into the very different kind of foreignness of Pakistan. Pamuk had been similarly circumspect in his evocation of the hometown he has been exploring all his life. &quot;This is indeed a city moving westward,&quot; he had written, &quot;but it&apos;s still not changing as fast as it talks.&quot; One day while I was there, phone lines back home to Japan went down for 24 hours. In the internet caf\u00e9s I found that Turkish-language keyboards prevented me from logging on to AOL. And as I checked out of my fairly fancy hotel in Sultanahmet, a gracious desk clerk asked me to write in a tip (a first, in my 30 years of travel). I did so \u2013 but when he gave me back the bill I saw that he had doubled the amount on the sly. On my very last night in Istanbul, I decided to put all my ideas and thoughts of a global future away. What really excited me about the place, I came to realise, was simply the sense of ceaseless movement, the way the energies of an Asian metropolis pulsed through largely European streets, so that the whole place seemed, intoxicatingly, a work in perpetual progress. And nowhere was the habit of making hard-and-fast distinctions dissolve more apparent than on the water. So I stepped on to a ferry in Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, in Europe, and went across to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, in Asia. On arrival, I passed through the turnstiles, turned around and bought another token for a ferry passing through the Golden Horn, back to Europe. The sun was starting to set, and the late-afternoon light turned every face to gold. Lovers were courting on the white wooden benches, waiters jounced past us carrying trays holding glasses of orange juice and apple tea. I watched secretaries in high heels teeter home through the sharpened dusk and giggling schoolgirls trying out their French on captive tourists on the boat. From every bridge we passed, men had thrown down fishing lines, which I&apos;d never seen from the ferries of Hong Kong or New York. To one side of us, the Bosphorus Bridge was turning red and blue and\u00a0yellow again; to the other, the minarets and mosques of Sultanahmet looked more unearthly than ever, illuminated against a\u00a0blue-black sky. As soon as you begin to know a place, I thought, all talk of\u00a0&quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; or &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; becomes redundant. Just the movements inside it, the way it comes\u00a0closer and then slips away: that&apos;s all the excitement you need.

A US journalist was punched and kicked in the face and more than a dozen other journalists manhandled, detained or delayed as they covered the events which revealed official anxiety over similar protests against authoritarian rule in China. Few expected Chinese citizens to answer the &quot;jasmine revolution&quot; appeal, which urged them to express their desire for reform by &quot;strolling&quot; past a McDonald&apos;s on Wangfujing shopping street and spots in 22 other mainland cities. In addition to the heavy police presence, street cleaning vehicles and men with brooms swept back and forth along the designated streets in Beijing and Shanghai, preventing pedestrians from slowing down. A construction site appeared on Wangfujing earlier this week, blocking off a stretch outside the hamburger bar. Associated Press reported that Shanghai police used whistles to disperse a crowd of around 200, although it was unclear if the people were anything more than onlookers. It said officers detained at least four Chinese citizens in the city and two others in Beijing. It was not clear, however, if those detained had tried to protest. In a statement, the Foreign Correspondent&apos;s Club of China said it was &quot;appalled by the attack on one of our members by men who appeared to be plain clothes security officers in Beijing. This video journalist was trying to do his job when he was set upon and repeatedly punched and kicked in the face by officers as part of a general crackdown in Wangfujing following calls on the internet for a protest in this area. &quot;More than a dozen other journalists who went to this part of Beijing to report had problems, including being manhandled, pushed, detained and delayed by uniformed police and others,&quot; it said. A handful of people sought to protest last Sunday following a similar message on the overseas Boxun site. But no one knows who was behind the message \u2013 they may well be abroad \u2013 and many thought it a joke. &quot;The idea that a Jasmine revolution could happen in China is extremely preposterous and unrealistic,&quot; said Zhao Qizheng, a former head of the government&apos;s information office, according to Hong Kong&apos;s Beijing-friendly Wen Wei Po newspaper. Most observers \u2013 including those highly critical of the Chinese government \u2013 agree. Although China downgraded its 2011 growth forecast on Sunday \u2013 from 8% to 7% \u2013 the country continues to enjoy a remarkable economic rise that began 30 years ago and has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. In a rare webchat, the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, who is seen as the government&apos;s sympathetic face for ordinary citizens, also stressed that controlling inflation was a priority. &quot;Rapid price rises have affected the public and even social stability,&quot; he said. Analysts agree that China is unlikely to face an uprising similar to the ones in the Middle East and North Africa. &quot;They [the Chinese government] are delivering economic growth. Egypt did not have a leadership succession system; China does at a certain level. The army is not independent; it is under the party&apos;s lead. China does not have al-Jazeera [television]. It&apos;s hard to see what the commonalities are,&quot; said Nicholas Bequelin, Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch. Yet recent days have seen possibly the harshest crackdown on dissidents and activists in years, said the Chinese Human Rights Defenders network (CHRD). More than 100 people have been summoned or questioned and at least five detained on state security charges that can carry decade-long prison sentences. They include the high-profile blogger Ran Yunfei, from Sichuan, who friends say is held on the unusually tough charge of subverting state power. &quot;We arrest hundreds, even thousands, of people a day. How can we remember each one&apos;s name? What&apos;s certain is that if someone is arrested, he or she must have broken the law and needs to be punished accordingly,&quot; said a provincial police spokesman. &quot;It&apos;s pretty rare for criminal detention to be the final step. Usually it will lead to formal arrest and once you have that, especially in state security cases, it is almost a guarantee there will be a conviction,&quot; said Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua foundation. Authorities are particularly anxious because China&apos;s annual political meetings begin in Beijing on Thursday. The vast majority of people in China will never have seen the protest appeal thanks to one of the most extensive and sophisticated censorship systems in the world. Internet censors have tagged &quot;Wangfujing&quot;, &quot;jasmine&quot; and even, at one point, &quot;today&quot; as sensitive words. Well-known Beijing blogger &quot;Tiger Temple&quot; said such controls have ensured that underlying political awareness does not compare to that in Egypt before the revolution. &quot;Chinese citizens do not even know what a citizen is \u2013 they know only that they are like lambs, the Chinese leaders are their parents, that they have enough to eat, to drink; why they should be against [the government]?&quot; he said. Others point out that the bloody crackdown that followed the pro-reform protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 sent a chilling message on the danger of confronting the Chinese Communist party. &quot;The fear factor has worked for 20 years,&quot; said Wu&apos;er Kaixi, a student leader now living in exile. That movement taught the party to eradicate any challenge before it can take root. It has also systematically studied the collapse of the Soviet Union and the colour revolutions, such as those in Ukraine and Georgia. While political demonstrations are rare in China, protests about specific grievances are growing in the country, with more than 90,000 incidents each year. Anger about corruption, land grabs, police brutality and other abuses has broken out in violent &quot;revenge attacks&quot; by disgruntled individuals and even mass riots. Wang Songlian of the CHRD network pointed out that the party fears rival organisations more than discontent. &quot;It has been very skilful in preventing any national linkages between groups,&quot; she said. Some campaigners think the clampdown may not reflect nervousness over this particular call, but a broader push against newly assertive activists by an increasingly powerful and well-funded security apparatus.", "tags": ["China", "Protest", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Global development", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-27T18:30:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/28/gamesblog-live-andy-tudor", "sentences": ["I think Bathurst is one of my favourites, as is the new Shanghai circuit."], "title": "Gamesblog Live: Need for Speed Shift 2's Andy Tudor on simulation versus emotion", "article": "     As lead designer of Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed, Andy Tudor is close to finishing the second iteration of the simulation wing of Electronic Arts&apos; Need for Speed driving game franchise. He is the only home-grown developer at Gamesblog Live \u2013 Slightly Mad Studios is based in London \u2013 Tudor revealed the complexities of making an ultra-realistic racer, and argued passionately about how mathematical realism in games falls flat unless it is complemented by emotional engagement. What level of detail do you have to go into to make a modern racing game realistic? Starting from scratch, with the cars in the game, we get the CAD data from the manufacturers. We have great relationships with the manufacturers, and they want to be in our game. Of course, we want them just as much, to showcase these amazing cars that most of us can&apos;t afford to buy. They give us all their assets, and when you look at those amazing cars, there&apos;s craftsmanship in terms of the technical side of things \u2013 how fast they go, their acceleration and so on \u2013 and then the aesthetic side. So the craftsmanship that they put into the real cars, we try to recreate as accurately as possible, in 3D as well. And it&apos;s the same with the tracks. We try to get as many tracks in as possible, and to get them mathematically correct, but we also take the guys out to track days, so they can drive the tracks themselves. Because what you find is that what looks correct on a Google Earth map doesn&apos;t necessarily give you the same sensation when you drive it. You find yourself thinking things like: &quot;Oh my God, that&apos;s way steeper than I thought it would have been, or than the mathematical height elevation tells me it is.&quot; What are your favourite cars and tracks? In Shift 2, we&apos;ve got variety, which people want. It&apos;s like if you ask me what my favourite game is, I wouldn&apos;t be able to answer that, because I like one from each genre \u2013 one last-generation game, one handheld one, one MMO and so on \u2013 so when it comes to my favourite cars, I personally drive a muscle-car, but other people may hate that. The new Pagani, which we announced today, is absolutely stunning. But then there are lots of people who like old retro machines. Do you have tracks such as the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife in Shift 2? Absolutely: we&apos;ve got fifty unique locations in the game now, including the Nordschleife and the N\u00fcrburgring GP circuit. Then we&apos;ve included the Bathurst circuit. Again, speaking to variety, Bathurst is something we really wanted in the game \u2013 it&apos;s out in Australia, there&apos;s an epic event there every year, and the scenery stretches out over an amazing vista, which you won&apos;t get somewhere smaller, like Hockenheim. I think Bathurst is one of my favourites, as is the new Shanghai circuit. In technical terms, what does Shift 2 have that other racing games don&apos;t? The simulation genre, really, is just a numbers game at the moment; it&apos;s all about &quot;We&apos;ve got the greatest physics engine, and we&apos;re going to add 1,000 cars, tracks etcetera.&quot; Which is quite a dry experience. We want to turn that on its head, by adding in social features, such as Autolog, for example: which lets you compete with your friends, even if they&apos;re not online right now. But having that thing, where I can see all your lap times, and spend half an hour or an hour trying just to beat you is great. And we&apos;re continuing to pioneer in new areas. Many games have night racing, for example, but nobody has night racing like we do it, because previous games have always done it the same as normal, just with darker lighting \u2013 there&apos;s no new gameplay in there at all. What we do is strip away all the lights and now you&apos;ve just got your headlights to guide you, which is a scary place. That&apos;s based on feedback which has been given to us by real drivers: they say: &quot;We&apos;ve got these high-beams on, but as powerful as they are, we still can&apos;t see the next corner coming up.&quot; Is Shift 2: Unleashed finished yet? We&apos;re so close to finishing \u2013 we&apos;re just adding the last 5% of polish, making sure that things are stable and everything is as polished as it can be, and it will be released on 1 April. Where can simulation games go in the future? What lies beyond complete realism? One thing is that graphics will always get better and better: cars will look smoother, tracks will have more spectators and detail \u2013 every single blade of grass will be modelled and all that. So we can sort of discount that: that will naturally happen. Where we feel it&apos;s going to go is adding in the real feeling you get when you&apos;re driving: the emotional response, the G-forces. When you&apos;re sat at home on the couch with a gamepad, that&apos;s already one step removed from a wheel, which is one step removed from actually being in a car with suspension and so on. We feel that rather being just a mathematical simulation, we need to be an emotional simulation of what&apos;s happening. So with the helmet cam, for example, the physics from the track are transferred to the tyres, which are transferred to the suspension, which goes to your body, which goes to your head, and that&apos;s where the helmet cam comes in. Your head moving around simulates the stuff you can&apos;t actually feel with just a gamepad in your hands. What can you tell us about the racing drivers you used as consultants? I&apos;m sure lots of other games say they had feedback from drivers, but in Need for Speed&apos;s case, we have a racing team, Team Need for Speed. They&apos;re out there \u2013 they won the Dubai 24-hour race, running a BMW Z4 GT3 car. And another team are winners of the Formula D Drift championship. Those guys are winners, the best in their field, and they are driving under the Need for Speed flag. They&apos;ve been giving us feedback on how the cars feel, how they handle, what angles the lights should be at, how powerful they should be, how hard the handbrake should be, what angle your head should be at going into a corner and so on. That kind of feedback is probably unprecedented. How do you reckon Shift 2: Unleashed stacks up against Gran Turismo 5? I&apos;ve gone on record before saying GT5 and Forza are on pedestals at the moment: everyone believes they are the games to beat. They are great products, but they stop at being a numbers game, a mathematical simulation of great physics, whereas we go beyond that with the emotional and social aspects. This has happened previously in games, when FIFA was trying to keep up with Pro Evolution Soccer and Dante&apos;s Inferno with God Of War: it&apos;s the same kind of sparring we have with our competitors. We&apos;ll see where we go, but we&apos;re in it for the long haul.", "tags": ["Need For Speed", "Games", "Technology", "Racing games", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-28T09:05:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/feb/28/ku-li-robin-hyde", "sentences": ["After a stopover in Hong Kong, she changed course for Shanghai."], "title": "Poem of the week: Ku Li by Robin Hyde", "article": "This week&apos;s poem, &quot;Ku Li,&quot; was begun in China during the second Sino-Japanese War. It&apos;s among the last poems by the New Zealand writer, Robin Hyde, completed not long before she committed suicide in London, aged 33, in 1939. It&apos;s a remarkable poem to have emerged from a relatively short and certainly perilous period of travel that included a trip to the frontline. Imagine a foreign correspondent currently in the Middle East producing such an empathetic, vivid and polished piece of writing against the pounding of gunfire and the pressure of deadlines.  But Hyde was a remarkably focused writer. Her careers as novelist, campaigning journalist and poet were crammed into a short life beset with personal difficulties, including poor physical and mental health. Born Iris Guiver Wilkinson in Cape Town in 1906, she was taken to Wellington, New Zealand as a baby. Her father worked in the Postal and Telegraph service, and the family&apos;s circumstances were modest. Iris was always strongly influenced by her father&apos;s leftist values, and, as a young woman, rejected the conventional social boundaries represented by her mother. Both Hyde&apos;s children were born out of wedlock. Her second son, Derek Challis, was to become her biographer, and produced, with Gloria Rawlinson, The Book of Iris: A Biography of Robin Hyde, in 2002. Her first child died at birth. She named him Christopher Robin, and subsequently began writing as Robin Hyde. She is best-known as a novelist, but poetry was her passion, and her technique continued to evolve to the end. While her early work can seem &quot;Georgian&quot; in tone and colour, she was always a literary explorer: a late poem, &quot;Incidence&quot;, for example, is written with a modernist&apos;s spatial sense, and provides an instamatic shot of a particular moment. Hyde was clearly set to become a major poet. Always restless and hungry for experience, she had intended to visit England at the beginning of 1938. After a stopover in Hong Kong, she changed course for Shanghai. The war with Japan had begun and she was to experience many dangers and difficulties, not least a 50-mile walk along a railway line to escape from beleaguered Hsuchow. Her experiences resulted in the prose book Dragon Rampant, besides the series of poems which includes &quot;Ku Li&quot;. &quot;Ku Li&quot; is a representative figure rather than an individual. The two words, as the poem explains, mean &quot;bitter strength&quot; and the Coolie&apos;s eternal plight is to be exploited by his masters, and used, virtually, as slave labour. The Hundred Names is a metonymic reference to &quot;the common man.&quot; It seems likely that Hyde knew of Arthur Waley&apos;s translations from the Chinese, and perhaps, when the poem describes Ku Li as playing &quot;horse without a bridle&quot; there&apos;s an intended echo of Pound&apos;s &quot;The River-Merchant&apos;s Wife: A Letter&quot; (&quot;you came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse&quot;). Ku Li has the powerless status of the child, though he is hardly playing: he &quot;carts a world along, and carts a war.&quot; Margaret Orbell describes finding &quot;a code of alert irony&quot; characteristic of the work of many New Zealand women poets (Ursula Bethell, Fleur Adcock) and this quality seems to inform Hyde&apos;s tone, too. She mocks the &quot;sweet-belled idle&quot; and their ignorant racism, but, more importantly, she shows a certain tough humour, as well as anger and compassion, on behalf of Ku Li. He is not aggrandised by the poem, any more than he aggrandises himself (&quot;Not claiming to have died for something&apos;s sake&quot;) \u2013 not, at least, until the end, where water (the river) and fire (glazed tiles) symbolise his unrecognised immortality. The strong, hard rhymes, sometimes driven across stanzas (&quot;dosed&quot;/ &quot;bossed&quot;) and the flexible rhythms give this poem&apos;s iambic pentameter a muscular quality, full of action and movement and variation. The verse embodies Ku Li&apos;s ceaseless labour and the ruggedness of his landscape. Generous and outward-looking though the vision is, the reader can&apos;t help feeling that Hyde is not only paying tribute to the &quot;bitter strength&quot; of the indomitable Chinese peasant, but describing her own heroic quest to write the truth of her country and her self. Ku Li Two words from China: &apos;Ku li&apos; \u2013 bitter strength. &apos;This coolies&apos; war!&apos; tinkle the sweet-belled idle. His face and Hundred Names sweep on below, Child-like, he plays at horse without the bridle: And carts a world along, and carts a war, Tugging perhaps to mountain heights at length: The new vernacular chronicles exhort him, And waste their breath. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 His grinning face can&apos;t know Half the fixed meanings of the flags he saw: He had a happy childhood: then time caught him, Broadened his shoulders, but forbore his head. Eight years his life between the shafts: eight hours (With luck), between Changsha and Hsuchowfu, Picks swinging like pendulums in a noon of flowers: Shining their freedom, bombers spot his blue, But cease to count. Too poor for marriage-bed He looks for dreaming in the big dim shed, Rolled in the quilt where other warmth has dossed: Turns to Yunnan, hacks the next strategy through, Cheerful; and often killed; and always bossed. And not on Tiger Head or Purple Mountain His grave-mound rises: worlds live on, to slake Their ashy gullets at his bitter fountain Of blood and vigour. Enemy armies break Somehow on this, as somehow cracks the stone Under his pick: but now he rots alone (Not claiming to have died for something&apos;s sake,) Only the earth makes ready for his bone, The green rice sees him with unflattering eyes: Too cheap a partisan for man to prize, Men seldom know him for their broadest river, And burnt in the immortal tiles forever.", "tags": ["Poetry", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-28T12:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/feb/28/guangzhou-opera-house-zaha-hadid", "sentences": ["They were sandcast in an old fashioned foundry in Shanghai where the sparks flew like ."], "title": "Move over, Sydney: Zaha Hadid's Guangzhou Opera House", "article": "     I walk up the ramp of the new Guangzhou Opera House, and suddenly it seems like Chinese New Year. The brand new skyscrapers that surround it, each named after some global finance corporation, burst into neon life, flickering and flashing in a way that makes Las Vegas seem like a mere twinkle. By contrast, the opera house seems almost serene \u2013 remarkable given that it&apos;s the latest design by Zaha Hadid, an architect celebrated for buildings that shoot across the urban landscape like bolts of lightning. Yet, while the pulsating lights disguise what are regular office towers, once inside, Hadid&apos;s opera house reveals itself in all its complexity, at once highly theatrical and insistently subtle. Set in Haixinsha Square, a brand new stretch of south China&apos;s ever-expanding trading city, the opera house takes the form of what appear to be two enormous pebbles that might have been washed up on the shores of the Pearl river, on which Guangzhou stands. Rough-shaped things sheathed in triangles of granite and glass protrusions, one houses the main auditorium while the smaller encloses a multipurpose performance space. There&apos;s no question, though, that the opera house is best experienced at night. As darkness falls and the foyers fill up with people, the building magically comes to life. The opening-night audience has come to experience Akram Khan&apos;s cacophonous dance piece, Vertical Road. Yet all eyes are trained on the doors as the architect makes her entrance. Tonight, Hadid is architecture&apos;s Queen of the Night, making stately progress through a phalanx of photographers. For the British contingent in the wave-like foyer, there is something special in seeing Hadid inside the building she should have built in Britain years ago. Ah, yes, the Cardiff Bay Opera House. In 1994, Hadid had designed a magical theatre for the Welsh coast. It would have become the most radical and compelling building in Britain, but an alliance of narrow-minded politicians, peevish commentators and assorted dullards holding the Lottery purse strings ensured it was never built. More than a decade on, Hadid has built her opera house. Of course, it&apos;s not the same design, yet the building embodies the spirit as well as something of the presence of the great theatre we could have had in Britain rather than here, 6,000 miles away. The Chinese had been thinking of an opera house in Guangzhou as early as 1993, when mayor Lin Shusen championed the new commercial and cultural quarter by the river. &quot;It was incredible,&quot; says Hadid. &quot;When I first came to Guangzhou in 1981, it seemed such a hard and dour place with everyone in Chairman Mao uniforms. By the late 90s it had begun to grow very fast indeed, but where we&apos;re standing now [in the foyer of the opera house], there was nothing whatsoever.&quot;     Bursting into neon life ... Zaha Hadid's Guangzhou Opera house. Photograph: Dan Chung for the Guardian    Even in a city famous for building at breakneck speed, the opera house has taken more than five years to complete. But then, this was never going to be an ordinary commission. The main building comprises a freestanding concrete auditorium set within an audacious granite and glass-clad steel frame. The exposed frame is a stunning thing, a kind of giant spider&apos;s web protruding in several unlikely directions. It seems to challenge the laws not just of conventional geometry, but of gravity itself. The Chinese state engineers charged with the project were pushed to new limits. &quot;The magic, though,&quot; says Simon Yu, the Scottish-born project architect, &quot;is in the joints that hold the structure in place.&quot; We look up at them. Here are star-like, cast steel junction boxes that keep the adventurous structure in tension. They look spectacular. &quot;We made them the same way they made great medieval bells. They were sandcast in an old fashioned foundry in Shanghai where the sparks flew like .\u00a0. . fireworks.&quot; Between this exposed steel skeleton and the auditorium lie the foyers. Here, you are hard pressed to find a straight line. They waltz around the auditorium, twisting, turning, ducking and weaving. Grand stairs slope and twist majestically from the black granite floors of the foyer up to the balconies and upper tiers of the auditorium. Audience members will find it hard to break away from these spectacular vistas and take their seats. The auditorium proves to be a further wonder, a great grotto like a shark&apos;s mouth set under a constellation of fairylights. The space is asymmetric, but despite its unusual shape, the acoustics are perfect; the work of Harold Marshall, the veteran New Zealand acoustician. Intriguingly, he says that the strange angles of Hadid&apos;s auditorium work to produce an acoustic perfectly suited to both western and traditional Chinese opera. &quot;There are very, very few asymmetrical auditoriums,&quot; says Marshall. &quot;But asymmetry can be used to play with sound in very satisfying ways; it&apos;s more of a challenge tuning it, but the possibilities are greater, and this one has a beautifully balanced sound.&quot; Could it have been done in Cardiff Bay? &quot;Of course it could.&quot; &quot;Next year,&quot; says Yu Zhang, the president of the opera house, &quot;we will be putting on Chinese versions of Cats and Mamma Mia.&quot; No one can accuse the Guangzhou Opera House of elitism. In fact, the aim has been to shape a building, and an institution, open to all talents. In the backstage areas, lucky schoolchildren as well as professional musicians and dance companies will rehearse in stunning mirrored rooms set under rippling ceilings, calling to mind underwater caverns and grottoes. Outside, the experience of strolling between and around the two &quot;pebbles&quot; is an extension of this architectural performance. The narrow crevice between the two structures reminds me a little of the enchanting entrance to Petra in Jordan through high walls of narrowing rocks. Local people clearly enjoy it. One boy runs up a sloping wall and tries to perform a somersault. Another seems to wonder whether he might race his bike up the opposite slope; but, with so many unsmiling security guards about, he decides, wisely, to pedal on. An even greater performance lies above. Here, by night, the surrounding towers appear to grow out of the tops of Zaha&apos;s &quot;pebbles&quot;, creating ever more surreal skyscapes at each turn of the head. These views can be experienced from inside the lobbies, too, lit from end to end by windows cut into the roofs and ceilings. Through these, you can see the drama of the city even while strolling through the depths of the opera house. &quot;The idea,&quot; says Hadid, &quot;is that the building is really a part of the city and you&apos;re aware of the city even when inside. It doesn&apos;t just go away.&quot; A post-opera stroll Hadid has long talked about the idea of buildings as landscapes, of shaping structures and spaces within them as if they might meander like a river. This is a beautiful idea very nearly realised in Guangzhou. If I have a criticism it is this: instead of dropping down to meet the Pearl River, the landscape of the opera house ends abruptly with further developments, including a viewing stand built for the 2010 Asian Games, and a concatenation of lumpen apartment blocks. It would have been so very special to have stepped out of a performance of Billy Budd or The Flying Dutchman and to have walked down to the river without having to think about which way to turn. Even then, Guangzhou has to be applauded for giving Hadid and her team such a free hand with the design, when such a building has yet to make its debut in Britain. Despite building on a grand scale around the world, in the UK Hadid has just a school in Brixton, Maggie&apos;s Centre in Kirkcaldy and the Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Olympics to her credit. For, here is an architect clearly in love with the arts, and who is an artist herself. A performing one, too, as she receives the adulation of Guangzhou walking slowly and yet so proudly through a building that she had been thinking about for almost 20\u00a0years.", "tags": ["Zaha Hadid", "Architecture", "Art and design", "China holidays", "Asia", "Travel", "Opera", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2011-02-28T21:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/mar/01/jane-russell-life-in-clips", "sentences": ["In the former, she and Mitchum meet up in a sleazy Mexican bar, while the second, a globetrotting affair in the mould of Josef von Sternberg&apos;s pre-war Shanghai Express, has Russell belting out torch classics like One for My Baby."], "title": "Jane Russell: a life in clips", "article": "As a 20-year-old and the object of Howard Hughes&apos;s attentions, Jane Russell was force-fed into a series of low-cut dresses for The Outlaw (1943).             She plays Doc Holliday&apos;s girl Rio, who falls in love with a wounded Billy the Kid when he hides out with her, on the run from Pat Garrett. Not remotely historically accurate, this blood-heat western is best remembered for the censorship squabbles over exactly how far Russell was allowed to lean over while tenderly ministering to the Kid. Hughes&apos;s legendary underwired cantilevered brassiere was designed during the shooting of the film, but Russell denied she ever wore it.            The Paleface (1948) was a real change of pace: a comedy western with Bob Hope as the useless dentist Peter Potter, who plays husband to Russell&apos;s deep-cover Calamity Jane. Songs, giggles and full Technicolor, it was a recipe for success that made a sequel, Son of Paleface (1952), inevitable.

In the former, she and Mitchum meet up in a sleazy Mexican bar, while the second, a globetrotting affair in the mould of Josef von Sternberg&apos;s pre-war Shanghai Express, has Russell belting out torch classics like One for My Baby. Von Sternberg, though, was fired during production after repeatedly clashing with Mitchum; Nicholas Ray was brought in to finish things up.            Russell&apos;s best-known film, and the one she&apos;ll always be rememberedfor, is one in which, even though she had top billing, she pretty muchplayed second fiddle to emergent superstar Marilyn Monroe. The &quot;twolittle girls from Little Rock&quot; in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) were perfect sweater-girl fantasy figures for the mid-1950s: Monroe blonde and ditsy, Russell dark and sassy. Russell&apos;s apparent acceptance of Monroe&apos;s bombshell superiority \u2013 and ability to parody it \u2013 won her lots of friends. She may not have got to sing Diamonds Are a Girl&apos;s Best Friend, but she did have Ain&apos;t There Anyone Here for Love.            After this high point, Russell&apos;s star began to decline. Howard Hughes had her courting controversy once again in The French Line (1954), inwhich she pranced around in a then-outrageous swimsuit with holes cutin it. She made the epic cattle-drive western The Tall Men (1955) for director Raoul Walsh, opposite Clark Gable; her own production outfit made Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955), a sort of semi-sequel to Blondes, with Jeanne Crain in the Monroe role, and she played tough in The Revolt of Mamie Stover (1956), as a hardboiled dancehall hostess who tries to make a go of it in Hawaii.            The truth was, though, that as the 1950s wore on, Russell&apos;s smouldering, tight-lipped charms seemed more and more out of place, and, after the failure of The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown (1957), she more or less packed in movie-making. Her commitment to Christianity and rightwing politics \u2013 surprising, you might think, for such a censor-baiting figure \u2013 helped push her away from Hollywood. She made a few cameos in the late 60s \u2013 including a turn in biker exploitation flick The Born Losers (1967), the original Billy Jack movie \u2013 but nothing she was ever proud of.", "tags": ["Jane Russell", "Film", "Marilyn Monroe", "Culture", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-01T14:17:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/01/china-foreign-journalists", "sentences": ["Chinese officials have warned foreign journalists they need advance permission to report from parts of Beijing and must not do so from a particular spot in Shanghai, marking an apparent tightening of media restrictions.", "Officials had now told some media they require special permits to report in several parts of Beijing, the club said, and in Shanghai journalists had been asked to sign pledges not to film or photograph at the proposed protest site."], "title": "China tells foreign journalists to respect rules after scuffles at non-protest", "article": "Chinese officials have warned foreign journalists they need advance permission to report from parts of Beijing and must not do so from a particular spot in Shanghai, marking an apparent tightening of media restrictions. A foreign ministry official appeared to blame the move on overseas journalists who said they were harassed at the site of proposed protests that did not materialise. Bloomberg News said men who appeared to be plainclothes police kicked and beat its cameraman in front of uniformed officers on Sunday, and a BBC correspondent said he and a colleague were roughed up and thrown into a van. Five news organisations reported having equipment confiscated or materials destroyed and other journalists were detained, delayed or manhandled as they reported from the site of proposed &quot;jasmine revolution&quot; protests, according to the Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club of China. Officials had now told some media they require special permits to report in several parts of Beijing, the club said, and in Shanghai journalists had been asked to sign pledges not to film or photograph at the proposed protest site. No one knows who has made the calls for demonstrations, which were posted on an overseas website. Extensive censorship has ensured the vast majority of Chinese citizens are unaware of them and few of those who knew of earlier announcements showed any intention to protest. But authorities appear nervous following uprisings in the Middle East and have cracked down on dissidents and activists. The annual political meetings begin in Beijing this week and are always accompanied by intensified security. Pressed on Sunday&apos;s attacks on Wangfujing, a popular shopping street, the foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a regular briefing: &quot;Many media organisations haven&apos;t encountered any trouble while reporting in China for many years. Why do some journalists always run into trouble? I find it strange. The journalists should really respect the laws and regulations.&quot; She added: &quot;That place is a busy street, the flow of people is large and not a single thing was happening. Who did so many reporters receive a notice from [to attend]?&quot; She said reporters had ignored police instructions to request permission before reporting there. But police rang only some journalists and some of those said they had been told only to obey reporting regulations. &quot;The police provided reasonable guidance, and the journalists should understand and co-operate,&quot; Jiang said. &quot;If both sides take this attitude, we can minimise the occurrence of such incidents.&quot; She said journalists should report assaults to the police. Regulations were relaxed ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games to allow reporters to work freely anywhere in China bar Tibet, where special permits are required. But in practice authorities have closed areas to the media when they consider them sensitive. In March 2008, reporters were barred from Tibetan areas in Sichuan as unrest spread. The government now seems to have put several areas of the capital off-limits to routine reporting, although Jiang said regulations had not changed. Local media are under far more pressure than overseas organisations. They are heavily censored and reporters have been fired for covering sensitive material. Bob Dietz, the Asia coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said Sunday&apos;s incidents were &quot;the worst aggression against the foreign press we&apos;ve seen since the Olympics in 2008. &quot;Such a heavy-handed response discredits the ruling Chinese Communist party and highlights their fear of popular opposition,&quot; he said. The outgoing US ambassador, Jon Huntsman, has described the harassment and assault of journalists as &quot;unacceptable and deeply disturbing&quot;, and the EU delegation in Beijing urged Chinese authorities to hold the perpetrators to account.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Press freedom", "Media", "Global development", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-01T18:48:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/02/1", "sentences": ["The Independent, P10 Also on MediaGuardian.co.uk today Daily Telegraph internal inquiry clears journalists of Vince Cable leak Telegraph&apos;s IT team questioned about leak of business secretary&apos;s &apos;declaration of war&apos; on Rupert Murdoch to BBC HMV shares plunge on new profits warning HMV shares drop by 5p to 15.75p as it warns City that earnings for the current year would be below expectations Pearson freezes stake held by Libyan Investment Authority Financial Times owner&apos;s move comes after UK government order to block assets of Muammar Gaddafi and his family Average broadband speeds &apos;less than half those advertised&apos;, says Ofcom Britons get average broadband speed of 6.2 megabits per second, less than half average advertised speed of 13.8Mb Julian Assange &apos;Jewish conspiracy&apos; comments spark row Ian Hislop writes in Private Eye that Assange accused him, the Guardian and Index on Censorship, before withdrawing claim 500 Desert Island Discs episodes to be made available online Archive to be accompanied by searchable database of every composition, book and luxury item chosen on Radio 4 show China tells foreign journalists to respect rules after scuffles at non-protest Journalists told they need advance permission to report from parts of Beijing and must not do so from a site in Shanghai Oscars 2011: ABC&apos;s audience down by nearly 10% Awards ceremony hosted by James Franco and Anne Hathaway attracts 37.6m viewers compared with last year&apos;s 41.3m ITV appoints former head of E4 as director of digital channels Angela Jain takes role vacated by new BBC 3 controller Zai Bennett and will be responsible for ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV Europe&apos;s highest court to rule on Google privacy battle in Spain Court to decide whether Spain&apos;s data protection authority has power to demand removal of newspaper articles from search engine"], "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "article": "Top stories on MediaGuardian.co.uk     The X Factor helped to boost ad revenues at ITV.

They will often ask interview questions about when you have set yourself a challenging goal, or about particular achievements you are proud of. Where are you going to get material to answer these questions if you only ever do things that are easily within your capabilities? If you only do the minimum you can get away with, how will you demonstrate your potential? This isn&apos;t just about getting a good grade in your degree, you also need to think about developing in-demand skills to the highest level you can. This will mean stepping outside your comfort zone and doing things that scare you. If you&apos;re afraid of giving presentations, look for opportunities to present. If you&apos;re OK with presentations, look for more challenging presenting opportunities. If you&apos;re doing mundane part-time work to bring in money, ask about taking on more responsibility. As you do more things, your confidence will increase. You will probably make mistakes \u2013 don&apos;t worry. Learn from them and look for opportunities to do better next time. Whatever specific skills or qualifications employers may look for, they are always interested in graduates who can show initiative and who are able to develop themselves. Dr Peter Slowe is founder and director of Projects Abroad, which offers short-term overseas volunteer work placements Time spent volunteering abroad can help get you noticed: Volunteering abroad doesn&apos;t automatically get you a job when you get back home, but it helps you to get noticed and shortlisted. If there are 500 applicants for 20 posts in a company, the HR department has to go through all the CVs to select applicants for interview. If you have a degree and have worked for a supermarket in the holidays, then that puts you in with almost every other applicant. On the other hand, if you&apos;ve worked on a human rights project in Cape Town or have helped to save a coral reef off Cambodia, then there&apos;s really something to talk about, so you&apos;re more likely to get chosen for an interview.  There are also real vocational volunteering projects like working in a law firm in Shanghai or medical projects in Mexico that most certainly helps with applications for particular jobs. It&apos;s not a complete answer but since it&apos;s also something that&apos;s really worth doing anyway, you should consider adding volunteering abroad to your CV. Glyn Heath is managing director of IT consultancy Centiq  Paid employment alongside your studies can boost your CV: In a recent round of interviews, we looked for candidates who showed a level of maturity in their CV. University is quite an artificial environment, so even though work experience isn&apos;t necessarily a deciding factor, it can certainly help to differentiate you from the crowd and show that you can operate in the real world. For example, one of our six graduates was an assistant manager of a pub chain, showing us that he had the necessary communication skills and work commitment for the job. Becky Ascough is project manager at Graduates Yorkshire, a social enterprise which matches graduates to employers in the region An internship could lead to a full-time job \u2013 and boost your skills: Competition for graduate roles is fierce, so work experience is essential in order for graduates to stand out from the crowd \u2013 but many students struggle to afford to take on unpaid work. An internship scheme aims to make graduates more employable by offering paid work experience, coaching and mentoring. Lots of businesses use internships to identify graduate talent and it gives graduates the chance to impress \u2013 but also to see if a role is right for them. In the past year we have placed 130 interns in Yorkshire businesses and 85% of these have continued into full-time employment. Those who aren&apos;t successful have still gained valuable work experience and skills to stand them in good stead for securing future employment. Penny de Valk is the chief executive of the Institute of Leadership and Management (ILM) It&apos;s not just what you&apos;ve done, it&apos;s how you present it: Take the time to tailor your CV and covering letter to the requirements of the role you are applying for, and pay attention to the language you use \u2013 it\u0092s not just what you say, but how you say it that counts. Business communication should be focused, concise and evidence-based, which can be a stretch for some graduate applicants. Steer clear of cliches. Stand out from the thousands of other hardworking and ambitious team players\u0092by focusing on your achievements in and out of work and study, and how they showcase these particular qualities. Ayesha Patel is a regional development manager for the business education charity Career Academies UK Get the most out of work placements: It is important to identify a mentor at the beginning of your placement \u2013 someone who you can emulate and seek advice from. Think about what you want to achieve from your experience, such as particular skills or a network of contacts, and make sure you discuss these with your mentor. It is also important to evaluate your own experience, thinking carefully about how well you complete each task, what type of activities you enjoy and what you do not like. This is very helpful in helping you decide what kind of career you would enjoy and be successful in. One other thing that often gets overlooked about work experience is the post-experience follow-up. Whether your placement is six weeks or six months long, make the most of it as it will last a lot longer on your CV. Keep in touch with your mentor and other contacts, as not only your academic qualifications, but also your workplace skills and the people you impress along the way, will help shape your future. Ruth Spellman is chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute Think about ways you can boost your skills while still studying: While internships and work placements are a great way to prepare yourself for the world of work, you will also find that many of the activities you already take part in at university will be contributing to your skillset. For example, by taking part in a student union society you can demonstrate your ability to work as part of a team, lead people and manage projects. There&apos;s a lot of data out there which suggests employers are particularly impressed by graduates with professional as well as their academic qualifications.  If you really want to stand out from the crowd, you should think about taking qualifications in leadership and management while at university. It says to employers: &quot;I&apos;ve gone that extra mile&quot; and because the skills are transferable, they can genuinely act as a career passport.

The largely rubber-stamp parliament, which opens on Saturday, will discuss the country&apos;s social and economic aims for the next five years. The rise in spending will fuel concerns among rival powers about China&apos;s increasing might. They are already concerned about its apparently tougher line on territorial disputes in areas such as the South China Sea, and its investment in new technology such as a stealth fighter jet. In 2010 spending rose at its lowest rate for years, by 7.5%, to 532bn yuan. Li told a news conference: &quot;China&apos;s defence spending is relatively low by world standards. China has always paid attention to restraining defence spending.&quot; Many analysts believe China spends more than it states publicly. US military spending has doubled in real terms since 2001 and although the Obama administration has vowed to cut spending over the next five years, it has requested a Pentagon base budget alone of $553bn (\u00a3340bn) for 2012. India also announced a rise in its annual military spending this week by about 11.6%, to 1.64tn rupees (\u00a322.4bn). Experts suggested the jump was intended to counter China&apos;s growing strength. Professor Huang Jing, a north Asia security expert at Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew school for public policy, said there were often substantial increases in China&apos;s military budget \u2013 usually including a rise in officers&apos; salaries \u2013 when it was preparing for a change of leadership. Its leaders also felt they were entering a period of uncertainty, with domestic challenges and upcoming leadership contests in countries such as the US, Japan and India, he said. &quot;Leaders will have less political capital to spend on foreign affairs, and foreign policy tends to be more expendable for political capital at home, so I think all of them will be tougher on foreign affairs.&quot; Huang said China&apos;s military buildup began in the mid-90s as it became concerned Taiwan would seek legal as well as de facto independence. &quot;The defence industry is a kind of machine: once you start it, you cannot slow it down. 2010 to 2050 are going to see a dramatic expansion of Chinese military power,&quot; he predicted. &quot;You also have to take into consideration that China&apos;s military seems to have become more influential in decision-making, or they at least voice their concerns louder than before.&quot; Xu Guangyu, director of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said the budget was &quot;not really high&quot; given the size of the army. He said the country&apos;s five-year plan, which focuses on raising living standards, will require salary and welfare improvements for the 2.3 million personnel, in part to offset the effects of inflation. &quot;The other reason is that the cost for military equipment is going up, especially for high-tech weapons.&quot; He predicted growth would slow again next year. Ni Lexiong, a defence expert at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said the increase reflected closer military cooperation between the US, Japan, South Korea and other countries in the region. He also pointed to Beijing&apos;s need to deal with new threats to its citizens and assets overseas.

The commentary in the Beijing Daily newspaper urged citizens to &quot;conscientiously protect harmony and stability&quot;, adding: &quot;At home and abroad, some people with ulterior motives are trying to draw this chaos into China. They have used the internet to incite illegal gatherings.&quot; Chinese authorities have reacted harshly to an anonymous call for &quot;jasmine revolution&quot; demonstrations, detaining or harassing scores of activists and dissidents, although the calls to rise up may have come from abroad and only a handful have shown interest in protesting. Another call has been launched for gatherings, again appearing on an overseas website. The official China News Service said Beijing had mobilised 739,000 police officers, officials, security guards and volunteers to maintain security during the week-long National People&apos;s Congress. Wen&apos;s two-hour talk, to about 3,000 delegates, stressed the importance of reining in inflation, with promises to build up reserves and even impose price controls if necessary to restrain food prices. &quot;This problem concerns the people&apos;s wellbeing, bears on overall interests and affects social stability,&quot; he said. Inflation hit 4.9% in January, although many economists believe food prices \u2013 the biggest concern for many \u2013 will fall soon as the worst effects of bad weather wear off. Overall the 12th five-year plan outlines a strategy to shift an economy that is heavily dependent on state investment and exports to a more sustainable position, fuelled by consumption. It aims to boost household income and put private enterprises on a more even playing field, and includes commitments to increase social spending. &quot;They seem more serious about these issues than they have been previously, but it doesn&apos;t guarantee that any of this will get done,&quot; said Alistair Thornton, China analyst at IHS Global Insight. &quot;There&apos;s a growing consensus that this time it has to be different. There&apos;s more emphasis in this plan than the last one, specifically on income growth.... [But] they need a bigger shake-up to get the results that the rhetoric suggests they want. &quot;What we were optimistically looking out for \u2013 although we recognised it was unlikely \u2013 would have been an actual target on income growth or consumption growth. They did say they were targeting a rise in consumption, which has been declining as a share of GDP.&quot; The work report sets the usual economic growth target of around 8% this year, but reduces the figure for the five-year period to 7% annually, down slightly from last year.

In a joint statement today they said: &quot;London continues to be widely recognised as one of the world&apos;s leading international financial centres, a position it has built over many decades through deliberate policy action.

After Britain&apos;s biggest bank, HSBC, was forced to deny reports that it plans to quit the UK because of the bank levy and bonus tax, the CBI warned George Osborne to give a deadline for scrapping the 50p tax rate or risk losing talented business people and growing companies to cheaper locations abroad. The CBI director general, John Cridland, said wealthy business people needed to play their part in cutting the deficit but warned that top-rate taxpayers would be tempted to quit the country if the 50p rate became a permanent feature. &quot;Mobile talent needs a good reason to do business in the UK, so the chancellor should signal a road map for reducing the 50p tax rate,&quot; he said. The warning comes after HSBC dismissed as &quot;speculative and presumptuous&quot; reports that it was planning to relocate to Hong Kong because of what it saw as punitive tax and regulation. The Sunday Telegraph quoted a major investor as saying that it had been told a move to Hong Kong was &quot;more than likely&quot;. The bank&apos;s leaders blamed last week&apos;s disappointing annual results on the government&apos;s bank levy and bonus tax, and have repeatedly warned against suggestions that the banking commission should recommend breaking up the banks. But in a joint statement the chairman, Douglas Flint, and chief executive Stuart Gulliver said: &quot;London continues to be widely recognised as one of the world&apos;s leading international financial centres, a position it has built over many decades through deliberate policy action. We have been very clear that it is our preference to remain headquartered here. &quot;We are, however, in the light of possible regulatory changes and additional costs such as the bank levy, being increasingly asked by shareholders and investors about the likely additional cost of being headquartered in the UK. We are very clear that the City of London&apos;s competitive position deserves protection and HSBC will play a full part in this; we are encouraged by the UK government&apos;s recent commitments to do the same. Talk of imminent change in HSBC&apos;s position on this matter is entirely speculative and presumptuous.&quot; HSBC, which stands for Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, is expected to decide in the autumn whether to keep its headquarters in the UK and the decision will be a key test of the coalition&apos;s tax policies. Flint has warned that the bank levy \u2013 which costs the bank \u00a3700m a year \u2013 is a location tax. The bank is also concerned about the banking commission, which reports in September and may recommend that banks such as HSBC are broken up. Comments by the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, at the weekend that banks were exploiting customers for short-term profit and storing up the seeds of another financial crisis could lead to further disenchantment with the UK regulatory regime. The bank made just 13% of its profits in the UK last year and has moved the office of the chief executive to Hong Kong, from where it moved its headquarters to the UK almost 20 years ago. Cridland said he had found widespread discontent among business managers at the tax rate as he toured the country. Osborne has signalled his intention to reduce taxes, including income taxes, at the earliest opportunity but has refused to commit himself to a timetable. The budget on 23 March is expected to include several measures to support companies that find it difficult to access credit from banks. However, his room for manoeuvre will be severely limited without a U-turn on plans to cut the deficit. The TUC&apos;s general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: &quot;Ordinary people are already paying a heavy price for a recession caused by the banks and finance industry. Yet now the CBI and the banks are saying that those who have the broadest shoulders should be the first to get relief. The chancellor must resist.&quot; The demand to signal the end of the 50p tax rate, which was brought in by Labour before the last election, was among a series of proposals to support the economy put forward by the CBI in its submission to the Treasury ahead of the budget. The CBI said policies for growth and jobs should focus on medium size companies that are starved of credit by banks and lacked practical support from government departments. Cridland said most of the measures put forward by the CBI would cost little to implement and would have an impact within the next five years. He urged Vince Cable&apos;s Department for Business and Skills to scrap unnecessary regulations and make good its plans to boost exports with the offer of credit guarantees and loans. He argued exports would bring extra jobs as long as stifling regulations that encouraged firms to move abroad were eliminated. He said: &quot;The budget should create the framework for a Mittelstand of mid-cap businesses by ensuring they can access the capital to expand at home and abroad.&quot; Recent figures have shown manufacturing leading the economy out of recession following a 20% cut in the exchange rate.

Though no link was made between these two developments, the government may be anticipating one. At first sight, the issues of environment and security could not be further apart, at least in terms of their very different contributions to China&apos;s international image. This was evident this weekend, when the government of prime minister Wen Jiabao drew plaudits from green groups and anger from human rights organisations. The praise was for the new five-year economic plan, which contains several progressive environmental policies (listed below) aimed at slowing emissions growth, cutting pollution and switching the focus of development from GDP quantity to sustainable quality. The criticism was for a sharp rise in public security spending, which for the first time overtook the military budget. Unease about the possible rise of a police state was further heightened by official threats and harassment of foreign journalists attempting to cover &quot;jasmine&quot; protests in Beijing and Shanghai on Sunday. Apart from police and reporters, almost nobody has turned up at these demonstrations, but the government is clearly uneasy. The immediate cause of concern for China&apos;s unelected leaders is the spreading wave of pro-democracy unrest in the Middle East. Longer term, however, there are deeper causes of tension related to environmental stress, notably the rising prices of food, oil and other commodities. With its new five-year plan, China is trying to avoid an ecological crash by gradually easing speed and changing direction. But this could pose a challenge to social stability. If the government is serious about slowing economic growth, trimming emissions, conserving scarce resources and improving air and water quality, there will be a social and political cost to pay. Unemployment is expected to creep up, commodity prices are likely to rise and polluters and power companies will not accept restrictions without a fight. If China had a democracy, the struggle could be conducted on the hustings and in the press and the courts. Without those means for conflict resolution, the government may well need more police to impose its goals. Full details are yet to be published of the key environmental goals for the next five years, but in his opening address to the National People&apos;s Congress on Saturday, Wen Jiabao sketched out an outline. It included: \u2022 Lowering annual GDP growth to 7 percent. This is likely to be treated as a floor rather than a ceiling, but it is a recognition that the double-digit expansion of the past five years is unsustainable. \u2022 A new carbon intensity goal will try to slow emissions growth relative to GDP by 17 percent, which should be just enough to ensure China meets its Copenhagen commitments, though WWF and Greenpeace called for more ambitious targets. \u2022 The energy intensity target \u2013 the level of emissions allowed per unit of GDP \u2013 has dropped to 16 percent, which reflects the struggle China had to meet its previous target of about 20 percent, even with rolling blackouts in some areas. \u2022 Renewables should account for 11.4 per cent of the country&apos;s energy supply, up from 8.3 percent. Though green sounding, this will mostly be achieved through an expansion of hydropower and nuclear plants. \u2022 Forest cover should increase to 21.7 percent of the nation&apos;s landmass, up from 20.4 percent. The key, here, however will be in the quality of the forests. If they are just monocultures, there will be little support for biodiversity. \u2022 Reduce major pollutants by 8 to 10 per cent. Details to be revealed, but there is likely to be an expansion of the pollutant targets to include nitrogen oxide, ammonia and, possibly, PM2.5 small particulate matter. If so, this would be a a progressive step. \u2022 New policy tools to reduce carbon and other pollution, through cap-and-trade systems, taxes and fossil fuel consumption limits. These mechanisms are likely to be launched initially as pilot projects, on a regional or sectoral basis.

A list of &quot;company endorsements&quot; of the Duke of York&apos;s performance as Britain&apos;s special trade envoy, compiled by his private office, backfired when it emerged that many of the tributes were four years old. An attempt by Downing Street to dismiss reports that ministers were preparing to downgrade the duke&apos;s role also ran into difficulties when No 10 sources made it clear that his position would become untenable if more damaging details emerged. The operation to defend the duke came as his former wife issued a strong apology for accepting money from a convicted billionaire sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. The Duchess of York told the London Evening Standard she was guilty of a &quot;gigantic error of judgment&quot; for accepting \u00a315,000 from Epstein to help her pay off her debts. The duke has faced intense criticism in recent weeks over his friendship with Epstein, who is facing a new FBI investigation over allegations of his involvement with underage girls. A picture was released last week of the duke with his arm round Virginia Roberts, then aged 17, who claims she was sexually exploited by Epstein and his friends. The teenager said she met the prince, who allegedly enjoyed massages at Epstein&apos;s home. The prince categorically denies any wrongdoing or impropriety. The duke&apos;s links with Epstein prompted a cabinet minister to tell the Guardian over the weekend that a &quot;tasking review&quot; would be used to downgrade his role as Britain&apos;s overseas trade envoy. The minister insisted, however, that the government could not force the duke out of the role. Senior figures in Downing Street, alarmed by damaging headlines in the Guardian and other newspapers, ordered officials to launch an operation to rally to the duke&apos;s defence. A senior figure told the BBC that the government had no intention of removing him. But the source added that if more damaging details emerged about the duke&apos;s business and personal links his position would become untenable. As the BBC reported that the duke had been given what amounted to a yellow card, Downing Street intensified its defence amid fears that it could become entangled in a row with Buckingham Palace. The confusion put pressure on Craig Oliver, the former BBC News at Ten editor, in his second week as the new Downing Street director of communications. Cameron&apos;s spokesman said at the daily 11am briefing that the prime minister had complete confidence in the duke. The spokesman said: &quot;The prime minister thinks he is doing an important job and is making a major contribution and he is supportive of him in that role. We are not reviewing that role in any way. The government&apos;s position is very clear: that we support him in his role as trade envoy.&quot; George Osborne endorsed the duke during a cabinet away-day in Derby. &quot;We have confidence in him doing the job and we think he&apos;s done a good job in recent years. He&apos;s promoted British exports. What we want is everyone promoting British exports at the minute and Prince Andrew has done that.&quot; Downing Street announced that a list of endorsements of the prince would be released to highlight strong support among business leaders for his role as trade envoy. A few hours later, shortly before 3.30pm, UK Trade and Investment released a list of 17 statements of support from business leaders under the headline &quot;Company Endorsements&quot;. The government body, which organises the duke&apos;s work as trade envoy, admitted that the list had been compiled by his office from a list of existing endorsements on his website dating back to 2007. A UKTI spokeswoman said: &quot;It has been compiled by his office. It is up on his website. It has been compiled over a period of time. Every trip he has been on people are asked for their feedback and it gets posted up. &quot;It is not this week. It is not in response to anything that has been happening this week. They are contemporaneous insofar as they are up on the website and they are still current because these are trips he has done not so long ago. It is 2007 onwards. Some will be really modern, some will be less modern.&quot; Mike Gapes, a former Labour chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, called on the duke to stand down :&quot;We need to be able to question our trade envoys about who they meet, what they do, what they do on behalf of our country \u2026 Because of his royal position, we can&apos;t do that.&quot; However, Labour showed sensitivity over the affair when the leadership ordered Chris Bryant, the former Europe minister, and still a frontbencher, to stop calling for the duke to stand down. Bryant was told to leave the duke alone after he told the Today programme that he should stand down because &quot;he is a bit of an embarrassment&quot;. A useful club in Team UK&apos;s bag? Prince Andrew looked genuinely pained. His press officer looked nervous. The interview had not begun well. I had made the mistake of asking him to describe his &quot;job&quot; as special representative for UK Trade and Investment (UKTI), the government&apos;s trade promotion arm. &quot;What you fail to understand \u2026&quot; he answered, before sighing and tailing off. Royals have roles, not jobs, was his point, when he eventually deigned to make it. Given the recent furore over the prince&apos;s dealings with convicted paedophiles and deposed dictatorships, soon he may not have either. It was 2006, and he was in Shanghai as part of a whirlwind trade tour of China. His advisers wanted to rebrand the prince as a serious, statesmanlike figure, based around his UKTI role. The duke \u2013 as he is known among his entourage \u2013 did not help himself. He used a golfing analogy to describe his role as part of &quot;Team UK&quot;, promoting British business abroad. He was one of many different clubs in the golf bag used by the government, depending on the situation, he explained. His advisers were paranoid about me using these quotes, for fear it would reinforce his image as a golfing playboy. At an exclusive, 90-minute interview in his apartment in Buckingham Palace a year later, he displayed a remarkable level of openness for someone who is regularly pilloried in the press. It is true that he had met me on the China trip the year before, and obviously felt I was trustworthy. But he seemed oblivious to the pitfalls of engaging so freely, most notably when talking about the cost of his trips to the taxpayer. I told him the \u00a3500,000 annual cost could be a considered a &quot;bargain&quot;. He did not appear to notice the flippancy of the remark, pressing on unflinchingly: &quot;In terms of the return on investment to the UK, I would suggest that \u00a3500,000 is cheap at the price.&quot; His press officer blenched, fearful of how his comments would appear in print.

Experts have mounted a renewed push for a relaxation of the strict family planning laws at an annual political meeting in the capital, warning that the country&apos;s population of 1.3 billion is becoming dangerously unbalanced, with too few adults of working age supporting too many of their elders. Officials, concerned that hinting at an end to the curbs could lead to a huge rise in the number of births, have quashed previous public discussion of a change. The one-child policy was adopted in 1979 after China&apos;s population surged \u2013 in part because Mao Zedong had suggested procreation was a patriotic duty. Some families \u2013 such as ethnic minority households or farmers whose first child is female \u2013 are already exempt. The government has been gradually relaxing regulations, for example by allowing two only children to each have two offspring. Experts in the field believe a uniform two-child rule would be fair, easy to enforce and would help to rebalance the population. Speaking at the Chinese People&apos;s Political Consultative Conference \u2013 an advisory body meeting now in Beijing \u2013 Wang Yuqing said officials were studying proposals for a two-child policy and that he believed it should be introduced gradually. Wang, deputy director of the CPPCC&apos;s National Committee of Population, Resources and Environment, told the New Express Daily he believed urban couples whose first child was female might be allowed to have a second child from as early as 2015. Wang added that cities such as Beijing and Shanghai were already experiencing declining birth rates, in line with the international trend for people to have fewer children as living standards rise. Pilot projects for a two-child rule have also suggested it would not result in a population boom. The South China Morning Post said another official had confirmed the government was considering a new exemption for five provinces, which would allow couples to have a second child if one of the parents was an only child. Li Jichun, the deputy chairman of the Heilongjiang provincial CPPCC, said it had not been decided whether his province would be included. Official statistics from the government&apos;s population agency suggest the fertility rate \u2013 the average number of births per woman \u2013 is still around 1.8 in China, slightly lower than in the UK but far higher than in Japan or Italy. Others put the figure far lower, although it is not clear whether they account for births that should be registered but are not. Ji Baocheng, a member of the rubber-stamp legislature the National People&apos;s Congress, said there was a pressing need for a two-child rule because if the policy was not changed in time, the population structure would be severely imbalanced. According to state news agency Xinhua, over-60s make up more than an eighth of the population and will account for a third within three decades, with their numbers growing to 400 million as the number of younger people falls. Speaking to New Express Daily, Ji pointed to the burden faced by couples caring for two sets of parents. &quot;The responsibility will be overwhelming,&quot; said Ji, who is also president of Renmin University. Ye Yanfang, another CPPCC member, said nine out of 10 experts had been pressing for a relaxation of the policy for several years. But he added: &quot;[The authorities] are still worried that more people will drive up the unemployment rate in the future.&quot; Experts also argue that the one-child policy was never supposed to be a permanent measure, but was meant to bring down population growth to a manageable level. Tian Xueyuan, a leading member of the team that oversaw the policy&apos;s introduction, told the Jinghua Times: &quot;The purpose of the policy was to control birth rate for one generation.&quot; Additional research by Lin Yi", "tags": ["China", "Population", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-08T10:49:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/09/bob-dylan-london-feis-2011", "sentences": ["On Tuesday, online ticket agent Mypiao.com began taking reservations for tickets to see the US legend play in Beijing and Shanghai on 6 and 8 April, according to reports.", "Tickets to see Dylan, who will turn 70 on 24 May, perform at the 12,000-seat indoor Beijing Workers Gymnasium and at the 8,000-seat Shanghai Grand Theatre, are reported to start at 280 yuan ($42) each.", "In 2009, Oasis were told they were &quot;unsuitable&quot; to play in Beijing and Shanghai as Noel Gallagher had appeared at a Tibet freedom concert 12 years earlier."], "title": "Bob Dylan to play London Feis 2011", "article": "Bob Dylan has announced his only UK date for 2011.

There are already widespread concerns about China&apos;s booming property market and the threat it poses to the country&apos;s expanding economy. China would spend nearly $200bn (\u00a3123bn) on an affordable homes and social housing scheme, said deputy housing minister Qi Ji in Beijing . The pledge came a few days after premier Wen Jiabao promised to &quot;resolutely&quot; curb speculation to tackle excessively rapid price increases. The authorities have taken various steps since spring last year to dampen the property market. These include raising interest rates, increasing the minimum downpayment required on second homes and restricting the rights of foreigners to buy property. Two Chinese cities are now imposing sales tax on property deals. While the measures have slowed growth, many fear it remains too high. In March 2010, urban housing prices shot up by 11.7% year-on-year, according to figures from the national bureau of statistics. December saw the lowest increase in more than a year, but it still stood at 6.4%. Economists are watching for the latest data anxiously: independent research from SouFun suggested a month-on-month increase of around 1% in January: the biggest such increase for half a year. Bears on the financial markets have long warned that China is in the grip of a property bubble, predicting that when it bursts it could knock the economy off course \u2013 and in doing so hamper the global recovery. More than a year ago, hedge fund king Jim Chanos described the sector as &quot;Dubai times 1,000 \u2013 or worse&quot;. Though few see it in quite such apocalyptic terms, many echo his concern. Others suggest that despite serious structural issues the situation is controllable, pointing to Beijing&apos;s careful monitoring of the situation. &quot;It won&apos;t be easy for prices to fall in the near future, but the bubble will break eventually,&quot; said Yi Xianrong, a real estate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). &quot;If it is broken gradually, through the government&apos;s efforts, it won&apos;t bring much harm; if it explodes all of a sudden, it will bring financial and social crisis.&quot; Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit added: &quot;The size of the market means that the world needs to be paying attention because what happens in the Chinese property market affects everything from steel outputs in Brazil to iron ore exports from Australia.&quot; He said his biggest concern was the gap between construction and sales that had emerged in the last year, as the government stimulus package kicked in. He added: &quot;Negative [real] deposit interest rates are stoking demand. There is clearly a lot of money flowing round the Chinese economy searching for a purpose, and housing is traditionally regarded as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.&quot; But he warned that like any speculative market it could be highly volatile. Authorities do not want investors to lose their shirts; at the same time, they are seeking to ensure that the less well-off can get a foot on the ladder. Rosealea Yao, principal analyst at Beijing-based Gavekal Dragonomics, suggested the cost of housing was now a bigger concern for many people than rising food prices. &quot;About 70 million people in the emerging middle class find themselves without hope of affording a decent house after more than 10 years of hard work,&quot; she said. Although speculation has pushed up prices, there are also underlying issues. As China urbanizses, around 15 million people are moving into the cities each year. Existing homes also need to be replaced; last year Qiu Baoxing, deputy minister of construction, said that most buildings had a lifespan of only 25 to 30 years. And incomes have risen steadily. IMF research published in December suggested that prices were broadly in line with underlying fundamentals. But it said there were signs of overvaluation in the mass market in several coastal cities, particularly Shanghai and Shenzhen, and in the luxury sector in Beijing and Nanjing. It also argued that house price corrections in China appeared to be relatively rapid, particularly when compared to -, say, - the US before 2008. Price increases appear to be spilling over, however; according to the National Bureau of Statistics, January&apos;s price rises were greater in second and third tier cities than the first tier locations, in relative terms. While housing prices in Beijing rose 6.8% year-on-year, AP reported that the southern city of Haikou saw a 21.6% rise and central Ganzhou saw a 12.3% rise. Most experts believe that many in China will have to put aside aspirations to home ownership. The government has said it will increase rental accommodation, Yao pointed out. Innes-Ker believes that predictions of doom in the housing market are over-egged: &quot;When push comes to shove, the government has the power to arrest any fall and I think it would take the action necessary to do so,&quot; he said. But others stress the weaknesses in Beijing&apos;s response to the housing issue to date. Yi of CASS said that restrictions on purchases were ineffective \u2013 there have even been reports of couples divorcing or faking divorce so they can buy extra properties \u2013 and that while the government had reined in credit, it had failed to use taxation as a tool. Chongqing and Shanghai have announced new sales taxes on properties, to much fanfare. But they apply to only a fraction of buyers and Yi pointed out that they are set at well below 0.5% \u2013 while Hong Kong has a property tax of 5%.", "tags": ["Business", "China", "World news", "Real estate", "Global economy", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-09T19:24:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/questioning-evolving-the-ecolabel", "sentences": ["A couple of years ago, a shipping container followed by the BBC went twice round the world in a year, stopping at Scotland, Shanghai, Brazil and Los Angeles along the way."], "title": "Questioning and evolving the eco-label", "article": "In the last fifty years, the value of internationally traded goods has increased from less than a fifth to more than half of world GDP.

But 33 years after Germany&apos;s Blue Angel, the world&apos;s first eco-label appeared, the time is ripe for asking: How well has the eco-label lived up to its ambitions? And how does the model need to evolve to accelerate more sustainable modes of consumption as 7 billion of us, and counting, bump up against the limits of the planet&apos;s natural resources? Certainly, many eco-labels have done a great deal to raise awareness and to create trust, to change what we expect from certain product categories, and to build capacity and create a common framework around sustainability. Consider the success of the Fairtrade movement in the UK, where sales of products topped \u00a31bn in 2010 and the 15th annual Fairtrade Fortnight is now drawing to a close.  But as Burrows notes, the eco-label model may have become too successful: &quot;A wide array of certification programs has been developed, creating confusion among customers and undue burden on farmers. The industry needs to better understand what is meaningful to customers and works best for producers.&quot; And it&apos;s not just the food and beverage industry that is affected. As of today, the Ecolabel Index lists 377 schemes in 211 countries and 25 industry sectors, from Italy&apos;s 100% Green Electricity to New Zealand&apos;s Zque natural wool label. In January alone, we saw announcements on a new label for wind energy, another front-of-pack nutritional label, and a certification process for conflict minerals. More worryingly, it&apos;s unclear how much impact eco-labels have really had. WWF&apos;s 2010 review noted &quot;insufficient comparable and meaningful data available&quot; on the impacts of certifications and roundtables. Not only that, impact isn&apos;t always the top priority for businesses: last week&apos;s ISEAL 100 thought leaders survey found that only 56% of those surveyed from the corporate sector saw &quot;improved sustainability performance&quot; as the main benefit of using voluntary standards, while 78% cited &quot;increased operational effectiveness&quot;. The need to question and to evolve the eco-label model is becoming more acute as global companies begin committing to audacious, long-term sustainability goals and need to find effective ways of delivering, as well as credible ways of communicating what they&apos;ve done. Consider Unilever, which has committed to sourcing 100% of its agricultural raw materials sustainably by 2020. How will the company deliver \u2013 and show that they&apos;ve delivered \u2013 on this goal when, as of 2009, only 8% of global tea production was certified sustainable according to one of 10 independent standards?  As Jan Kees Vis, Unilever&apos;s global director of sustainable sourcing, says: &quot;Companies and brands are struggling with the question how to mobilise consumers to give preference to products and brands that have the potential to deliver positive social and environmental outcomes. The tools available seem to be labels and brands, and I think there is room in the market for both.&quot; Eco-labels have started to evolve to meet the challenge: ISEAL and WWF have recently completed major strategic reviews of their voluntary standards and multi-stakeholder initiatives. But we need to step back and consider what eco-labels were designed to achieve in the first place, consider objectively the limitations of the eco-label as a tool, and ask how it can be complemented by other ways of creating trust and influencing behaviour change across global supply chains. Ultimately, eco-labels strive to accelerate sustainable behaviour. Neither consumers nor producers can be expected to do the right thing unless they know what that is, and eco-labels are to be commended for focusing on this need \u2013 as are the global companies who are pushing to make effective use of them.

Among those offering support are countries that are still recovering from the consequences of their natural disasters, such as Pakistan and Bolivia. China is among the 17 Asian states to offer support. It is providing $4.5m worth of humanitarian aid. The first shipment of emergency materials, including 2,000 blankets, 900 tents and 200 emergency lights, are due to be flown from Shanghai to Tokyo on Monday, the Xinhua news agency reported.

Reuters reported on Sunday that the mayor of Kandahar city in Afghanistan has pledged $50,000 to support relief efforts. The World Bank, Unicef, Unesco and the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs are among the international organisations pledging support. The World Bank president, Robert Zoellick, said: &quot;This is a heartbreaking situation and the World Bank Group stands ready to help the government and the people of Japan in the recovery efforts. As the extent of the tragic loss of life and damage is still unfolding in Japan we are also monitoring potential impacts in countries across the region and are ready to offer our support.&quot; International support is been offered in a number of ways. Rescue and relief teams have been flying into Japan over the weekend, including 63 fire service search and rescue specialists from the UK, which took up to 11 tonnes of rescue equipment, including heavy lifting and cutting equipment, two rescue dogs and a medical support team, and two search and rescue teams from the US, comprising almost 150 people and dogs trained to detect live victims. Some members of the UK team have recently returned from Christchurch in New Zealand, which was hit by an earthquake last month. The US has also provided $100,000 in immediate disaster relief assistance through its embassy in Tokyo. A spokesman from the Department for International Development said the UK had no plans to offer funds direct to the Japanese government, but the government &quot;stands ready to provide whatever help and assistance is needed&quot;. &quot;A specialist search and rescue team from the UK government is already on the ground in Japan.&quot; A 102-member rescue team is expected to head to Japan from South Korea on Monday. The German Federal Agency for Technical Relief is also sending assistance. Meanwhile, Minivan News in the Maldives reports that the president is sending 86,400 cans of Maldivian tuna to help with food shortages. The news agency said the delivery is an acknowledgement of Japan&apos;s assistance after the 2004 tsunami. The donation is worth around $93,700. The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), an umbrella organisation of 13 humanitarian aid agencies, said most of its members were &quot;unlikely&quot; to play any part in the response, although the British Red Cross has launched a fundraising appeal to support the Japanese Red Cross, which has been working on the ground since Friday and is reported to have mobilised more than 80 national disaster response teams. More than 600 staff, including doctors and nurses, have been sent to affected areas. Around 700 blankets have been distributed and some 30,560 more sent to the affected area for further distribution.

Countries still deeply affected by natural disasters or political unrest \u2013 including Pakistan, New Zealand, Afghanistan and Bolivia \u2013 are among those offering aid and support. China, which is engaged in a border dispute with Japan and views its neighbour with deep suspicion, is among the 17 Asian states that have pledged help, offering $4.5m (\u00a32.8m) in aid. The first shipment of emergency materials, including 2,000 blankets, 900 tents and 200 emergency lights, was due to be flown from Shanghai to Tokyo today. New Zealand, meanwhile, has sent a 65-strong search and rescue team. Although there have been no confirmed reports of British casualties in Friday&apos;s disaster, the foreign secretary, William Hague, has confirmed that some Britons remain unaccounted for in the country. Around 17,000 UK nationals are known to have been in Japan when the earthquake struck. The Foreign Office&apos;s emergency helpline has been contacted by more than 4,000 worried relatives and friends of those believed to have been caught up in the disaster. Anxious friends and relatives have reported several incidents of messages wrongly informing them of a death. Emma Hickebottom said her family assumed the worst when a message was posted on a people-finder web page about her brother Brian Hickebottom that read: &quot;I have received information that this person is dead.&quot; Emma, 28 and from Cardiff, said: &quot;We&apos;d had a spam email saying he was dead and we were very distressed. I came home to be with my parents but luckily Brian and his family are safe.&quot; The 34-year-old English teacher from Birmingham had survived by taking refuge in the school where he works, along with his wife, Sanae, 37, and baby daughter Erin, aged five months. Hague appealed to any Britons who are in Japan, or have recently left, to contact the Foreign Office or the UK Embassy in Tokyo to confirm that they are safe.

The unprecedented intervention failed to prevent the country&apos;s main stock market index plunging by more than 6% on Monday, followed by a further 6% slump early this morning when markets opened, but is thought to have averted a steeper fall. Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei index dragged down shares across the world as investors worried that a decline in the world&apos;s third biggest economy would reduce the value of goods and services the country bought from overseas. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares slumped by nearly 1% and its Europe-wide equivalent fell by 1.06%. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.15% in afternoon trading, while Germany&apos;s Dax and France&apos;s CAC 40 indices ended the day down 1.65% and 1.3% respectively. Analysts said European shares would probably have fallen further, if Brussels had not agreed at the weekend to increase the eurozone&apos;s bailout fund from around \u00a4250bn (\u00a3216bn) to \u00a4440bn, making a repeat of the Irish and Greek crises less likely. As Japanese workers battled to prevent a nuclear meltdown and the unrest continued in the Middle East, the price of oil and gas increased amid concerns that Japan, a country heavily dependent on nuclear energy, may need to significantly step up its consumption of fossil fuels. Japan typically gets about a third of its energy from nuclear power. It has seen its capacity reduced by more than a fifth by the country&apos;s worst earthquake, which has left 11 reactors out of action. Michala Marcussen, head of global economics at the French bank Societe Generale, said: &quot;Power supply is a critical factor. If power production output is damaged in a sustainable fashion, that could have a durable impact on the economy.&quot; The price of gas jumped by as much as 7.4% to the highest level since November 2008, while a barrel of Brent crude oil tumbled by $0.56, or 0.5%, to $113.28 at one stage before rising again slightly later. Gold jumped by as much as 1% to $1,431.89 (\u00a3885.34) an ounce and silver rose by more than 2% as rattled investors fled from any asset that looked risky into the relative safety of precious metals. The Japanese economy is expected to take a huge hit over the next few months as companies there, including foreign businesses such as GlaxoSmithKline, the British drug firm, temporarily cease production, with frequent disruptions expected to continue for weeks. Toyota, the world&apos;s largest carmaker, said that it would produce up to 40,000 fewer vehicles, as it closes 12 plants across the country until at least Wednesday night. The company will lose $72m for each day its operations are shut down in Japan. AIR Worldwide, the risk modelling agency, calculates that the global insurance bill for the earthquake will be $35bn (\u00a322bn), while the total economic losses \u2013 insurance costs plus lost productivity \u2013 would add up to more than \u00a362bn, according to the Equecat risk consultancy. Meanwhile, UK, European, US and Asian economies will also suffer, but to a far lesser degree, as exports to Japan fall. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHSGlobal Insight in New York, estimates the disaster could knock as much as 5% off Japan&apos;s gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter of the year \u2013 April to June \u2013 and between 0.3% and 0.5% over 2011 as a whole. The UK and the US are likely to see around 0.1% knocked off their GDP as a result of the disaster this year, with the Asian economies being hit &quot;about two or three times as hard as that&quot;, Behravesh said. &quot;With these kind of disasters, the economy typically takes a big hit to start with but later benefits from huge levels of reconstruction activity. I would expect a significant slowdown in Japan in the second quarter but then there could be a significant rebound as soon as the third quarter.&quot; &quot;Purely in terms of economic growth, the damage as a result of the disasters and the reconstruction activity roughly cancel each other out,&quot; he added. &quot;It is a rich country with a lot of savings and can handle this.&quot; In Asia, the effect of the earthquake on the leading stock exchanges was mixed. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index rose by 0.4% and China&apos;s Shanghai Composite edged up by 0.1%, with coal companies benefitting in particular on the hope that nuclear power problems in Japan would force the country to burn more fossil fuel at the same time as the expected frequent power cuts would allow Asian rivals to steal away some of its business. However, shares in Taiwan&apos;s TAIEX index fell by 0.56% to a three month low, on concern that the Japanese crisis would reduce tourists from the country as well as demand for exports. The earthquake also had a mixed impact on commodity prices. While some commodities increased, others, such as corn, cocoa, sugar, cotton and copper decreased, on concern that the decline of the Japanese economy would reduce demand for them. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 March 2011.

Now \u2013 following the most successful year for Europe&apos;s biggest economy since the euphoria that followed reunification two decades ago \u2013 that looks like the sort of prediction English football fans make ahead of each World Cup: premature, based on little more than wishful thinking \u2013 and wrong. &quot;We will have a golden decade now,&quot; says Hans-Werner Sinn, president of Munich&apos;s Ifo Institute, one of the country&apos;s leading thinktanks. Sinn wrote a book early in the last decade, when unemployment was high and pessimism rampant, called Can Germany be Saved? His view then was that it could be. Now he says it has been. The phrase &quot;crisis, what crisis&quot; also springs to mind outside the Audi plant an hour up the autobahn in Ingolstadt, where a happy band of German motorists have turned up to pick up their new cars, fresh off a one-kilometre production line churning out 2,500 vehicles a day, six days a week. &quot;2010 was our best ever year,&quot; says Jurgen de Graeve, Audi&apos;s head of communications. &quot;At the beginning of last year it was clear the market was about to turn up but we didn&apos;t expect it to happen so fast.&quot; Current trading conditions for Audi, as for the rest of German industry, have been transformed since the long, hard winter of 2008-09, when some factories slashed output by up to 90% as the financial crisis threatened a second Great Depression. Overdependent on its export sector, Germany suffered a 20% drop in manufacturing output in 2009. But government wage subsidies meant companies could keep highly skilled workers employed part-time rather than throwing them on the dole, enabling industry to respond quickly to the pick up in global demand. There is now confidence the traumas of 2008-09 will help the country reinvent itself after a troubled period in which the economy was hobbled first by the costs of reconstruction in the former East Germany, then by the uncompetitive rate at which Germany joined the single currency, and finally by the collapse of the IT bubble in 2001. It was then that the rumours of inexorable decline started to circulate. The list of defects was long: pampered workers; an over-generous welfare state; a too cosy relationship between companies and their bankers; the lack of a venture capital industry; too high a reliance on family-run manufacturing businesses; a population that was getting older and starting to shrink. Put together, the view was that for decades Germany had been living on past glories \u2013 the explosive growth of the Wirtschaftswunder, or economic miracle, in the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 and had allowed its economy to become sclerotic. Now there is belief the good times are coming back, and that some of the weaknesses flagged up in the 1990s and 2000s have turned out to be strengths. It will, however, take more than one year of powerful growth to convince sceptics \u2013 inside and outside Germany \u2013 that a second Wirtschaftswunder is guaranteed. The integration of the old communist lander is far from complete: money has moved from west to east, the people have moved in the opposite direction. Some Germans now say the old East Germany is the equivalent of a Potemkin village: the buildings have been given a makeover but the mass exodus of the young means there is no one living in them. The skewed nature of Germany&apos;s growth is also a concern. Unemployment is falling, and in rich states such as Bavaria it is below 5%, but there are few signs yet of a classic export-led revival broadening into a pick up in wages and consumption. Heiner Flassbeck, once adviser to Oskar Lafontaine \u2013 briefly the leftwing finance minister to Gerhard Schr\u00f6der \u2013 is one who says there is no real comparison with the 1950s and 1960s, when the proceeds of growth were shared by companies and their employees. In those days, German workers worked hard and grew prosperous, earning higher wages as the factories they worked in became more efficient. Over the past decade, there has been another productivity spurt as German companies have overcome the handicap of an over-valued exchange rate on entry into the single currency by making themselves hyper-competitive. This time, though, workers have not enjoyed the fruits of their labour. Real wages have stagnated, consumption stayed weak. &quot;Over the next 10-15 years there has to be an increase in wages to shift demand from the export sector to domestic demand,&quot; Flassbeck says, echoing the calls from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for Germany to play its part in evening out the imbalances in the global economy between those countries that run massive trade surpluses and those with chronic deficits. As the two biggest exporters in the world, China and Germany are seen as sharing a common problem: &quot;Chermany&quot;, it is said, needs to import more. Flassbeck says that unless Germany does so at a European level the euro cannot survive because weaker countries will face permanent austerity. Sinn believes that falling unemployment will eventually lead to increases in wages, which in turn will boost consumer spending. There is, though, little sign of Germany&apos;s policy-makers hastening this process. They seem quite content with the combination of factors that help explain Germany&apos;s comeback. The first is Germany&apos;s economic and political structure. Prosperity is far more widely spread across the country, with none of the excessive concentration of wealth in one region found in Britain. There is an emphasis on long-term growth rather than flipping assets, and boom-busts in the housing market are unknown. Germany was not immune from the speculative mania, and one reason Angela Merkel is prepared to bail out the struggling economies of the eurozone is that German banks are up to their eyeballs in Greek, Spanish, Irish and Portuguese debts. But there was still an industrial bedrock. Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, agrees. &quot;Looking back, some economies were putting too many of their resources into sectors such as real estate. Perhaps they overdid it. Germany benefits from an old-fashioned structure. What looked old fashioned was more durable. The UK has overdone it but it is not the only one. The Americans, the Irish and the Spanish all overdid it.&quot; So, while the City boomed and Wall Street became fixated by sub-prime mortgages and collateralised debt obligations, Germany concentrated on making stuff. This was true of the prestige international names like BMW and Siemens, but it was also true of the hundreds of thousands of lesser-known names that make up the Mittelstand. These are companies, often family run and in many cases founded a century or more ago, that provide the hidden wiring for the global economy. Germany provides the kit that other companies need to make their products, and the Mittelstand companies have become expert at dominating their corners of the market. It is not uncommon for a German company to have a global market share of 80% in a particular piece of equipment, and despite high labour costs customers keep coming back for the guaranteed delivery times, the reliability of the products and the after-sales service. The second explanation for Germany&apos;s renaissance is that the country finally embraced structural reform of its economy at least two decades after Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan pioneered deregulation, privatisation and welfare reform in the UK and the US. What happened, according to supporters of this theory, is that unlike Britain and America, Germany coped well with the oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s so saw no need to change anything in the 1980s. Towards the end of that decade, and increasingly after reunification, the economy became increasingly sclerotic, but the warning signs were ignored by Helmut Kohl. But by the early 2000s, the evidence of slow growth and high levels of unemployment was too powerful to ignore, so Gerhard Schr\u00f6der introduced the Agenda 2010 reforms which cut business taxes, slashed the top rate of income tax, made pensions less generous, cut unemployment pay and allowed the shops to stay open later. &quot;Schr\u00f6der didn&apos;t get the full credit for what he did,&quot; Mayer said. &quot;He attacked all the sacred cows and paid the price by losing the election to Merkel. Industry embarked on a ruthless cost-cutting programme, they exploited new production techniques and IT to make their operations leaner and more profitable. Some parts of manufacturing were moved overseas but not all of it. &quot;It is an amazing comeback. The country seems to be a lot more dynamic.&quot; Flassbeck has a different view. He blames the timidity of the unions on the changes introduced by the former SDP/Green coalition. &quot;There is no pressure for higher wages because of the fear of being fired. Schr\u00f6der killed the unions. That&apos;s a nice paradox.&quot; The third explanation is that German investors had their fingers burned in the financial crisis and are now keeping their money safely at home. That has provided the capital for an investment boom that will help keep German industry hyper-competitive in the future. Sinn says this is a real change from the period 1995-2008, when Germany had one of the lowest investment rates in the west. &quot;The crisis has meant the perception of risk has changed. &quot;Investors see that not all glitters is gold. &quot;There was a period under the euro when lots of attractive investment opportunities seemed to be in other countries. Government bonds seemed to be absolutely secure so German banks invested there. The risk perception means that German savings now don&apos;t go out of Germany.&quot; Finally, there&apos;s China, where year after year of 9-10% growth has sucked in exports from Germany. In part this has been demand for German cars from a rapidly expanding middle class in Shanghai and Beijing, with Audi now expecting to sell more cars in China this year than it does at home. But it is also the result of Germany&apos;s global dominance in investment goods, the products countries need when building up a manufacturing capacity. Britain talks about breaking into the Chinese market: Germany has done so. Are there lessons in this for Britain? Yes, says Martin Zeil, deputy prime minister of Bavaria. &quot;All the countries that have kept the nucleus of their industry are more successful.&quot; Bavaria has invested carefully in the region&apos;s science and technology base, identifying future growth sectors such as green technology and life sciences and building up clusters of excellence that act as a magnet for investment. It takes more than a clutch of world class companies to provide a solid industrial base. And yes too says Mayer at Deutsche Bank, who spent eight years in London watching the boom-bust come to grief. &quot;You have to realise that Gordon Brown was wrong when he praised economic stability and high growth as the result of his policies. It was an illusion. &quot;A large part of the world was living on the drug of credit. The UK economy is so reliant on housing. It has a high social value. Everybody is obsessed with it. In Germany almost everybody rents. &quot;Britain was on a 10-year high and now it is doing cold turkey. You have to wean the economy off credit and rebalance towards production and traded goods. But it takes years and years and years. In Britain there is a tendency to take the easy way out, to just go for another gin and tonic.&quot;", "tags": ["Germany", "Europe", "World news", "Economics", "Global economy", "Business", "Automotive industry"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-14T22:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/15/japan-nuclear-emergency-panic-buying", "sentences": ["Air China cancelled flights to Tokyo from Beijing and Shanghai."], "title": "Japan's nuclear emergency prompts panic buying in Tokyo", "article": "News of a serious radiation leak at the Fukushima nuclear plant has sparked panic buying in Tokyo, as some residents started to leave the capital to escape potential contamination. Several embassies advised their citizens to leave affected areas, including Tokyo, and some multinational companies either told staff to leave or were considering relocating outside the city. As officials urged people living near the stricken plant to stay indoors, residents in the capital, 150 miles to the south, began preparing for the possibility of a similar lockdown. Experts were keen to stress, however, that only &quot;minute&quot; levels of radiation had been detected in Tokyo. Weather forecasters said winds near the atomic plant, which experienced a third explosion on Tuesday morning, were blowing in a south-westerly direction \u2013 towards Tokyo \u2013 but would move in a westerly direction later in the day. People in the capital, home to 12 million, snapped up radios, torches, candles, fuel containers and sleeping bags, while for the fourth day there was a run on bread, canned goods, instant noodles, bottled water and other foodstuffs at supermarkets. Retailers said the panic buying was reminiscent of the oil crisis in the 1970s. The electronics firm Panasonic said it was increasing production of batteries, which were being bought in large quantities as far away as Hiroshima in the south-west. Fears are rising that if the hoarding frenzy continues it will affect the ability to deliver emergency supplies to the disaster zone. &quot;The situation is hysterical,&quot; said Tomonao Matsuo, a spokesman for the instant noodle maker Nissin Foods. &quot;People feel safer just by buying Cup Noodles.&quot; Foreign journalists covering the nuclear crisis, including reporters from the BBC and CNN, withdrew from the Fukushima area. On Monday, the German magazine Der Spiegel said its veteran war correspondent was being pulled out of Tokyo. Tourists cut short holidays and descended on international airports in Tokyo and Osaka, seeking flights home. They included about 200 South Koreans who have now arrived back in Seoul. Liezel Strauss, a South African, said on Twitter on Tuesday morning: &quot;I just woke up to several calls &amp; emails, family &amp; husband freaking out, it&apos;s time to go, flight booked to singapore this pm.&quot; She added: &quot;Realised no use staying stressing + freaking my family out if i&apos;m not helping and physically contributing, I want to but reality is I&apos;m not.&quot; The number of people stranded at Narita airport, near Tokyo, rose after airlines cancelled flights but officials said there had been no surge in passenger numbers. Air China cancelled flights to Tokyo from Beijing and Shanghai. Other airlines in the region said they were monitoring the situation but had no immediate plans to cancel services. South Korea has urged its nationals in Japan to stay away from the quake zone while Germany advised its citizens to consider leaving the country. The French embassy warned that a radioactive wind could reach Tokyo on Tuesday evening and advised its citizens to leave. Britain&apos;s Foreign Office advised against all non-essential travel to Tokyo and north-eastern Japan. &quot;Our advice is people should take their lead from the Japanese authorities,&quot; the Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne told Sky News. The US state department urged its citizens to avoid tourism and non-essential travel to Japan. &quot;[Our] travel advice is not to go to that part of Japan in any case unless you have an extremely compelling reason for doing so,&quot; it said. Japan&apos;s government has ordered people within 12 miles of the Fukushima No 1 plant, about 150 miles north-east of Tokyo, to evacuate. Those living between 12 and 19 miles from the plant were told to stay indoors due to fears of exposure to radiation. In Saitama, a prefecture north of Tokyo where safe but higher radiation levels have been detected, residents struggled to secure food. Yoshiyuki Sakuma was one of many who could not find a single bag of rice. &quot;I couldn&apos;t find any anywhere,&quot; he said, adding he was now searching for bread. &quot;If you lose electricity, water and gas, at least you can still eat bread.&quot;", "tags": ["Japan", "Japan disaster", "Nuclear power", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Energy", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Fukushima"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-15T08:52:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/15/radiation-tokyo-flights-cancelled", "sentences": ["Lufthansa became the first European airline to announce its daily flights to Tokyo would switch to Osaka and Nagoya at least until the weekend, and Air China cancelled flights from Beijing and Shanghai."], "title": "Radiation fears prompt Tokyo exodus", "article": "Airlines from Asia and Europe have halted flights into Tokyo, while multinational firms made plans to relocate employees as anxiety continued to grip Japan over the nuclear crisis. Despite official reassurances that radiation levels in the capital posed no threat to health, a steady stream of tourists, residents and expatriates left the capital by plane and bullet train. Austria said it was moving its embassy out of Tokyo to the western city of Osaka. Setbacks in the struggle to avert disaster at an atomic power plant in the north-east of the country also sparked a fresh round of panic-buying in the Japanese capital, where tiny amounts of radioactivity registered for the first time since last Friday&apos;s earthquake and subsequent tsunami. People in Tokyo endured another day of anxiety as they heard that the plant had been rocked by two more explosions and evidence emerged that water in a pool storing spent fuel rods may be boiling. Tokyo is already experiencing serious disruption to its transport network after Tepco, the city&apos;s electricity supplier, decided to implement rolling power cuts triggered by disruption to power generation by the disaster. &quot;I&apos;m not that worried about another earthquake \u2013 it&apos;s the radiation that scares me,&quot; said Masashi Yoshida, who was waiting for a flight out of Haneda airport with his five-year-old daughter. Those among Tokyo&apos;s 12 million people who decided to stay snapped up batteries, torches, candles and sleeping bags, and stripped shelves of bread, bottled water, instant noodles and canned food. The hoarding, partly prompted by the prospect of regular power cuts over the next six weeks, threatens to hamper efforts to divert supplies to the quake zone, where millions are suffering food and water shortages. Scientists said radiation levels near the Fukushima No 1 nuclear plant, where more than 200,000 people have been evacuated or told to stay inside, posed no immediate threat to the capital, which is 150 miles to the south. Naoto Kan, the prime minister, urged 140,000 people living within 19 miles of the plant to remain indoors. About 70,000 people living within 12 miles have already been evacuated. &quot;I know that people are very worried, but I would like to ask you to stay calm,&quot; Kan said. &quot;Radioactive material will reach Tokyo but it is not harmful to humans, because it will be dissipated by the time it gets there,&quot; said Koji Yamazaki, a professor of environmental science at Hokkaido University on Japan&apos;s main north island. Prolonged fears of a serious accident could weaken Tokyo&apos;s role as an international financial hub. Several firms said they were pulling staff out, including 350 Indian employees of the software services exporter Infosys Systems. But big financial firms in Japan were going about their &quot;business as usual&quot;, said the International Bankers Association, which represents firms such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. The French embassy advised its citizens to leave and the German embassy advised people with families to do the same. China is poised to evacuate its nationals from badly affected areas of north-east Japan. Several international airlines said they would avoid Tokyo until they were certain the danger had passed. Lufthansa became the first European airline to announce its daily flights to Tokyo would switch to Osaka and Nagoya at least until the weekend, and Air China cancelled flights from Beijing and Shanghai. Taiwan&apos;s EVA Airways said it would not fly to Tokyo and Sapporo for the rest of the month. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic said services to Narita and Haneda, Tokyo&apos;s main airports, were not affected. Causes of concern The Fukushima engineers&apos; main priorities now are to cool the three overheating reactors by pumping seawater into them and to ensure that water levels in the storage pools do not fall low enough to expose the spent fuel rods. In the best-case scenario, the storage pools do not overheat and engineers manage to pump cold seawater into the damaged reactors over the coming days and gradually bring them down to a safe temperature, when they can be put into cold storage. In a more worrying scenario, cooling at any or all of the reactors fails to prevent the nuclear cores from going into a meltdown. At very high temperatures, the core could melt through the containment system and cause an explosion inside the building. If that explosion damaged the outer containment structure, which is made of steel-lined reinforced concrete, radiation from the reactor could escape into the environment. In this scenario, one option would be to seal the whole reactor with lead and concrete. Another scenario causing concern involves the storage pools, because they do not have containment systems to stop radiation leaking from them. Because the cooling systems have failed, the storage pools have started to heat up. If they boil dry, the fuel rods will be exposed and could potentially release vast amounts of radiation directly into the environment.

Ostling, who was due to perform at Leeds University, was subjected to eight hours of questioning before being told she was taking work away from UK musicians and sent home. Her case was highlighted in a recent House of Lords debate as evidence of the difficulties routinely faced by visiting artists and performers since the introduction in 2008 of the tier five &quot;creative and sporting&quot; category of the points-based immigration system. The home secretary, Theresa May, is to announce this week the final details of curbs on overseas student visas to meet the Conservatives&apos; election pledge to reduce net migration to below 100,000 a year. The demands for her to overhaul the system of artist and cultural visas follow complaints from leading arts figures, including Lady Bakewell, that such cases are no longer isolated incidents but the &quot;daily nightmares&quot; of concert planners and theatre managers across Britain. A survey by the Greater London authority showed that a quarter of all artists who were hired in 2010 to open an exhibition, take part in festivals or play a concert in London were visiting from outside the European Union, and nearly all on temporary tier five short-visit visas. The GLA survey found that arts organisations faced increased bureaucracy and costs and have had to cancel events at short notice because artists have not been granted visas. Of arts organisations surveyed, 42% said they would work with fewer non-EU artists as a result of the changed immigration regime. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, said unnecessary bureaucratic burdens should not be put in the way of artists and performers. &quot;With competition from cities like Berlin, Shanghai or Mumbai, we must not jeopardise London&apos;s position as a world creative hub,&quot; he said. More than 6,700 artists applied under tier five to visit Britain last year. Lord Clancarty, who initiated the Lords debate, said that to come for a few days or a few weeks, artists and performers had to prove they had \u00a3800 in a bank account, apply in person, supply biometric details, pay an individual fee and have a sponsor who was also willing to pay a \u00a3400 fee. &quot;The application process is lengthy and tortuous and is often not completed in time. Many applicants can be refused for no obvious reason. &quot;A growing number of those within the arts and cultural sector believe that there needs to be an &apos;artists&apos; visitor&apos; route for temporary visits by artists separate from the points system, which would also allow artists&apos; fees to be paid. &quot;I do not believe attempts to tinker with or refine tier five is a solution. Artists visiting Britain on a temporary basis is not an immigration issue but about cultural exchange \u2013 and it is our worldwide reputation for this which is already being damaged.&quot; He said Ostling, of Chicago-based string quartet Carpe Diem, was &quot;bullied and rudely questioned for eight hours&quot; before being sent back to the US. She was told that she was taking work from British musicians even though the three recitals she was to take part in were unpaid. Among other examples he cited were: \u2022 A Manchester exhibition, Contemporary Art Iraq, which none of five invited Iraqi artists or academics were able to attend because they could not supply bank account statements \u2022 Russian pianist Grigory Sokolov, who cancelled his sole UK concert in 2009 because he refused to give fingerprints and eye scans every time he needs a visa to perform in Britain \u2022 Chinese artist Huang Xu, who was refused a visa to attend the opening of his exhibition at a London gallery \u2022 Cannes-prize winning Iranian film director Abbas Kiarostami, who applied for a visa to take up an invitation to direct Cosi Fan Tutte at the English National Opera. After being fingerprinted twice, he gave up in disgust and vowed never to visit Britain again \u2022 Russian ballerina Polina Semionova, who was nearly unable to perform as guest ballerina at the English National Ballet&apos;s 60th anniversary celebrations at the Royal Albert Hall last June because her visa was not processed in time. The National Campaign for the Arts also cites cases of Malian musicians who were asked to travel thousands of miles to Dakar, Senegal, to apply for UK visas and then had to wait 10 days while their applications were sent for processing in Banjul, Gambia. Others who have been refused entry include Daara J Family, a Senegalese hip-hop outfit, who are BBC Radio 3 world music award winners, a Javanese artist and teacher, a Brazilian theatre company, South Africa&apos;s &quot;edgiest theatre director&quot; and a Palestinian poet. Bakewell said more than half the leading theatres, orchestras and art galleries considered hosting artists from outside the EU as essential to their businesses. &quot;These problems are not occasional, but the daily nightmares of concert planners and managers across the country. It does not have to be so but, in fact, it is threatening to get worse,&quot; she told the Lords. Jeremy Oppenheim, UK Border Agency&apos;s national lead for temporary migration, said: &quot;We are committed to attracting the best talents to the UK and this means continuing to be open and attractive to artists, but not at the expense of tackling abuse of the visa system. &quot;Last year we received over 40,000 tier five applications and issued visas in more than 90% of cases. &quot;We regularly meet with the arts and entertainment industry and we encourage feedback from them as well as the individual applicants who use our services.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 24 March 2011.

He parties, he turns up on the front page of the News of the World, he loses sponsorship, he rails against the &quot;unfair&quot; advances wrought by technology, he loses his form, he finds it again, he wins five world championship gold medals, he loses his form again, he turns in the worst performances of his career and, finally, he is apparently re-born as the untouchable athlete he was before all of the above took place. Welcome to the last two and a half years in the life of Michael Phelps, which have been about as predictable as they have been dull; which is to say, not in the slightest. At least the story has, to this point at least, taken an upturn. Two weeks ago, 25-year-old Phelps looked back to his best - or at least somewhere approaching it - when he won five gold medals at the Indianapolis Grand Prix meeting, the most significant of which came in the 200m individual medley against his team-mate and rival Ryan Lochte, who had supplanted him in 2010 as the world&apos;s most dominant swimmer. &quot;It feels good to be able to race again and race at good speed,&quot; Phelps said after setting the world&apos;s best time of the year in what is seen as a barometer event. Lochte, who holds the world record in the 200 individual medley, was gracious in defeat. &quot;He&apos;s back, there&apos;s no doubt about it,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s ever not there, no matter what he says. I feel like he can step up and race any time.&quot; Really? That wasn&apos;t the prevailing view in January, when Phelps, by his own judgment, swam appallingly, falling into the &quot;B&quot; finals in a couple of events and losing to Lochte in the 200 medley. After Phelps&apos; relatively unproductive 2010 season, people were beginning to wonder again about his dedication to the craft and appetite for competition. It has been a recurring theme since August 2008 Such doubts first surfaced in the aftermath of Beijing when Phelps, at the peak of his fame, was photographed at a student party in Richland, South Carolina, smoking from a &quot;bong&quot;. He subsequently apologised for his behaviour, without detailing what his behavior actually was, and then settled back into the life of relative anonymity. In the hierarchy of American sporting obsessions swimming barely climbs on to the bottom rung, especially in non-Olympics years. Even an athlete of Phelps&apos; talent and success has difficulty breaking through this cloud of indifference. When he has appeared in the public eye, it has usually been for the &quot;wrong&quot; reasons - he might occasionally pop up in one of the supermarket tabloids photographed in the company of a new girlfriend. In August 2009, a few days after winning five gold medals at the world championships in Rome (and threatening to withdraw in protest over &quot;unfair&quot; swimming suits worn by some of rivals) he was involved in a minor car crash in his home town of Baltimore. In the life of a wealthy, successful, 25-year-old athlete such (minor) scrapes might be expected - by comparison with, say, the average NFL star, Phelps is a saint - but they paint a picture that is at variance with the life dedicated Olympians are expected to lead. And when Phelps performs badly in the pool, as he did at Austin in January, people begin to wonder. After Indianapolis, they are wondering a little less. &quot;It was a joke,&apos;&apos; Phelps said of his performance in Texas. &quot;I literally didn&apos;t feel like I got one good thing out of that besides swimming slow and realising that I was out of shape.&quot; He spent the three weeks training in Colorado Springs, where he worked on some &quot;technical issues&quot; - to good effect, clearly. &quot;A team-mate told me &apos;you&apos;re actually enjoying yourself, and you can see it. You&apos;re happy, you&apos;re swimming well, and you&apos;re having a good time&apos;, &quot; Phelps said in Indianapolis. &quot;That&apos;s a part of it that&apos;s changed since Austin.&quot; Phelps&apos; next appearance in the pool will be in May, when he is scheduled to compete in the Charlotte UltraSwim meeting, and after that will turn his attention to the July&apos;s world championships in Shanghai. &quot;There are a lot of new people out there,&apos;&apos; he said of his return to China. &quot;A lot of the Europeans are swimming really well, Ryan is swimming really well. It&apos;s going to be fun this summer to head over to Shanghai and be able to swim with some new faces.&quot; As for his plans for the 2012 Olympics, he and his long-time coach Bob Bowman have given little away, beyond saying he would not compete in the gruelling 400m individual medley. Phelps has mused publicly about competing in the shorter, sprint race but Bowman is having none of it. In all likelihood he will compete in seven events in London &quot;There are still a lot of goals I have and things I want to achieve before I retire from the sport,&quot; he said in Indianapolis, declining to explain what those goals are. &quot;Everybody wants to know that, but no one will know. Bob has them, and I have them, and we&apos;ll work together and try to reach them.&quot;", "tags": ["Michael Phelps", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-21T14:55:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/21/john-higgins-snooker-world-title", "sentences": ["O&apos;Sullivan withdrew from the Shanghai Masters in the early season when he was defending champion, chose not to compete in 10 of the 12 events comprising the Players Tour Championship series and scratched from the German Masters the day after he made six centuries in eight frames in an exhibition of which he was a co-promoter in Blackburn."], "title": "John Higgins draws Stephen Lee for starters in world championship", "article": "John Higgins has won four titles and lost only two matches since his return from suspension in November and has an outstanding chance of winning his fourth world title at the Crucible theatre next month.

Since then he has prospered, with business interests in food, clothing and property. A model for the Chinese community, he is in the process of buying part of the port at Le Havre in Normandy. Wang, 45, has plans for his company, Eurasia, to renovate dock warehouses covering 15 hectares and turn them into an import-export centre trading between France and China, a scheme on a par with the huge logistics platform that will soon be opening at Piraeus in Greece. As he likes France, he wants to invest here, Wang says. He takes great care when he speaks French, holding back his naturally quick tongue, and says he reads Le Monde and Le Figaro, unlike most of his compatriots, who prefer Chinese papers. He signed a preliminary purchase agreement in Le Havre last December and plans to invest $31m in the project. Work should start in September. The scheme is part of a pattern unfolding worldwide. &quot;The Chinese want to do the distribution and marketing themselves,&quot; says Herv\u00e9 Corn\u00e8de, the sales manager at the port. The rundown warehouses Wang is taking over are ideally placed. With a wharf on one side, they are close to a motorway junction and will be soon be accessible to rail freight. The plan is to import cheap Chinese products and export French luxury goods: &quot;Wine, perfume, haute couture, leather goods and so on.&quot; Wang has been working on the project for two years and there are drawings all over the big table in his gloomy Paris office. He is proud to be here, conscious that for many Chinese immigrants in France he is an inspiration, particularly for people from his home town of Wenzhou, 400km south of Shanghai. Many of them run small businesses, typically Chinese restaurants recently converted to sushi bars, bars or wholesale clothing stores. That is how Wang started, just one of countless hardworking folk who landed here in the 1970s, often undocumented, following in the footsteps of the Vietnamese boat people. He, too, laboured day and night with his family to pay off the loans obtained from his fellows with only his good name as collateral. He, too, was determined to make good. The progress of the Wang family was typical. Wang senior arrived first in 1973 and started work repairing furniture in Paris, his son explains. His mother and brother followed in 1976. &quot;I was the last to arrive, in 1978,&quot; he adds. He was 13 at the time. After two years&apos; apprenticeship he joined the rest of the family working in a restaurant managed by his father in Cr\u00e9teil, outside Paris. In the 1980s, the family gave up the restaurant and switched to running a food shop. Then they moved north, to Lille, investing in the garment industry, in which they achieved spectacular growth. They started importing goods and by the mid-1990s were supplying leading chains such as Kiabi, Auchan, Pimkie and Foir&apos;Fouille. Having moved back to the Paris area and established a position as one of the biggest wholesalers in Aubervilliers, the Wangs started acquiring commercial premises. They would buy or rent properties, then divide them up and sublet them to smaller wholesalers, mostly Chinese. A handful of Chinese immigrants adopted more or less the same business model, particularly around Aubervilliers, which is one of the biggest trading centres for Chinese goods in Europe. However, Wang&apos;s business is now large enough \u2013 turning over $22m in 2010 \u2013 for him to operate outside these traditional networks. Many think that his success is partly due to his love of France and an openness unusual in a businessman with his background. The Wang style also contributes to his success with the Chinese community in France. &quot;He has all the characteristics of a Chinese but he is not like the others,&quot; says an enthusiastic Tamara Lui, a writer based in Paris working for the Sing Tao [Hong Kong] daily. &quot;In a way we are all looking for the Wang in ourselves,&quot; she adds, referring to the anxiety of many Franco-Chinese, torn between their longing for success and integration and their reluctance to lose their original culture, particularly their language. However, many of his competitors are not so happy about his attitude. Although he devotes time to many Chinese organisations, as is generally expected of a man in his position, he has never accepted any form of public responsibility. &quot;No time,&quot; he says. But in the eyes of the Chinese community a man should never forget that success is also achieved through collective solidarity. For example, Wang is not a favourite with the network surrounding the former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, which exerts a certain influence on Franco-Chinese relations. &quot;He is a Frenchified Chinese,&quot; says Alain Destrem, the conservative MP for the 15th arrondissement of Paris and head of the Club Europe-Chine Co-op\u00e9ration (ECC). &quot;He has lost his community spirit.&quot; It turns out that the ECC supports one of Wang&apos;s long-standing rivals, Wu Zhong, a businessman with a very similar career, who has been in France since 1994. Zhong is 42, almost the same age, and boasts the same initial backer, Li Yuping, a Chinese tycoon who still owns a symbolic share in Wang&apos;s company. Zhong&apos;s French is a little hesitant and his overall approach is more conventional, which is apparently more to Destrem&apos;s liking. According to Ling Lenzi, 42, one of Wang&apos;s closest business acquaintances, his distrust of the Wenzhouese community may be his only serious shortcoming. Even now he still manages his little empire with a workforce of fewer than 20 people, and he alone stands as guarantee for all his acquisitions.

But even as George Osborne was setting out a package of measures intended to ensure that &quot;Britain is open for business&quot;, the focus was turning to the banking sector \u2013 which will be excluded from the full extent of the corporation tax cut as a result of an unexpected rise in the bank levy \u2013 and major oil companies, which were slapped with an unexpected fuel tax. &quot;A good budget for business \u2026 unless you&apos;re a bank or an oil company,&quot; said Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at Deloitte. The chancellor said a two-percentage-point cut in corporation tax in April \u2013 rather than the 1% previously announced \u2013 would be offset by a small rise in the bank levy to 0.078% from 0.075% to &quot;ensure this not a net tax cut for banks&quot;. Osborne said he was making the change, under which corporation tax will fall from 28% to 23% in four years, because he wanted Britain &quot;to be the place international businesses go to&quot;, and to give the UK the lowest corporation tax in the G7. Barely a month after the banks signed up to the Project Merlin pact with the government, which had promised a stable tax regime, analysts were calculating the impact on banks from the higher bank levy and the cut to corporation tax, which reduce the value of deferred tax assets accumulated by many banks during the financial crisis. These deferred tax assets were created when the banks made huge losses in the 2007/8 crash and will reduce their corporation tax bills until they have been eaten through. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: &quot;As a quick thought, it will be net neutral for the sector, but banks like Lloyds might be slightly better off and HSBC slightly worse.&quot; Lloyds makes most of its profit in the UK and has a smaller bank levy than HSBC, which pays around \u00a3370m because of its large balance sheet but makes less of its profits in the UK. Even so, Michael Wistow, head of tax at Berwin Leighton Paisner, said: &quot;The City will be disappointed that banks have been singled out for higher taxes at a time when the other industries are benefiting from reductions in their tax rates.&quot; The exchequer will receive an extra \u00a3630m from the \u00a32.5bn-a-year bank levy in 2011-12 and a further \u00a3590m by 2015-16. The cuts to corporation tax will cost \u00a33.1bn by 2015-16. Campaigners for more taxes on banks saw the budget as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot;. Max Lawson, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: &quot;George Osborne&apos;s announcement that he will take from the banks with one hand while giving back with the other means they are still not paying their fair share.&quot; Banks warned they were being placed at an unfair disadvantage internationally because the levy hits their entire balance sheet. HSBC has admitted it will review this year whether to move its HQ from the UK because of the tax regime \u2013 although tax experts noted that a pledge by Osborne to reconsider the 50p tax rate for higher earners should benefit bankers. Angela Knight of the British Bankers Association said: &quot;Without satisfactory double taxation arrangements in place, this is putting banks operating in the UK at a long-term disadvantage, both internationally, as they compete against banks not paying such a levy, and domestically, as they compete with other sectors of the financial services industry&quot;. However, the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, was careful to conclude that the &quot;changes in City taxes will not harm the City&apos;s competitiveness&quot;. The government will be hoping that the cuts to corporation tax \u2013 and a pledge to make the UK&apos;s tax regime not just competitive within the G7 but also within the wider G20 \u2013 will stop companies leaving the UK and encourage others that have already left to return. The immediate statement from United Business Media&apos;s finance director, Robert Gray, that the group was &quot;actively considering&quot; whether to return the UK for tax purposes was a relief to the chancellor. UBM, which makes 95% of its profits outside the UK, is particularly interested in the changes to the so-called controlled foreign companies regime, which is changing the way companies are taxed on profits they make overseas. These changes will reduce tax to the exchequer by \u00a32.3bn by 2015/16. A number of measures were focused on start-ups and smaller businesses, with the CBI predicting that a &quot;new wave of finance&quot; could be unleashed through the Enterprise Investment Scheme. &quot;Doubling the lifetime limit on entrepreneurs&apos; relief within capital gains tax will encourage them to keep on innovating and growing their businesses, as well as providing much-needed investment for start-ups,&quot; said John Cridland, director general of the CBI. Cool on Britannia George Osborne&apos;s rallying cry to entrepreneurs from Stuttgart to S\u00e3o Paulo and from Shanghai to Seattle that Britain is open for business was being ignored within hours \u2014 at least in Stuttgart and S\u00e3o Paulo. Roberto Troster, a financial consultant in S\u00e3o Paulo, said the biggest drawback was that Britain was not in the euro, rather than the soon-to-be-cut corporation tax rate. &quot;I don&apos;t think taxation is the problem, especially nowadays when you can move profits wherever you want,&quot; said Troster, a former chief economist for Brazil&apos;s banking federation, Febraban, who now advises Brazilian companies seeking to operate abroad. Steffen Schoch, managing director of a regional trade body in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, whose capital is Stuttgart, said: &quot;It remains to be seen how Germany will respond with a rate of 29.4%. The decision [to cut corporation tax] will please companies that already have a presence in the UK and will help those considering entering the UK market. But it remains to be seen whether it will lead to more firms setting up business in Britain.&quot; Hans B\u00fchler, who heads German packaging company Optima, based in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall in south-west Germany, which has an office in the UK and is considering setting up a factory there, said: &quot;Taxes should never be the decisive factor when it comes to deciding where a business should be based.&quot;", "tags": ["Budget 2011", "Budget", "UK news", "Media business", "Tax and spending", "Politics", "Banking", "Business", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-23T21:41:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/25/martin-scorsese-cornish-film-festival", "sentences": ["Trains and clouds of steam were obviously essential ingredients, and he considered both Shanghai Express (1932), with the luminous Marlene Dietrich and Anna May Wong, or Hitchcock&apos;s thriller The Lady Vanishes (1938)."], "title": "Martin Scorsese to curate Port Eliot film festival", "article": "Even legendary Hollywood director Martin Scorsese has never had a set like this to play with \u2013 a giant screen by a river under the stars, with a backdrop of trains rumbling across a towering viaduct designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Scorsese, who is curating The Director&apos;s Cut, a unique four-night film season at the Port Eliot Festival in Cornwall this June, clearly agonised over an opening film that would live up to the grandeur of the setting in 4,000 acres of Humphry Repton-designed parkland. Trains and clouds of steam were obviously essential ingredients, and he considered both Shanghai Express (1932), with the luminous Marlene Dietrich and Anna May Wong, or Hitchcock&apos;s thriller The Lady Vanishes (1938). His final choice may surprise devotees of Raging Bull or Gangs of New York: his opener is Murder on the Orient Express (1974), the version directed by one of his heroes, Sidney Lumet, starring Albert Finney as Agatha Christie&apos;s cranky Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, which he regards as a classic. He has paired it with Hitchcock&apos;s North by Northwest (1959), which ends with one of the deathless cinema metaphors when Cary Grant, having battled the baddies on the face of Mount Rushmore, pulls his new wife to him on a train, and the scene cuts to the train itself speeding into a tunnel. It was a considerable coup for one of the summer&apos;s most eclectic festivals to persuade Scorsese to take a break from editing his first 3D film, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, filmed at Shepperton and starring Jude Law and Sir Ben Kingsley, to programme four themed double bills. Port Eliot, at St Germans, began as a small books event in 2003 and now includes music, food, fashion, art, a flower show and comedy. This year will also include John Cooper Clarke presenting a masterclass on writing limericks. All Scorsese&apos;s film choices are vintage. He is a passionate film historian and has worked with the British Film Institute (BFI) to secure the prints for his season. Heather Stewart, creative director of the BFI, said his season matches its mission of getting archive film out to new and broad audiences. She said: &quot;The interaction of these forms and the mix in such an inspiring setting will be a great experience for the festivalgoers and artists alike.&quot; On successive nights Scorsese has chosen films which appear on many lists of the greatest of all time, including Luchino Visconti&apos;s The Leopard (1963), matched with Jean Renoir&apos;s The River (1951) for his literary adaptations night. Michael Powell&apos;s ravishing ballet movie, The Red Shoes (1948), starring the glorious Moira Shearer, which is apparently his favourite film, is matched with All About Eve (1950) for his musical theme. He has not chosen any of his own films, but that gap will be filled by discussions of his work chaired by the film writer Tom Shone. &quot;Getting Scorsese to do something for this tiny corner of Cornwall is truly fantastic,&quot; Cathy St Germans, co-founder of the festival, said. &quot;We did it the way we got Sarah Waters to come here and many others \u2013 we wrote him a nice proper letter, and he said yes.&quot; Scorsese has yet to visit the beautiful estate and the house which claims to be the oldest continuously inhabited in the country, the home for centuries of the St Germans family, but will be pleased to discover he can come by train. When a 19th century earl allowed the railway to cross his lands, the payback was one of the prettiest railway stations in the country, right at his gate, and unlike many quaint vintage stations, still in daily use. &quot;He hasn&apos;t said he&apos;s not coming, so we very much hope he will \u2013 if he does we know he will just fall in love with the place as everyone does.&quot; The contact with Scorsese came through his long-term colleague, the British costume designer Sandy Powell, who was nominated for an Oscar for her astounding costumes for Gangs of New York, and won one for The Aviator. She came first to the festival as a visitor, and returned last year as a performer, presenting a show-and-tell session which included her Oscar statuette \u2013 at the special request of Lord St Germans. The festival organisers are working hard to create an environment which lives up to Scorsese&apos;s vision: the Paradiso will have a cocktail bar in an Airstream campervan, some seats in cardboard Cadillacs designed by the Ballet Rambert designer Michael Howells, and will also be serving hot chocolate and providing blankets and umbrellas just in case. &quot;The idea of a cinema by the river came last year when I was lying on the grass one night at last year&apos;s festival. It felt like the first time I&apos;d lain down in days \u2013 and I thought what I&apos;d really like now is to watch a lovely movie, right here, without having to move,&quot; Cathy St Germans said.

Global warming may be high on the international agenda, but global capitalism still takes nuclear power and fossil fuels for granted. One draft of an answer lies buried in the crumbling, saffron pages of the Observer&apos;s back numbers from the 1940s, 50s and 60s. As 2011 unfolds, their author, the economist EF Schumacher, looks set for rediscovery as a man with a plan whose hour has come. Here, for instance, is Schumacher on &quot;the so-called peaceful use of atomic energy&quot; \u2013 &quot;There could be no clearer example of the prevailing dictatorship of economics\u2026 That nuclear fission represents an incredible, incomparable, and unique hazard for human life does not enter any calculation and is never mentioned.&quot; To submit to the nuclear lobby, he continues, &quot;is a transgression against life itself, a transgression infinitely more serious than any crime ever perpetrated by man. The idea that a civilisation could sustain itself on the basis of such a trangression is an ethical, spiritual, and metaphysical monstrosity.&quot; These brave, burning words could have been written last night. But who, exactly, was EF Schumacher? To his family, he was &quot;Pop&quot;. To friends he was &quot;Fritz&quot; and, occasionally, &quot;James&quot;. To David Astor, editor of the Observer, he was &quot;Professor&quot;. When he died in 1977, EF Schumacher was not only a secular guru to countless admirers, but also the author of Small Is Beautiful, a global bestseller subtitled &quot;a study of economics as if people mattered&quot;. Schumacher expressed the ideas of Small Is Beautiful in pithy soundbites: &quot;Technology must be the servant of man, not its master&quot;; &quot;there is more to life than GDP&quot;; &quot;the world cannot rely on diminishing supplies of non-renewables&quot;; and, most famous of all, his belief in &quot;lots and lots of small autonomous units&quot;. For a moment, in the 1970s, these caught the wind of the zeitgeist. &quot;To very few people&quot;, declared the Times, &quot;is it given to begin to change the direction of human thought. Dr Schumacher belongs to this intensely creative minority.&quot; Long before our current crisis, Schumacher and his ideas were attracting attention here in the UK. Several of the better themes of David Cameron&apos;s widely disputed &quot;big society&quot; are indistinguishable in their ambition from parts of Small is Beautiful. The prime minister, indeed, has long been interested in Schumacher&apos;s ideas. Almost immediately after becoming leader of the Conservative party, Cameron addressed the Soil Association, engaging with key aspects of the Small Is Beautiful message. Schumacher always said that his arm would wither if he voted Conservative, but he turns out to be a natural godfather for the coalition. A very English German, and lifelong anti-Nazi, Schumacher once wrote &quot;Be prepared to joke at every pain&quot;. Much of his life was devoted to reconciling the planet to intractable global issues through the application of a dissenting intelligence, good humour and lateral thought. &quot;We always need both freedom and order,&quot; he once wrote, a sentiment dear to English hearts and minds. Ernst Friedrich (Fritz) Schumacher was born on 16 August 1911, the son of a distinguished academic and professional family from Berlin. His sister Edith, who later married the atomic physicist Werner Heisenberg, said of her brother&apos;s uncanny perceptiveness, &quot;He is like another Beethoven&quot;. On top of his innate gifts there was the legacy of strange and violent times in Germany. Schumacher&apos;s childhood was blighted by the first world war and the German economic collapse of 1923. Schumacher left school and university on a lifelong quest for answers to the puzzles of existence. Although his education had given him &quot;maps of life and knowledge &quot;, he wrote, nothing he had been taught seemed to have any relevance or &quot;importance to the conduct of my life&quot;. Already he was anticipating an engagement with the challenges of the 20th century. &quot;I have a restless longing in me that cannot be fulfilled,&quot; he wrote to his sister. &quot;Hopefully, in the future, but not yet.&quot; Perhaps the present was too troubled. After winning a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford, making the friendships that would shape his career, and visiting the US, Schumacher returned to Berlin. Always a German patriot, like many young men of his generation, he had to navigate the rise of Hitler and National Socialism until the inner conflict became intolerable. In 1936 he married Anna Maria (&quot;Muschi&quot;) Petersen, and moved to England. Muschi was a loyal, long-suffering wife whose good nature perfectly complemented Schumacher&apos;s more cerebral serenity. &quot;When you&apos;re with Muschi,&quot; said David Astor, &quot;it&apos;s like warming your hands at the fire.&quot; She devoted herself to raising four children while her young husband embarked on his quest for answers. Schumacher&apos;s move to England had provoked bitter family rows. In a conflict played out in countless middle-class German homes, Schumacher argued that fighting for the Fatherland meant fighting against a Germany in the grip of Nazism. By contrast, his brother-in-law, Heisenberg, chose a controversial path of co-existence that would reach a troubled conclusion in Copenhagen. Schumacher insisted that England was the only place from which to conduct this battle. To his friends, this was no surprise. As one put it, &quot;Fritz was a German, but in his way he was also an Englishman.&quot; Schumacher&apos;s belief in an English future was fulfilled, with a paradoxical twist, early in 1940. He was living comfortably with his family in Weybridge, working in the City, devoting himself to Muschi and the children, and developing &quot;the possibility of an Anglo-German friendship&quot;. When Weybridge was declared part of an Enemy Protected Area, and he had to flee, his Oxford friend David Astor came to his rescue. Astor had begun to promote a European ideal through the pages of the Observer. He was also linked to Schumacher through the &quot;Shanghai Club&quot;, which championed the leftward shift of British society during the war. A shifting constellation of the best and the brightest, its members included Barbara Ward, EH Carr, Sebastian Haffner (Raimund Pretzel), Isaac Deutscher, John Strachey and, most notably, George Orwell. Clever editors recruit where they can, and instinctively. Astor found at the Shanghai Club, a Chinese restaurant in Soho, many of the writers and journalists who would soon become associated with the Observer. Coming to the aid of a refugee like Schumacher was part of Astor&apos;s extraordinary gift for private, creative sympathy. His family had an estate in Northamptonshire, with cottages to spare. In June 1940, the Schumacher family moved to Eydon (pronounced Eden) to begin a new life on the land. For a man used to bourgeois comforts, a farm labourer&apos;s cottage, with no gas or electricity and one cold tap, was a shock. Worse was to follow. The Battle of Britain was raging; a Nazi invasion threatened. Across Britain, enemy nationals were being rounded up and interned, many of them on the Isle of Man. The official dragnet caught all sorts: German Jews, communists, Italian chefs, fervent Nazis, Oxbridge dons. The distinguished classicist Arnaldo Momigliano, faced with a choice of internment among Italians or Germans chose the former declaring that he would prefer to be a professor among a bunch of Italian waiters than an Italian waiter amongst a crowd of German professors. Schumacher was comparatively lucky. When, shortly after moving to Eydon, the policeman&apos;s knock came at the cottage door, he was taken off to join about 1,400 prisoners under canvas in a hastily built camp on Prees Heath, on the Shropshire-Wales border, where every kind of refugee was herded together under chaotic conditions. His life would never be the same again. Despite the degrading mix of misery and squalor at the camp, Schumacher remained impressively committed to his adopted country. &quot;To leave England now would break my heart,&quot; he wrote to his wife. Soon, his instinctive optimism was focusing his attention on the future and \u2013 because he was never short of self-belief \u2013 his role in it. He began to recognise that internment was giving his life purpose. &quot;I see my task more clearly than ever: Europe, a new Europe, coming from England.&quot; It was a paradoxical response to an episode that, to a lesser man, might have been alienating and oppressive. His experience of Prees Heath, which actually lasted no more than a few months in 1940, shaped Schumacher&apos;s understanding of society. On this dreary stretch of common, the cerebral statistician was forced into a rapprochement with Schumacher the humane socialist. Many colleagues would later comment on his extraordinary concern for the well-being of the individual in society and his generous, inclusive nature. Slowly, the internees began to establish discipline, routine and a measure of organisation. With such a disparate collection, it was not easy, but Schumacher&apos;s easygoing good humour was invaluable. &quot;Give me an Italian communist any day,&quot; he would joke in later life, contrasting Italians and Viennese. Elected camp leader, he set about organising Prees Heath into a hygienic and humane regime. He wrote to his wife that his modus operandi was &quot;based on kindness and persuasion... with so much misery about I am convinced it is the only method.&quot; Here, for the first time, was the mixture of simple exposition and philanthropic self-improvement that would later underpin his approach to changing society. &quot;I am learning a great deal,&quot; he told Muschi, &quot;how to deal with many different types of men. It is a hard school but a good one, and I am making some progress.&quot; Schumacher&apos;s remarkable equanimity never left him. He had no animus towards his captors. &quot;Whatever the British are doing to us now,&quot; he wrote, &quot;so long as they win I will be satisfied.&quot; Schumacher had always been a Marxist. Prees Heath, he discovered, was a microcosm of society: the oppression and exploitation of the imprisoned many by the privileged few. Schumacher had grown up part of an intellectual elite, detached from reality, and mixing through birth and intelligence with an aristocracy of Anglo-German academics and professionals. Camp changed his understanding and his perception of society for good. He would return to village life in Northamptonshire like a man released from a seminar on life itself, burning with new ideas. Throughout the war, encouraged by Astor, who supplied him with books, Schumacher devoted himself to the all-consuming question of how to make the world a safer and better place. How could real peace be won and guaranteed? What should be the shape of the postwar world? What to do about Germany? Back in Eydon, Schumacher had also to come to terms with life as an enemy alien. The villagers thought him a spy. Signs went up in the local shops \u2013 &quot;No Germans&quot; \u2013 and the Schumacher home was pelted with stones. Eventually, peace was restored, but only after a public meeting in the Eydon village hall at which Fritz and Muschi were allowed to explain themselves. Fritz the amateur German farm labourer became &quot;James&quot; the foreign eccentric who was reputed to take tea with Lord Keynes. All his life, he would revel in a maverick identity, the good German you couldn&apos;t pigeonhole. Schumacher was now writing regularly for Astor&apos;s Observer which became a perfect platform for his ideas. JL Garvin, who had edited the paper from 1908, had been forced by ill-health to step down in a hurry. Astor, aged just 29, inheriting a situation of journalistic chaos, turned to his friends. Schumacher&apos;s English prose needed a lot of subbing, but his fresh and innovative ideas added a vital ingredient to the mix. The war moved into its final phase. Schumacher began to play a pivotal role in shifting a resurgent Observer into advocating new social and economic international solutions to urgent post-war problems. Some of these would become the foundation of the postwar consensus on the mixed economy and the welfare state. Schumacher&apos;s personal journey was erratic. His ideas were in flux. As he wrote to Astor, while still on the land: &quot;My intense interest in socialism is a new departure\u2026 What my final opinion will be I don&apos;t know, but I am pretty sure that my nature does not allow me to embrace wholeheartedly as &apos;final&apos; any political creed or system, any &apos;ism&apos;, or any panacea.&quot; Never an extremist, Schumacher believed in the sovereignty of reason. His daughter Barbara recalls that, in his company, &quot;you always felt that he was very wise. If you asked him something, he would stop and think before he gave you his answer. He would always turn any discussion round and look at it in a different way, but he was always very twinkly, with a wonderful sense of humour.&quot; His second wife, Verena, remembers that &quot;he was the easiest man to live with, incredibly even-tempered, who believed that the first Christian duty was cheerfulness.&quot; Nevertheless, Schumacher made the re-entry into academe with difficulty. &quot;Give me farm labourers,&quot; he wrote, anticipating his later ideas. &quot;They will talk more intelligently than this scum of the earth called Oxford postwar Reconstruction Planners.&quot; The loathing was mutual. One of his colleagues wrote, &quot;I don&apos;t believe that man was born. I think he came out of a bottle.&quot; For his part, Schumacher later admitted that, in those days, &quot;I was a very arrogant young whippersnapper.&quot; Eventually Fritz Schumacher would morph into a snowy-haired, kindly and voluble uncle of bohemian manner. But, as the war came to an end, he was still a young man in a hurry. Schumacher&apos;s increasingly singular personal quest left its mark on his family. Barbara Schumacher, born in 1946, remembers being conscious that &quot;my home life wasn&apos;t like other people&apos;s&quot;. Her &quot;Pop&quot; had become an ardent vegetable gardener, and would get up at six to work his plot before commuting to work. Her sister, Virginia, recalls the domestic ritual of bread-making, a habit she maintains to this day. Despite memories of their father&apos;s addiction to physical domestic labour, both women recall that &quot;there was something soft about him. He had very well manicured hands, and was always beautifully turned out.&quot; Schumacher was also mixing with the elite of the postwar Labour reconstruction: Hugh Gaitskell, Michael Foot, Hugh Dalton, Jennie Lee and Stafford Cripps. Barbara says that he made no effort to disguise his origins. As a recent &quot;enemy alien&quot; he might have been expected to lie low, but that was not in his nature. He always spoke out, attracting the attention of Sir William Beveridge, who became another patron. Occasionally, Schumacher&apos;s presence in the higher reaches of government inspired bitter, anti-German attacks, but when he became a fully naturalised Briton in 1945, his place and his future seemed more secure. Even his youthful appearance was on his side. At 35, he still looked about 25 and he always disconcerted those who, on first meeting, were astonished by the contrast between his youth and experience. He believed that there was a social, even moral, dimension to the crisis of resources he observed on an official visit to the shattered ruins of postwar Germany. The doctors, engineers and lawyers of Germany had not failed as experts but as people. In one of his earliest public lectures, given in March 1948, he described man&apos;s task as twofold, first &quot;to fully develop oneself&quot; and second, &quot;to form one&apos;s relationship to other people \u2013 family, groups, one&apos;s countrymen, mankind \u2013 sensibly, ethically, or expressed quite simply, with joy.&quot; It&apos;s a fair bet that no other government economist of these years was formulating a role for &quot;joy&quot; in social policy, but Schumacher was becoming a most unusual public intellectual. Now in his late 30s, he was asking the questions about the nature of existence he had first confronted on Prees Heath. What is the purpose of one&apos;s life? Are there any useful tools available to humanity beyond scientific fact and optimism ? Once he joined the National Coal Board as economic adviser in 1950, he began to see the future more clearly. He would devote the rest of his life to environmental questions. For 20 years, the Coal Board gave him a niche from which to test these in the field of energy. &quot;I am completely submerged in COAL,&quot; he told his wife. He and Muschi had moved to Caterham. Holcombe was a big, rambling house in four acres of garden in the Surrey green belt. The growing family of four had a vegetable patch, and Schumacher devoted himself to sustainability. The relative affluence and stability of the 1950s gave Schumacher the opportunity to indulge his fascination with existential questions. In his drive better to understand the individual, he became obsessed with astrology, insisting on doing his children&apos;s horoscopes. Schumacher himself was a Leo, a king of the jungle, a leader and shaman. &quot;The mysteries of life were what interested him,&quot; Barbara remembers. &quot;He was on a lifelong quest for answers. I think he was always troubled by the German catastrophe.&quot; How was it possible that the Fatherland, the home of Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Marx, could have fallen under the spell of the Nazis? &quot;For me,&quot; says Barbara, &quot;my father&apos;s greatness lies in having the courage to question all the certainties of life.&quot; In 1955, immersed in the search for inner stillness, Schumacher took a three-month sabbatical in Burma, another turning point. Thereafter, he began to develop a Buddhist approach to economics. He had already reduced the problems of &quot;nature&apos;s larder&quot; (the earth&apos;s resources) to the single issue of energy. Now he began exploring what a &quot;Buddhist economy&quot; might mean. There should, he wrote, be a &quot;distinction between renewable and non-renewable resources. A civilisation built of renewable resources is superior to one built on oil, coal, metal etc. The New Economics would be a veritable Statute of Limitation \u2013 and that means a Statute of Liberation.&quot; After his trip to Burma, there was in Schumacher&apos;s mind the slow fusion of an energy-centred economic system with Gandhian and Buddhist ideas of non-violence. In August 1960, these ideas found expression in an Observer article entitled &quot;Non-violent economics&quot;. It was a very difficult time. Muschi was terminally ill with cancer, and her husband found it hard to muster the psychological resources to cope with her loss. Eventually, he would marry Verena, his children&apos;s au pair, embark on a second family and focus his attention on questions of &quot;Intermediate Technology&quot;, the application of technology from the developed world for daily use in the developing world, using local materials. Schumacher&apos;s interest in the needs and resources of the rural poor coincided with the Observer&apos;s now celebrated stand on African liberation. Astor and Schumacher, as editor and contributor, were now echoing each other&apos;s preoccupations about the future development of the planet. The climax of these years occurred in August 1965, when the Observer ran a milestone Schumacher article about Intermediate Technology on the front of the Review. His focus on world poverty struck a chord that resonated with readers. The paper was swamped with letters which in turn led to the foundation in 1966 of the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now &quot;Practical Action&quot;). Once he had retired from the Coal Board in 1970, Schumacher found a liberation in a new way of life, undoubtedly inspired by marriage to a woman 30 years his junior. He began to take an interest in the practical application of his theories. Peter Segger, an influential champion of the organic food movement, who has devoted his life to Schumacher&apos;s ideas and now lives in deepest Wales, remembers his mentor&apos;s visit to his farm. &quot;He was so warm, enthusiastic and generous. To a beginner like me, he was a huge inspiration. His book was seminal.&quot; Segger believes that Schumacher&apos;s biggest achievement, as an outsider, was to articulate a dissenting view of society in which &quot;you could start on whatever scale you chose&quot;. Verena concurs that her new husband was &quot;very intellectual, but not frighteningly so. He was always utterly inclusive. It was his natural inclination to explain. He never made you ill at ease, but he did like to be provocative.&quot; Increasingly, his provocations were international. As well as a punishing schedule of talks and meetings, Schumacher began to translate his lifelong struggle with the conundrum of existence into two books. The first, an unorthodox spiritual roadmap with the title A Guide for the Perplexed, was a summary of his quest for happiness. The second, initially titled &quot;The Homecomers&quot;, and finally published in 1973 as Small Is Beautiful, would become the global bestseller that dominated his last years. Small Is Beautiful was a word-of-mouth phenomenon. The book itself is an occasionally repetitive collection of essays and lectures written over many years, some of whose themes had first been tried out in the Observer. On publication, it secured few reviews, and sales were initially slow. Its readers, however, were devoted. Schumacher&apos;s ideas spread among a generation troubled by ecological &quot;survival&quot;, and in search of a new blueprint for the future. Long before global warming dominated the environmental and political agenda, Schumacher&apos;s book sales went viral, partly propelled by the oil price rise of 1974, but more probably inspired by his message. First, he argued that the &quot;natural capital&quot; of the earth&apos;s resources is irreplaceable. Global capitalism, squandering fossil fuels, threatens our civilisation. Squander &quot;the capital represented by living nature&quot; and you &quot;threaten life itself&quot;. Second, to address the challenge of how to change man&apos;s relationship with the planet, society needs to mobilise a combination of &quot;freedom and order&quot;, two apparently irreconcilable concepts. For Schumacher this meant &quot;lots of small, autonomous units&quot;, committed to &quot;the indivisibility of peace and also of ecology.&quot; Typically, Schumacher expressed his ideas in memorable phrases: &quot;good husbandry will help people to help themselves&quot;. Finally, asserting the four cardinal virtues given him by his new-found faith in Roman Catholicism, Schumacher declared that mankind&apos;s duty was both simple and disconcerting: &quot;We can, each of us,&quot; he writes, &quot;work to put our inner house in order.&quot; The guidance for this task, he concluded, should not come from the state, or from science and technology, but from humanity itself, &quot;the traditional wisdom of mankind&quot;. Schumacher enjoyed only a few years of recognition for his vision of a better, more holistic society. The non-stop schedule took its toll. In September 1977, he dropped dead on a train to Zurich. He was not yet 70. The afterlife of a cult bestseller is always interesting. There was a memorial service in Westminster Cathedral, addressed by Yehudi Menuhin, followed by a lot of talk about &quot;Schumacher centres&quot;. Different pressure groups found different messages in Small Is Beautiful. &quot;It was a bit like the early church,&quot; says one observer. &quot;Everyone thinking they have got hold of the truth, but each has got a different part.&quot; The Soil Association, of which Schumacher had been president, received a direct legacy from its mentor in the shape of royalties from Small is Beautiful. Jonathan Dimbleby, another former president, is delighted to see his predecessor back in fashion. &quot;Small Is Beautiful really does mean something now,&quot; he told the Observer last week. &quot;Schumacher has become a man for our times. I believe we must go back to Schumacher to find a future that works.&quot; Dimbleby is not alone. Long before the Arab revolutions threatened oil supplies or the Japanese tsunami wreaked its terrible nuclear aftermath, David Cameron and the coalition had begun to look at Schumacher&apos;s ideas. In 2005, Cameron addressed the Soil Association, the key pressure group for alternative agriculture on the importance of sustainable farming. Patrick Holden, director of the Sustainable Food Trust, says: &quot;Cameron gets it. Food and water will be the big electoral issues of the 21st century.&quot; Rohan Silva, senior policy adviser to the prime minister, places Schumacher in a tradition of 20th-century anti-utopian thought represented by Karl Popper and Isaiah Berlin. Speaking for himself recently in Downing Street, Silva explained the government&apos;s &quot;emphasis on breaking up large-scale institutions into smaller elements. This,&quot; he continued, &quot;is absolutely what we are seeking to prosecute.&quot; Repeating Schumacher, Silva said: &quot;Smaller elements will enable people to choose a human scale \u2013 with an emphasis on the environment and well-being. There is more to progress than narrow economics, and more to life than GDP. We will be the first government to implement a measurement of well-being.&quot; Celebrating the concept of &quot;enoughness&quot;, Silva claimed that &quot;the three pillars of the &apos;big society&apos; are all consistent with Schumacher&quot;. These pillars are, first, the decentralisation of power; second, public service reform; and third, social community reform helping people to come together to work responsibly for the common good. We have, said Silva, &quot;an urgent sense of needing to embrace enoughness&quot;. When I challenged him to reconcile some of these ideas with the all-powerful vested interests of global capitalism, Silva smoothly responded that &quot;this is one of the great challenges for this government&quot;. He quoted Cameron&apos;s desire to build &quot;a contributor society rather than a consumer economy&quot;. So is Schumacher then a household god in Downing Street? Silva seems wary of becoming the prisoner of pressure group politics. &quot;We talk about policy in practical terms,&quot; he replies carefully. &quot;We try not to talk about philosophy, but we do like to really engage with as many thinkers as possible.&quot; The spirit of Schumacher seems to be alive and well and at the centre of coalition thinking. From the window of my meeting with Silva there&apos;s a view of the No 10 garden. Will the PM follow Michelle Obama and introduce an allotment to Downing Street? Silva replies that there&apos;s not enough time in the day to go gardening, but asserts that &quot;the prime minister is most comfortable digging his garden [in Witney, his constituency] and tending to his vegetables&quot;. In Britain in 2011, the man of many names and more enthusiasms has coalesced into &quot;Schumacher&quot;, the mirror in which those who want to grapple with ideas for a new and better future can find their reflection, and perhaps derive some comfort. The coalition will probably never completely embrace him explicitly. Privately, however, some of them will sign up to his ideas. Members of the cabinet from David Willetts to Jeremy Hunt, who may possibly keep a dog-eared copy of the paperback bestseller on the bedside table, are known to sympathise with Schumacher&apos;s basic message. This can be expressed in a simple, serene sentence: &quot;Our task is to look at the world and see it whole.&quot;", "tags": ["Economic policy", "Conservatives", "Labour", "David Cameron", "Economics", "Social sciences", "Social history", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-27T00:01:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/28/david-tang-icorrect-interview", "sentences": ["To be fair to Tang, who sold his fashion chain Shanghai Tang to luxury goods group Richemont in 2006, name-dropping has become something of an occupational hazard."], "title": "David Tang: From connections come corrections", "article": "Sir David Tang is incredibly well-connected, as anyone who doesn&apos;t already know is likely to discover within minutes of meeting the billionaire businessman, socialite and, as of last week, would-be internet entrepreneur. The gregarious restaurateur, born in Hong Kong but educated in England from the age of 13, slips in an account of a recent conversation with Henry Kissinger seconds after settling back in his comfortable chair at a central London members&apos; club to discuss his new website, ICorrect.com. &quot;I would say to Henry Kissinger \u2013 as I did \u2013 look, people will ask in generations to come, did you bomb Cambodia legally or illegally?&quot; he recalls. To be fair to Tang, who sold his fashion chain Shanghai Tang to luxury goods group Richemont in 2006, name-dropping has become something of an occupational hazard. He has spent weeks drumming up support for his venture, which gives the rich, powerful and influential a platform to respond to online slurs \u2013 for a $1,000 a year fee. &quot;Only I know all these people and I have to go and see every one of them,&quot; he explains. &quot;For the last two months I have seen every single person, from the most powerful to the most read and talked about to the most controversial.&quot; Tang has smooth-talked or strong-armed many of them into becoming ICorrect members (or &quot;correctors&quot; as he prefers to call them). Bianca Jagger signed up and used the site to explode the myth that she rode into the infamous New York nightclub Studio 54 on a white horse semi-naked. (&quot;I briefly mounted the horse, dressed in a full-length red Halston dress.&quot;) Tony Blair&apos;s former chief of staff Jonathan Powell, Michael Caine and Stephen Fry have also used the site, which launched earlier this month. ICorrect is easy to use, although it is currently populated almost exclusively by Tang&apos;s friends and acquaintances. An allegation or assertion is set out on the right-hand side, and a celebrity riposte posted next to it. Imagine a virtual version of a graffiti-strewn school toilet, with innuendo and gossip scrawled on the walls \u2013 only with space set aside for a right of reply from targets. All hearsay When Tang met Kissinger, the former US secretary of state told him to read his autobiography, as he had addressed the Cambodia question in the book. Tang, who does a passable impression of Nixon&apos;s former aide, waving his cigar around as he does so, retorted that no one will do so in the future. &quot;The only filing system there is is this parallel space we call cyberspace,&quot; he says, and the information that exists in it, &quot;is all hearsay. And that is the problem. If you don&apos;t correct things and you just leave them they will repeat themselves again and again and again. And that&apos;s it.&quot; That is hardly a new phenomenon but Tang says public figures can now set the record straight for a small fee rather than resorting to the libel courts or the Press Complaints Commission. &quot;If you&apos;re somebody to be reckoned with, [the annual fee] is how much it would cost to ring up the solicitor and ask them to write a standard letter.&quot; Tang hopes the site will make money almost immediately as celebrities, sports stars, academics and politicians flock to it. He talks excitedly of global domination. &quot;After I launch it in America I will go to China, Spain, France, Hong Kong. I&apos;m going to have an Arabic [version].&quot; Once he reaches a critical mass of users he believes he can sell members&apos; details to companies who will pay handsomely for access to the world&apos;s most exclusive address book (apart from his own). &quot;It will become the first luxury brand on the internet. That&apos;s the value, that&apos;s the potential.&quot; It is tempting to dismiss ICorrect as a rich man&apos;s folly, a hobby for a semi-retired businessman whose companies run themselves (Tang is the exclusive Asian distributor for Havana cigars and owns the China Tang restaurant in London&apos;s Dorchester Hotel). Is this really a viable business proposition? Wikipedia is free, after all, and well-known figures \u2013 or their PR advisers \u2013 are free to visit the site and correct misinformation, while Twitter and Facebook allow celebrities to communicate directly with their public, managing their reputations in real time. Tang dismisses Wikipedia on the basis that inaccuracies and untruths can be reinstated as well as removed. &quot;Twitter is very impulsive and impermanent,&quot; he adds, &quot;and you only have 140 characters. There is no greater &apos;Emperor&apos; of Twitter than Stephen Fry. He went on ICorrect [and] he goes on for a long, long time. These are serious people who want to go on and explain themselves.&quot; Tang concedes well-known figures could use their own websites to right perceived wrongs, but says they are reluctant to do so. &quot;Madonna wants to sell songs and concerts, not to engage in controversies about how she adopts African children. The Prince of Wales wants to promote his good works, not [talk] about the fact that he is a bit crazy talking to plants or eating seven boiled eggs for breakfast. There is a case for setting the negative aspect of your life apart and containing it; [putting it] into a corner to deal with it.&quot; Politicians next Tang hopes corporations will also sign up \u2013 paying $5,000 a year \u2013 and points out that Chelsea Football Club, sports management group IMG (which represents Tiger Woods and Roger Federer) and Norman Foster &amp; Partners have already done so. &quot;These are not insubstantial companies,&quot; he notes. He is targeting politicians next. His overheads are low, and so he reckons 500 members will be enough to cover his costs. He thinks ICorrect, in which he is the sole shareholder, will make a small amount of money this year. Tang insists he is not seeking vengeance against the media: &quot;It wasn&apos;t out of frustration.&quot; He says he has never complained to a newspaper, although he knows most of the editors, naturally. The &quot;socialite&quot; label irritates him because he stopped going out when he turned 50. &quot;It&apos;s better than being called a paedophile,&quot; he reflects. &quot;I suppose for 25 years I did go out.&quot; When pressed, Tang says he believes journalistic standards have fallen, although he could simply be afflicted by a form of selective myopia that seems restricted to the wealthy and powerful, a condition that grows worse when a sufferer&apos;s friends and associates are written about regularly. In any case, does he really trust the rich and famous, people he describes as &quot;prima donnas&quot; and &quot;divas&quot;, to tell the unvarnished truth on his site? He says it might not matter, providing there are no fakes \u2013 new members must prove they are who they say they are \u2013 and no inflammatory or libellous content. &quot;We are not in the business of policing the content, except that obviously I would be entirely stupid if I didn&apos;t monitor either defamation or incitement to crime. &quot;You have to be slightly careful about accepting controversial figures,&quot; Tang muses. &quot;If you ask me, would I accept Nick Griffin or Gary Glitter \u2013 probably not, because I can do without the hassle.&quot; When asked if allowing propaganda to be published on ICorrect unchallenged would undermine the credibility of the site and embarrass him personally, Tang begins to rant about the long list of despots who have been the guests of the Queen. &quot;They all rolled up in open carriages up the Mall, stayed in Buckingham Palace, and they were entertained regally by ... Her Majesty. And afterwards they all go mad, or we discover they were [mad all along]. But that&apos;s part of life. What can we do?&quot; Bar any dictator from using the site, perhaps? &quot;Yes, but let&apos;s say Gaddafi wanted to join ICorrect tomorrow and it all turns out to be bullshit. It could actually form a very valuable piece of information for historians and psychologists,&quot; Tang argues unconvincingly. He believes celebrities might even use the site to indulge in acts of contrition. &quot;It could also become [a forum for] apologia. If I were Naomi Campell I might well have said I should not have used the word &apos;inconvenient&apos; in the Charles Taylor [trial in the Hague].&quot; Americans love apologia, he says, his eyes lighting up at the prospect. &quot;You need Tiger Woods to say &apos;I&apos;m very sorry, I shouldn&apos;t have done this&apos;.&quot; That may be fanciful, but Tang is convinced ICorrect will give many well-known figures the opportunity to have &quot;the final word&quot;.", "tags": ["Media business", "Digital media", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-28T06:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/spain-unemployed-under-30-emigration", "sentences": ["Tomorrow Jesus, 34, is off to Shanghai."], "title": "Spain's unemployed: one in five under 30 still looking for that first job", "article": "Tomorrow Jesus, 34, is off to Shanghai. His career in international development ran aground after the Spanish government slashed its budgets. The job, for which he was overqualified, became too irritating. So he&apos;s heading to China, where he has Spanish friends, with a return ticket that he hopes he&apos;ll not have to use for a few years. &quot;China is like a very optimistic film. It seems like a place where there are a lot of opportunities,&quot; he says. Very few people of Jesus&apos; age are saying that about Spain. At 43%, Spain&apos;s youth unemployment is the highest in the EU by far, and more than double the average. For those aged 16 to 19 the rate is 64% \u2013 an 11% increase on the previous year. One in five of those under the age of 30 are still looking for their first job, and almost half (46%) are on short-term contracts of less than 6 months. Youth unemployment here is higher than in Tunisia and Egypt. It&apos;s so high that many young people have to look long and hard to see past it. When I asked a class at an unemployed training centre who would be prepared to leave the country to find a job they all raised their hands. All said that the majority of their friends were also unemployed. Outside the unemployment office in the shadow of the Real Madrid stadium, where a queue snakes for 70 metres outside before the venue opens, Victoria, 26, waits patiently in line. It&apos;s been half a year since she worked as a receptionist. Since then she&apos;s been getting by with the help of her parents. &quot;I want to work in audio-visual communications. But I will take anything. Things are very difficult right now. I hope things are going to get better. But I don&apos;t really know how.&quot; Almost every young person I spoke to believed their lives would be harder than their parents. &quot;This is the least hopeful and &apos;best education&apos; generation in Spain,&quot; says Ignacio Escolar, 35, author of the country&apos;s most popular political blog and former editor of the newspaper Publico. &quot;And it&apos;s like a national defeat that they have to travel abroad to find work.&quot; Unlike the Spanish emigration patterns of the 1960s and 70s, when low-skilled workers left in search of work, most of those leaving this time are well-educated. A series on the subject in the autumn by the daily newspaper El Pa\u00eds prompted hundreds of letters. One wrote: &quot;When I was a kid, my parents used to tell me, &apos;we weren&apos;t able to study because we had no money, so you must study to avoid ending up like us&apos;. I did what they said, and today, in my 20s, with a university degree, a masters, and several other qualifications, along with too many grants from big companies, I am unemployed.&quot; Another wrote: &quot;I have a university degree. I have a good job, a good salary. I live in a house with a garden. How can this be? I left Spain when I was 23.&quot; Ignacio Prada, 25, who has two masters degrees, left for London a few months ago to work as a barman. He earns more doing that than he would do in an entry-level job, which would in any case be very difficult to come by. &quot;I live like a rat there so I can save money and learn English,&quot; he says. &quot;To be honest I never tried to get a job here. There are jobs, but the quality is not very high. I have friends who have economics degrees who are working at a cash register. I definitely feel part of this lost generation.&quot; As dramatic as the statistics sound, there is little evidence of a sense of urgency or outrage. Two weeks ago in Portugal a Facebook group called Desolate Generation staged a 150,0000-strong demonstration in Lisbon with tens of thousands turning out elsewhere in the country. In Greece, Italy and Britain, students have been out on the streets. But Spain&apos;s young remain relatively quiet. &quot;When I took part in the general strike last year most of the people involved were quite old,&quot; says former student leader, I\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, who is 27. It is not just the youth that appear docile. A demonstration against the austerity measures while I was in town could not fill the Puerta del Sol, Madrid&apos;s central square. Jesus, leaving for a final dinner with his family, and Ignacio, admitting he&apos;s homesick, still both say they are optimistic about Spain. So do all but one of the unemployed at the training centre. Electorally, most expect an increase in voter abstention among young people at the next elections. While British youth invented punk, and black America created hip hop as popular cultural responses to economic crises in previous decades, there seems to be little evidence that resistance is being expressed in other ways beyond trying to forget all about it. Spain has one of the highest rates of cannabis and cocaine usage among its young in western Europe. The botell\u00f3n, the social activity for younger people of drinking alcohol in public areas such as the streets, also increased in popularity until recent police clampdowns. Some on the political left struggle to explain the indifference. &quot;We&apos;re very worried about this,&quot; admits Cristina Bermejo, a representative of the youth wing of the CCOO union. &quot;People look like they&apos;re asleep and the disaffection is also directed at us in the unions.&quot; At the student union 20-year-old Carmen Aldama thinks people are &quot;apathetic&quot;. Errej\u00f3n, 27, \u00a0believes the young are de-motivated by the consensus in the political culture at a time when the governing Socialist party is implementing cuts. &quot;There is anger, but it&apos;s not political anger. In fact it&apos;s anger directed against the political class because all the politicians look the same. So it becomes cynicism.&quot; Errej\u00f3n also thinks that his generation bears the burden of failing to live up to the achievements of its parents&apos; political past. &quot;They say, we are the generation that brought about transition from fascism to liberal democracy. What have you done? What are you doing? We had mass movements. What are you going to be able to teach me if I can fight and defeat a dictatorship?&quot; But others say that the reason Spanish youth seem so relaxed is because the severity of the situation has been overstated. &quot;There are two explanations,&quot; says Juan D\u00edez-Nicol\u00e1s, a sociology professor and pollster. &quot;First, there isn&apos;t 43% youth unemployment \u2013 20% of the Spanish economy is underground and a large proportion of young people work in it. Second, the family, which, in Spain has been the cushion that has softened the blow of the impact of the economic crisis.&quot; The second point is particularly striking. The notion of a comedy film like the American movie Failure To Launch where the joke hinges on the fact that the central, thirtysomething, character has not moved out of the family home, makes little sense in Spain \u00a0where 54% of those between the ages of 18 and 34 do still live with their parents. But with a 10% increase in those living at home, the crisis has clearly had an impact. In many respects the source of Spanish youth&apos;s plight is much the same as elsewhere in Europe where the unemployment is twice the general rate, and the crisis has pushed each measurement higher. &quot;The difference in Spain is related to the productive sector,&quot; said Santos Ruesga, economics professor at Madrid&apos;s Autonoma University. &quot;Our boom was fuelled by very high levels of construction and tourism. Both are very low-skilled and labour-intensive. When the crisis hit we had a lot of low-skilled people lose their jobs and many of them were young.&quot; Gayle Allard, an economics professor at the IE international business school, says the problem is rigid Spanish labour laws that make it difficult to fire permanent workers. &quot;You have this privileged majority of people on permanent contracts who are very expensive to fire and so have no incentive to be more productive,&quot; she said. &quot;The problem with the youth is that they are coming in from the outside and they can only get temporary contracts, which makes them more vulnerable.&quot; Ruesga disagrees. &quot;Labour laws in Spain aren&apos;t very different to anywhere else,&quot; he says. Either way, Spanish unemployment has always been stubbornly high. At the height of the boom it was higher than that in Britain at the depth of the economic crisis. Education makes a big difference. The ni/ni (neither/nor) group \u2013 those neither in full-time education nor employment \u2013 are suffering. Among those aged 24 to 29, those with a doctorate are four times less likely to be unemployed than those who left school without qualifications. But with three in every 10 graduates working in a job for which they feel overqualified, even the most fortunate are frustrated. &quot;It&apos;s like there is oil on the streets,&quot; says blogger Escolar. &quot;All it needs is a small spark and it could blow.&quot;", "tags": ["Spain", "World news", "Unemployment"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-30T07:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/30/wang-anyi-profile", "sentences": ["Wang Anyi&apos;s city is Shanghai, to which she was permitted to return in 1978.", "Whether it be peasants battling with famine and poverty or the tiny cruelties of neighbours in the misty Shanghai streets, Wang Anyi&apos;s irony and her daring explorations of sexual love demonstrate most clearly how many different ways there are to challenge an authoritarian state.", "Beginning in 1945 and ending with the extraordinary eruption of the modern Chinese state, Wang&apos;s heroine is Wang Qiyao, a typical young Shanghai beauty."], "title": "Profile: Wang Anyi", "article": "Wang Anyi was a child of China&apos;s Cultural Revolution.

As with music, that unique city informs all her work. Men and women at work and in love, in city and in village, are the stuff of her fiction.

Always, like an underground river, run the interminable miseries of life under Mao. Whether it be peasants battling with famine and poverty or the tiny cruelties of neighbours in the misty Shanghai streets, Wang Anyi&apos;s irony and her daring explorations of sexual love demonstrate most clearly how many different ways there are to challenge an authoritarian state. Wang is now a prominent literary figure in China, and a prolific writer of fiction, both short stories and novels. Many of the greatest of these have been translated.

Over the past 40 days, six lawyers have been taken away by the police and disappeared. Dozens of other rights defenders, activists and dissidents have also been taken away; and one of the lawyers has resurfaced under circumstances suggesting that he was badly tortured. He was described as &quot;looking like a mummy&quot;. Such cases used to be very rare. Lawyer Gao Zhisheng, disappeared three times since 2007, reappeared twice to tell stories of horrible torture. It is not as though China lacks laws prohibiting torture, or as though it could not put its political critics through an ordinary \u2013 if not a fair \u2013 criminal process, which among other things would require them having access to lawyers. But rather than being punished for what they have done, these lawyers and their colleagues are being terrorised for what they might yet do. In a society in which discontent runs high, and in which there have been anonymous calls for a Chinese &quot;jasmine revolution&quot;, the party-state fears lawyers and activists exposing its wrongs, helping people affected by injustices ranging from illegal land-grabs and demolitions to political or religious persecution. The authorities have long relied on abuses to control certain groups, such as petitioners, but had until recently treated the professionals who gave a voice to their grievances with a little more respect. &quot;Now they&apos;re getting so nervous, they&apos;ve started really hating us,&quot; one of the lawyers told me about a month before vanishing. In part, it has to be admitted, the current wave of terror seems unprecedented because there were no human rights lawyers when Tiananmen Square, the cultural revolution, and other brutal and destructive crackdowns and movements occurred. Forty years ago, few Chinese people would have thought of legally challenging rights infringements because there were hardly any legal institutions to speak of. The legal system has only over the past two decades begun to accommodate the use of law against human rights violations \u2013 a kind of work that always also involves changing the system gradually and nonviolently from within. Now, the system that has been trying to seek legitimacy from legality has become afraid of people taking the idea of law too seriously. Perhaps the Communist party leadership could not anticipate that rights would become so popular. And who could have predicted the rise of the internet with its increased opportunities for activism, allowing lawyers to take their advocacy outside China&apos;s controlled courtrooms? It is becoming increasingly apparent that the leadership has decided to change course politically, away from &quot;governing in accordance with law&quot; and back to a more totalitarian system. Human rights lawyers keep a sort of mental list of persons likely to be targeted next, depending on how active they have recently been. Lawyers Tang Jitian, Jiang Tianyong and Teng Biao in Beijing, Liu Shihui and Tang Jingling in Guangzhou, and Li Tiantian in Shanghai were high up on that list before the police took them away. From the authorities&apos; point of view, the trick is to manage these lists. They &quot;need&quot; to disappear those at the top and frighten those lower down; to allow just enough information out to instil fear, but not enough information for anyone to hold them responsible. They need to prevent any potentially hard-hitting accounts and images that would damage them (think of Abu Ghraib or Guant\u00e1namo Bay), through intimidation and control extending to the remotest village, if need be. I could go into a little more detail, if it weren&apos;t for the fact that I, too, had to be afraid of the consequences for my friends. This is how terror works itself into the consciousness of everyone, even those supposedly shielded from it. A child whose father is among the disappeared recently said to her mother: &quot;We mustn&apos;t think too much about Dad, because you say that this will make a person sneeze (the Chinese equivalent of &quot;making someone&apos;s ears burn&quot;). If he is badly wounded, sneezing will make him hurt even worse.&quot; Anyone would be reluctant to report when this would put an informant at risk: one cannot entirely escape this logic of terror. But there is at least one thing foreign governments and publics can do, which is to ask the Chinese government where the disappeared rights defenders are, why they have been taken away, and how they are being treated. We must ask these questions, not only privately but also in public, to avoid becoming complicit in what is done to them.", "tags": ["China", "Human rights", "Civil liberties - international", "Tiananmen Square protests 1989", "Protest", "Law", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-31T11:38:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/31/china-crackdown-on-activists-arrests-disappearances", "sentences": ["Other lawyers missing are Li Tiantian of Shanghai and Liu Shihui from Guangzhou."], "title": "Crackdown in China spreads terror among dissidents", "article": "China has launched the most severe crackdown on dissidents and activists for more than a decade, human rights campaigners have warned.

Rights groups say they are increasingly concerned that those who have vanished may be at physical risk. The move follows anonymous online calls for &quot;jasmine revolution&quot; protests, echoing the uprisings in the Middle East. Although the posting was on an overseas website, and there was little sign of domestic support for the appeal, officials began detaining and harassing people within hours of its appearance. &quot;I think the crackdown is partly to find out who is behind it,&quot; said Wang Songlian of the Chinese Human Rights Defenders network, which has been monitoring the detentions. It believes about 200 more people had their movements controlled for shorter periods. Wang added: &quot;But part of it is an opportunity to retaliate against certain people \u2026 The terror of this current crackdown is that it is very difficult to know whether you are going to be next. That in itself is very unsettling for activists.&quot; The group is one of several to describe the campaign as the harshest since 1998, when the government imprisoned around two dozen activists for organising the China Democracy political party, although some argue that the troubled regions of Xinjiang and Tibet have seen equally sweeping &quot;anti-separatist&quot; drives in the interim. Many of the latest detainees appear to have been targeted for publicly criticising the authorities on Twitter or other online services, or have a history of rights activism. Although three men in Sichuan have been formally arrested for incitement to subversion \u2013 well-known blogger Ran Yunfei, Chen Wei and Ding Mao \u2013 the greatest concern is for those who have simply disappeared. In several cases, they were last seen being taken away by police. &quot;We are worried and can&apos;t eat well or sleep properly each night. They are doing good deeds for people; why should they be taken away?&quot; said Pang Jinhua, mother-in-law of lawyer Teng Biao, who has been missing since mid-February.

Other lawyers missing are Li Tiantian of Shanghai and Liu Shihui from Guangzhou. The latter vanished shortly after telling the Guardian he had been hooded and beaten on his way to a demonstration. Another Guangzhou lawyer, Tang Jingling, may also be missing. Their friends and supporters are increasingly fearful that they may face long prison terms or lengthy illegal detentions and even physical abuse. Chinese law states that police must inform an individual&apos;s relatives or place of work within 24 hours of detention, unless there is no way to do so or it would &quot;impede the investigation&quot;. Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua foundation, which supports political prisoners, said that the China Democracy party activists had at least gone through a judicial process, however flawed. &quot;One of the things disturbing about this latest crackdown is how apparently routine it has become for security agents to essentially ignore the legal procedures in their treatment of activists,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;The possibility of torture \u2013 whether in reality or in suspicion \u2013 is a bigger deterrent and much more chilling than jail \u2026 [People] wonder if they are next on the list.&quot; Nicholas Bequelin, an Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, warned: &quot;We are very apprehensive about the risk of torture and ill-treatment. &quot;We are seeing the government trying to roll back the space that has opened up in the last 10 years, particularly in terms of the assertion of rights. &quot;It&apos;s an effort to instil fear for internet users so they exercise self-censorship. It&apos;s also an attempt to decapitate civil society by taking away its most visible figures.&quot; Many usually outspoken government critics have become reluctant to speak to diplomats, journalists or other foreign contacts. Police did not respond to faxed questions about the missing lawyers. Asked about concerns for their whereabouts and physical safety, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, told a regular press briefing: &quot;China&apos;s judicial authorities work independently. &quot;China, as a country under the rule of law, protects its citizens&apos; basic rights and freedoms \u2013 including freedom of expression \u2013 but citizens while exercising their rights have an obligation to abide by the law and should not bring harm to the public interest.&quot; Earlier this week China dismissed a call from a UN rights agency to free human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, who has not been seen for almost a year and is thought to have been detained for two years.

A dispute in Bristol city council over the continued existence of a director of place making has also called into question the models and means by which\u00a0councils are supposed to promote\u00a0place and local economies. The argument over the city&apos;s attempts to engender a &quot;sense of place&quot; through recruiting for a specific postholder to oversee it has caused a &quot;wave of derision&quot; in the city, as the local paper put it, and has drawn criticism from the Daily Express, lashing out last May at what it called a &quot;gobbledygook job&quot;. As ever, the Tax Payers&apos; Alliance reliably dismissed the role as a &quot;costly indulgence&quot;.\u00a0 The city&apos;s Tory group leader added it was &quot;the sort of job which tends to bring local government into disrepute&quot;, while the opposition Labour group proposed the deletion of the post as part of its budget amendments this year, made at a time when hundreds of council staff are being laid off.\u00a0 But what does the post actually do? Since his appointment to the sensitive \u00a372,000 a year job last year, local creative firm chief Mike Bennett has set about organising a release of lanterns to celebrate Chinese New Year on a rainy February evening on the Clifton Downs (while protestors marched in the city against council job cuts) and held a brainstorming\u00a0meal for 55 local creatives\u00a0at the city&apos;s\u00a0Raymond Blanc restaurant.\u00a0 Understandably one local regeneration practitioner railed against the &quot;hijacking&quot; of place making &quot;by people who think you can define a city by painting your face and juggling on the back of a flat-bed truck&quot;. The media reaction this month to Haringey council&apos;s recruitment of a director of place and sustainability suggests that councils will require sensitivity over managing cuts proportionately while growing their local economies. Elsewhere, Redditch council incurred media and sector derision\u00a0last year as a result of its underwhelming marketing campaign to address &quot;unjust perceptions&quot; of the town, which included drawing attention to its BMX track and plans to build a swimming pool.\u00a0 All of this\u00a0tells us\u00a0that patrician and municipal jingoist\u00a0place branding has had its day, not only from a sensitivity perspective, under depleted public finances, but also in terms of the business case for such activity being handled from behind a town hall desk.\u00a0 This isn&apos;t to capitulate to those who absurdly argued in Bristol that its place branding and promotion should be handled by the civic mayor, but instead to consider alternative local partnership-led models which can have the effect of augmenting sense of place and add economic value. Work by global cities adviser Greg Clark for the United Cities and Local Governments organisation has shown that the intangible distinctiveness of place is a vital component of urban strategic planning, especially in an era of increased competition between metropolitan areas globally.\u00a0 With the New Economic Foundation&apos;s clone town survey becoming an annual fixture, councils\u00a0shouldn&apos;t be blamed for\u00a0seeking to\u00a0turn around\u00a0their centres and foster a sense of uniqueness. So where should councils\u00a0be looking to enhance their urban persona and attractiveness? The Heritage Economic and Regeneration Trust (Heart) in Norwich is one such model of an arms-length independent body which both acts as steward of local cultural assets and delivers their external promotion.\u00a0 Norwich isn&apos;t being pushed by paid external consultants to market itself as an equivalent to New York or to send officers on trade missions to Shanghai, but is instead moulding its city offer around its heritage assets and its offering to all sectors and age groups, not only as a place to visit but also to live.\u00a0 Local people are recruited to act as brand ambassadors and the organisation&apos;s bottom line is judged on sustainable visitor numbers. The model has attracted national and international attention and has been successful in levering in funding to improve the city centre in an authentic and realistic way. The RSA&apos;s &apos;Changing Chelmsford&apos; project saw the organisation&apos;s fellows based in the town assemble to discuss a vision for both projecting a more vibrant image as well as injecting some vitality into what is seen as an affluent but dull place.\u00a0 Branding initiatives such as Bristol&apos;s costly director and the widely mocked &quot;let yourself grow&quot; road signs of Northamptonshire prove that public cynicism over otherwise essential local economic development activity remains pervasive. The challenge for councils is to adopt partnership models which generate ideas and value rather than negative headlines.

Police have summoned more of Ai&apos;s assistants for questioning, according to a US filmmaker who has been making a documentary on the 53-year-old. Alison Klayman said officers had told some staff and volunteers \u2013 several of whom are foreign \u2013 to leave the studio or leave the country, adding that one aide had already left Beijing. Officials detained Ai on Sunday morning as he attempted to board a plane for Hong Kong. No one has been able to contact him or his friend Wen Tao, who was detained on the same day. Ai&apos;s installation of 100m sunflower seeds is still on show in Tate Modern&apos;s Turbine Hall and arts leaders and artists in the UK have added their voices of concern. The Tate director, Sir Nicholas Serota, said the whereabouts of the artist remained unknown. &quot;We are dismayed by developments that again threaten Ai&apos;s right to speak freely as an artist and hope that he will be released immediately,&quot; he said. Gregor Muir, director of the ICA which last week auctioned an Ai work for \u00a350,000, said: &quot;The ICA is deeply troubled to learn of recent events concerning Ai Weiwei. Our thoughts are with his family, studio staff and friends. Only last week, Ai donated a brilliant artwork to our fundraising auction and we are indebted to his generosity. To then hear news that Ai had been detained by his own government is deeply shocking.&quot; Tracey Emin called Ai&apos;s predicament &quot;a nightmare&quot;, adding, &quot;I hope he is safe.&quot; He is an artist, she said, who &quot;raises world awareness&quot;. Antony Gormley, currently in St Petersburg, said: &quot;I would call on all cultural institutions globally to voice their protest against all kinds of behaviour which we haven&apos;t seen since the days of Stalin.&quot; Bob and Roberta Smith, who makes slogan paintings, added his concerns in his own unique way . Ai is China&apos;s best known artist and designed the Olympic Bird&apos;s Nest stadium, but he has been an outspoken critic of the government. Last year he was placed under house arrest after announcing a party to mark the forced demolition of his studio in Shanghai. London&apos;s Lisson Gallery is due to stage an exhibition of his work next month and director Greg Hilty said: &quot;We are extremely alarmed by the detention of Ai Weiwei and his colleagues and are greatly concerned for his safety. Ai Weiwei is one of the leading cultural figures of his generation and consistently displays great courage in placing himself at risk to effect social change through his art. He serves as an example for legitimate social criticism and free expression both in China and internationally.&quot; Politicians have also stepped in. The foreign secretary, William Hague, has called on the Chinese government to &quot;urgently clarify Ai&apos;s situation and wellbeing&quot;. He added: &quot;The development of independent civil society and application of human rights under the rule of law are essential prerequisites for China&apos;s long-term prosperity and stability.&quot; US state department spokesman Mark Toner also called for Ai&apos;s immediate release, and expressed concern at the &quot;trend&quot; of forced disappearances, extralegal detentions, arrests and convictions of activists. The EU delegation to China said it was concerned by the increasing use of arbitrary detention and urged authorities not to use it in any circumstances. Australia has also voiced concerns. France and Germany earlier appealed for the artist&apos;s release. &quot;Ai Weiwei being taken away is not surprising to us; we just didn&apos;t think it would happen now. I don&apos;t think he had expected that either,&quot; said Pu Zhiqiang, a high profile rights lawyer. Pu had agreed to act for the artist if necessary, but said he had not been able to discuss the issue with Ai&apos;s family yet. &quot;Even if they [police] detain some kind of street thug, they have to give a notice within certain time, but for Ai Weiwei there is no information,&quot; Pu added. Ai&apos;s wife, Lu Qing, told Reuters: &quot;This time it&apos;s extremely serious. They searched his studio and took discs and hard drives and all kinds of stuff, but the police haven&apos;t told us where he is or what they&apos;re after.&quot; The Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) network said that another four artists from Beijing were detained on 24 March after a performance art event where some pieces touched on the crackdown and the &quot;jasmine revolution&quot;. An anonymous online appeal for protests akin to the Middle East uprisings appears to have sparked the campaign against critics. Artists Huang Xiang, Zhui Hun and Cheng Li were criminally detained for &quot;causing a disturbance&quot; by officers from the Songzhuang police station and Guo Gai was also taken away, probably because he had taken pictures, CHRD said. An employee at the police station said he did not know about the situation, then added: &quot;Actually, it is not convenient to talk about it.&quot; No one could be reached at the detention centre where the four are reportedly held. CHRD said that in total around a dozen people had disappeared and 26 people had been criminally detained, with five released on bail. Another three have been formally arrested and one has been sent to a labour camp. Amnesty International said that it believed lawyers were being harassed and intimidated to prevent them defending those caught in the crackdown. It said that in addition to several missing human rights lawyers, a dozen more had been pressured by authorities. They included Liu Xiaoyuan, who was briefly detained and berated by police for tweeting about a missing lawyer. He had requested to visit a detained female activist. Asked about concerns for the whereabouts and physical safety of those reported missing, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said last week: &quot;China, as a country under the rule of law, protects its citizens&apos; basic rights and freedoms \u2013 including freedom of expression \u2013 but citizens while exercising their rights have an obligation to abide by the law and should not bring harm to the public interest.&quot;", "tags": ["Ai Weiwei", "China", "Art", "Art and design", "Tate Modern", "Human rights", "Law", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-05T18:44:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/06/bob-dylan-china-ai-wei", "sentences": ["Tonight, however, he was singing to the culture ministry&apos;s tune: the concert was performed &quot;strictly according to an approved programme&quot;, a sign of official nervousness that has persisted since Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s 2008 Shanghai concert, when she chanted &quot;Tibet!"], "title": "Bob Dylan in China: a simple twist of fate?", "article": "In China, irony is usually just around the next corner. In the week that Ai Weiwei, the artist and activist, was arrested, Bob Dylan was allowed in to play Beijing. Nobody knows for certain why either decision was taken, but that didn&apos;t bother the 6,000 people who filed into the Workers&apos; Stadium Arena last night to hear the grandfather of the protest song play his first gig in the land that brooks no dissent. Dylan gigs are famously variable: songs are often transformed beyond recognition. Tonight, however, he was singing to the culture ministry&apos;s tune: the concert was performed &quot;strictly according to an approved programme&quot;, a sign of official nervousness that has persisted since Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s 2008 Shanghai concert, when she chanted &quot;Tibet! Tibet!&quot; while singing her song Declare Independence. That outburst resulted in a dearth of big-name performers in China. Beyonc\u00e9 came in late 2009, Usher in July 2010, but most of the recent foreign acts have been B-list. Last year, Dylan himself was refused permission to play. Why the change of heart? One former culture ministry official, Shi Baojun, told the Guardian it may be something as simple as fresh thinking at the Chinese embassy in Washington, where officials pore over the record of any artist hoping to play in China, examining their biography, opinions and \u2013 above all \u2013 previous comments on China. &quot;As personnel change all the time, changes in decisions often only reflect who is in charge. Some are bold, some are cautious,&quot; Shi said. That doesn&apos;t entirely explain why now, though: &quot;You have to understand, the government&apos;s always balancing the need to look liberal with the need to keep control,&quot; said Shi. &quot;They have so many audiences, and there&apos;s often no point in looking for logic because there isn&apos;t much, or any.&quot; The setlist featured some Dylan standards, greeted with enthusiasm by the audience \u2013 It&apos;s All Over Now, Baby Blue, Tangled Up in Blue, Simple Twist of Fate. He also showcased some more recent work \u2013 Lovesick, Thunder on the Mountain, Beyond Here Lies Nothin&apos;. From a distance, in his white stetson and drainpipe trousers with a military yellow stripe down the side, he could still pass for the slim youth of decades past. He still has the same tripping, graceful step, although he handles his voice with care now, as if it&apos;s a fragile instrument he doesn&apos;t quite trust. Still, as he growled, rasped, whooped and slides through his repertoire, the attack and the attitude were still, as ever, disconcerting and compelling. A guy in his early 30s sitting next to me, Song Xiao Feng, remarked coolly: &quot;We&apos;re not here for the music, we&apos;re here for the legend.&quot; But by the time Dylan reached his encores \u2013 Like a Rolling Stone, All Along the Watchtower and finally, Forever Young \u2013 most of the audience, about two-thirds of whom were Chinese, one-third foreign, were finally on their feet. He wasn&apos;t for everyone. One Chinese man behind me said: &quot;He&apos;s not singing, he&apos;s talking.&quot; But to most, it looked like he was nailing it. The only words Dylan spoke during the whole evening came at the end, when he introduced the band members. Yet he never seemed the sometimes reclusive and withdrawn performer of recent reports. He looked just like the legend that had drawn most of the audience to pay what are, for Beijing, serious prices \u2013 ranging from \u00a330 up to \u00a3200. As he left, a young Chinese man, Gong Ping, used a distinctive Chinese word of respect: &quot;People say he&apos;s out of date, but he has experience and wisdom. He&apos;s a &apos;sheng ren&apos; \u2013 a sage, like Abraham Lincoln or Martin Luther King.&quot; As the audience clapped and cheered at the end, the feeling was that we had seen a unique event, the first, and perhaps last, of its kind in China.", "tags": ["Bob Dylan", "Music", "China", "World news", "Ai Weiwei", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-06T17:24:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/06/ai-weiwei-investigated-economic-crimes", "sentences": ["Earlier, outgoing US ambassador Jon Huntsman had raised the artist&apos;s case in a strongly worded speech in Shanghai, describing him as one of the activists who &quot;challenge the Chinese government to serve the public in all cases and at all times&quot;."], "title": "Ai Weiwei is investigated by Chinese police for 'economic crimes'", "article": "Chinese police are investigating outspoken artist Ai Weiwei for &quot;suspected economic crimes&quot;, the state news agency, Xinhua, has announced. Authorities had not previously acknowledged police action against the 53-year-old, who went missing on Sunday after being stopped by officials at Beijing airport. The single-sentence report, deleted shortly after it appeared, did not explicitly refer to his detention, and there was no word on his friend Wen Tao, 38, who has also been unreachable since his reported detention on the same day. Earlier, outgoing US ambassador Jon Huntsman had raised the artist&apos;s case in a strongly worded speech in Shanghai, describing him as one of the activists who &quot;challenge the Chinese government to serve the public in all cases and at all times&quot;. The artist&apos;s detention has sparked an international outcry, with the US, Britain and the European Union criticising a crackdown on dissidents and activists. Germany&apos;s foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, has summoned the Chinese ambassador over the issue. Police visited Ai&apos;s studio three times in the week before he went missing. &quot;He felt a premonition that he would be detained,&quot; his wife Lu Qing told AP. &quot;He told me something might happen to him.&quot; She said she was particularly worried about his health as he takes medication for several illnesses. While Ai had repeatedly clashed with authorities, friends had already warned that this case appeared more serious because police had removed dozens of computers and documents from his studio and had questioned his assistants. Earlier in the day, Ai&apos;s mother, Gao Ying, told Reuters: &quot;I think they detained him for a reason. If they think they have something, it&apos;s certainly a fixed case, an injustice. I think they&apos;ll concoct some things against him.&quot; Gao said she had been &quot;filled with a bit of dread&quot; since Ai angered authorities by listing the names of children who died when schools collapsed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Officials censored discussion of the subject after public anger developed over shoddy construction. On the Sina microblog, China&apos;s domestic equivalent of Twitter, censors deleted many messages about Ai, and a search for his name produced a warning that results were not shown due to local regulations. But internet users fought back with typical ingenuity. Several used the words &quot;ai weilai&quot; or &quot;love the future&quot; \u2013 which looks and sounds similar to his name \u2013 to call for his return.

The piece did not explicitly say that authorities were holding him and police have not responded to faxed queries. There is still no word on Ai&apos;s friend Wen Tao, 38, who was reportedly detained on Sunday. Human rights groups believe Ai&apos;s detention is part of a wider crackdown in which scores of activists and dissidents have been detained, formally arrested or disappeared. It has sparked an international outcry. Ai&apos;s older sister, Gao Ge, told Reuters: &quot;The economic crimes report is absurd, because the way he was taken and then disappeared shows it&apos;s nothing of the sort. This is more like a crime gang&apos;s behaviour than a country with laws.&quot; She said her brother had previously warned his family he might one day be jailed for his activities. &quot;He was very clear that we shouldn&apos;t try to meddle and stop him speaking out ... My mother cried,&quot; she added. Ai&apos;s mother, Gao Ying, said the &quot;economic crimes&quot; allegations were being used to stifle his activism, adding: &quot;If he&apos;s not released, this will be the start of a long struggle ... They still haven&apos;t notified us why he was taken or where he is.&quot; Chinese law states that police must inform an individual&apos;s relatives or place of work within 24 hours of detention, unless there is no way to do so or it would &quot;impede the investigation&quot;. Gao said her son was unlikely to accept charges to win a swift release. &quot;If he&apos;s not given justice, he&apos;ll refuse to come out, I think. That&apos;s his character,&quot; she said. Human rights groups allege that similar accusations of economic wrongdoing \u2013 such as tax-related charges \u2013 have been used to intimidate activists in the past. In an interview last year, Ai told the Guardian the state might take action against him and that security officials had recently visited his bank. But he added: &quot;I also have to speak out for people around me who are afraid, who think it is not worth it or who have totally given up hope. So I want to set an example: you can do it and this is OK.&quot; The Global Times, a popular state-run tabloid, has run another attack on western condemnation of the case. &quot;[China] needs people like Ai Weiwei. But at the same time, it is even more important that Chinese law restrict the provocative behaviour of Ai Weiwei and others,&quot; it wrote.

But what if they were green bankers? Green bankers could lead a new approach to finance, helping Britain earn its way in a competitive global economy while supporting the entrepreneurs and businesses that are going to deliver a more sustainable future for everyone. Restoring financial services, especially in London, as a key driver of Britain&apos;s economic success should be in all of our interests. Not only does a successful financial services sector buoy tax receipts, but a thriving financial capital underpins growth by creating high-value jobs and economic activity throughout the country. For the last 45 years, the trade in financial services has brought a large surplus of money into the UK - even during the crash - despite the overall balance of payments having been negative for the last 25 years. So as we look for a way to create a sustainable economic recovery, it would be hard to ignore the potential role of financial services. In the same way that London has played a leading role in financing international industrialisation and development, we can do the same for the capital-intensive global transition to a low-carbon and sustainable economy. Although this sector is immature, the international market on which it is based is already large and growing rapidly. According to a recent Bloomberg/Pew Center report on global clean energy investment, there was a record $243bn worth of finance and investment in 2010. In Europe, \u20ac1 trillion of energy infrastructure investment is estimated to be required in this decade alone and globally, $46tr in additional investment is thought to be required by 2050 to tackle climate change. British efforts to gain market share in these large and growing green markets should extend to every sector, from services to manufacturing to R&amp;D. But we are lucky that in financial services Britain&apos;s capital has an excellent foundation on which to build. London is already the world&apos;s leading green financial capital, but this privileged position was achieved almost entirely by accident. As the largest financial centre within the European Union emissions trading scheme (ETS) and being part of a developed country that unlike the US signed the Kyoto protocol, London by default became the centre of both the EU and international carbon market. Another critical factor has been the active promotion of green and climate change-related policies by successive British and EU governments. Not only does this create a plethora of green investment opportunities in a large and close hinterland - the European market - that can be accessed by London based professionals, but it also means that London has become a leading green policy hub and ideas machine. Green policy ideas started by London&apos;s thinktanks, NGOs, and academic institutions are quickly picked up by UK politicians, disseminated through London&apos;s international media hub and then promoted in other European member states and internationally. Britain can be proud of this nexus of green innovation. But London&apos;s promising start in this new sector could be successfully challenged. We will be seriously tested by other ambitious financial capitals, including cities that missed out the first time round, such as New York, Chicago and Sydney, or by those that have identified this as a key growth area, such as Frankfurt, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. That&apos;s an intimidating mix of competitors by any standard. So what can we do to support this early success? An essential prerequisite is sustaining the capital&apos;s overall health as a financial centre, for example, by ensuring London is a well-regulated and affordable place to do business. But beyond these generic factors we can and must do more. The UK government and London mayor can directly and indirectly help. They must ensure that pioneering policies in the UK and Europe are successful, such as the EU ETS, new schemes to enable private investment in energy efficiency (the &quot;green deal&quot;) and renewable heat (the renewable heat incentive). New initiatives, such as the Capital markets climate initiative launched by Greg Barker, a UK climate change minister, need to become successful long-term platforms for policy-makers and financiers to come together and help create solutions to climate change. Government can also make sure that London&apos;s academic innovators in the climate change space, such as Imperial College, get the technology research funding they need to succeed. The greenest Olympics ever and the Olympic legacy can also be designed to support green and low-carbon entrepreneurs. In addition to these efforts, we must quickly send the right signals to businesses and investors that London is serious about success. The new UK green investment bank should be located in the capital, for example, and London&apos;s newly promised enterprise zone should be designed to attract and support green innovators over the long term. These measures can help keep London ahead of the game and support our economic recovery. This will help Britain earn its way in the world, transform our planet for the better and, just perhaps, salvage something of the reputation of bankers. \u2022 Ben Caldecott is the head of European policy at Climate Change Capital", "tags": ["Green economy", "Green jobs", "Environment", "Banking", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-07T10:45:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/07/china-rule-of-law-ai-weiwei", "sentences": ["When 58 migrant workers died in a fire in a corruptly-built Shanghai tower block, Ai again set out to document the dead.", "Curiosity about the fate of these lawyers is discouraged: one Beijing lawyer, Liu Xiaoyan, was detained for 10 hours in February for an online inquiry into the whereabouts of a Shanghai colleague."], "title": "Under this surreal 'rule by law', Ai Weiwei is guilty | Isabel Hilton", "article": "When the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei insisted to reporters in Beijing this week that &quot;China is a country ruled by law&quot;, and &quot;other countries have no right to interfere&quot; in the case of the detained avant-garde artist Ai Weiwei, there was a certain truth to his remarks. China is a country ruled by law. But this is quite different, as many victims of official corruption in China have discovered, from being a country in which the rule of law prevails. The rule of law contains important principles: the law is supreme, and all have equal rights before it. The concept of rule by law was pioneered by one of China&apos;s harshest imperial regimes, the shortlived but influential Qin dynasty, 2,000 years ago. The Qin emperor saw the law as an instrument of authoritarian rule, to be defined and used as he chose, and it is this tradition that appeals to the current Chinese leadership. Without understanding the distinction it is hard to see how China&apos;s growing body of law, with its court apparatus, judges and lawyers, really functions. Under a conventional system the supreme judicial authorities might be expected to have some legal background, but in China the head of the political and legal committee of the central committee of the Communist party, Luo Gan, is an engineer turned security supremo who is there to ensure the system serves the party. As he has put it, his role is to guard against &quot;negative western legal concepts&quot; like judicial independence. The party controls the courts, appoints the judges and routinely dictates the verdicts. Even if a citizen wins a case, the court has little power to enforce the verdict without the backing of those same state officials. A Chinese litigant is often in the Kafkaesque situation of being dependent on those who committed the abuse for redress. Nevertheless, with few other possibilities, growing numbers of Chinese citizens try to use the law to fight back against corruption. But if the citizen is expected to obey the law, the party state itself can shape and deploy it to suppress dissent and to preserve the careers of corrupt party officials. The party&apos;s discipline department will act against deviant officials when it wishes, but such matters are too important to be the concern of the legal system. The law is, however, a handy means of detaining, harassing and disbarring defence lawyers who get in the way of the state, and for the prosecution of complaining citizens for ill-defined offences against public order, social stability, national security or, as in Ai\u00a0Weiwei&apos;s case, economic crimes. Ai&apos;s alleged economic crimes are bound to pale in comparison with those of state officials, who are reckoned to steal more than $80bn a year. A report by Beijing&apos;s Renmin University in 2005 estimated that 90% of Chinese officials spend more than they nominally earn, so if Ai&apos;s economic crimes do exist, they are unlikely to be\u00a0the real problem. Far more important are his stubborn efforts to document the names of those killed by official corruption. In this he\u00a0has enjoyed more latitude than many: as the son of the celebrated revolutionary poet Ai Qing, he counts as one of China&apos;s new aristocracy. But when he set out to collect the names of the children who perished in the deathtraps of their badly-built schools in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, he was treading on\u00a0sensitive toes. No official has been prosecuted for the corruption that produced those schools. Instead, the parents of the dead children have been harassed; a teacher who tried to help them has been jailed; and Ai Weiwei himself has suffered a brain haemorrhage from a beating last year in Sichuan. When 58 migrant workers died in a fire in a corruptly-built Shanghai tower block, Ai again set out to document the dead. This is not listed as a crime under Chinese law, but it certainly annoys those responsible. Ai was not the first to test the limits of official tolerance. When corruption in the dairy industry led to the poisoning of a quarter of a million babies in 2008, the news was suppressed for several months so as not to spoil the Olympic mood. The firm responsible was prosecuted, but many complicit officials were not. Among the parents who remained vocally unhappy was Zhao Lianhai, who continued to campaign for compensation for his infant son, who developed kidney stones. He was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail. Another father, Guo Li, got a five-year sentence. But punishing the victims for taking legal action against corrupt officials no longer seems to be enough. In recent months a series of detentions and disappearances of active lawyers has signalled a more robust attack on the exercise of legal rights. The most notorious case is that of Gao Zhisheng, a leading human rights lawyer who was given a three-year suspended sentence in 2006 for &quot;inciting subversion&quot; \u2013 and\u00a0who disappeared last April. In February, three more high-profile lawyers disappeared and another had his leg broken while trying to visit Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer who is himself under house arrest.

We and many Chinese and other friends are very concerned at the Chinese government&apos;s behaviour towards its own citizens. Ai Weiwei&apos;s position is that he firmly believes in the freedom of speech and the right to speak up on behalf of others who have been brutally silenced for their efforts to change society for the better. As an immediate priority we urge governments to exert strong pressure on China to treat its citizens with respect as a matter of basic justice and humanity. At this stage of China&apos;s development as a country taking an increasing part in world affairs, it is crucial that we make it clear that China&apos;s credibility in the world is at stake if it does not significantly improve its human rights record. For example, another artist, Wu Yuren, was released in Beijing on 3 April after being detained for nearly 11 months without trial. His wife and child were left in a state of great anxiety for his safety and welfare and he had committed no crime. Liu Xiaobo has been handed an 11-year sentence as a writer who expressed the need for constitutional reform in the Chinese political system. He has effectively been removed from society for more than 10 years for expressing his views. We are concerned that the same fate awaits Ai Weiwei. We urge the UK government to treat this case as an urgent priority and to press for his immediate release.

That&apos;s the story at Games Workshop, and the latest news has lifted the company&apos;s shares by 12%. The retail group, which specialises in table top battle games including one based on Lord of the Rings, said it had traded strongly in the four months to last week, and as a consequence full year profits were likely to be ahead of current market expectations. Cash generation remains healthy and so it has declared a 20p a share dividend. Part of the reason for the improvement is a spate of cost cutting, including restructuring its retail outlets with more one-man stores, relocating its north American sales office and closing a model making plant in Shanghai, as well as investment in its online development. These improvements took longer to come through than expected, but the company appears now be seeing the benefits. Games Workshop is currently 45p higher at 415p, and in a buy note analyst Charles Hall at Peel Hunt said  We are upgrading our 2011 estimate by 25%, as the gross margin and cost reductions are higher than expected and restructuring charges lower than anticipated. In addition, cash balances have risen, and this has enabled the company to accelerate dividend payments. We were previously forecasting a 25p payment for the final dividend \u2013 we now expect a total payment of 30p.  Games Workshop has never been in better shape operationally and we should see a return to sales growth. The company has excellent long-term potential, given the global scope of the business, high margins and strong cash generation. The company has committed to returning truly surplus cash to shareholders each year \u2013 the 30p dividend would deliver an attractive yield of 8%.

But the business, which runs the Disneyland Paris and Walt Disney Studio theme parks, is struggling with a massive debt mountain and poor visitor numbers that could undermine its fundraising move. To make matters worse, Euro Disney is also under investigation by France&apos;s stock market watchdog after the price of its shares doubled to \u20ac9.05 (\u00a37.95) over a 10-day period in February. A total of 50.2% of Euro Disney&apos;s shares are publicly traded on Paris&apos;s Euronext exchange and the spike left analysts scratching their heads. As a result, celebrations for its 19th birthday on Tuesday are on ice. In stark contrast, Disney&apos;s presence in Asia is accelerating and on Friday it broke ground on a \u00a32.7bn park in Shanghai, the company&apos;s third park in Asia. In Paris, however, interest in Disney is slowing down. In the year to 30 September 2010 attendance at Euro Disney&apos;s parks fell by 3% to 15m as more holidaymakers stayed at home. This led to a \u20ac2.9m drop in revenue from its theme parks but total turnover grew 3.7% to \u20ac1.3bn due to a \u20ac47m windfall from the sale of a shopping mall on its property. It gave Euro Disney an operating profit but the company was pushed into a \u20ac45.2m net loss after making repayments on the loans used to fund construction of its two parks. Repaying its \u20ac1.9bn debt has left Euro Disney with a net loss in four of the past five years. Last year it deferred payment of \u20ac20.2m in interest owed to its biggest lender, the state-controlled Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations, as well as \u20ac25m of royalty fees to the Walt Disney Company, which owns 39.8% of Euro Disney. This was the maximum amount the company was allowed to defer and, as a result, it was forced into negotiations with lenders over its annual recurring investment budget. This budget covers the renovation of its assets but excludes investment in new developments. Its 2010 annual report revealed that if no agreement is reached with lenders, the budget for 2011 will be around \u20ac25m under its total of \u20ac73.9m last year. At its AGM in March the chief financial officer Greg Richart said Euro Disney was &quot;seeking lenders&apos; approval to increase spending for on-stage assets&quot;. &quot;On-stage&quot; refers to the parts of the two parks that visitors see. Euro Disney usually celebrates major anniversaries by opening new rides to attract more visitors. Its last blockbuster launch at Disneyland Paris was the Tower of Terror, a freefall ride inside a 180ft art deco tower, which opened its doors in 2008. Three small fairground-style attractions were built last year but no new rides are due to open in the next 12 months or beyond. This is not surprising given that blockbuster rides can cost as much as \u20ac100m to build. In October chief executive Philippe Gas announced he had set a target of paying back 25% of Euro Disney&apos;s debt by 2013: to meet this goal, the company would need to repay \u20ac475m over the next three years but Richart revealed at the AGM that only \u20ac410m is scheduled to be repaid by the end of 2013, with the annual repayment dropping to \u20ac37.4m in 2014. Euro Disney has long hankered after a third park to boost visitor numbers and its original agreement with the French government allowed it to build a third park by 2017. In September it extended the timeframe until 2030, but one of its analysts believes a third park is unlikely to be built even within this period.

Bob Dylan plays a gig in Beijing, then heads with his guitar to another of his nation&apos;s traditional enemies, Vietnam. That&apos;s a commercial transaction \u2013 rather than the state-aided entertainment known in the contemporary buzz-phrase as &quot;soft power&quot; \u2013 but we simultaneously see an example of soft-toy power: the US government has stumped up $20m over four years to fund an Urdu version of Sesame Street in Pakistan. For Dylan to be singing in the week when the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and many other cultural figures have again been silenced feels queasy, especially given his longstanding image as a troubadour of reform. And the protest singer has weakened his position by seemingly meekly agreeing to the censor&apos;s request not to perform Blowin&apos; in the Wind or The Times They Are A-Changing or to preach cultural freedom from the stage. My own experience of Dylan performances is that his renditions are now so idiosyncratic and his inter-number mumbling so impenetrable that it remains entirely possible that he performed both of his most famous protest songs, and made an impassioned plea for the release of Ai Weiwei, without either Chinese censors or audience noticing. But the key question in exporting art into contentious territories is the extent to which the work&apos;s essential values are diluted, as seems to be the case with Dylan. Contrastingly, while it seems inevitable that sections of Pakistani society will be suspicious of the reversioned Sesame Street on the grounds that the puppets may be spreading CIA-scripted imperial propaganda, this feels like a benign example of soft power, as were equivalent British versions of The Archers for Afghanistan (with advice on landmines) and Rwanda. Sesame Street was impressively multicultural long before that became fashionable and will spread through its Pakistan spin-off the message it preaches in America: spelling counts and counting spells intelligence. Inherent in much of the criticism of Dylan this week is the suggestion that we should consider soft power&apos;s hard flipside: a cultural boycott. The South African playwright Athol Fugard has argued that the theatrical ostracism of his nation during apartheid (when some writers and actors refused to work there) did play some role in embarrassing the government, although the sporting boycott was more influential, as it put out of reach a product that was in greater demand. The counter-argument is that the punters in a country should not be punished for the human rights abuses of their government, especially as the general population can not be assumed all to freely support their leaders&apos; actions. It was presumably this reasoning that led UK performers (including Elton John and Queen) to perform in South Africa during its period of political toxicity. And, indeed, Sir Elton, when appearing in Red Square during the communist era, offered a model for singing in oppressive places by breaking into &quot;Back in the USSR&quot; even though his Soviet minders had apparently asked him not to. According to this theory, any democratic western culture that breaches the actual or metaphorical walls of tyranny may have some progressive and tempering effect on the local politics. The fact that there exists a demand in Beijing for a Dylan gig can be seen as a defeat for the country&apos;s leaders, as can their decision on Friday to license a Disneyland in Shanghai. Dylan&apos;s and now Mickey and Minnie&apos;s presence is likely to make citizens feel better about themselves. The obvious risk, though, is that they also feel better about their government. Remember those successions of South African politicians having to explain to their people why the country didn&apos;t get to play high-class sport any more. But we should also listen to the resonant echo of a comment made by a member of the England cricket hierarchy when the Brown administration seemed to be putting moral pressure on the squad to abandon a planned tour of Zimbabwe without actual Foreign Office orders not to go. &quot;You can&apos;t,&quot; the spin bowler warned the spin doctors, &quot;expect cricketers to improvise a foreign policy for you.&quot; And nor should the burden of global moral leadership fall on entertainers. But the spectacle of a celebrated protest singer becoming a target of liberal political protest shows how treacherous this issue can be. Perhaps Dylan should offer a song for the Pakistani Sesame Street, an example of American cultural diplomacy that seems to involve less compromise of values.

Sign up or miss out altogether. It is a cautionary tale of the difficulties faced by media companies attempting to crack China. Last year a disgruntled Rupert Murdoch sold off his majority stake in News Corporation&apos;s three Chinese TV channels in a move widely interpreted as born out of frustration with overbearing restrictions. And in 2009 Kate Adie&apos;s documentary about the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests caused BBC Worldwide to be blacklisted from programme buying and co-productions. The global appetite for British television shows has continued to grow \u2013 according to UK producers&apos; trade body Pact&apos;s annual report, export sales were up 9% globally year on year to more than \u00a31bn in 2009. However, sales to China are so small that the territory is not even split out of the &quot;rest of Asia&quot; category, which amounts to just \u00a393m. Dawn McCarthy-Simpson, senior policy executive at Pact, talks about the &quot;Bric wall&quot; \u2013 a reference to difficulties such as onerous regulations and intellectual property theft in the fast-growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China. &quot;China is a long walk for a short drink,&quot; says Wayne Garvie, the managing director of UK independent producer All3Media&apos;s international operation, who has experience of the Chinese market from his previous job at BBC Worldwide. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen anyone make the revenues to justify the amount of time and effort it takes.&quot; While Garvie says China is &quot;not a priority territory&quot; for the Shameless and Skins producer, there are those who feel the market is finally about to come of age. The silver lining to the tale of the Chinese broadcaster&apos;s questionable tactics is that it was looking overseas for a hit format to go up against the second series of another foreign import, China&apos;s Got Talent. This Chinese version of the Simon Cowell format pulled in astronomical figures for Shanghai Media Group, the second largest media company in China, with the series averaging more than 400 million viewers per episode. While the eye-popping viewing figures helped push open Chinese broadcasters&apos; eyes to the potential benefits of buying foreign formats, the huge success of Pop Idol rip-off Super Girl in recent years has shown the ease with which foreign rights holders can be side-stepped with impunity. &quot;It takes time for the Chinese TV players to realise and respect the real value of the formats business,&quot; says Li Rui Gang, president of the SMG. &quot;Legal protection is one thing, the other I think is the mindset, which means the local TV markets need to be educated about the importance of creativity.&quot; China&apos;s TV industry is effectively controlled by SARFT, a notoriously strict and twitchy state regulator, which has to rubber-stamp every TV deal. SARFT operates as a cultural guardian and can pull a show off air at the first hint of content that portrays the wrong attitudes or depicts China or the Chinese in a poor light. And it has done. TV rights company IPCN, founded by former ITV senior executive Mick Desmond and Rebecca Yang, brokered the China&apos;s Got Talent deal and has plenty of experience negotiating an often &quot;fog-like&quot; regulatory landscape. Yang says too often there is a &quot;huge amount of resistance&quot; from foreign rights holders about making changes to formats that might make them more palatable to SARFT, and they often seem to be completely unaware of what is suitable to be pitched to a Chinese market. &quot;Shows must be culturally, economically and politically interpreted and many foreign companies are operating in the fog,&quot; she adds. &quot;Most western companies are pitching shows that just couldn&apos;t air in China. Companies like Fremantle, Endemol and BBC Worldwide have all been very interested and knocking on the door but there really hasn&apos;t been much happening.&quot; IPCN secured the green light for China&apos;s Got Talent with a pitch that included an endorsement from the committee organising the Shanghai Expo, which saw it as a platform to promote a positive national image for the event. A crucial format change was also agreed, with the public vote to decide who leaves the show replaced by selected groups of &quot;media representatives&quot; making decisions on behalf of viewers from their region in China. The result was the show airing in prime time \u2013 talent shows are traditionally not allowed before 10.30pm in China \u2013 and a second series on the way in July, as well as a nice greasing of wheels for a slew of new TV format deals. IPCN has just struck deals for production company Talpa&apos;s Dating in the Dark, which airs on Sky1 in the UK, and Sing It, as well as All3Media-owned Objective&apos;s The Cube, which airs on ITV1, and reality hairdressing series Shear Genius from Elisabeth Murdoch&apos;s production company Shine. It is though to be Shine&apos;s first format sale in China. &quot;The format industry is definitely growing in China now. I&apos;ve been here for years and it used to be a case of trying as hard as possible not to reveal too much detail about the format you are trying to sell for fear of it being ripped off,&quot; says Matt Elmes, a China-based consultant executive producer on a new show called Happy Choirs based on a well-known UK format. Li Rui Gang believes that the Chinese government is starting to &quot;put a lot of effort&quot; into cracking down on piracy. There is also a growing consensus within the Chinese TV industry that the time has come to stamp out piracy if it is to be taken seriously and treated as an equal. As one industry source puts it: &quot;No one wants to deal with a thief.&quot; &quot;The Chinese media industry is really starting to mature and they have the financial firepower to be major international players,&quot; says Desmond. &quot;There is a realisation that, as they become [programme] exporters pan-Asian and beyond, to protect their own rights, and have a reputation on the world stage, they need to respect international programming rights.&quot;", "tags": ["Independent production companies", "China", "Media", "Television industry", "Media business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-11T06:00:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/apr/11/gameshow-cube-china-launch", "sentences": ["Dating in the Dark, which airs on Sky1 in the UK, will air on Guangdong TV while a 26-episode run of karaoke-style show Sing It will air on Shanghai&apos;s Dragon TV.", "Desmond said that having gathered valuable market experience IPCN \u2014 which launched a Shanghai-based branded content and sponsorship spin-off last year called 80 Entertainment \u2014 intended to look to branch out into TV production in its own right."], "title": "Gameshow The Cube to launch in China", "article": "Hi-tech gameshow The Cube is to head to China in one of a clutch of deals that will see shows including Dating in The Dark and Shear Genius, Shine&apos;s first format deal for the Asian market.

Friends of Zhang Jingsong, known to friends as Xiao Pang, and accountant Ms Hu \u2013 who worked for Ai&apos;s art and architecture practice Fake Design, and whose full name is not known \u2013 have been unable to contact them since the weekend. Officials said last week that police were investigating Ai in connection with suspected &quot;economic crimes&quot;, but the artist&apos;s family say they have yet to be notified of his detention. Ai, 53, has been out of contact since he was stopped by officials at Beijing airport more than a week ago. His friend Wen Tao, 38, has also been missing since police reportedly detained him on the same day. They did not respond to faxed queries about the four individuals. They visited Ai&apos;s studio three times in the week before his detention, and removed scores of items afterwards. They also questioned numerous staff and volunteers. The detentions come amid a broadening crackdown in China, which has seen dozens of activists, dissidents and high-profile human rights lawyers criminally detained or go missing. On Sunday, police rounded up about 160 Christians attempting to hold an open air church service in Beijing, having been evicted from their previous home. Most were released not long afterwards. Christians are supposed to attend state-approved churches but the authorities in the capital had appeared more tolerant of underground &quot;house churches&quot; in recent years. Meanwhile, English language state media continued to attack Ai over the weekend, publishing a lengthy piece claiming that many in China regarded his work as &quot;third rate&quot;, and citing a variety of unverified allegations. Although he is not a household name in China, he is the country&apos;s best-known artist internationally and co-designed the Bird&apos;s Nest National Stadium \u2013 the centrepiece of the Beijing Olympics. The Xinhua article added: &quot;Though police authorities have not disclosed details [of his alleged offences], various claims of accusations against Ai surfaced on the internet within hours of the investigation being announced.&quot; It said that none of the claims had been independently investigated, but went on to quote claims that his 2007 work Fairytale \u2013 for which he flew 1,001 Chinese citizens to an art show in Germany \u2013 was stolen from the idea of Professor Yue Luqing. But Yue told the Guardian that he had &quot;strong sympathy&quot; for Ai and was worried about him following his detention, and questioned the relevance of the claims. &quot;I hope he is safe, no matter where he is now. I know that he has not been in good health. I have been paying attention to what he has been doing during the years, and I identify with him. These are completely different matters,&quot; he said. Yue said that in 2006 he had sent 1,001 people from Shanghai to Xi&apos;an, as part of an arts project organised by the British Council. But he added: &quot;I would like to clarify that personally I have never said that Ai Weiwei plagiarised my work. I don&apos;t think it is necessary to sue him and I don&apos;t have that kind of plan either.

Four decades after his songs became anthems for America&apos;s anti-Vietnam war movement, the folk legend appeared at a half-empty venue in Ho Chi Minh City. Dylan was making his first visit to the city once known as Saigon, performing at the 8,000-seat RMIT University. Although thousands of locals and ex-pats bought tickets for the concert, around half the tickets went unsold, according to the Associated Press. The singer is not well known among Vietnamese youth, the BBC reports, and half of the country&apos;s 87 million people are under 30. As in China, where Dylan appeared in Beijing and Shanghai last week, the 69-year-old had to vet his setlist with government officials. Vietnam&apos;s communist government does not often welcome major western acts, and maintains stringent controls over what music they perform. But though promoter Rod Quinton said no restrictions had been imposed, the songs Dylan chose were hardly controversial. Despite a handful of 60s classics, such as All Along the Watchtower and Highway 61 Revisited, there was no sign of Blowin&apos; in the Wind or The Times They Are a-Changin&apos;, and Dylan&apos;s setlist leaned heavily on recent tunes. He closed the show with a rendition of 1974&apos;s Forever Young. To the consternation of human rights groups, Dylan has refused to address political issues since arriving in Asia. &quot;[He] should be ashamed of himself,&quot; said Brad Adams, executive director of the US wing of Human Rights Watch. &quot;[Dylan] has a historic chance to communicate a message of freedom and hope, but instead he is allowing censors to choose his playlist.&quot; While Dylan made international headlines at Sunday&apos;s gig, a &quot;significant part of the concert&quot; was dedicated to Vietnamese songwriter Trinh Cong Son, according to the president of RMIT University. Local musicians opened the show with a performance of 15 of Son&apos;s compositions. &quot;As part of this year&apos;s 10th anniversary commemoration of the death of Trinh Cong Son, we felt it would be a very good way to introduce more foreigners and more of the younger generation of Vietnamese to one of Vietnam&apos;s great modern literary and musical figures,&quot; Merilyn Liddell explained.

It has been clear for some time that the Asian powerhouse is moving more rapidly on renewable technologies. A recent report by Pew Charitable Trusts shows China led the world last year with a $54.4bn investment in clean technology, about 40% higher than third-placed America. More surprisingly, the Communist government in Beijing is also showing a greater willingness to adopt market-based approaches that were once considered preferable only by capitalist economies. On Monday, a senior Chinese official said mandatory emissions trading systems will be rolled out in six of the country&apos;s most advanced regions by 2013. After the pilot schemes in Guangdong, Hubei, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing, the government has promised to ramp up the use of carbon-based financial instruments to a nationwide level by 2015. It is a sign that China is both desperate and ambitious enough to try almost anything. The widely trailed move towards a cap-and-trade system will provide an extra tool for China to achieve its Copenhagen commitment to reduce carbon emissions relative to economic growth by 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2020. Cap-and-trade initiatives in Washington started much earlier, but have sunk in Congressional quicksand. The first US experiment in emissions trading came to an end four months ago with the closure of the Chicago Climate Exchange, though California&apos;s scheme (the world&apos;s second largest) is reportedly in talks to expand by joining with Europe&apos;s. Critics of emissions trading will undoubtedly say the US is better off without it. Europe currently has the world&apos;s biggest carbon market, which has channelled billions of dollars towards projects in developing nations that are designed to reduce emissions. China has been a major beneficiary, accounting for about 60% of the world&apos;s carbon credits. But the United Nations mechanism for evaluating credits has been plagued by allegations of fraud and misallocation of resources. In the latest scandal, Chinese officials denied this week that the country&apos;s factories were manipulating production of hydrofluorocarbon-23 - a powerful greenhouse gas - to qualify for huge quantities of carbon credits. The European Union is unimpressed and will ban such credits when its new emissions trading system starts in 2013. Existing schemes are clearly flawed. But by opting out, the US is losing its ability to influence reform, just as China begins to establish what could become a rival trading system. Beijing has positioned itself cleverly. In the years ahead, its influence will grow in both renewable technology and climate finance. This has prompted the analyst S\u00f8ren L\u00fctken to talk of an emerging Grand Chinese Climate Scheme. It is far from certain that this will be successful. Corruption, imprecision and inexperience are major hurdles that China has yet to overcome in establishing a cap-and-trade scheme. Lobby groups could water down plans that will cost industry money. As in the US, the economy will remain dependent on fossil fuels for many decades. Yet compared to the US, China seems to have a clearer sense of direction, greater flexibility and a willingness to move. In a testimony last month to a congressional energy committee, Deborah Seligsohn, the Beijing-based representative of the World Resources Institute, spelled out the long-game that is underway:  &quot;Chinese economic strategists recognise that China was late to the industrial revolution and even late to the IT revolution, but it believes it can be a leader in a green revolution.&quot;  Frustration among US environmental groups has been building up for some time, evident in these blog comments last year from Jake Schmidt of the National Resources Defence Council:  &quot;The signals today on clean energy coming from China and the US are pointing in complete opposite directions - one country on hold and the other moving forward.

When I first started playing around with the Web in 1994 it was pretty much text-based. Coming out of the digital publishing era that seemed kind of dull. One day I saw a headline on the front page of the New York Times about some new cave paintings found in France. I was able to go online and do a quick search and see them instantly. THAT blew my mind! Images add so much context to the information online -- bringing emotions and stories to life for me. No matter what I am searching for I can&apos;t resist flipping over to see what images turn up, no matter how random or spontaneous. Internet hero:  Italo Calvino. His books, particularly Invisible Cities, provide some of the best allegories for appreciating the true meaning of the Net. What is the ethos of frog design? How does the culture in that organisation inspire solutions to big problems? The key to frog is curiosity. People here are curious. We are interested in interpreting and learning from the insights we glean from observing human experiences and behaviour. What drives us is the funny feeling that we never know what&apos;s around the next corner. Whether one of us is studying a topic such as online education, the health care system, or mobile money, whether we&apos;re working in New York or Shanghai or researching in Afghanistan, we always feel like we&apos;re one encounter away from an idea / insight / inspiration that could be the key to changing the world. I love that! Can design play a role in social value? Can we design our way toward a more harmonious world? As designers, we can use our skills, tools, and creativity to influence many markets and issues beyond our core businesses and customers. When researching, designers don&apos;t just learn about the world, but also help shape it. As designers, we can help build out and share peoples experiences efficiently and, hopefully, serve as a catalyst for new engagement and collaboration models that can have a powerful impact on people&apos;s lives. Currently, we are exploring mobile technologies as an important new window into people&apos;s beliefs and behaviours. We are working with partners like UNICEF and the Institute for Money, Technology, and Financial Inclusion to explore the potential of mobiles in health and financial empowerment. What is Project Masiluleke, and how is it making an impact on peoples lives? Project Masiluleke (also known as Project M) is a broad initiative with many partners (frog, PopTech, iTeach, the Praekelt Foundation, MTN South Africa, Nokia Siemens Networks and the National Geographic Society) that targets the HIV/AIDS crisis in South Africa. Masiluleke means \u0152hope\u00b9 and \u0152warm counsel\u00b9 in Zulu. The initiative is an opportunity to tackle this crisis from the perspective of the patient / individual. We have envisioned a new service delivery model that could connect with people in a fundamentally different manner from the traditional healthcare system. And we are starting to construct this solution piece by piece, as an overlay to communication tools and habits that already exist - with an &apos;Over the Top&apos; strategy. One of the advantages of mobile technologies is that they are light-weight, easy to test and bootstrap. For Project M we were able to start a service that, within a year of its launch, now reaches 1-2 million under-served South Africans a day. Technology is being used as a tool to enlighten, educate, and liberate people around the world. How far would you agree with this statement? Technology is never a solution on its own. What interests me is the relationship between technology and behaviour. The two have this amazing feedback loop as they impact each other and open up new avenues of engagement. Almost every problem that we work in is human and social in nature. So technology must recognize and amplify these social dimensions. And it CAN, when done well, providing a new level of awareness and augmentation for people as they make day-to-day decisions. A simple text message or poke at the right time with the right relevance holds a lot of power. What (or who) drives you to keep on innovating? I see my role as a catalyst and facilitator, not as an innovator. If you bring together the right people and push there thinking then ideas will start to flow. That is the beauty of my role at frog, I get to watch that dynamic play out again and again and benefit from the brainpower of a diverse set of collaborators and co-creators.

It is also the 21st-century incarnation of an 87-year-old marque that was once a byword for all that was nippy, open-topped and carefree about British sports cars.

Despite the ownership, and the fact that it is three-quarters built in China before being shipped over and finished off by the 40 or so manufacturing workers in Birmingham, Wallace insists the five-door hardtop is a true MG. &quot;All of the design work for the car, all the styling and all of the actual engineering design work is done here, and all the engineering development and proving of the car is done by that team on site here at MG Birmingham,&quot; he said. &quot;The driving dynamics of the car are [also] overtly MG: it&apos;s very sporty going through quick corners and bends and we think that&apos;s a particular thing that sets us apart.&quot; But those fantasising about the whoosh of wind through their hair as they tear down country lanes might want to rein in the romance: the MG6 is looking to take on the likes of the Ford Focus and Vauxhall Astra. Lest there be any doubt that the MG6 is not exactly a sporty coupe, Wallace added: &quot;A lot of people compare it to the Skoda Octavia and the Vauxhall Insignia, for the body shape.&quot; To others, though, the new car is about a lot more than the reinvention of a beloved brand. This week is the sixth anniversary of the closure of the once-great Longbridge plant, with the loss of 6,500 MG Rover jobs. The Labour MP Richard Burden, whose Birmingham Northfield constituency includes Longbridge, describes the MG6 as a milestone and, hopefully, a glimpse of real recovery. &quot;We&apos;re never going to see Rover&apos;s return of 20,000 people engaged in mass car production, but what you&apos;re seeing here is not just a new model rolling off the tracks at Longbridge but also a new model that was designed and developed at Longbridge,&quot; he said. &quot;Britain now excels in performance engineering and in automotive-related environmental technologies \u2026 [and] Longbridge can be a centre for that.&quot; All the talk of corporate and regional revival, however, will prove premature if the marque fails to hit the mark this time around. According to Richard Ladds, editor of the MG Owners&apos; Club magazine, Enjoying MG, the new car is &quot;very good, very capable, very competent \u2026 it&apos;s not a BMW but it&apos;s not a low-rent car either&quot;. Nor is he bothered about where the car is mainly built. &quot;It&apos;s a bit like an Apple computer: I think, &apos;Oh that&apos;s a lovely Apple computer&apos;, I don&apos;t think, &apos;Oh it&apos;s built in China&apos;.&quot; The main thing, said Ladds, is that the old Morris Garages badge is once again on the bonnet of a new car. &quot;There&apos;s a somewhat strange brand loyalty and it&apos;s nice to be able to say yes, we can go and buy a new MG,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Automotive industry", "Design", "Manufacturing sector", "Business", "UK news", "Motoring", "Culture", "China", "Money", "World news", "Birmingham", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-12T17:43:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/12/mg6-design-verdict", "sentences": ["Although styled by a British designer \u2013 Tony Williams-Kenny, formerly with the Japanese car maker, Mitsubishi \u2013 the Roewe is manufactured by SAIC (Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation), the state-owned Chinese company that took over the Nanjing Automobile (Group) Corporation that bought out MG Rover in 2005."], "title": "MG6: part Audi, part Korean hire car", "article": "Let&apos;s be clear.

The world No10 rang the organising body last Thursday asking to be left out of the tournament, which starts this weekend, but when he was asked for a written confirmation he had a change of heart and decided to go through with his first-round match against Dominic Dale, which starts on Monday. However, he will now work with Dr Steve Peters, a psychiatrist who helped the highly successful Great Britain cycling\u00a0squad at the 2008 Olympics and also has a role with Team Sky. &quot;A friend said to me in China that I should see this bloke. I&apos;ll try anything that might work,&quot; O&apos;Sullivan said. He is hoping that Peters will help him rediscover his appetite for the game following the four least productive months of his career and mount a serious challenge for a fourth world title. A spokesman for Peters said the two had yet to meet to discuss their way forward. Since taking the Premier League title in late November, O&apos;Sullivan has not won a match and has this season withdrawn from two major ranking events, the Shanghai Masters and the German Masters, and 10 of the 12 minor ones that comprise the new Players Tour Championship. When he has played, his form has been patchy, his resolve easily broken. He has shown a desire to play only if the result is immaterial, such as when he made six centuries in eight frames in an exhibition he co\u2011promoted in Blackburn. Away from the table, his relationship with Jo Langley, the mother of his two youngest children, ended in a protracted financial dispute, which has hardly helped his preparations. Peter Ebdon, the world No13, felt it would be good for the game if O&apos;Sullivan could recapture his best form. &quot;If the real O&apos;Sullivan turns up against the real John Higgins, or the real Ding Junhui, or a number of other top players when they&apos;re really playing on top of their game, we really could have fireworks,&quot; the 2002 champion said yesterday. &quot;This could be one of the best world championships we&apos;ve ever seen, and I think it&apos;s very, very open.&quot; O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s problems appear to stem from his father&apos;s 18-year sentence for murder in 1992. The 15-year-old was in Bangkok as the hot favourite for the World Amateur Championship when news of his father&apos;s arrest came through and he lost in the last 16 to a player he should have beaten comfortably. His problems, whatever their tangled roots, have added to the already huge pressures of championship play and have often been too much for him. In 1996 he admitted to assaulting a media official at the world championships and was handed a two-year suspended ban and a \u00a320,000 fine with an additional \u00a310,000 donated to charity. At the 2006 UK Championship, trailing 4-1 to Stephen Hendry, he missed a red then shook hands with Hendry and the referee and walked out. &quot;I got annoyed with myself and lost my patience,&quot; he said, before being fined \u00a321,000. More recently, after a 5-4 defeat to Marco Fu in Beijing in 2008, O&apos;Sullivan simulated a sex act on the microphone at his press conference, asking a reporter &quot;Do you want to suck that?&quot; He later apologised.

But the content and exaggerated performance style are questionable,&quot; Li, who heads the television drama management division, told a conference. &quot;Many stories are totally made up and are made to strain for an effect of novelty. The producers and writers are treating serious history in a frivolous way, which should by no means be encouraged any longer,&quot; he said. A statement on the Sarft website warns companies to avoid &quot;incorrect&quot; shows, attacking time travel dramas for their &quot;bizarre&quot; plots and reinvention of myths and even for spreading feudal superstition. The Xinmin Evening News, which first reported the story, said the administration was outlawing the genre. But experts said the new guidelines \u2013 although they already appear to have reined in producers \u2013 were not a ban as such. &quot;A warning \u2013 it is not an official ban \u2013 from Sarft is already strong enough,&quot; Professor Nie Wei, of the School of Movie and Television Drama Studies, at Shanghai University, said. &quot;The producers of the Palace, the recent popular time travel drama, are changing their scripts [for the next series],. &quot;Some of the time travel dramas nowadays are made in a very shoddy way and are irresponsible in not respecting history \u2013 but overall, it is more complicated [than Li suggests]. &quot;I think whether there is time travel or not is not important. What matters is whether it is a good piece of work or not.&quot; While western examples of the genre, such as Life on Mars or Quantum Leap, have often focused on the recent past, the Chinese programmes fuse a modern mindset with the country&apos;s passion for costume drama. Last year&apos;s hits included the Myth, in which a teenager travels back 2,000 years and becomes an army general. The Palace was about a modern girl who finds herself in the much more recent Qing dynasty, where she is torn between two rival princes.

They do not want to expose their feet, which are covered with festering blisters from the water of the Ting River. The pollution disaster here, in Fujian province, eastern China, has brought Zijin Mountain into the public eye. Before July, 2010, the metals giant that runs the pits here \u2013 Zijin Mining \u2013 was upheld as an example of &quot;double excellence&quot;: bringing both economic benefit and environmental protection. Bitian has not had usable water for a long time. According to statistics from the village authorities, more than 200 of the 305 families here have to walk down a very long road every day to collect mountain water. One villager, Zhong Sanlian, allowed me to see her sore-covered feet. After she washes her clothes in the river water, she said, her feet swell up for several days and itch painfully. The village secretary, Huang Jingxin, said: &quot;Your hands start to itch as soon as you come into contact with the river water.&quot; Even the colour of the Ting River scares them. When there is no wind or rain the water is green. But when it rains heavily, sediment from the bottom of the river is brought up and the water turns into a rusty sunset colour. Losses to the downstream fishing industry have already been calculated. However, damage caused in the immediate area as a result of July&apos;s disaster has not yet been evaluated. The villagers said that all the fish in the river have been killed off. River life has always been a source of pride for the people here. Turtles used to sell for more than 70 yuan (US$10.7) per jin (around half a kilo). They also used to catch grouper, beard fish and eels, which had sweet and tender meat, like tofu. July was the last time anyone here caught a fish more than half a metre in length. That fish died quickly and a group of the villagers bravely ate it together. Among them was 30 year-old Bi Bosheng, who works at the neighbouring Wuping Zijin mine, in a shaft over 400 metres deep. He has a different take on life and death to most: more and more people dare not eat anything from the river. Another villager, Huang Lihua, suspects it is as dangerous as taking poison. Even now, Bitian has not posted a report on local water quality. It&apos;s as if the pollution incident had nothing to do with this village. Nobody has raised the issue of compensation or how to deal with drinking-water problems. The only comment has come from the Dahang County TV station, which has been broadcasting daily since the beginning of August that Ting River water is meeting quality standards on every count. Local people are too scared to eat the fish here, but the results of official laboratory tests have &quot;confirmed&quot; that Ting River water is meeting standards. The results were posted on a bulletin board on Jiangbin Road in Shanghang County. According to inside sources, the former head of Shanghang County Environmental Protection Bureau has been removed from office. The new head, Li Yongtao, goes to Zijin Mountain for monitoring purposes every day. La Jilong, the head of the environmental monitoring station in Yongding County, which is situated downstream of Shanghang County, even told me that &quot;already there are no traces of copper ions&quot;. This does not calm the fears of the locals, however. Exasperated, village head Zhong Wenfang said: &quot;At present we don&apos;t know what to believe \u2013 whether the problem has been resolved or not.&quot; The villagers here have long mistrusted the authorities. At the end of June and beginning of July, the river at the foot of Bitian village turned strange shades of blue and green, like synthetic colours in an oil painting. Every day, the villagers see the environment inspection vehicle come to the bridge at the entrance to the village to take water samples. They know something is wrong, but up until now nobody has explained to them what has happened. According to China&apos;s &quot;Environmental Protection Law&quot;, if there is a sudden incident in a company or government unit that could cause an environmental accident, then &quot;the people who may come to harm as a result of the pollution must be informed in a timely fashion&quot;. Zijin Mining clearly failed to comply with this. The distrust goes further back than July, however. Villager Huang Lihua has not dared to drink the river water for several years. He has used several hundred metres of rubber tubing to divert mountain spring water from the other side of the mountain to his home. Three or four years ago, his cattle, which would frequently go down to theriver to drink, became ill and died. He buried the cattle. He did not dare to eat or sell it. Even without the impacts of July&apos;s accident, Bitian is paying a price for the mining operations on Zijin Mountain. The mountain lies to the north-east of the village. When it is windy, ore residue fills the air. On bad days, even the houses on Zijin Mountain are hard to see. Since the beginning of this century, when the peak of Zijin Mountain was blasted for mining, the environment of Bitian village has steadily deteriorated. Last year, Zijin Mining gave Bitian village a subsidy to establish a running water supply. However, this year water samples from the village were sent for laboratory testing and the water quality found to be sub-standard. The villagers said they now use it to flush their toilets. Huang Lihua said: &quot;The water from the Ting River used to be delicious, but now we don&apos;t dare to drink it&quot;. Villagers with enough money buy clean drinking water like city people. What really frustrates the people of Bitian is that, apart from the pollution, Zijin Mining hasn&apos;t brought them anything: there have been no benefits for the villagers and gaining work at the company is not an easy task. This cannot be counted as a poor village. At the beginning of the 1990s, many people bought shares in Zijin Mining and made some money. But those with funds have moved away. Zhong Wenfang, the village head, said that the people still there are those with no alternative. Most of the older Bitian villagers know Zijin Mining&apos;s chairman, Chen Jinghe, who as a young man used to climb Zijin Mountain in the day and, in the evening, eat his dinner at the Bitian village hall. And so, for the past two months, a group of village bigwigs have been going to Zijin&apos;s offices to try to speak with Chen. Zijin Mining has, in response, promised to resolve their drinking water problems, but still nothing has been done. The relationship between Zijin Mining and the Shanghang county government is set out in the company prospectus. In the last restructuring, Zijin Mining changed froma state-owned enterprise to a modern shareholder-owned enterprise. However, the largest shareholder is still the Shanghang county government. Many government officials have positions in Zijin Mining and these posts have been disclosed to the media. There are pressures from both above and below. Zhong Wenfang said that he finds being a village cadre is too difficult: &quot;Every day, villagers express their opinions to the village committee, saying, &apos;The air is so terrible! You need to resolvethe drinking water issue!&apos;&quot; The Ting River was originally the life-source of the Hakka people. Now, it has become a burden. Downstream from Bitian, Jiantou village stretches for three kilometres. Here, each household has a well by the river to draw water. The wells are all 20 to 30 years old, but have been abandoned in the last few years \u2013 nobody dares to drink the water now. Ten days ago, another esophageal cancer patient from Bitian died. According to local medical statistics, of 40 people to contract cancer in the village in the past 10 years, 35 have died. Most of them lived in the village closest to Zijin Mountain. The village secretary Huang Jingxin told me that these statistics are &quot;very accurate&quot; and that most of those who died suffered from esophageal cancer, lung cancer and stomach cancer. Many of them went to Beijing and Shanghai for treatment, plunging their families into debt. Ten years ago, there were almost no cancer patients in the village. The Ministry of Health has not published the rate of cancer in China. However, according to statistics produced at the fifth China Oncology conference in 2008, over the past 20 years China&apos;s cancer rate has been between 1% and 1.5%. The cancer rate in Bitian village is three times higher than this and, in the village closest to the mine, it is almost 10 times higher. The villagers say that, before mining started here, cancer was very rare, but since the mining began &quot;most of the deaths have been caused by cancer&quot;. The environmental deterioration of the Ting River basin, which stretches from Zijin Mountain to the Mianhuatan River, has not happened overnight. And alongside this gradual process, mining expansion has continued at an alarming rate. The Zijin Mountain goldmine started operating in 1993, kick starting the area&apos;s industrial development. By 2000, full-scale open pit mining was under way. The Zijin Mountain peak was leveled and turned into a natural workshop for heap leaching and hydrometallurgy. Before this, open-air heap leaching had rarely been practised in southern China. In various interviews, Zijin chairman Chen Jinghe rejected the viewof industry experts that &quot;the south is too humid and rainy for heap leaching and the situation of Zijin Mountain does not lend itself well to this mining process.&quot; The rapid rise of Zijin Mining is proof of the potential for mining low-grade ore. Once, the Zijin gold mine was considered a hard and &quot;tasteless&quot; nut. In normal circumstances, one tonne of ore would need to contain three grams or more of gold before being considered for industrial ore mining. However, most of the ore from Zijin&apos;s mine contains less than one gram of gold per tonne, making low-cost heap leaching a good solution. Today Zijin Mining&apos;s vice-president, Liu Rongchun was manager of mine technology when the company was founded in 1993. In interview with Southern Metropolis Daily, he said that heap leaching in southern China was absolutely doable as long as you choose an appropriate site and protect against waste-water seepage. He said Zijin was using the process to turn something small into something great, and that environmental protection was at the heart of the company&apos;s ethos. Why is environmental protection management so important in heap leaching, even though the process uses known materials? First, an important material used in heap leaching is sodium cyanide, which is a highly toxic substance. Second, it produces a huge amount of waste: one tonne of ore could contain as little as one gram of usable metal. Handling the waste is more challenging than the core extraction process. In 2006, Mining Technology magazine published the article &quot;Zijin mining: exploitation of low-grade and refractory metallurgical mineral resources&quot;, the result of a collaboration between Changchun Gold Research Institute and researchers from Zijin Mining. It mentions that, &quot;Heap leaching of gold is a simple, low-cost method that uses limited mineral processing equipment. Only these methods of mineral processing, namely open-pit mining and carbon in heap leaching methods + (fine orecyanide carbon) are capable of expanding production capacity, reducing operating costs and increasing dressing and smelting recovery rates, in order to expand gold production, increase enterprise profits, lower tailing grades and selected ore grades.&quot; Heap leaching resolves the cost issues associated with low-grade mineral mining. Figures show a linear increase in the estimated gold deposit volume in Zijin Mountain over the last 10 years. From an initial 10 kilograms, the figure had risen to 11.5 tonnes by 2006, a one thousand-fold increase. In close to two years, Zijin Mountain produced around 80 tonnes of gold, making it China&apos;s largest gold mine. The advent of open-air heap leaching allowed production capacity to expand. Meanwhile, the situation in Bitian village gets worse year by year. The village head, Zhong Wenfang said: &quot;I used to think the Ting River was really wide, I never dreamed of ever expanding mines&quot;. The wet copper smelter that caused July&apos;s pollution leak employed the same principles as heap leaching. The copper is located below the layer of gold. Only in the last couple of years has Zijin started to extract it. This wet smelting technology, jointly developed by Zijin Mining and the Beijing General Research Institute for Metals, was given an award by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association and the Gold Association. A researcher from the institute told me that wet copper smelting is a mature technology internationally and the greatest advantage is that you can use low-grade copper. Zijin Mountain is also the first large-scale mine in China to use hydrometallurgy to mine ore. Vice-president Liu Rongchun said this technology has been researched for 10 years and practiced for five. Twenty percent of the world&apos;s copper is produced using bio-hydrometallurgical processes, which can raise the rate of resource utilisation. In fact, if we look to the past, it is a miracle that Zijin Mountain copper is used at all. According to data provided by Zijin Mining, its average copper content is 0.38 grams per tonne. That is to say, from one tonne of ore, only 0.38 grams of copper is extracted, and the remainder is considered waste. China has large quantities of poor-quality ore. Zijin Mining provides a route to low-cost exploitation, and its industry reputation is based on the model &quot;benefit the country, benefit the people and benefit the self&quot;. Previously, Zijin Mining repeatedly stated that hydrometallurgy is a closed process, and there is no possibility of waste-water containing copper efflux. However, a survey of the literature revealed that, within the hydrometallurgical process, and consideringthe particular characteristics of Zijin Mountain ore, there can also be simultaneous leaching of iron and arsenic. These heavy chemicals can accumulate in the leaching solution and reduce production efficiency. During the production process, these byproducts must be carefully managed. Liu Rongchun has confirmed this with Southern Metropolis Daily. He explained that the company has three safeguards to prevent leaks during the leaching process. First, it secures a mat beneath the ore stockpile during heap leaching to prevent seepage. Second, it creates seepage-collection wells, to collect any solution that may have leaked during the heap-leaching of the ore stockpile. Third, to ensure that everything is perfectly safe, the Environmental Protection Bureau of Shanghang County has installed an independent water-quality monitoring device downstream of Zijin Mining&apos;s waste-water discharge point. According to the Environmental Protection Bureau, the pollution accident at the beginning of July was caused by the simultaneous failure of all three safeguards.The seepage collection wells and spillways were &quot;illegally&quot; kept open; however the findings of the investigation did not clarify if the accident was based on subjective intent or an accident. Liu Rongchun said: &quot;On the macro scale, we are very good \u2013 but the problems were unexpectedly caused by small details. This is a profound lesson, reflecting failures of management.&quot; Across the world, hidden behind the wealth created by the mining industry, are problems requiring attention \u2013 and those most in need are the villages closest to the mines. Unfortunately, amid China&apos;s rapid development, these places are still neglected for various reasons. Less than a kilometre from Zijin Mountain, in neighbouring Wuping county, is Yueyangpian village. The metals found here are mainly silver and copper, but there is also gold, lead, zinc, gallium, bismuth and sulphur \u2013 all associated with large-scale deposits of silver polymetallic ore. But the mine set up to exploit these resources has also brought environmental disaster for local residents: as the wealth from mine amasses, the state of the village gradually worsens. This mine was first set up in the 1990s and jointly operated by Sanxin Mining and Ronghe Mining. Their activities cut off groundwater supplies and some of the village farmland could not be irrigated. A government document shows that, at the beginningof 2007, this mine in Wuping County was transferred from Ronghe Mining directly to Zijin Mining by &quot;principle leaders of the county committee of the county governmentand under the efforts of the Land and Resources Bureau&quot; and established as Wuping Zijin. Wuping Zijin became a subsidiary of Zijin Mining Group. According to a 2008 security bulletin published by the company, Zijin Mining owns 77.5% of Wuping Zijin. Wuping county is the second largest shareholder. In a later, expanded version of the environmental impact assessment, the mine was described as showing poor economic returns and having safety issues, including tailings hazardous to downstream villages and the Ting River. &quot;Therefore, the best way is for a strong enterprise to lead exploitation,&quot; it said. Liu Rongchun recalls that Wuping County was not completely comfortable with this mine. As a result, Zijin Mining put in place a careful management plan, improved the rate of resource utilisation and standardised safety and environmental protection features. In the second year after the take-over, Wuping Zijin put forward plans to expand capacity to &quot;daily processing of 2,000 tonnes of ore&quot;. Wuping county government is the second largest shareholder in the mine. The expansion plans fell under the supervision of Wuping county deputy magistrate Wang Yunchuan. Zijin Mining completed its expansion within one year. The environmental impact assessment conducted by the Sanming city Environmental Protection Science Research Unit indicated that the biggest source of pollution wasthe waste-water emitted from tailings, most of which ended up in the Ting River.But it was confident this problem would be dealt with: &quot;The expansion project will impose restrictions on volume of waste-water emitted. Most people in a public survey approved of Zijin&apos;s acquisition and expansion,&quot; the report said. However, Southern Metropolis Daily&apos;s investigations show that this was not the case. After the expansion was completed, pollution was not reduced in line with Zijin&apos;s promises. The new tailings storage facility for the mine in Yueyongpian has been designed to sit on a high slope, and so the water level is higher than most of the village&apos;s buildings. Yueyongpian is made up of three administrative units, including Yueyong village.Their water source is badly polluted. Many villagers told me that the most serious groundwater pollution began the year before last, after the tailings-storage facility wasexpanded. The villagers of Yueyongpian cannot drink the water from old wells, which were in use for several decades; neither can they drink the water from wells dug by individual households. The villagers showed me a pot of boiled well water. On the side there was a thick yellow layer of dirt and it tasted salty. &quot;Before there was any mining, the water was very clear and sweet,&quot; said one old villager, Zhou Rencheng. &quot;Now, after one night, the water gets rusty and tastes foul.&quot; The farmland is also badly polluted. In the 1950s, a set of small reservoirs were set up for irrigation and the water was diverted to the rice paddies with water pipes. After the reservoirs became polluted, the earth on the fields turned black and smelly. The rice takes longer to grow and the crop is stunted. When the villagers go down to the fields, they wear rain boots. If they work barefoot, then their feet will rot. Wuping Zijin has received little attention in comparison with Shanghang Zijin, even though they are only separated by a mountain. The villagers showed me some photographs. When the national press rushed to Shanghang county for interviews, the forked road to Wuping Zijin was blocked by a rock. When I asked Zijin Mining about the current status of Wuping Zijin&apos;s many metal mines, the response was: &quot;There has been no pollution of the Ting River, or in the surrounding areas.&quot; Vice president Liu Rongchun added: &quot;Of course, development has an effect on its surroundings, however so far this has been within an acceptable extent.&quot; Liu Rongchun said that each mine is assessed before acquisition. However, this assessment is not satisfactory. In 2009, a group from Yueyongpian village formed to put forward their misgivings about the mine and representatives of Wuping County came to the village for a meeting. The village team leader and village cadres also took part. The people all said that the water tasted bad. But the conclusion reached by the county cadres was that there was nothing wrong with the water and it was drinkable. To this day, the villagers have still not seen a public report on water-quality testing done by the Environmental Protection Bureau. Not far from the expanded mine are villagers whose existence and environment are coming under increasing pressure. At Yueyang, just a fraction of the village&apos;s original lands are still capable of supporting a farming lifestyle. Work in the mines is also very dangerous. Gold and silver are toxic materials. Every villager knows this. Zhou Yonghong, a 42-year old local, worked at a small, private mine nearby. One day, he lost his footing and fell into the cyanide pool. He died on his way to hospital. The mine paid out compensation. When Zijin Mining built the tailings-storage facility at Yueyong, it attracted strong opposition from local villagers. Then they built a tailings dam for Wuping Zijin. This was the fourth time that they requisitioned land during this period and the price on offer had risen \u2013 from 12,000 yuan per mu (around 667 square metres) to 25,000 yuan per mu. At that time, villager Lin Meiying still owned seven plots of land. When land for the dam was being requisitioned, the county and town sent workers to her home every day. She did not let them in. But her brother-in-law, a teacher at a middle school in Wuping, was told he would be fired if his older brother and wife didn&apos;t agree to sell their land and so she gave in. When she went to town to have the sale certified, she stopped to apply for work in the mine as, along with her land, she had lost her source of income. But Wuping Zijin told her that, at 44 years old, she was too old for thework. The 100 mu of farmland here has turned into the biggest source of pollution in the village. At the entry port to the tailings-storage facility, there is a large sign saying: &quot;Tailings storage facility, entry forbidden&quot;. But, in reality, the villagers have not all moved away and the tailings storage facility is already in use. Hu Biaoyang even lives within the facility&apos;s grounds. According to company plans, his house will eventually be submerged. But Hu doesn&apos;t have anywhere to build a new house and doesn&apos;t want to move, and so he has made two demands: the first is that the facility will not affect his current standard of living and the second is that, once the land is requisitioned, his future living will be safeguarded. Hu Biaoyang does not have any relatives who are teachers or civil servants and the two sides are at a stalemate. From time to time, workers come and try to persuade him to give up, saying that Wuping Zijin is a state-owned company, the backbone of Wuping and the area&apos;s biggest taxpayer. Hu Biaoyang has kept some pictures of the site of the tailings-storage facility before it was flooded: a green rice field in the summer and yellow withered stalks after the winter reaping. Now it is just stagnant water; even the mosquitoes avoid it. Some villagers&apos; graves were not moved in time and have also been submerged under the reservoir. The wells in front of the houses are gone too and the reservoir water will soon flood his house. During my visit, the villagers looked out on this stagnant water in consternation.They still remember their feelings of reluctance about the project. They have filmed the farmland and made dvds as something to remember their home by. But they also know that, even if the water receded, the fields could not be cultivated. For fish farms downstream, pollution from mining means economic losses. For the villagers of Yueyang and Bitian, meanwhile, it is a challenge to their basic right to life. Even small-scale mining can produce serious pollution. The people of Yueyang told me that, for half an hour every day, their village is enveloped in acrid smoke from the privately owned Jinshi mine nearby. Ten years of mining has turned Yueyang into a &quot;cancer village&quot;. There are more than 3,000 people living in the three administrative villages of the Yueyang area. In the past five years, about 60 to 70 cancer patients have died in these villages, many of them married couples or siblings. The youngest cancer patient is only 18 years old. Southern Metropolis Daily obtained a detailed case list. The most common causes of death were stomach cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer. Guan Yangwen and Guan Shengwen were brothers. They died in 2002 and 2006 respectively. Last year, their sister was diagnosed with leukemia.Guan Zhongwen and Lin Jindi were a married couple. Guan died of stomach and liver cancer and Lin breast cancer. Their only child was orphaned. Zhou Renxi and Qiu Yongzhao, also a couple, were both killed by cancer. Lin Meiying&apos;s father, Lin Zhanqin, his sister&apos;s parents-in-law, Zhong Xiuzi and Wen Dengchun, and his father&apos;s older brother \u2013 all of them died of cancer.The villagers have received no compensation: it is very difficult to prove the connection between cancer rates and environmental degradation, and difficult too to determine where the main responsibility lies, as the mine has been operated by three mining enterprises. Twenty year-old Zhou Meifang grew up on this land. At 18, she went to medical school in the city. Last year, when she returned to Wuping for National Day, she fell ill and was diagnosed with leukemia at the local hospital, which sent her to Fuzhou for treatment. Three weeks later, she died. Her mother did everything she could, borrowing 20,000 yuan (US$3,000) from family and friends for treatment, but the doctors were unable to save her. Steeped in debt, her family faces a troubled future. The villagers from Yueyang even envy villagers elsewhere who have lost their land. Those living under the shadow of cancer are not able to seek compensation. And, as much as they want to move away from their polluted homesteads, they have nowhere to go. \u2022\u00a0Yang Chuanmin is a reporter at Southern Metropolis Daily, and joint winner of the in-depth reporting category at the 2011 China Environmental Press Awards. \u2022\u00a0This article was first published by Southern Metropolis Daily on September 1, 2010.", "tags": ["Mining", "Environment", "Energy", "Pollution"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-14T11:08:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/apr/14/synthetic-biology-pathogens-china", "sentences": ["One of the scientists in the audience was Professor Zhao Guoping, director of the synthetic biology laboratory at the Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences."], "title": "How do synthetic biologists keep the support of the public?", "article": "The science minister, David Willetts, gave an address this morning to an international gathering of researchers who are in London for a symposium on synthetic biology. The event is a UK-US-Chinese collaboration, bringing together the science and engineering academies from those three countries. Willetts took the opportunity \u2013 as he should \u2013 to bang the drum for British science and promote the not-so-bad funding settlement that science research achieved in the comprehensive spending review. He emphasised that Britain was serious about blue skies research as well as those projects directed more keenly at commercial applications. Willetts went on to raise the issue of public support for synthetic biology and the need to keep in mind the concerns that come up in discussion groups. He drew on a public dialogue report published last year (pdf here) that goes through some of these. To quote one passage he picked on from that document:  Enabling scientists to reflect on motivations was deemed very important. What is the purpose? Why are you doing it? What are you going to gain? What else will it do? How [do] you know you are right? These are five central questions at the heart of public concerns in this area. It should be incumbent on scientists to consider them.   &quot;I think we can deal with these issues, but it&apos;s very important we remain aware and sensitive to them,&quot; he said. I asked Willetts whether government had learned anything from this country&apos;s miserable experience with GM crops, an industry effectively crushed in the UK by lobby groups that appear to take an anticapitalist and antiglobalisation stance. Certainly the GM fiasco was fuelled by the view that many first generation crops would have benefited only those multinational companies trying to sell them.  With synthetic biology \u2013 a largely academic pursuit \u2013 the goals have clearer, more palatable goals: to produce green fuels or create new medicines. &quot;The development of synthetic biology has so far avoided those mistakes,&quot; Willetts said. One of the scientists in the audience was Professor Zhao Guoping, director of the synthetic biology laboratory at the Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences. Prof Zhao asked Willetts about the prospects of a UK-Chinese collaboration on synthetic biology. Such a deal looks likely: Willetts is heading out to China in a couple of months and agreed to put this on the agenda. I spoke to Prof Zhao about the kind of collaboration he&apos;d like to see. &quot;In China, synthetic biology is a developing science in a developing country,&quot; he said. &quot;International collaboration is very important to make [the field] develop quickly and efficiently, to transform it into an industry.&quot; He sees the collaboration being one where intellectual property is shared among partners.  Zhao talked about the need for common international standards for the organic bits and pieces that synthetic biologists want to use as components in their products. But agreed standards for security and ethical issues surrounding synthetic biology are also desirable. The potential dangers of synthetic biology are often raised and rarely underplayed in the media, but Prof Zhao sees this as a crucial matter for scientists to tackle head-on.  The cloning of Dolly the Sheep led to a ripple of fears that people were next, that long-dead tyrants might be replicated, Boys from Brazil-style, or that vaguely scary cult leaders might embark on their own experiments. There are more realistic concerns with synthetic biology, Zhao said.  &quot;For cloning a human, practically we are talking a couple of centuries for that and it is relatively easy to control. But for synthetic biology, if I really want to work on a virus that can attack something I can go and do it,&quot; Zhao said. &quot;If some crazy guy wants to make a new pathogen you can say that he can&apos;t be so smart to create something from nothing. He&apos;ll copy some known pathogen. We should do research on the present and even extinct pathogens to understand them and know how to treat them so we are well prepared,&quot; he added. &quot;This is the most important issue for synthetic biology.&quot; Back in 2005, US researchers used the tools of synthetic biology to recreate the 1918 Spanish flu virus. China is set to become a major player in synthetic biology. The country was the first to make totally synthetic insulin nearly 50 years ago and has built up world class experience in genomics and chemistry. Since 2005, synthetic biology has gained more explicit funding, to explore &quot;cell factories&quot; and more recently to isolate and characterise biological parts and modules that will act as building blocks for new products. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is now preparing a strategy for synthetic biology to span the next ten years. Britain is well-placed to benefit from a collaboration with China. This country was slow off the mark with synthetic biology, but has done much to catch up. Teaming up with China, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, would give added impetus to a field that looks set to reap major scientific and financial rewards. We have an opportunity.

The economy grew by 9.7% in the first three months of the year, down from 9.8% in the fourth quarter, but faster than market forecasts. Consumer prices in March rose 5.4% year on year, the highest in 32 months and well above February&apos;s 4.9% increase, according to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics. Officials believe controlling inflation is crucial to maintaining stability and have raised interest rates four times and increased reserve ratios six times since October. &quot;Despite the most aggressive period of tightening in years, the government cannot seem to slow the economy down,&quot; said Alistair Thornton of IHS Global Insight. &quot;Beijing has had to regularly revert to heavy-handed administrative measures, such as direct price controls in the food sector and limits on house purchases in the property market, in order to contain inflationary pressure. With inflation expectations still running high and prices at disconcerting levels, the government will need to press on with its tightening schedule.&quot; Standard Chartered said it was raising its full-year growth estimate from 8.5% to 9.3% because of the news. But Wang Jin, an analyst with Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai, told Reuters: &quot;The economic figures in the first quarter are strong, but still within market expectations. I don&apos;t think the economy faces risks of overheating and the growth momentum will slow down in coming months. &quot;The central bank will stick with its tightening stance and we expect more increases in reserve requirements and interest rates.&quot; On Wednesday, the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao vowed that Beijing would use &quot;every means&quot; to get inflation under control. He gave his strongest hint yet that the government will allow greater appreciation of the yuan. He said Beijing would &quot;further improve the yuan exchange rate mechanism and increase yuan exchange rate flexibility to eliminate inflationary monetary conditions&quot; along with other policy measures such as adjusting interest rates and ratio requirements. Analysts expect inflation to peak again in June but wane in the second half of the year. The 11.7% rise in food costs reflected growing demand, a shrinking pool of young workers \u2013 pushing up agricultural wages \u2013 and supply chain problems, said Arthur Kroeber of economic consultancy GaveKal-Dragonomics. &quot;In public, the officials like to talk about commodity prices, because it is always easier to blame problems on something outside,&quot; he said. &quot;But if you look at what they are actually doing, I think it is pretty clearly understood that the sources of inflation are domestic.&quot; That required tighter monetary policy and market reforms to improve efficiency, he said. Standard Chartered said it was clear that non-food items were also fuelling inflation. &quot;The headache for Beijing policymakers will get worse as headline growth continues to slow in Q2, while inflation remains stubbornly high,&quot; Stephen Green, Li Wei and Shen Wan predicted in a note. Earlier this year, Wen said China would target 7% growth over the next five years, rather than 8% as it has done previously. That was a signal of intent rather than a prediction: the country regularly overshoots its targets by a long way. Last year, growth hit 10.3%, thanks to an 11.9% spurt in the first quarter. China has long vowed to rebalance its economy so that domestic consumption reduces its reliance on exports and investment. These latest statistics offered some cause for hope, with consumption contributing 5.9 percentage points to first quarter growth and investment 4.3 percentage points, with net exports reducing the total slightly. Kroeber said: &quot;There&apos;s a consumption component that&apos;s very strong, but the retail sales number is going down. If you look at auto sales, they&apos;ve slowed down a lot. Consumer confidence surveys show it has progressively weakened over the last six months .... The headline number is implausibly strong.&quot; He said the data did not allow analysts to judge what was happening to consumer spending. China has just recorded its first quarterly trade deficit since 2004, but analysts think that reflects the soaring cost of the commodities it imports. It is still expected to record a large surplus over the year as a whole. President Hu Jintao told a business forum in Hainan, southern China that the country&apos;s economic model still needed adjustment. &quot;Over the next five years, China will make a great effort to boost domestic demand, especially consumer demand,&quot; he said.

What you&apos;re left with is music like Touch: slow, drifting electronica, marked by glitches, with an almost church-like atmosphere that has led some to describe it as &quot;ambient goth&quot;, an affecting mix of spectral sonics and ghostly vocals, as un-earthy as it is unearthly. ARGENTINA     The flag of Argentina     ZonaindieVioleta Castillo - La Batalla Del Movimiento  Violeta is a young and promising singer-songwriter from Buenos Aires who just released her first recordings in the form of two EPs, Uno and Otro. La Batalla Del Movimiento is a sweet pop ballad with great arrangements, thanks to her collaboration with a great band called Monoambiente. You can listen to both EPs and buy the MP3s from her Bandcamp page. AUSTRALIA       Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Khancoban - Until It Takes You Over  Sure there are big drums and meandering atmospherics that do tab out a few pages of Neon Bible, but Khancoban manage to verge on &apos;epic&apos; without coming out too overtly pomp. For what it lacks in lyrical diversity, it makes up for in delivery - a steady build that abruptly cuts off after only three minutes. New album Arches Over The Sun drops in July. Until then, this one will be a good excuse to wake up early and mull over my cereal to. BRAZIL       Meio DesligadoLu\u00edsa Maita - Lero-Lero  Lero-Lero is the minimalist samba that opens the debut album from singer Lu\u00edsa Maita. It&apos;s a song that calmly grows, almost without you noticing - her soft voice takes you to a special place in your head and suddenly you&apos;re just dancing and singing along with her. This track is also available for free download on Bandcamp. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicDora Alexander - Travelers  Yes, Dora Alexander sound just like a version of Radiohead that ceased to exist somewhere between The Bends and OK Computer. But you know what? It&apos;s been about a decade and a half since then, so it&apos;s probably safe for someone else to claim that sound. And, as Travelers - both this song and their debut EP of the same name - demonstrates, Dora Alexander are ready to pick up that mantle. Here&apos;s hoping they stick with it a little longer than the originators. CHILE       Super 45DeMentira - Post-Tbc  Ariel Altamirano, the DJ and producer better known as DeMentira, is the founder of Chilean netlabel Discos Pegaos, specializing in electronic music and abstract beats. The label was responsible for debut albums by Vaskular and Motivado as well the release of Chinpanc\u00e9 EP, first solo effort from DeMentira since his introduction as producer and rapper for the trio Iris in 2006. Post-Tbc is the first single from Chinpanc\u00e9 EP where we find mysterious beats, not dissimilar to dubstep, as well the experimental nature of the wonky sound. CHINA       WooozyFriend Or Foe - Snorting Clorox  Friend Or Foe are a secretive, occasionally masked rock trio who have been tearing up the Shanghai scene lately with their brand of fun-filled, balls-out rock. Preferring to keep their identities a secret, the band promulgate the myth that they are in fact three illegitimate demons, raised in Heaven: guitarist and vocalist Rabshakeh and often topless drummer Mahanehdan are joined by bassist Bill. COLOMBIA     Flag of Colombian      Colombia UrbanaJiggy Drama - Me Vale  Jiggy Drama is a musical phenomenon in Latin America. His &apos;Nerdside&apos; style has the total attention of radio stations and nightclubs, generating an internet boom with his urban alternative music. His most recent single, Me Vale, is a Cumbia fusion with some Caribbean sounds. DENMARK       All ScandinavianFrederik Teige - You Always Tried To Pull Us Down  He&apos;s been touring with Efterklang since 2007, but thankfully singer, songwriter and guitarist Frederik Teige has also found time to write and record material of his own. The climax so far is his self-released full-length debut Body God - nine songs worth of awesome alternative pop - which you can get for as much as you feel like paying (free is even an option) on Bandcamp. ESTONIA       PopopMimicry - Godspeed  Aggressive and arrogant, otherworldly and expressive, Mimicry fuses electroclash with psychedelic techno, ethnic beats and garage rock. Their aim: to produce perfectly mindblowing party music and provoke emotions never felt before. FINLAND       GlueNT&apos;s White Trash - Whistle  The most recognizable Brit in Finnish indie, Nick Triani, put together NT&apos;s White Trash with the aim of making some noise, which is captured in the band&apos;s debut Mourning Becomes Electric due in May. Whistle is a catchy two-and-a-half minute guitar-pop song, with an uplifting\u2026 well, whistling. It is a smooth exception on an album that promises some edgier sounds. FRANCE       Yet You&apos;re FiredThomas Kieffer - Summertime  Thomas Kieffer is a talented songwriter, offspring of the Strasbourg rock scene. At 15 years old, he was hugely impressed by bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple and started playing in different bands. Today, at 35, his resum\u00e9 is very impressive: he has opened for legendary artists such as Canned Heat, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Gary Moore, NOFX and Scorpions. He started a solo career two years ago, giving up on hard rock and metal, and should succeed with it and his album Beautiful Hands. GERMANY       BlogparteiJoasihno - Von  Joasihno&apos;s songs benefit a lot from his percussionist skills and his open-mindedness for playful but cautious arrangements. His wanderlust is almost tangible as he sings, although he is deeply rooted in Bavaria. Von is taken from his forthcoming debut We Say: Oh Well which is being released on Kyr Records. GREECE       Mouxlaloulouda2L8 - Don&apos;t Follow Me  2L8&apos;s music lurches deftly between emotional intimacy, ambition and experimentation. Their two well-received previous releases (download them for free here) proved they are one of the most creative and compelling acts in the musical underground. They are running a campaign on Pledge Music to help them unleash their forthcoming double album, New Battles, Without Honor And Humanity. The magnificent Don&apos;t Follow Me, a Music Alliance Pact exclusive, drips with melancholy. It blends warmth and brooding, existential contemplation with a repetitive but mesmerizing acoustic guitar melody full of subtlety and distinct sonic accents, and swims in gorgeous sheets of trembling, passionate vocals. ICELAND       Icelandic Music MaffiaSk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld - Kva\u00f0ning  Sk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld is a metal band formed in August 2009. The six members had been formerly active in other bands, not all metal. Their music can be described as powerful, melodic and epic Viking metal, along with various folk influences. The lyrics follow the strict rules of traditional Icelandic poetry. Kva\u00f0ning is featured on last year&apos;s debut record Baldur, a concept album telling the epic and dramatic tale of the viking Baldur. INDIA       IndiecisionPentagram - Tomorrow&apos;s Decided  Pentagram is one of India&apos;s biggest acts. The band has been around for the better part of the past two decades, creating music that&apos;s always been a contemporary, cutting edge reflection of the generation it is part of. The band recently released its fourth studio album Bloodywood, arguably its most evolved work yet. Tomorrow&apos;s Decided uses a traditional, folk-based drum beat and surrounds it with quintessential, soaring Pentagram electro-rock goodness to create four of the most intensely exciting minutes you&apos;re going to have today. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarGugun Blues Shelter - White Dog  Gugun Blues Shelter is probably one of Indonesia&apos;s best exports, with recognition from the blues community in Europe, USA, Asia and Australia. The band have played at international events such as the Belfast Big River Blues and Jazz Festival and Great British R&amp;B Festival. And no big festival in Indonesia would be complete without them. IRELAND       Nialler9SertOne - Past Present Future  Reminscent of RJD2, J Dilla and all those fine beat maestros that no doubt inspired him, Liverpool via Portadown&apos;s SertOne aka 21-year-old Gareth McAlinden is certainly a producer to watch. This tune contains a unique Belfast sample, twisted brass and a head-nodding beat that makes you sit up and take notice. You can find it on the recent seven-track The View From Above EP through Melted Music. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelGevolt - Bay Mir Bistu Sheyn  Yiddish metal pioneers Gevolt took this 1932 Yiddish musical track (that incidentally was a big hit in Nazi Germany until they figured out it was Yiddish) and made glorious metal out of it. Their sound resembles a happy-go-lucky Rammstein/Linkin Park hybrid with violins. But since a lot of their songs are versions of the old ones my grandmothers sing, they have an unmatched nostalgic beauty. Download their second album Alef Base for free while you still can at their site. ITALY       PolaroidLove Boat - You Know I Really Want You  These guys from Sardinia are probably more known around Europe than in Italy. That&apos;s how bad this country has gotten. Anyway, they have a new album on the German label Alien Snatch and a 7&quot; EP on Shit Music For Shit People. This song comes from the latter&apos;s B-side. Grab everything and start to dance a wild garage party - this is good rock &apos;n&apos; roll. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaToy Selectah - No Pasma feat. Isa GT  In the last decade, Cumbia has become the &apos;lingua franca&apos; to fill Latin-oriented dancefloors worldwide. Its saucy rhythms and nasty grooves easily adapt to many other musical forms: from techno to reggae, passing through favela-funk or dubstep. With a career spanning 15 years (and dreadlocks nearly that long), Toy Selectah has earned respect as a Cumbia-lord, trading the genre and cross-pollinating it with his constant travels and after-hours gigs. His Mex Machine EP out on Diplo&apos;s Mad Decent label is an infectious state of affairs. On No Pasma, the Colombia-born, London-dwelling singer Isa GT throws some cocksure chants on a perfect groundshaking Cumbia. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamDeath Letters - Your Heart Is Upside Down  It&apos;s nice to see a bit of international buzz building for a young Dutch band. This duo aren&apos;t even legal to enjoy a good piss-up in Texas, which is where they headed last year to record an album with Chris &apos;Frenchie&apos; Smith (Jet, The Dandy Warhols, Smog) and where they returned to for SXSW last month. The resulting album, Post-Historic, isn&apos;t the band&apos;s first effort but it&apos;s markedly different from their self-titled debut. Here they leave behind their original blues-rock trappings and fire through Glassjaw post-hardcore, Biffy Clyro post-grunge and ...Trail Of Dead post-rock &apos;n&apos; roll. That may be a lot of &apos;posts&apos; but they make an incredibly energetic yet refined racket on stage. NEW ZEALAND       Einstein Music JournalGhost Wave - Sunsetter  Ghost Wave hits you like a motorik wall of noise, with its hypnotic waves of reverb guitar, mechanical drums and atmospherics. Matt Paul&apos;s project started after his solo electronic act Street Beat gave way to this united front, with drummer Eammon Logan, guitarist Rikki Sutton and bassist Alex Grant. Live they&apos;re enigmatic with tightly wound, ravaged Clean-style hooks and perfectly warped pop songs. Their debut EP was released earlier this month on Arch Hill. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceBeatbully - B\u00f8lleboogie  Beatbully is an offspring of the Norwegian skweee label D\u00f8dpop. Skweee is a genre of Nordic heritage, based on classic hip hop beats with heavy influence of modern electronica. Although mainly composed for a live audience, Beatbully invites skweee to your living room as well. This winter, he released Kosmisk Regn (&quot;Cosmic Rain&quot;), the first solo album in D\u00f8dpop&apos;s history. B\u00f8lleboogie has an irresistible beat that leaves no one behind on the dancefloor, and the juicy melody won&apos;t release you till its over. It&apos;s a three-minute piece of bliss that will make even your grandmother dance. PERU       SoTBKuraka - Fuego Negro  Kuraka is a rock group that spawned from the collaboration of renowned musicians of local bands such as Emergency Blanket, Zen, M.A.S.A.C.R.E. and Inyectores. The diversity of styles seemed an obstacle to assemble their ideas, but the bonds of friendship led to them making something interesting. In 2009, they released a few singles that whetted the appetite for their debut album Fuego Negro, which came out in August 2010 on Mundane Records. Take a listen to the great song that gives the album its name. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?They&apos;re Heading West  - My Case Is A Different One  They&apos;re Heading West are three singers/composers (Jo\u00e3o Correia, Francisca Cortes\u00e3o, Mariana Ricardo) and a drummer (S\u00e9rgio Nascimento) who decided to get together and play songs from their bands and solo projects. They only have one set of songs, recorded live at a national radio station, which is not yet available commercially. The song featured this month is, therefore, a MAP exclusive as a free download. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseParachute Pulse - Hopscptch  Parachute Pulse is the brand new project of Ana Roman. Her debut album, Kingdom, is a collection of cinematic sounds, moods and emotions. The album is available for free download on her label&apos;s page, Asiluum. Hopscptch is a collaboration with Res Es of Semiosis, who were featured in the Music Alliance Pact back in May 2009. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopSebastian Dangerfield - You Played Your Part, Singer!  Sebastian Dangerfield are a four-piece from Edinburgh who are little-known even in their home city. But that shouldn&apos;t be the case for much longer if the band continue to show such an accomplished grasp of Americana-tinged folk-rock amplified with a healthy dose of scuzzy-pop zest and various stringed instruments. The wonderfully-named You Played Your Part, Singer! is taken from their new EP, The Sound Of The Old Machines, which you can find on Bandcamp. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...DJ Koflow - Make Your Hands Clap, Toes Clap  DJ Koflow is one of Singapore&apos;s most celebrated DJs. His claim to fame started when he won the national DMC Championship in 2003, and he continued to skyrocket by receiving many honourable mentions in local and international media. He dropped his debut album The Turntable Instrumentalist despite a heavy production and performance schedule, with the record speaking volumes of his myriad influences. Jazz, hip hop, funk and soul all seamlessly flow together in the hands of one of the country&apos;s brightest mix masters. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Battle Beyond The Stars - The Desert  Philip Kramer, aka Battle Beyond The Stars, is a Cape Town-based DJ and producer. He is best known for his unique blend of electro, French house and unusual tracks that no DJ in their right mind would play in public. He recently released an EP entitled Memory which gave his awaiting fans a concrete collection of songs. With his new offering The Desert, he injects his signature sound to create a shimmering, synth-infused song that shows off his immense talent with its subtly. For his latest work download and have a listen to Drifter&apos;s Theme. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKNeon Bunny - Long-D  Yoojin Lim is the sole member of Neon Bunny, who debuted with an album called Seoulight in late March. Having been a session keyboardist for successful power-pop act The Black Skirts - the very first South Korean MAP contribution - her own sound is on the electro side, influenced by Ladyhawke and Phoenix. Long-D is a semi-catchy track with something of a retro sound. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerDisco Las Palmeras! - La Casa Cuartel  Disco Las Palmeras! are a three-piece band from Galicia, hometown of related acts such as Franc3s, Mequetrefe or Tri\u00e1ngulo de Amor Bizarro and cradle of the new Spanish noise wave. La Casa Cuartel opens their debut album, Nihil Obstat, released earlier this year. The song is about a terrorist strike on a police station and features hypnotic drums and suffocating guitar riffs that recall exactly the same feelings the lyrics talk about: fear and anxiety. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseSummer Heart - Please Stay  It&apos;s almost spring which means summer is still a while away. But we can dream, can&apos;t we? That&apos;s where this song from Malm\u00f6-based band Summer Heart comes in. It&apos;s called Please Stay, but with its Beach Boys harmonies, groovy beat and summer feeling, it may as well be the band&apos;s coup d&apos;\u00e9tat. SWITZERLAND       78sPamela M\u00e9ndez - Bubble Bubble  Bubble Bubble is the first single from Pamela M\u00e9nedez&apos;s critically-acclaimed debut album I Will Be Loved, released in February. The Bern resident, whose father is Mexican, belongs to a new breed of female singer-songwriters popping up in nearly every Swiss town. Heidi Happy, Sophie Hunger, Lena Fennell and Lea Lu are others to check out. UNITED STATES     Flag of the USA     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingSupreme Cuts - Amnesia  Chicago&apos;s Supreme Cuts describe their sound as &quot;future R&amp;B&quot; - a perfect name for the sample and bass-heavy slow grooves they weave into their songs. Amnesia is perhaps their most supreme cut, a ridiculously addictive head trip that could soundtrack a nightclub as easily as it could an R Kelly video from the 90s. VENEZUELA       M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sUnos Infames - Pagando Es Que Se Puede  You could say that Unos Infames is just another rock band. But no. To hear and see them live you will realize that their strength on stage belongs to a mega band. Unos Infames, who formed in Barcelona, Anzo\u00e1tegui, is made up of experienced musicians who fuse some blues influences with controversial lyrics.

Forget even the adjustable rear wing and Kers which have transformed Formula One. The most important feature of the race game this season is getting to grips with the tyres. Pirelli took over from Bridgestone this year with the brief to make highly degradable rubber and increase the number of pit stops. Australia was an anticlimax but in Malaysia the rubber melted and teams made two, three and sometimes four stops. It was mayhem in the pitlane but there was also plenty of drama. And the most successful teams got their tyre changes down to just two and a half seconds. On the heavy-breaking Shanghai circuit tyres will once again be the major topic of conversation as teams devise different strategies and hope those will not be shredded as frequently as their rubber was in Malaysia. Paul Hembery, Pirelli&apos;s motorsport director, said: &quot;So far I&apos;m very pleased with the way that our tyres have helped the show, but I&apos;m always impressed by the way that the teams and drivers learn so quickly. &quot;The input we had was to produce two or three stops. Four is maybe one too many; two to three, depending on the circuit, seems about right. We have accurately predicted two pit stops in Australia and three in Malaysia but we&apos;ll have to wait before having a completely clear idea of what to expect in China.&quot; There are four tyre compounds for dry weather: supersoft, soft, medium and hard. Of these, only two can be used per race and in China the choice is once again soft and hard. &quot;Melbourne was not a surprise because it was always known as a difficult circuit for overtaking,&quot; Hembery said. &quot;Sepang being a much wider, open circuit gave them more than 30 overtaking manoeuvres so it was an exciting race considering it wasn&apos;t wet. Often you get an interesting race in Sepang when the heavens open up.&quot; At Shanghai, Hembery is predicting that the soft tyres will last 13 laps and the hard tyres 20. But he is expecting teams to become more refined with their strategies and to reduce the number of stops they make. As they design their cars better, and their drivers show more sensitivity for their wheels, the aim will be to cut the number of stops down to one. Hamilton, for one, will be hoping to avoid his problems in Malaysia, where he had a spat with his team after he had to go into the pits four times and complained about how quickly the tyres degraded. &quot;The tyres have to wear,&quot; said Hembery. &quot;It still needs a lot of skill because if you get it wrong you&apos;re back to a one-stop strategy. We&apos;ve got 20 different circuits, 12 types of chassis and 24 different drivers, so there are a lot of variables in there. You can see the difference between drivers and the difference between chassis, so there are elements out of our control.&quot; Ferrari&apos;s Fernando Alonso believes the drivers have got used to the different performance of the tyres in the opening two races. &quot;In Australia people did two stops and even one stop, which was a surprise,&quot; he said. &quot;In Malaysia we were ready for two, [not] for three, for four, we saw some different strategies from different teams. And now I think the racing will be better because we know the tyres. We are all more ready.&quot; Some are not convinced. The seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher said: &quot;After Australia and Malaysia, once again we have a very different type of circuit at Shanghai, so it&apos;s still going to be a steep learning curve. &quot;In terms of tyre wear, Shanghai should be more forgiving than Malaysia, with temperatures generally being a lot lower and the surface smoother. In general the performance of the Pirelli tyres is good, but learning how to control the window during which they are at their best is the big challenge.&quot; But for Hembery the big success story has not come from the major teams, Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren. He gives top marks to Sauber, whose Sergio P\u00e9rez managed to complete the opening race of the season in Melbourne while making just one stop. &quot;Sauber have most impressed me so far. It was very interesting how they managed that one-stop strategy. And Sauber is generally using the tyres very well, with their set-up, balance, weight distribution, the loads on the tyres, and driving style. It&apos;s the full combination.&quot;  How to spot which tyre is being used Pirelli Pzero supply the Formula One teams with six different types of tyre - four compounds of dry tyre in addition to a wet and an intermediate which are available in one compound. Here Pirelli&apos;s motorsport director, Paul Hembery, explains which is which 1: Supersoft (red logos on the sidewall) &quot;This tyre gives lots of grip over just a few laps. It probably won&apos;t be used as often as the other tyres but it will be devastatingly effective when it is.&quot; 2: Soft (yellow logos) &quot;This tyre gets up to temperature very quickly and it&apos;s very drivable. It delivers everything you would expect a soft tyre to do and it&apos;s durable as well, with good balance and grip.&quot; 3: Medium (white logos) &quot;Reliability is the watchword here. It takes a little longer to get the temperature up but once it has warmed up properly it is very versatile. A complex tyre to develop, it has to work well under a wide window of track and weather conditions.&quot; 4: Hard (silver logos) &quot;The opposite of the supersoft, this is very durable but capable of good performance at the same time. It takes longer to reach its peak operating temperature and is best for long stints.&quot; 5: Intermediate (blue logos) &quot;Designed to work in a wide variety of situations, their role is much more versatile than those of the wet tyres. This was one of the most tricky tyres to develop.&quot; 6: Wet (orange logos) &quot;The strongest area here is the amount of water they are capable of dispersing. In the past year or so we seem to have experienced an increased number of wet races and they all tend to result in exciting situations, so this is a very important tyre.&quot;", "tags": ["Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Fernando Alonso", "Michael Schumacher", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2011"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-15T19:56:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/16/sebastian-vettel-f1-chinese-gp", "sentences": ["Sebastian Vettel stormed to his third pole position of the season and the 18th of his career and immediately said: &quot;The race will be easy tomorrow.&quot; OK, the German was really talking his tyre choices but he could well have been talking about the race itself because after another scintillating weekend, in which he also topped all three practice sessions in Shanghai, the world champion&apos;s confidence has never been higher."], "title": "Sebastian Vettel continues F1 dominance with Chinese GP pole", "article": "Sebastian Vettel stormed to his third pole position of the season and the 18th of his career and immediately said: &quot;The race will be easy tomorrow.&quot; OK, the German was really talking his tyre choices but he could well have been talking about the race itself because after another scintillating weekend, in which he also topped all three practice sessions in Shanghai, the world champion&apos;s confidence has never been higher. Jenson Button will be second on the grid for Sunday&apos;s race, his best qualifying performance of the year, while Lewis Hamilton will start in third. But there was misery for Vettel&apos;s team-mate Mark Webber, who failed to get into the second qualifying round after tyre and electrical problems. He will start back in 18th place. For the third time in as many races, Paul di Resta out-qualified his Force India running mate Adrian Sutil. And he showed an Ayrton Senna-like quality in the way he nipped out for a late run to nip into Q3 with only seconds remaining. Sutil, who was 11th, just missed out on the final shoot-out. He has raced in 73 Grands Prix while this is the British driver&apos;s rookie season. Di Resta will start in eighth place. There were more, predictable contrasting fortunes with Mercedes. Nico Rosberg qualified in fourth, 10 places ahead of his team-mate Michael Schumacher, who at one point looked to be struggling to get into Q2. But, once again, Vettel is the main man. He said afterwards: &quot;I&apos;m very happy with the way the weekend has gone. But it is a shame for Mark, who has had a tough few days. &quot;Obviously we did it again but I try to remind myself and the team that every time is tough.

Louis Vuitton handbags are a &quot;must have&quot; (but not necessarily among football fans) and sales of the latest Volkswagen Golf GTi are buoyant. Welcome to Communist China in the second decade of the 21st century. A new research project suggests that football, cars and fashion are what intrigue the Chinese most about Europe. Next up is perfume, historical sites, music, film, nature, technology and beer. More than 3,000 Chinese citizens were asked how they see Europeans and the European Union as part of a project known as Chinese Views of the EU, funded by \u00a31.4m from the European Commission&apos;s research support programme. The programme is being led by the University of Nottingham working with researchers in universities in Beijing, Leiden in the Netherlands and Bremen in Germany. The researchers point out that consumerism hasn&apos;t completely taken over Chinese consciousness, as more than half of the respondents said they like European ideas of democracy. But there may still be some way to go: when respondents were asked to name European historical figures they knew, Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and Karl Marx topped the list. While the main part of the study concentrated on the city dwellers, a separate survey of 700 or so government officials, NGOs, business people and media people showed better knowledge of the EU. &quot;The greater the knowledge of European procedures, the greater the tendency to be positive about the EU,&quot; says Richard Pascoe, consultant to and former director of Nottingham University&apos;s China Policy Institute. &quot;The survey suggests that if we engage more effectively with Chinese people, they will have a more positive view of Europe.&quot; Beckham may not have made it on to the list of historical figures, but the Chinese are certainly seduced by the magnetism of his instantly recognisable image. &quot;Premier League and European Champions League have been beamed into bars as well as homes across China for some time,&quot; says Pascoe, who set up the project three years ago. Replica shirts with footballers Wayne Rooney and Lionel Messi&apos;s names on the back are worn, as well as woven, in China. Dr Jasmine Zhang Li, a research fellow at Nottingham University&apos;s School of Contemporary Chinese Studies, says there is a rapidly growing urban middle class with spending power. &quot;Louis Vuitton handbags are mostly bought by Chinese tourists. Like anything with a Burberry label, it&apos;s a very popular brand.&quot; Cars that were once made in Europe are popular, too. &quot;Almost all the European motor companies have joint ventures in China and well over 1,500 cars are sold in Beijing in any one day,&quot; she says. But, as ever, progress can have downsides. &quot;That&apos;s why the streets are so congested,&quot; says Pascoe, who is old enough to remember a very different China. He went there first as an undergraduate in the mid 1970s, when the Pudong district of Shanghai was made up of rice fields and a ferry terminal rather than &quot;a forest of skyscrapers&quot;. Back then, you wouldn&apos;t have been allowed to conduct a survey like this, he says. &quot;And even if you had been, all the answers would have been the same, as everybody would have parroted the Communist party line. Otherwise, they would have been arrested and sent to a prison camp. Nowadays you can get honest answers, as people are not afraid any more.&quot; But social networking sites are still banned, and the Chinese government has put in place a sophisticated censorship mechanism to block comment on controversial topics such as Tibet and Tiananmen Square. But Pascoe says the Chinese have not totally missed out on the internet explosion. &quot;It&apos;s not democracy as we would understand it,&quot; he says, &quot;but this amazing forum for communication and debate has had a hugely positive impact on the way people can express their opinions.&quot; Yet there are still big differences between Chinese and European culture. &quot;We are prone to constantly misunderstanding one another,&quot; he says. &quot;There was virtually no contact between us for 2,000 years and then, as soon as there was, it quickly became a clash of civilisations in which, as the Chinese see it, the warlike Europeans got the upper hand and started to colonise chunks of Chinese cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou.&quot; According to Pascoe, Chinese people have long memories and still see us Europeans as being quite aggressive. But, the research shows, there is a certain fondness for all things European, which could be capitalised on. &quot;The EU needs to tap in more to this reservoir of goodwill. But you can&apos;t improve a relationship unless you make a real effort to understand the other side and take the trouble to work out why they think what they think.

With three Michelin stars it has succeeded as much by consistency as by creativity and remains one of the US&apos;s true destination restaurants. \u2022 perseny.com 11. Daniel New York, USALast year&apos;s position: 8 Daniel Boulud&apos;s desire to meld unexpected ingredients and create dishes you won&apos;t see on any other menu make for one of Manhattan&apos;s most exquisite eating-out experiences. Today his restaurant empire is blossoming, with openings across the world, but for a true taste of the Lyonnaise lion, to Manhattan you must go.\u2022 danielnyc.com 12. Les Cr\u00e9ations de Narisawa Tokyo, JapanLast year&apos;s position: 24 Much has been made of the fact that the first Japanese restaurant to make this list has a distinct French accent, but chef-owner Yoshihiro Narisawa is not just producing Gallic haute cuisine with a Pacific edge. Themes of soil, water, fire, charcoal and forest permeate the menu to reflect Narisawa&apos;s bringing of nature to the plate, resulting in dishes complete with the smell, aspect or texture of the landscape from which they were drawn.\u2022 narisawa-yoshihiro.com 13. L&apos;Astrance Paris, FranceLast year&apos;s position: 16 Pascal Barbot opened L&apos;Astrance after making his name at Alain Passard&apos;s L&apos;Arp\u00e8ge. That was back in 2000, and since then he has built up a serious reputation and is now regarded as one of the most innovative and distinct chefs in France. There&apos;s no menu as such \u2013 just tell him what you can&apos;t or won&apos;t eat and he&apos;ll prepare a bespoke succession of wildly creative dishes. \u2022 +33 (0)1 40 50 84 40 14. L&apos;Atelier Saint-Germain de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon Paris, FranceLast year&apos;s position: 29 With its emphasis on conviviality, L&apos;Atelier moved Jo\u00ebl Robuchon from fine dining into fun dining. Interaction between diners \u2013 seated at a sushi-bar \u2013 and chefs, who performed in an open-plan kitchen, was encouraged and kitchen theatre quickly became the rage. That the original remains so popular is largely the result of Eric Lecerf and Philippe Braun, two of Robuchon&apos;s most trusted lieutenants, who man the Parisian fort while Robuchon trots the globe.\u2022 joel-robuchon.net 15. Hof van Cleve Kruishoutem, BelgiumLast year&apos;s position: 17 Chef-patron Peter Goossens lives and breathes local produce, and a meal at Hof van Cleve shows both the considerable extent of his regional larder and his talent at exploiting it. Fish and shellfish feature prominently, suiting Goossens&apos; style of cuisine, in which he highlights freshness of flavour and reminds you of the source of your food. That said, he&apos;s no one-region pony and has an increasing interest in Asian cuisine.\u2022 hofvancleve.com 16. Pierre Gagnaire Paris, FranceLast year&apos;s position: 13 Pierre Gagnaire&apos;s eponymous restaurant in Paris is still one of the most vaunted places to eat in the French capital, demonstrating the resilience of one of the food world&apos;s true greats. Gagnaire&apos;s approach to cooking combines a touch of the poetic with a dash of simplicity and a soup\u00e7on of wistfulness for dishes that appear as mini art forms. \u2022 pierre-gagnaire.com 17. Oud Sluis Sluis, Netherlands Last year&apos;s position: 19 Oud Sluis has run for three generations and current patron, Sergio Herman, has remained true to its founding principles \u2013 capitalising on the Zeeland coast&apos;s fresh fish and oysters. This is no ordinary seafood restaurant, however. Herman&apos;s quest for flavour-matches of Italian and Japanese influence, such as langoustine with artichoke, Iberico ham and makrut lime leaves, has earned him a reputation as one of the country&apos;s most inspiring chefs.\u2022 oudsluis.nl 18. Le Bernardin New York, USA Last year&apos;s position: 15 Fish is the star of the show at Le Bernardin but only when you eat there do you fully realise the high regard chef Eric Ripert holds for our underwater friends. The menu is a who&apos;s who of the sea, with red snapper, monkfish, fluke, turbot, salmon, king fish, halibut, lobster, bass, skate and kampachi in forms including &quot;almost raw&quot;, &quot;barely touched&quot; and &quot;lightly cooked&quot;. \u2022 le-bernardin.com 19. L&apos;Arp\u00e8ge Paris, FranceRe-entry Alain Passard cut red meat from his menu back in 2001, but the Breton-born chef is no drum-banging vegetarian: the menus at this elegant restaurant, close to the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, still include top-notch game, poultry and seafood. However, L&apos;Arp\u00e8ge remains veg-centric and is a haven for pescetarians, vegetarians and even \u2013 whisper it \u2013 vegans. It&apos;s also hallowed ground for chefs and Passard&apos;s light touch and flawless presentation has made him a true French master.\u2022 alain-passard.com 20. Nihonryori RyuGin Tokyo, JapanLast year&apos;s position: 48 The menu at Nihonryori RyuGin is built around the seasons and chef Seiji Yamamoto takes great care to retain the integrity of traditional Japanese ingredients and cooking methods while pushing the boundaries of the cuisine. Yamamoto delights in avant-garde techniques \u2013 he&apos;s not afraid to flex his Arnie-like culinary muscles at times \u2013 but his overall approach doesn&apos;t overlook tradition. One dish features 30 kinds of Japanese spring vegetables and 10 types of shellfish.\u2022 nihonryori-ryugin.com 21. Vend\u00f4me Bergisch Gladbach, GermanyLast year&apos;s position: 22 The minute you turn into the drive of the imposing Schloss Bensberg \u2013 the hotel in which Vend\u00f4me is housed \u2013 you know you&apos;re in for a treat. Here, chef Joachim Wissler invites diners to accompany him on a small or grand &quot;expedition&quot;, where they can feast on simply prepared dishes that come thick and fast. It&apos;s a surreal Alice in Wonderland-like jaunt through Germany&apos;s forgotten culinary landscape: fun, but with an underlying seriousness.\u2022 schlossbensberg.com 22. Steirereck Vienna, Austria Last year&apos;s position: 21 Steirereck, housed in a beautiful Art Deco building in Vienna&apos;s central city park, is a grand affair with a 35,000-strong wine list and stunning views over the river Wien. Yet the food has stayed true to its old-world heritage with chef Heinz Reitbauer using national and regional Austrian cooking to create small moments of surprise through the discovery of previously unknown ingredients or the resurrection of those long forgotten.\u2022 steirereck.at/wien/restaurant 23. Schloss Schauenstein F\u00fcrstenau, Switzerland Last year&apos;s position: 30 With only 26 covers, Schauenstein is one of the smallest restaurants in the list and since being awarded three Michelin stars last November is even harder to get into than previous years. Its chef, Andreas Caminada, is a serious talent who eschews the whizz-bang style of cuisine. Instead, he prefers to tease out the extraordinary potential of simple ingredients to create masterpieces of craft, taste, colour and precision. \u2022 schauenstein.ch 24. Eleven Madison Park New York, USALast year&apos;s position: 50 Eleven Madison Park is increasingly making waves within international circles and is the second-highest climber on this year&apos;s list. The restaurant recently underwent considerable change with chef Daniel Humm and general manager Will Guidara reducing capacity from 114 covers to 80 and completely revamping the menu. There&apos;s no more \u00e0 la carte. Instead, a card printed with a grid of 16 ingredients hints at the dishes available.\u2022 elevenmadisonpark.com 25. Aqua Wolfsburg, Germany Last year&apos;s position: 34 Aqua&apos;s location is corporate in the extreme \u2013 the Wolfsburg Ritz-Carlton overlooks Volkswagen&apos;s Autostadt visitor attraction \u2013 but this is no soulless, carbon copy, could-be-anywhere, hotel fine-dining joint. Sven Elverfeld applies his considerable skills to peasant food, resulting in avant-garde re-workings of boiled lamb fillet with Frankfurt green sauce and beef with sour cream, gherkins and beetroot. In a place where you&apos;d expect absolutely no reference to location, it&apos;s here in spades. \u2022 restaurant-aqua.com 26. Quay Sydney, AustraliaLast year&apos;s position: 27 Long before it was so deeply fashionable, chef Peter Gilmore was perfecting his &quot;nature-based cuisine&quot; at Quay with his dazzling array of dishes. The restaurant has retained the coveted &quot;Three Hats&quot; from the Australian Good Food Guide for a ninth consecutive year and Gilmore recently published his first book \u2013 Quay: food inspired by Nature \u2013 a visually sumptuous but deeply informative exposition of his work.\u2022 quay.com.au 27. Iggy&apos;s Singapore Last year&apos;s position: 28 Iggy&apos;s made the move from The Regent Singapore hotel to new premises at The Hilton late last year, doubling the size of the original restaurant, but owner Ignatius Chan has resisted the temptation to use this as a way of ramping up the number of covers for the sake of more Singaporean dollars. The kitchen has lost none of its flair and precision with flavours strong and uncompromising, with dishes that have a true international grounding.\u2022 iggys.com.sg 28. Combal Zero Turin, ItalyLast year&apos;s position: 35 Anyone somewhat fatigued by samey high-end restaurants should definitely consider a trip to Combal Zero, where its hyper-creative, conceptual tasting menu will be equivalent to a round of electric shock therapy, stimulating mind and body alike. Chef-proprietor Davide Scabin is out to blow his customers&apos; minds and challenge perceptions with cutting-edge dishes served with incredible creativity - including Around the World in Five Soups and a helium balloon, supplied with Campari and soda-water capsules.\u2022 combal.org 29. Mart\u00edn Berasategui San Sebasti\u00e1n, SpainLast year&apos;s position: 33 Mart\u00edn Berasategui may have taken a bit of stick for being the only heavyweight Basque chef to take his brand of cooking worldwide (he has an outlet in Shanghai), but the food at his flagship continues to impress. The menu comprises 13 tiny, neatly presented dishes and foams, jellies and spherified balls abound, but Berasategui stays true to his roots: he uses very little non-regional produce and all his plates reference traditional dishes. \u2022 martinberasategui.com 30. Bras Laguiole, FranceRe-entry Working on the top of a hill in a remote slice of the French countryside, Michel Bras (pronounced Brahs) forages little-known herbs and vegetables and gently coaxes the best out of them, creating beautiful, organic plates such as his signature dish of Gargouillou containing more than 50 varieties of vegetable, herbs and flowers. Bras has never worked in anyone else&apos;s kitchen (aside from his mother&apos;s) and this is reflected in his simple, distinctive cooking. \u2022 bras.fr 31. Biko Mexico City, MexicoLast year&apos;s position: 46 If you&apos;re hankering after a taste of techno-emotional Spanish cuisine but can&apos;t stomach the inevitable \u20ac300 bill, you might consider a trip to Mexico City&apos;s Biko, where a tasting menu is a snip at just under \u20ac40. At Biko, Mexican food gets the modern Basque treatment: the gentle appliance of science to get the best out of local produce, combined with deft use of big, concentrated flavours in complicated, artfully presented dishes. \u2022 biko.com.mx 32. Le Calandre Padua, ItalyLast year&apos;s position: 20 Le Calandre represents contemporary Italian cooking&apos;s middle ground. That&apos;s not to say that Massimiliano Alajmo&apos;s cooking is in any way average, but his cuisine is not extreme; it doesn&apos;t seek to challenge or confuse but is rather grounded in what is in season and what tastes good. Last year the restaurant underwent a major refurbishment, doing away with tablecloths in the process, to better reflect the philosophy of the kitchen. \u2022 calandre.com 33. Cracco Milan, Italy Last year&apos;s position: Re-entry Carlo Cracco is often credited \u2013 and occasionally derided \u2013 as being the ringleader of a small but important group of Italian chefs attempting to break away from the constraints of cooking &quot;traditional&quot; food. At his eponymous Milan restaurant he creates challenging cuisine that has won him considerable acclaim from the major Italian guides and two stars from Michelin. If you&apos;re not a fan of sea urchins, snails and slugs, though, it may be one to swerve.\u2022 ristorantecracco.it 34. The Ledbury London, UK New entry Tucked away in the affluent but relatively off-piste Notting Hill neighbourhood of west London, Brett Graham&apos;s small but perfectly realised restaurant has become one of the city&apos;s ultimate dining destinations. The tone is set by impeccable service, with the largely Antipodean front-of-house staff successfully walking the tightrope between formal and relaxed. Graham&apos;s equally outstanding food combines elements of French cuisine using traditional British ingredients, presented with charm and personality.\u2022 theledbury.com 35. Chez Dominique Helsinki, Finland Last year&apos;s position: 23 Chef-patron Hans V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki has been flying the flag for Finland&apos;s cuisine since 1998 at Chez Dominique, regularly voted the country&apos;s best restaurant for its innovative cooking based around Nordic and French flavours. The idea behind V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki&apos;s cooking is to surprise by providing an experience unlike any other restaurant \u2013 an act he achieves through offering mystery menus where the diner places their trust at his mercy. It&apos;s a gamble well worth taking.\u2022 chezdominique.fi 36. Le Quartier Fran\u00e7ais Franschhoek, South AfricaLast year&apos;s position: 31 Part upmarket auberge, part award-winning restaurant complex, Le Quartier Fran\u00e7ais nestles in a corner of the Cape winelands. Dutch-born chef Margot Janse&apos;s nine-course African-inspired Surprise Menu, paired with local wines, takes diners on a gourmet safari, highlighting southern African flavours, many of which are sourced from Le Quartier&apos;s gardens. Others, such as Kalahari salt, hail from Namibia. Janse&apos;s aim is to be 100% African in all her produce \u2013 she&apos;s 80% there.\u2022 lequartier.co.za 37. Amber Hong Kong, China New entry Dutch-born Richard Ekkebus is at the helm of newcomer Amber, the signature restaurant of Hong Kong&apos;s five-star Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and is perfectly placed to procure the best Japanese line-caught fish and other produce that passes through the former silk and spice crossroads. The restaurant has high standards of on-plate artistry and imaginatively explores French conventions and combinations of tastes and textures, amplified by a daily-changing wine list. \u2022 amberhongkong.com 38. Dal Pescatore Mantua, Italy Last year&apos;s position: 36 This family restaurant notched up a Michelin first when it was awarded three stars in 1996: Nadia Santini became the first female chef in Italy to gain top marks. Even now, it&apos;s easy to see what attracted the little red book to this out-of-the-way corner of Mantua \u2013 the setting is luxurious and while the cuisine is still rigorously authentic Italian, the kitchen remains ever-receptive to new ideas or ingredients. \u2022 dalpescatore.com 39. Il Canto Siena, ItalyLast year&apos;s position: 40 Working out of a former Carthusian convent, Paolo Lopriore boldly offers decidedly non-traditional food in a region with one of the most fiercely protected culinary identities in Italy. He may use Tuscan classics such as ribollita and tonno e fagioli as a jumping-off point, but from there it&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess what will happen next. A few diners report &apos;challenging&apos; flavours but the vast majority come away raving about the confidence of the chef&apos;s direction. \u2022 certosadimaggiano.com 40. Momofuku Ss\u00e4m Bar New York, USALast year&apos;s position: 26 Pork takes a starring role at David Chang&apos;s informal and buzzing restaurant, either slow-cooked shoulder or braised and grilled belly served in steamed buns or wrapped in lettuce (Ss\u00e4m means wrapped). There are small plates, too, that reflect Chang&apos;s eclectic approach: Short Rib Sandwich \u2013 Taleggio, Beet Slaw and Bacon or maybe Spicy Honeycomb Tripe with Ginger, Scallion, Celery and Pickled Tomatoes. Think of it as a Pan-Asian St John. \u2022 momofuku.com 41. St John London, UK Last year&apos;s position: 43 Founders Trevor Gulliver and Fergus Henderson have been busy becoming hoteliers this year but it&apos;s business as usual at their stalwart British restaurant-cum-canteen. Here you can eat some of the best meat dishes in London, from whole suckling pig to roast mutton, in refreshingly unfussy surroundings. What&apos;s lacking in pomp is more than made up for in technical ability. Its Welsh rarebit is easily one of the finest of its kind in the world. \u2022 stjohnrestaurant.com 42. Astrid Y Gast\u00f3n Lima, PeruNew entry Gast\u00f3n Acurio&apos;s flagship restaurant in the Peruvian capital may be a newcomer to the list, but its chef-owner is already a well-established star of international gastronomy. At Astrid Y Gast\u00f3n, Acurio uses myriad indigenous ingredients, led by Pacific seafood, and traditional cooking methods fused with the international influences for beautifully conceived dishes such as Warm Amazonian Ceviche, Suckling Goat with Loche Pumpkin and Lucuma Panacotta on Cocoa Alfajor. \u2022 astridygaston.com 43. Hibiscus London, UKLast year&apos;s position: 49 Claude Bosi moved Hibiscus to London from Ludlow four years ago and his intense focus has paid increasing dividends with discerning diners. Bosi&apos;s dishes tread the fine line between classic and modern. He is not interested in bizarre flavour combinations or hi-tech methods that change the intrinsic nature of ingredients, but instead focuses on originality and flair. The result is a restaurant that stands proud among its peers not only in the UK, but across the globe.\u2022 hibiscusrestaurant.co.uk 44. Maison Troisgros Roanne, France Last year&apos;s position: 44 Maison Troisgros has held three Michelin stars since 1968 and is currently under the control of Michel Troisgros, who picked up the reins in the late &apos;80s. Though very much grounded in classical French food, Michel Troisgros has embraced other influences, most notably Japanese and Italian, for an unfussy and distinctly modern cuisine, yet in a nod to its mighty gastronomic heritage, its Escalope of Salmon with Sorrel signature dish has remained on the menu unchanged since 1965. \u2022 troisgros.fr 45. Alain Ducasse au Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Paris, FranceLast year&apos;s position: 41 Alain Ducasse has gone back to basics at his eponymous flagship restaurant. There&apos;s now much less going on in his dishes \u2013 just two or three main ingredients presented simply, yet artfully \u2013 and his key aim is to strike a balance between acidity, bitterness and sweetness. He&apos;s using less salt and fat too, confident in his team&apos;s ability to introduce great flavour by other means \u2013 although the presentation remains as flamboyant as the interior. \u2022 plaza-athenee-paris.com 46. De Librije Zwolle, NetherlandsLast year&apos;s position: 37 Twenty-five years before it became fashionable, a passion for local, seasonal ingredients was the foundation upon which chef Jonnie Boer built his career and De Librije regularly features perch, eel and gurnard on its menus. The kitchen has a philosophy of simple purity, with Boer stating &quot;it is not a laboratory&quot; and the current menu features plenty of robust, earthy flavours, perfect to ward off winter&apos;s lingering chill. \u2022 librije.com 47. Restaurant de l&apos;H\u00f4tel de Ville Crissier, SwitzerlandLast year&apos;s position: 14 While many restaurants take a shock-and-awe approach of pairing unusual ingredients as an obstacle course for the palate, chef patron Philippe Rochat&apos;s cooking is refreshingly straightforward, dare we say old-school. Attention to detail plays a major part of the dining experience and the kitchen sources the very best caviar, truffles and cheeses, whatever the price; bread is baked daily on-site and each dish contains only three main constituent flavours. \u2022 philippe-rochat.ch 48. Varvary Moscow, RussiaNew entry Chef Anatoly Komm is turning heads with an approach that is unashamedly &quot;traditional Russian&quot; on the one hand, but exciting and contemporary on the other. Fans of Komm include Ferran Adri\u00e0, who praises the chef for turning clich\u00e9d Russian cuisine on its head by combining traditional dishes and contemporary techniques with spectacular results. His 12-course &quot;Gastronomic Show&quot;, for example, features Borscht with Foie Gras and a Russian Salad using ingredients sourced in Russia. \u2022 anatolykomm.ru 49. Pujol Mexico City, MexicoNew entry Head chef Enrique Olvera has switched from fancy dining to Mexican food &quot;with soul&quot; at Pujol with market-inspired dishes that nod to a strong cultural legacy. Cooking in clay pots has ousted the water bath but the food is no less modern \u2013 think coffee, corn and flying ants toasted and ground into a powder, stuffed into a dried pumpkin and wrapped in corn leaves, then heated to evoke a balmy Mexican street scene. \u2022 pujol.com.mx 50. Asador Etxebarri Atxondo, SpainRe-entry To see a true culinary workshop in action, head to Asador Etxebarri, where part chef, part blacksmith Victor Arguinzoniz deals almost exclusively in grilled food. If you can eat it, he&apos;ll grill it. Caviar, cockles and even milk are cooked over locally felled oak and, unlike at many asadors, few of the ingredients arrive charred or blackened. If you&apos;re tired of your dinner being mucked about with, this is the place to go.\u2022 asadoretxebarri.com", "tags": ["Restaurants", "Chefs", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-18T20:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/18/mclaren-lewis-hamilton", "sentences": ["Again tyre strategy will be vital and Red Bull, although they know they still have the faster car, will be mindful that they were outwitted in Shanghai."], "title": "McLaren up to pace after poor pre-season, says Lewis Hamilton", "article": "Motor racing Lewis Hamilton has revealed the extent of McLaren&apos;s early-season problems following his thrilling victory on Sunday, one which has thrown open the Formula One world championship. McLaren were so far off the pace during testing in Barcelona before the start of the season that they wondered how they would compete with Red Bull, last year&apos;s dominant team and who still lead this season&apos;s drivers&apos; and constructors&apos; tables. Hamilton, who counted Sunday&apos;s win among his top three, said: &quot;If you really, really knew how bad the car was behaving in the winter \u2026 you would get to 10 laps if you were lucky. The reliability was a disaster. While we were being quite cool about it, it was worrying for sure. Then they pushed very hard and in the space of two weeks it was incredible what they were able to bring to Australia. We worked so hard. Our desire to win is huge. &quot;It still feels absolutely amazing to have a car beneath us that can compete,&quot; he added. &quot;We&apos;ve still got some way to go to close the gap to the Red Bulls but we had the better strategy in China and were able to execute it really well. The team will keep on pushing as hard as ever as we head into the European season.&quot; Asked if he thought, before the season started, that he was capable of winning its third grand prix, he replied: &quot;No. But I am looking forward to many, many more great races like this and giving a really true showing of the strength of our team.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s first win since Spa in August, eight months ago, broke a sequence of four successive wins for Red Bull&apos;s Vettel and, according to Hamilton, will revitalise the team going into the mini-break before the next race in Turkey on 8 May. &quot;It&apos;s perfect for that. You can&apos;t measure what a win like this does to a group of guys. Even I underestimate what difference it makes. But I hear it from all the people. And I can only imagine how they&apos;re reacting back at the factory. &quot;They&apos;ll come into work in the morning with a smile on their face. And when you come into work with a smile on your face I think you do your work that much better than if it&apos;s been a doom and gloom day. &quot;So this boost will last really well through this little break that we have and hopefully we can make another step closer to these guys [Red Bull]. I&apos;ve just told the guys exactly what we need. And now it&apos;s their job to find it.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s upbeat mood was echoed by his team-mate Jenson Button who, despite a sometimes difficult afternoon, in which he entered the Red Bull pit for a tyre change, still finished among the points in fourth place. &quot;For me, it wasn&apos;t a perfect race, but Lewis did a really great job and I think that helps with the motivation for the team,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the team will be very happy. Not just the guys here but those back at the factory. &quot;They have got a few weeks now to really work on a few developments for Turkey and there will be such a buzz, the excitement of building a car that can really fight the Red Bulls.&quot; The challenging Istanbul circuit has not always brought success for Hamilton but he will remember winning there last year, with Button second, following a crash between the Red Bull pair, Vettel and Mark Webber. Again tyre strategy will be vital and Red Bull, although they know they still have the faster car, will be mindful that they were outwitted in Shanghai. And they also have problems with Kers. Button said: &quot;I feel very positive going to Turkey. Lewis and I had a real ding-dong there. We&apos;ve had a couple this year, so hopefully it will be the same there. If we do it means we are both competitive. I just hope we&apos;ll be doing it in front of the Red Bulls and won&apos;t make the same mistake they did.&quot; Hamilton added: &quot;I&apos;ve always been competitive there. I&apos;ve been on the first two rows pretty much every time. In 2006 I came second there in one of the best races in my life, in GP2.&quot; The McLaren pair sounded breezy alongside the disconsolate Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso. &quot;Our race pace is too slow,&quot; he said. &quot;We know we have to improve to get to the front. McLaren and Mercedes have managed it. Clearly, aerodynamics is our achilles heel at the moment. The car has not changed, while others have made progress.&quot; Ferrari&apos;s president, Luca di Montezemolo, echoed those thoughts, saying that &quot;this cannot and must not be the team&apos;s level&quot;.", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Formula One", "Sport", "Motor sport", "McLaren", "Jenson Button", "Formula One 2011"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-18T22:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/21/malaysia-fights-brain-drain", "sentences": ["&quot;The fact that Malaysians fill many of the top and middle management posts in the region, from Shanghai to Singapore, tells us that the country is bleeding talent.&quot; The problem has been getting worse in recent years."], "title": "Malaysia at economic crossroads as it fights the great brain drain", "article": "Sheng Cai Lim is a skilled and experienced IT professional, an asset to a country that aspires to grow into a fully developed nation by the end of the decade. There&apos;s only one problem. Lim, 29, isn&apos;t sure he wants to stay in Malaysia. Lim says it&apos;s 50/50 that he&apos;ll leave. &quot;I&apos;ll likely go to Singapore for a few years, and then after that maybe Canada or New Zealand,&quot; he said. He&apos;s on a six-month sabbatical from work and recently registered with head hunters who place candidates abroad. &quot;My friends overseas wonder why I&apos;m still in Malaysia. They say there are better opportunities abroad,&quot; he said. If Lim does make the move, he&apos;ll join the 1.5m Malaysians, or 5.3% of the population, who live and work outside of the country, according to the World Bank. By moving to countries such as Singapore, Australia and the UK, these migrants are creating a considerable brain drain that threatens the country&apos;s economic progress. &quot;Brain drain is hurting the country&apos;s drive to move up the value chain,&quot; said Dr Ooi Kee Beng, senior fellow at the Institute of South-east Asian Studies in Singapore. &quot;The fact that Malaysians fill many of the top and middle management posts in the region, from Shanghai to Singapore, tells us that the country is bleeding talent.&quot; The problem has been getting worse in recent years. More than 300,000 Malaysians left the country between March 2008 and August 2009, compared to nearly 140,000 in 2007, the deputy foreign affairs minister, Tuan A Kohilan Pillay told parliament. Many work in key sectors such as finance, technology and engineering. Two factors are driving the exodus, said Tony Pua, MP and member of the opposition committee on the ministry of higher education. &quot;First, there&apos;s simple economics. You can make more money overseas,&quot; he said. The other cause is the country&apos;s race-based affirmative action policies, Pua said, which favour ethnic-majority bumiputra, or sons of the soil, over minority Chinese and Indians, who make up 24% and 7% of the population, respectively. &quot;The two problems exacerbate each other. The economy has not been growing, and there&apos;s an increasing demand for a bigger piece of the pie among bumiputra. As a result, the government is more prone to implement policies that favour them, and minorities feel excluded. It&apos;s a vicious cycle,&quot; Pua said. Malaysian law provides bumiputra benefits such as rebates on property prices, quotas for university enrolment and civil-service jobs, and preferential treatment for government contracts, among other advantages. The laws, which were enacted in 1971 in an attempt to redistribute wealth in the wake of race riots in 1969, distinguish Malaysia from other Asian countries with brain-drain problems, such as the Philippines. In interviews with Malaysians living in Kuala Lumpur and overseas, frustration with these laws and worries about rising racial tension and Islamic conservatism have led many to reconsider their futures in their country of birth. &quot;Malaysia is a very controlled and fanatic country,&quot; said Janath Anantha Vass, 29, an ethnic Indian accountant in Kuala Lumpur who plans to move to Australia. &quot;Melbourne suits my lifestyle the best, and I feel that&apos;s the place for me.&quot; The Malaysian government is attempting to respond to the problem with an array of programmes, including 1Malaysia, a campaign designed to ease racial tensions. In January, Prime Minister Najib Razak launched the Talent Corporation, which seeks to lure back skilled Malaysians. But many are sceptical that these programmes will address the systemic problems driving brain drain. &quot;I&apos;m not sure how effective Talent Corporation will be. Past programmes like this have not worked, and I&apos;m not sure how this one is different,&quot; said Evelyn Wong, an ethnic Chinese economics student at Scripps College in California, who blogs about brain drain. But Dr Kim Leng Yeah, an economist at Ram Holdings in Kuala Lumpur, said Talent Corporation did at least demonstrate the government&apos;s willingness to address the issue. &quot;There has been a lot of public scepticism,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is a proactive move.&quot; Representatives at Talent Corporation declined to comment. As Lim, who is ethnic Chinese, considers his future, he has spent time thinking about his place in multicultural Malaysia. &quot;I do realise that I am a minority in this country,&quot; he said. &quot;My family is encouraging me to leave. They say, &apos;Malaysia doesn&apos;t want us anymore, so why stay?&apos;&quot; And while he hasn&apos;t given up on eventually returning, he would have to see significant changes before doing so. &quot;It doesn&apos;t feel like the country is mature enough to tackle its problems right now.

Last year&apos;s Tim Burton film saw her reclaim her position at the centre stage of pop culture, and introduced her to a new generation. But it played things far too safe to satisfy true Wonderland aficionados \u2013 surprisingly, given Burton&apos;s surreal track record. Salvation, though, may be at hand, in the shape of Alice: Madness Returns, a game in which you get to navigate Alice through the pitfalls of Wonderland. Alice: Madness Returns has a great pedigree, as well as an unusual provenance. It is actually a sequel, to the only previous Lewis Carroll-based game with any credibility, American McGee&apos;s Alice, although the original came out in 2000. Its creator, the wondrously named American McGee, is a man whose status in the industry was forged as a high-profile member of the id Software teams that defined first-person shooters as we know them \u2013 McGee was a leading light on the Doom games plus Quake and Quake II. To add another curve-ball to proceedings, despite his name, McGee is now based in Shanghai, and Alice: Madness Returns will be the first major western-published game created entirely in China. We caught up with McGee on a rare UK visit. So why resurrect Alice after a decade? &quot;Well, there wasn&apos;t a lot of planning to it. I had moved to Shanghai, and started a studio there, and it made sense at some point during the creation of the studio that it became capable of doing a sequel to Alice. It was never a case of: &apos;Hey, it has been 10 years \u2013 let&apos;s bring this thing back to life.&quot; Playing through a demo level confirms that the general format of the original game has survived a decade intact: it&apos;s a third-person action-adventure, mixing platforming and combat, in which you play Alice and must traverse levels familiar in theme to followers of Lewis Carroll. Alice has melee and ranged attacks (she shoots bombs from a teapot) and can spawn clockwork white rabbits which explode after a while. Plus, she can shrink herself down, which also reveals hidden pathways. McGee elaborates: &quot;We thought there was a combination of gameplay elements that worked really well in the first game, but at the same time, we had the luxury of listening to the audience for 10 years. There were certainly issues about the gameplay: the combat system in particular, so that gave us an opportunity to improve it and put a lot more depth in there. But at its core, it&apos;s still very much a narrative-driven game.&quot; &quot;In each of the new domains Alice visits, we have a domain-specific ability. So, for instance, in the Queen&apos;s domain, there&apos;s a Giant Alice section, where she gets to eat some cake, stomp around and squish card-guards by the hundreds. There&apos;s side-scrolling in the Oriental domain, which happens by way of these shadow-projection puzzles; it looks very much like a Mario throwback. We also have a section we call Off With Her Head, in the Dollhouse domain. There, she has her head transformed into the head of a doll, and it is popped off, then thrown into a sort of Marble Madness level, where it bounces along and encounters obstacles. I think that really helps to strengthen the variety, which is one of the core aspects of the game.&quot;     Alice: Madness Returns ... the Cheshire Cat    Won&apos;t a sequel to a 10-year-old game face accusations of being old-fashioned, though? &quot;I think we may get that comment, but at the same time, I think these classic gameplay mechanisms that you now see re-emerging on mobile devices and in social games will live forever. Somebody who didn&apos;t have the opportunity to play the first game might find it quite refreshing&quot; As might an Alice fan disillusioned by Tim Burton&apos;s film? &quot;It was funny: we started development long before that film was even announced, so they managed to announce it, get the thing done and launch it in a matter of a year. Meanwhile, we had been working on the foundation and prep-work for the sequel to the game for quite some time. Personally, I was disappointed with the way in which that film came off. The biggest failing, I thought, was that they didn&apos;t focus enough on Alice as a character \u2013 it became this ensemble thing, with mainly Johnny Depp as the lead, although he was not that much fun to watch.&quot; American in China As McGee tells the story of how he ended up in China, one thing becomes clear: despite the patriotic name, he isn&apos;t exactly about to sign up for the Tea Party. He&apos;s only half-joking when he says: &quot;I was living in LA, and someone offered me the opportunity to move to Hong Kong to work on a game. George Bush had also just won his second election, and I had told all my friends that if he was elected again, I was going to leave, so those two things coincided. Although I knew the production in Hong Kong was a flawed one before I ever moved, I saw it as a good opportunity to get out to the region and get some experience in China.&quot; &quot;So after two years in Hong Kong, I was bouncing up to Shanghai quite a bit with a friend to start up an outsourcing company there which was servicing the games industry doing art assets. When someone offered me a development deal for American McGee&apos;s Grimm, I said: &quot;I don&apos;t have a studio,&quot; but they said: &quot;Don&apos;t worry about it: go and build one.&quot; So that was an amazing opportunity, and I jumped on it and took it to Shanghai, because by then I had developed some good connections there.&quot; Surely that must have involved some major culture-shocks? &quot;I think probably the largest shock came not necessarily from the culture, but from the experience of leaving the US and moving to Hong Kong because, when I did that, I had a very &quot;Burn it down&quot; attitude. I literally sold everything I owned \u2013 my car, my house and my possessions \u2013 and all I was left with were two suitcases and a cat. That&apos;s a very powerful experience, especially when we&apos;ve been brought up in a culture that assigns so much value to possessions. It was very cathartic, though. Moving into China, of course there are challenges, but you get past them.&quot;     Alice: Madness Returns ... Alive vs Teapot    Surprisingly, McGee argues that developing games in China isn&apos;t necessarily cheaper, since he still has to adhere to international pay-scales, but what he likes most is the prevailing attitude: &quot;It&apos;s a very optimistic place to be these days. There&apos;s a lot of innovation going on, a lot of change happening and a very blue-sky mentality, especially among the creative industries, because they are now, for the first time, inventing all-new markets, in all-new technologies, and all-new ways of accessing consumers, so that means you have a very young, dynamic creative and consumer culture there, which feeds directly into the culture inside the studio. It&apos;s a nice place to be making games.&quot; Meanwhile, in the west, optimism has never been in shorter supply. But at least Alice: Madness Returns should supply plenty of escapism. \u2022 Alice: Madness Returns is due to arrive for Xbox 360, PS3 and PC on 17 June", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Xbox", "Microsoft", "PlayStation", "Sony", "PS3", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-22T10:38:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/24/costa-bids-to-awaken-asia-appetite-for-branded-british-coffee", "sentences": ["Starbucks boss Howard Schultz recently expressed his ambition for far eastern expansion with one of his typical corporate mantras: &quot;We are winning, and the prize is huge.&quot; Costa, meanwhile, has two joint-venture businesses based in Beijing and Shanghai that have not been without their teething problems."], "title": "Costa bids to awaken Asia's appetite for branded British coffee", "article": "The new chief executive of Whitbread, Andy Harrison, is expected to ramp up ambitious overseas expansion plans for Costa Coffee this week as he sets out his vision for an international espresso bar chain to challenge global market leader Starbucks in some of the world&apos;s fastest-growing markets. Harrison, a former boss of easyJet who will deliver his first full-year results at Whitbread on Thursday, will announce Costa has comfortably exceeded its target of 250 new openings \u2013 a goal set by his predecessor Alan Parker a year ago \u2013 taking the store count to 1,850. Parker had set a long-term target for Costa of 3,000 stores by February 2015, including 1,400 outside the UK. This week Harrison is under investor pressure to push that target higher still as the British chain challenges the might of Starbucks in five fast-growing regions: China, India, Russia, parts of central Europe and the Middle East. The Whitbread boss may also take the opportunity to raise the target for rooms he wants to add to the group&apos;s budget hotel business Premier Inn. Some 43,600 existing rooms already generate the lion&apos;s share of profits for the group and make Whitbread the largest hotel operator in the UK. The focus for hotels expansion is expected to continue to be the UK, after mixed successes for pilot developments in the Middle East and India. The existing target is to increase Premier Inn&apos;s room count to 55,000 in three years&apos; time. Starbucks&apos;s store count, which reached 17,000 earlier this year, may be almost 10 times larger than that of Costa, but after stripping out North American operations, the Seattle-based group has 4,653 bars spread across 52\u00a0markets around the globe. The British chain has already proven itself very capable of measuring up to Starbucks&apos;s might, having outmanoeuvred it in the UK, the world&apos;s third-largest market for branded espresso bars after the US and Canada. Starbucks now has 703 stores in the UK compared with about 1,200 Costa bars. As growth prospects for both the US and UK economies look set to lag behind developing markets for some years to come, both Starbucks and Costa have been looking beyond their home markets, seizing upon an emerging fashion for western-style branded espresso coffee among the burgeoning middle classes of Asia. In its five target overseas markets, Whitbread identifies 1.2bn city dwellers served by about 4,000 branded coffee shops, of which Costa claims an 11% share. It is in these markets that Harrison wants to intensify expansion, especially because Starbucks \u2013 which already has 426 stores in China to Costa&apos;s 80 or so \u2013 has announced plans that would take its store count in the country to 1,500 by 2015. Starbucks boss Howard Schultz recently expressed his ambition for far eastern expansion with one of his typical corporate mantras: &quot;We are winning, and the prize is huge.&quot; Costa, meanwhile, has two joint-venture businesses based in Beijing and Shanghai that have not been without their teething problems. Both are believed to have stepped up expansion plans in the past year, though store numbers still lag behind initial expectations. This programme will have to accelerate sharply if Costa is not to be left behind by its arch-rival. Elsewhere among Costa&apos;s target overseas markets, the British chain had 25 stores in Russia as of last autumn (Starbucks has 37); 198 in central Europe (Starbucks has 31); and 228 in the Middle East (Starbucks has 303). In India, Costa already has 60 sites; in January, Starbucks signed an alliance with the Tata conglomerate that will see it enter that market for the first time, possibly later this year. Back in the UK, Costa is expected to continue expanding, though recently it has preferred, where possible, to do so via franchised outlets, freeing resources for overseas growth. The business has been looking to target new markets beyond the high street such as supermarkets, universities and hospitals; last month&apos;s acquisition of Coffee Nation, the coffee vending-machine business that is to be renamed Costa Express, will help meet this ambition without sapping expansion funds too heavily. Harrison joined Whitbread in September after five years running easyJet, where his departure sparked a pay controversy: shareholders voted down the airline&apos;s board remuneration policy in protest at a \u00a31m retention bonus paid to him shortly before his exit. EasyJet&apos;s founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, criticised Harrison&apos;s strategy, accusing him of expanding too aggressively through large orders of new aircraft. But Harrison has always defended his tenure, pointing out that, unlike many rival airlines, easyJet remained profitable throughout the economic downturn. Shareholders, who have watched Whitbread&apos;s stock decline 6% so far this year, will be looking for Harrison to draw on much of his experience from easyJet. Not only is he well versed in how to do business in tough overseas markets, but he is also steeped in the dark arts of so-called yield management \u2013 in other words, charging the highest possible price to customers without losing them, a trick budget hotels have sought to learn from the no-frills airline industry for some time. It is in this area that investors hope Harrison can really accelerate Premier Inn&apos;s earnings potential.", "tags": ["Whitbread", "Starbucks", "Food & drink industry", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-23T23:05:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/26/china-super-rich-demand-luxury-brands", "sentences": ["Shops are springing up not only in Beijing and Shanghai, but also in unglamorous provincial cities such as Hefei and Shijiazhuang."], "title": "China's taste for high-end fashion and luxury brands reaches new heights", "article": "Angelica Cheung, the Chanel-frocked editor of Vogue China, has a problem her counterparts would sell their designer wardrobes for: too much advertising to fit in the glossy. &quot;I have to sit down at a desk to flip through it,&quot; she says. &quot;It is going to get very difficult to read. It&apos;s too heavy. Maybe it will have to be two magazines in future.&quot; In the US, Vogue&apos;s chunky September issue is fashion&apos;s lodestar; so successful it spawned its own documentary. In China every month&apos;s edition is a glossy, advert-packed, doorstopper: testament to the explosion of the high-end fashion industry. As the latest Hurun wealth report logs 960,000 millionaires in China, the expanding ranks of the super-rich are seeking ways to confirm their status and indulge a newfound taste for consumption. High-end brands are happy to assist. The ubiquitous Louis Vuitton boutiques have been joined by Loewe and Balmain. Burberry plans to expand from 57 to 100 stores within five years. Herm\u00e8s has even launched its own China-specific sub-brand, Shang Xia. The management consultancy McKinsey predicts that, as middle-class consumers acquire the designer habit too, within four years China will become the world&apos;s largest luxury market, worth $27bn (\u00a316bn), up from $10bn in 2009. . Add in purchases overseas, by Chinese tourists avoiding the country&apos;s sky-high luxury taxes, and the figures are staggering. Chinese consumers will buy more than 44% of the world&apos;s luxury goods by 2020, forecasts CLSA Asia-Pacific, the brokerage and investment group. That ratio is all the more remarkable given that high-end brands emerged only in the 1990s. Cheung says Vogue China requires more &quot;education&quot; pages than its sister titles, to make up for the missing years and unravel the western references. &quot;In China [the 1960s] was the Cultural Revolution. You need to explain swinging London, Mary Quant, the Beatles and why these people made a difference. If you don&apos;t explain, they&apos;re just clothes.&quot; Certainly, the fashion industry is putting down roots in popular culture. China has its own Project Runway \u2013 called Creative Sky, with Cheung as a judge. And it has its own take on The Devil Wears Prada, with the fashion romance Colour Me Love. Even now fewer than 2% of the population buys top-end brands, says Zhu Mingxia of Beijing&apos;s University of International Business and Economics. &quot;The next decade will be the golden era for luxury.&quot; Beauty products and accessories account for a much larger slice of the market than in the west, and more of the customers are male; according to the American accessories marketer Coach Retail International, men account for 45% of China&apos;s $1.2bn luxury handbag market. Prada shoulder bags and Gucci clutches are essential props for many businessmen. And if they are not carrying their own status symbol, young men may wield one on behalf of a girlfriend. Buying a partner an expensive handbag establishes you as husband material; carrying it for her is also appreciated, so it is not uncommon to see burly young men gallantly toting pink or diamante-studded bags. Many of these new consumers are executives and entrepreneurs, keen to show they have made it, or the offspring of wealthy families. Others, however, are the aspirational: &quot;Secretaries who live on instant noodles for six months to pay for their LV handbag ... it&apos;s a way of saying, &apos;I have become part of this world,&apos; &quot; said Paul French of the retail consultancy Access Asia. Cynics joke that &quot;the three Cs \u2013 the corrupt, the criminal and the concubines&quot; are among the heaviest spenders. A gold watch or expensive handbag not only show appreciation to a helpful official or acquiescent mistress; they are also tradable assets and less traceable than cash. Brands see they must fight to retain an aura, justifying their price tags as their popularity increases. Shops are springing up not only in Beijing and Shanghai, but also in unglamorous provincial cities such as Hefei and Shijiazhuang. With minimal rents (developers believe prestige brands attract other clients), there is little to stop their relentless multiplication, even when customers are thin on the ground. &quot;Every mall in Beijing has a Versace, and every year there&apos;s another mall,&quot; said Miao Wong, managing director of a record company, as she eyed the designer-clad crowd at a recent Burberry party in the capital. Two or three years ago she too shopped for high-end, western labels; these days she prefers local designers such as Vega Wang. She may be rare among her peers, but officials also appear to think fashion is better when it keeps a lower profile. Beijing recently banned billboards promoting &quot;hedonistic and high-end lifestyles&quot;, underlining concern about overt displays of wealth in an increasingly unequal society. One day later a minister indicated plans to cut luxury taxes. The message to brands and customers alike: consumption is fine, just don&apos;t make it too conspicuous.

For most businesses, the price of water remains relatively inconsequential compared to other operating costs. The real value of water for business is tied to intangibles such as brand, reputation, license to operate, business continuity and as a driver for innovation. But there is another aspect of the value of water for business \u2013 arguably the most important aspect \u2013 that is tied to the social dimension of water. Currently, some 1.1 billion people lack access to clean water, and more than 2.5 billion people lack access to safe sanitation. The implications of these statistics for a steepening scarcity curve are staggering, particularly as demand for water increases globally in many major sectors \u2013 industrial, agricultural and domestic. The business implications are similar to the implications for society: increased competition for water and a workforce that lacks access to a basic resource. Based on innovative ideas presented at the second annual Hult International Business School Global Case Challenge a few weeks ago, solutions can be identified to help solve the water scarcity issue. The competition is focused on addressing the global clean water crisis in partnership with Water.org, an organisation founded by Gary White, Matt Damon, and The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). In competitions held in Boston, San Francisco, London, Dubai, and Shanghai, the international competition crowd-sourced innovative ideas from some of the world&apos;s top students. Deloitte participated as a judge. The Hult Global Case Challenge, as a CGI member, has committed to working with fellow CGI members to solve one of the world&apos;s most pressing resource issues. The winners of each regional competition will compete in the global final in New York City on April 30, 2011, co-hosted by the CGI. At the final event, the participating teams will present their refined solutions to a panel of executive judges. Water.org will receive a USD $1 million donation from Hult International Business School, which can be used to help see the winning team&apos;s solution implemented. The Hult competition draws attention to the alarming and indefensible lack of access to clean water and sanitation among many populations. It is driven by a global business school competition. It recognises social issues can no longer be divorced from economic and environmental issues. (The cornerstone of sustainability is the integration of economic, social and environmental risks and opportunities.) Based upon the passion, creativity and commitment of the students participating in the Hult Global Case Challenge, we are confident of identifying new pathways to solving the water scarcity challenge.

The piece detailed their close friendship over 18 years and concluded with a visit that the two men made to a cemetery three days before Ai was detained on 3 April. Ai \u2013 who had received several visits from police that week \u2013 pointed to a nearby jail and told his friend: &quot;In prison, I would not commit suicide.&quot; Police at Pudong airport said they knew nothing about the situation, while police at Hongqiao airport said: &quot;We did not take anyone away today.

He is also well known for his sculptures and photography and has written a bestselling novel. No one has been able to contact Ai since he was stopped at Beijing airport.

These meetings are [held by] mid-level diplomats who talk past each other. &quot;[But] this is one venue where you can try to raise these issues. If you remove that, you don&apos;t have these opportunities.&quot; Mao Yushi, a Beijing-based economist who advocates political reform, told Reuters: &quot;Especially in a political environment like China&apos;s, forces from inside the country calling for human rights meet with various forms of suppression. &quot;Foreign criticism is extremely important for the progress of human rights in China.

We&apos;ve been here before. Masdar is the latest in a long line of brave new worlds that appear to promise the earth and then in practice deliver rather less. Remember Dongtan? That vast eco-metropolis that was supposed to rise up from the marshlands outside Shanghai? Nearly a decade on, the marshes still lie empty, the project mired in local politics. Or think of the huge hopes invested in Britain&apos;s new towns after the war; or the tower blocks that were going to sweep away the slums with bright, airy living. Grand designs often go awry. But talk of Masdar as a failure is premature. Sure, the ambition may have been scaled down \u2013 along with virtually every other project under the sun in these cash-crunched times. And some of the more fanciful features \u2013 such as the magnetic pilotless cars \u2013 have been dropped in favour of a more banal approach. But this is still a scheme with some scale. If there are no more cutbacks, by 2021 Masdar will be a desert city of 40,000 powered entirely by renewables. It will have proved that it&apos;s possible to slash water consumption \u2013 arguably even more important than cutting energy \u2013 and eliminate waste almost entirely. All of which is no mean achievement in a region whose main urban claim to fame \u2013 Dubai \u2013 is the living epitome of an unsustainable future. By then, Masdar shouldn&apos;t be alone. On China&apos;s Pacific coast, the Tianjin eco-city development is promising green living powered by solar and geothermal, with nine out of 10 journeys to be made by foot, bike or public transport. But if we see these new developments as a model for the green cities of the future, it will be us who have failed, even if they&apos;ve been a (qualified) success. Why? Because by 2040, two-thirds of the world&apos;s population will be living in urban areas, and all but a tiny fraction of these will be in today&apos;s vast conglomerations. So the green city of the future already has a name: it&apos;s called Mumbai or London, New York or Lagos. And if we can&apos;t transform our existing urban areas into something approaching sustainability, then we are, frankly, stuffed. These don&apos;t have the luxury of starting from scratch \u2013 let alone doing so with a budget funded by years of oil revenue. But there is a huge amount that can be done. A lot of this consists of boring old efficiency techniques, from lagging lofts to reusing greywater. These can save far more resources than can ever be generated by covering roofs in solar PV \u2013 sensible though that is. But there could be shiny new tech too \u2013 for example, laser-guided &quot;shoals&quot; of driverless travel pods, running on a fraction of the power used by today&apos;s electric vehicles, could replace the noisy chaos of traffic jammed streets. In this context, the real value of Masdar is as a showcaseand laboratory for the innovations that will help shape our urban future: from radical new public transit systems to smart mini-grids. But some of the most innovative changes will be in attitudes and behaviour, rather than gizmos. Forum for the Future&apos;s report Megacities on the Move highlights the need for radical shifts in ideas of ownership \u2013 of cars, for example. Already, schemes like Whipcar \u2013 which allow members to borrow neighbours&apos; cars as and when needed \u2013 are emerging. But why drive at all, if everything you need is in walking or cycling distance? Rather than building endless Masdars, we could reconfigure existing cities around local hubs, avoiding the need for constant crosstown traffic. Community-owned energy and food schemes could go a long way towards meeting local needs too. In Britain, the Transition Towns movement \u2013 about as far away from oil-rich dream metropolises as you can get \u2013 is buzzing with ideas like these. The challenge may be enormous, but so are the possibilities. So let&apos;s enjoy the sci-fi sparkle of Masdar by all means. But be prepared to get down and dirty to transform the mean streets of our home towns too.", "tags": ["Green economy", "Environment", "Ethical and green living", "Energy", "Green building", "Renewable energy", "Solar power", "United Arab Emirates", "Middle East and North Africa", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "World news", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-29T10:30:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/29/marrakech-cafe-bomb-experts-sift-wreckage", "sentences": ["Israel&apos;s foreign ministry said two of the victims, a man and a woman, were Jews living in Shanghai."], "title": "Experts examine wreckage of Marrakech cafe bomb blast", "article": "Anti-terrorist experts from several countries have been sifting through the wreckage of the Marrakech cafe where 15 people died on Thursday, as officials said a remote control bomb caused the blast.

It took place on 1 May 1851 in the Crystal Palace building at Hyde Park and was the idea of Queen Victoria&apos;s husband, Prince Albert. The graphic for the doodle incorporates the Google name, and online viewers can use their mouse to zoom in to look at particular sections as if using a magnifying glass. There are also animated features, such as a fountain. More than 14,000 exhibitors from around the world gathered at the Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace&apos;s 91974 sq metres (990,000 sq ft) of exhibition space in 1851. The Crystal Palace, built with glass panels on a cast iron frame and 564 metres (1,851 ft) long, was created especially for the show and designed by Joseph Paxton. The building displayed examples of technology developed in the industrial revolution and Britain&apos;s exhibits were joined by items from colonies including Australia, New Zealand and India, as well as contributions from Denmark, France and Switzerland. Inventions included an early voting machine and a forerunner of the fax machine. Visitors could also marvel at the Koh-i-noor \u2013 at the time the world&apos;s biggest known diamond. After the exhibition, the Crystal Palace was moved to a new park in Penge Common next to Sydenham Hill. Here, it was enlarged and stood in the area from 1854 to 1936, when it was destroyed by fire. The name Crystal Palace was later used to denote this area of south London and the park that surrounds the site, home of the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. Interestingly, the building and the original show also helped create the English euphemism &quot;spend a penny&quot;, meaning go to the toilet, after sanitary engineer and plumber George Jennings created the first public loos. The so-called Monkey Closets were located in the Retiring Rooms, and visitors, who were also offered a shoe shine, were charged a penny to use them. The first show was a big success and the profit made was used to found London&apos;s Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum. International exhibitions, which became known as world&apos;s fairs, have since been held periodically around the globe. Many have led to impressive works of architecture, including the Eiffel Tower from Paris&apos;s 1889 Exposition Universelle, the Atomium in Brussels and Seattle&apos;s Space Needle.

Mindful of Steve Davis&apos;s six Crucible triumphs and Stephen Hendry&apos;s seven, Higgins said he &quot;wants to get to seven because I&apos;ve won three in the last five years&quot;. It was not just the quality of his opponents \u2013 Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan, Mark Williams and Trump in the last three rounds \u2013 that made this &quot;far and away the biggest and best&quot; of his titles. A year earlier, virtually to the day, Higgins was embroiled in allegations that he discussed match fixing, based on information gathered by a News of the World entrapment operation in Kiev. A World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association disciplinary hearing in September fined him \u00a375,000 for failing to report an illegal betting approach and imposed a six-month suspension, most of which had already been served. He did have a reputation to rebuild, but his previous unblemished record and unanimous regard for his professionalism assisted this. In five months he won five tournaments on his way to Sheffield, despite the death of his father, John senior, the linchpin of this very close family, in February. \u00ac He left Sheffield for a brief holiday in Italy with his wife and three children, having earned \u00a3471,970 in prize money since his return to the circuit \u2013 as he needed to in order to recoup his fine, legal and other expenses and lost earnings. But if it was Higgins&apos; title, it was Trump&apos;s tournament as the former junior prodigy followed his breakthrough capture of the China Open five weeks ago with a series of exceptional performances. Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan tweeted that he had never seen long potting like it; Neil Robertson, whose title defence Trump ended in the first round, said that &quot;Judd&apos;s taken attacking snooker to a place where there&apos;s no right or wrong shot. Great to watch.&quot; His potting, fluency and dazzling array of positional shots made him, in 17 days, a new English sporting hero, exuding enjoyment of the challenge, yet, in his unassuming nature, the sort of son every viewing mother would like to have. &quot;I loved it out there,&quot; said Trump. &quot;You only get nerves when you&apos;re scared of missing. I went for my shots. Some went in, some didn&apos;t. &quot;I&apos;ve tried to make the game more popular with younger people. There are a lot of people who don&apos;t really watch snooker and have started watching because of me in these last two weeks, so I&apos;ve got to keep doing my thing and keep a new generation coming through and making kids want to play the game.&quot; He is, nevertheless, aware of the realities of professional sport, saying it was &quot;obviously nice&quot; to hear himself described as snooker&apos;s new superstar, before adding : &quot;But you&apos;re only really remembered when you win titles. You&apos;re not remembered as a loser. Next year there&apos;s going to be a lot of expectation on me. There will be a lot of players who will want to bring me back down to earth.&quot; Following snooker&apos;s transition more than three decades ago from low-profile folk sport to British television phenomenon, it lost some of its public appeal. Under a succession of unimaginative administrations and beset by incessant internal political strife, the circuit progressively contracted. The dwindling number of tournaments meant that young prospects like Trump could not obtain the only thing they were lacking \u2013 experience \u2013 quickly enough: &quot;I got practising but you only had six or seven tournaments a year so it was impossible to get a rhythm going. You&apos;d play in one tournament and have two or three months off.&quot; Everything changed when Barry Hearn took the helm a year ago with a 51% stake in World Snooker. February&apos;s inaugural German Masters in Berlin was a spectacular success; the World Cup is to be revived in Bangkok in July, immediately followed by a new ranking event in Melbourne. September&apos;s Brazilian Masters is the circuit&apos;s first venture into South America. China is pressing for a third ranking event in company with those established in Shanghai and Beijing. A key element in Hearn&apos;s strategy is the new Players Tour Championship, which ran this season with seven events in England, five in continental Europe \u2013 the one in Furth won by Trump \u2013 with the play-offs in Dublin, all carrying scaled down ranking points. The PTC is designed to keep all players busy with earning opportunities and to give venues not quite ready for a full ranking event a step towards one. Germany and Belgium staged such events this season and Denmark, Hungary and Poland (who have a 16 year-old European under-21 champion) are also under consideration for next season. By increasing prize money from last season&apos;s \u00a33.5m to \u00a35m this with a confidently expressed intention that next season&apos;s will top \u00a36m, Hearn&apos;s benevolent despotism has succeeded where more conventional approaches have failed. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2011.

The so-called &quot;Phoenix Four&quot; of Peter Beale, John Towers, Nick Stephenson and John Edwards acquired Britain&apos;s last remaining volume car producer from BMW for a nominal \u00a310 in 2000, with the enthusiastic backing of the then Labour government. They then spent the next five years pocketing huge awards before the firm collapsed in 2005, owing \u00a31.3bn to creditors and putting thousands of people out of work. Edward Davey, the business minister with responsibility for corporate governance and company law, said: &quot;These disqualification undertakings represent a successful conclusion to a lengthy and complex investigation into the collapse of MG Rover. Peter Beale, John Towers, Nick Stephenson and John Edwards have each been banned from being involved in the management of any company for several years. The outcome of this case serves as an important reminder that unacceptable conduct by company directors can result in lengthy periods of disqualification.&quot; From 17 May, Beale will not be able to work as a director for six years, Towers and Stephenson for five and Edwards for three. Companies House records show that Beale, Towers and Edwards all resigned from a company called Techtronic (2000) last month, while they also reveal that Towers remains as a director of a company called Hatwel, along with his wife Bethanie. When MG Rover collapsed in April 2005 with the loss of 6,500 jobs, the Phoenix Four and former MG Rover chief executive Kevin Howe had paid themselves a total of \u00a342m. Howe has not been banned, although he has no current directorships. The disqualifications follow a government report into the financial affairs of MG Rover and its associated businesses, which was launched in May 2005 under Section 432 of the Companies Act by then trade and industry secretary, Alan Johnson. It found that the conduct of the Phoenix Four made them unfit to be company directors and that throughout their reign, a complex corporate structure was adopted that saw the creation of 33 separate companies. The report stated that the directors manipulated the assets and income streams through the use of companies in which they, rather than the creditors of MG Rover, had an interest, allowing them to benefit through large salaries, dividends and profits. Inspectors also investigated Beale&apos;s purchase, installation and operation of computer software that deleted data from a laptop a day after the inquiry was announced, as well as the role of the government in securing bridge finance while takeover talks took place with the Chinese carmaker Shanghai Automotive (SAIC). The quartet, who always denied any wrongdoing, described the report as a &quot;witch-hunt&quot; and a &quot;whitewash&quot;. At the time of its publication they said: &quot;It drips with the hallmarks of this government \u2013 spin, smear and point-blank refusal to take any responsibility for their own actions.&quot; They added: &quot;[Our remuneration] was never a secret. [The government] did not have to spend \u00a318m [on a report] to find that out. Our remuneration was all in the company accounts and signed off by Deloitte, one of the world&apos;s most respected firms of auditors. It was entirely legal, above board, and much less than similar payments in large car companies.&quot; When Phoenix acquired Rover in May 2000, jubilant Rover workers hailed Towers as he arrived at the Longbridge plant in a Rover 75, chanting: &quot;There&apos;s only one John Towers&quot; and waving banners saying &quot;Phoenix Will Fly&quot;, while the then industry secretary Stephen Byers was cheered by MPs when he announced the deal. BMW had been threatening to close the plant before the Phoenix deal.

After three years of renovation and extension work, its 192,000 square metres of exhibition space is supposed to give the People&apos;s Republic a museum in keeping with its international standing. Only the Louvre in Paris (210,000 square metres) is larger. It opened to the public in March, with free admission, but only 8,000 visitors a day are allowed to see the permanent exhibition. So the Chinese turn up early in the morning to see the rooms devoted to national resurrection, ancient bronzes, Chinese porcelain and statues of the Buddha. The rooms on ancient China have just opened. The task of converting this gigantic Stalinist structure, dating from 1959, and redesigning its entrance hall and exhibition spaces, was given to a German firm of architects, Gerkan, Mark &amp; Partners, better known for railway stations, airports and sports stadiums. History museums all over China have been pressed to dispatch some of their greatest treasures to the capital. But despite its facelift the institution&apos;s prime mission is still patriotic education, fashioning and interpreting Chinese history to serve the party line. A perfect illustration is the permanent exhibition entitled The Path to National Resurrection. It starts with the period of humiliation to which western colonial powers subjected China, highlighting the steps on the way to nationalist reawakening and modernisation, with the foundation of the first republic. The sections focusing on the People&apos;s Republic, established when Mao seized power in 1949, take visitors through the key moments in the history of the Communist party, culminating in the economic achievements of recent years, with the conquest of space, fast trains to Tibet and the Olympic Games. A smiling Mao appears in just one photograph, talking to party members in 1961 after the disastrous experiment with the Great Leap Forward, which caused the deaths of millions of Chinese. Two others allude to the Cultural Revolution, but fail to mention its atrocities. The only picture relating to the events of 1989, in the square outside, is dated 9\u00a0June and shows Deng Xiaoping congratulating the troops enforcing martial law. &quot;I was surprised to see there is so little detail,&quot; said a young biology student, Li, born in 1987. &quot;Some of our teachers talk about Tiananmen and we all look on the net,&quot; she added. This mutilated history &quot;infuriates&quot; Yang Jisheng, a former journalist at the Xinhua news agency and author of a monumental study of the great famine, which is banned in China. &quot;Those of us who are familiar with the history avoid this sort of museum. Historical facts have been perverted. The refusal to talk about the past is a bit like plugging your ears while you steal a bell, convinced that no one else will hear,&quot; he said. The concepts of reawakening and regeneration are particularly upsetting, Yang adds. &quot;They refer to periods when China was supposedly glorious. But which period should we consider: the first emperor, the Tang or the Qin dynasty? And which aspects should we retain of these periods, which were after all dictatorships?&quot; In these days of keen rivalry between the world&apos;s great museums, the Beijing show highlights a contradiction deep-rooted in the People&apos;s Republic: the first exhibition loaned by a foreign organisation is devoted to the Art of Enlightenment. Thanks to this master-stroke of German diplomacy, Chinese visitors can enjoy 600 works of 18th-century art from museums in Berlin, Munich and Dresden. At the opening of the exhibition on 1 April, the German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, spoke of the ideals expressed by art, such as respect for human dignity, the rule of law and individual freedoms. Such ideas, he added, led to the fall of the Berlin wall, but the Chinese media made no mention of his comments. Other museums in Europe are thinking about staging shows here too, and the Louvre is already involved in a joint project. The luxury goods group LVMH has started talks about an exhibition on the Vuitton brand and travel. It is slated to occupy four rooms and last two or three months, according to the LVMH spokesperson in Shanghai. With its prestige, ambitious aims and vast exhibition space begging to be filled, museums from all over the world are courting the Chinese mogul. But this may not be a simple task. As one expert said: &quot;The editorial line of Chinese museums is not always crystal clear.&quot; This article originally appeared in Le Monde", "tags": ["Museums", "Architecture", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-10T13:01:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/10/microsoft-buys-skype-biggest-gamble-yet", "sentences": ["&quot;There&apos;s no way Microsoft is going to generate enough revenue and profit from Skype to compensate.&quot; Another, Shanghai-based Michael Clendenin, managing director of the consulting firm RedTech, said: &quot;If you consider Skype was just valued at about $2.5bn 18 months ago when a chunk was sold off, then $8.5bn seems generous and means Microsoft has a high wall to climb to prove to investors that Skype is a necessary linchpin for the company&apos;s online and mobile strategy.&quot; But despite Skype never having turned a profit, analysts were mostly enthusiastic."], "title": "Microsoft buys Skype for $8.5bn in its biggest purchase and gamble yet", "article": "     Microsoft&apos;s acquisition of Skype, its biggest ever, is an $8.5bn (\u00a35bn) gamble to try to catch up with Apple and Google. The software company, once so dominant, has been left behind by its more fleet-footed competitors as the pace of technological change \u2013 especially in mobile telecoms \u2013 has outstripped its ability to innovate. Analysts saw the deal, which edges out the $6bn it paid for online advertising company aQuantive in 2007, as a sign of Microsoft&apos;s ambition to become a bigger force in the consumer and smartphone market. They also interpreted it as a sign that Microsoft intends to broaden its appeal to businesses by using Skype to offer cheaper services than existing phone companies. Skype, which has 663 million people across the world registered to use its voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) communications, is available on personal computers and mobile phones \u2013 though not yet on Microsoft&apos;s new Windows Phone operating system. That is expected to be remedied soon. The deal will see it established as a separate business inside Microsoft, dubbed Microsoft Skype. Tony Bates, the Skype chief executive, will become president of Microsoft Skype and report directly to Microsoft&apos;s chief executive, Steve Ballmer. Ballmer, who tried to buy Yahoo three years ago for $45bn, spelled out his vision: &quot;Skype is a phenomenal service that is loved by millions of people around the world. Together we will create the future of real-time communications so people can easily stay connected to family, friends, clients and colleagues anywhere in the world.&quot; Others were less enthusiastic and highlighted the difficulty Microsoft faces in monetising Skype, whose telephony service is free between users. &quot;It doesn&apos;t make sense at all as a financial investment,&quot; said Forrester Research analyst Andrew Bartels. &quot;There&apos;s no way Microsoft is going to generate enough revenue and profit from Skype to compensate.&quot; Another, Shanghai-based Michael Clendenin, managing director of the consulting firm RedTech, said: &quot;If you consider Skype was just valued at about $2.5bn 18 months ago when a chunk was sold off, then $8.5bn seems generous and means Microsoft has a high wall to climb to prove to investors that Skype is a necessary linchpin for the company&apos;s online and mobile strategy.&quot; But despite Skype never having turned a profit, analysts were mostly enthusiastic. &quot;For me, this actually looks like a near-perfect fit for Skype,&quot; said Dean Bubley of Disruptive Analysis. &quot;A substantial part of Skype&apos;s current user base is from PCs. Although mobile devices get all the glory at the moment, Skype epitomises what&apos;s best about desktop VoIP.&quot; Next frontier Horace Dediu, a former Nokia business development executive who now runs the Asymco consultancy, said: &quot;I see this as a pattern of consolidation of voice business models. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s coincidental that Apple, Microsoft and Google are all trying to secure assets, intellectual property, experts and businesses in VoIP and in voice control. &quot;Voice is the next frontier both in IP-based communications and in user interfaces. Skype happens to have a very large pool of users who can be engaged with multiple services besides voice. These additional services can be the root of new business models. Microsoft has plenty of degrees of freedom to experiment with: Windows Live, [search engine] Bing, Windows Phone etc.&quot; Google and Facebook were last week rumoured to be in the running for Skype but Microsoft emerged as prime bidder. The company already has three other VoIP offerings, via MSN Messenger, Xbox Live and Lync, used in its Office division. It is not clear how usernames will be integrated among them. Ballmer confirmed that Skype will continue to be developed for non-Windows platforms. Skype&apos;s principal source of revenue is international calls made by people unwilling to pay standard voice rates, which can be far higher. The analysis company Telegeography noted that Skype&apos;s international traffic volume grew by 39bn minutes in 2010 \u2013 twice the amount of all phone companies in the world combined. &quot;Demand for international communications is probably limitless,&quot; said Stephen Beckert, a Telegeography analyst. &quot;Skype has taught millions of callers they no longer need a telco to talk to friends, family and business partners abroad.&quot; Incorporating Skype into Windows Phone \u2013 which will be used by the Finnish phone-maker Nokia in forthcoming smartphones \u2013 could also have advantages in countries such as Latin America, where people find voice calls too expensive and prefer to use data services, said Stela Bokun of Pyramid Research. &quot;At the end of 2011, 40% of handset users in Latin America and Mexico will be using handsets that are 3G+ enabled,&quot; she told the Guardian. That could offer a route for Skype. Other possibilities in emerging markets include using Skype credits as payment for internet access, she said. Skype has never made a profit: in 2010 it recorded a loss of $7m on revenues of $860m \u2013 $1.30 per registered user a year, or $5 per &quot;connected&quot; user a year. While revenues have been growing it has been able to negotiate better call termination rates around the world with telephone companies. The acquisition is the second in Skype&apos;s eight-year history. In October 2005 it was bought by eBay for $2.5bn, but was 70% sold in October 2009 to a consortium of private equity and venture capitalists.

In his absence Michael Phelps, the American three years Thorpe&apos;s junior, has blossomed, winning an unprecedented eight gold medals at the Beijing Olympics. The man nicknamed Thorpedo for his five Olympic gold medals and 11 world championship titles admitted he is so far off his best that he does not know if he would make a final at the world championships in Shanghai in July. The 28-year-old Australian will not get to test that theory since he has to wait until November before swimming&apos;s anti-doping body has cleared him to race having registered for the nine-month testing period following his formal comeback announcement in February. However, he remains cagey over how fast he is swimming right now. &quot;Faster than last week,&quot; he said with a grin. &quot;I can&apos;t give a percentage, it&apos;s hard to do, and I won&apos;t tell times. But I&apos;m getting better. I&apos;m reminded more frequently that I can do this pretty well.&quot; Is he in medal-winning shape? &quot;Not by July, definitely not.&quot; Could he make a final? &quot;Um, I don&apos;t know. I really don&apos;t. For me looking at when I can actually compete, November seems early as well. I&apos;ve got to be ready by the end of March 2012, just before our trials, and to be able to prepare again to be able to swim faster than that at the Olympics.&quot; If by July, 12 months out from the start of the Olympic Games, Thorpe is unsure whether he can even be competitive in a race then what hope does he have of succeeding in London? His response is characteristically phlegmatic. &quot;If I look at it from the point of view of this being my career, it&apos;s probably a terrible thing to do. You put at risk everything that you&apos;ve done, and you can gain something obviously. There&apos;s rewards for it. But I didn&apos;t think of this as something for the career. This is my life. This is what I do. And this is a decision that has come from the heart, not from the head. Simple as that.&quot; Having beaten Phelps to take gold in the 200m freestyle at the Athens Olympics \u2013 an event lauded as the race of the century \u2013 the question is whether there will there be a rematch in 2012? &quot;It&apos;s a little bit early to say it is or it isn&apos;t going to happen. I have to qualify in the 200m, which I should be able to do. Michael has to swim it as well at the Olympics. &quot;I understand how people can get excited and there is a possibility now that it might happen in London. . . [but] the result could be different. It may not be me swimming in it, it may not be Michael. If you look at the 200m and how people are swimming around the world, Michael and I might be too slow.&quot; Reports in Australia have suggested that Phelps is planning to race there in January, but Thorpe played down any chance of the two meeting then. &quot;I won&apos;t say no, but I doubt that I would do that. I actually think I&apos;ll be training on the other side of the world.&quot; For now the Australian seems happy to live with the uncertainty of his future, unconcerned with the thought of failure in 2012. &quot;It&apos;s strange,&quot; said Thorpe, who was talking at the AdiZone in Hackney \u2013 a multi-sport outdoor gym designed by his sponsor, adidas. &quot;I understand that I should be worried about it but I think it&apos;s being away from the sport and then finding out that you really actually enjoy doing this again.&quot; For someone who fell out of love with swimming after becoming the youngest world champion when aged 15, Thorpe says his return has breathed new life into him. &quot;This is how I used to feel about swimming when I was a lot younger. It&apos;s energising to be involved in it. In the spotlight, I lost a bit of what swimming was, the context changed, it wasn&apos;t just about what I did in the pool, it was more about what else was going on outside of the pool and I didn&apos;t like that.&quot; Can the love affair continue post 2012? &quot;I haven&apos;t made a decision yet, but at the moment, I think I will.&quot;", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Ian Thorpe", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-11T23:31:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/behaviour-change-sustainability-persuasion-success", "sentences": ["The China Environmental Protection Foundation took this approach to prompt the people of Shanghai to walk more and drive less."], "title": "Winning the persuasion game", "article": "If we&apos;re going to cut the impact of our lifestyles down to a size the planet can manage, many of the things we do every day will have to change. That&apos;s no secret. The good news is that we have a host of technologies and strategies available here and now to help us do just that. The bad news is we don&apos;t use them. So how can we change our behaviour on anything like the sort of scale required? Ask an expert, and you&apos;re likely to be hit with a litany of tried and trashed techniques. Top of the list is initiatives that offer information and nothing more. Thanks to a slew of public education campaigns, more people than ever are aware of climate change and the impact of CO2. Today, almost 50% of Brits know what a carbon footprint is, up from 25% in 2007, according to a survey by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. But it also found people had little appetite for making far-reaching changes in their own behaviour. &quot;In other words&quot;, says Lorraine Whitmarsh, of Cardiff University&apos;s School of Psychology, &quot;people do not act in accordance with what they know or [say they] care about&quot;. It&apos;s a point reinforced by environmental psychologist Doug McKenzie-Mohr. In Fostering sustainable behaviour, he cites studies which found that numerous sustained efforts to educate people about the impact of their behaviour failed to make a difference. Take for example the One-Tonne Challenge, a major Canadian media campaign. It reached 51% of the population \u2013 but to no effect. According to the report, many Canadians found it &quot;too inconvenient or time-consuming&quot; to change anything, and weren&apos;t sure how to go about it. Other campaigns were much clearer about what to do \u2013 but their outcome was just as disappointing. In the Netherlands, projects which provided households with information on energy conservation and water efficiency, accompanied by workshops and a state of the art handbook, were found to have absolutely no impact on behaviour. &quot;If environmental education worked (and, remember, we started back in the 50s) we wouldn&apos;t be having the problems we&apos;re having&quot;, points out Ray De Young, Associate Professor at the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources and Environment. Meanwhile, says McKenzie-Mohr, &quot;millions have been squandered on advertising campaigns, because the barriers [to more sustainable lifestyles] go far beyond a simple lack of awareness.&quot; As the old adage goes, you can lead a horse to water \u2013 but getting it to drink is another thing entirely. Especially if what you want is not for the horse to just take a sip, shrug and wander off, but for it to have a good gulp, mull it over and come back for another\u2026 and eventually decide that this particular stream will be its preferred watering spot for the rest of its days. One obvious answer, surely, is to make it worth people&apos;s while to change. In other words, bribe or reward them to do the right thing. On the surface, this works. Tesco went all out to sell 10 million low-energy lightbulbs in 2009, telling shoppers that each one could save them \u00a39 a year. Within seven days, Tesco had sold more energy-saving bulbs than it had in the whole of 2006. Result? Solitaire Townsend, Chair of sustainable communications company Futerra, who has led a range of research on behaviour change, has her doubts. &quot;It is an obvious way in, yes \u2013 [but] it&apos;s an obvious way in for everything. It&apos;s an obvious way to sell piles of crap, as much as it is to sell behaviour change.&quot; And the danger, she adds, &quot;is if you sell something purely on the basis that it&apos;s cheaper, you get no loyalty to that behaviour. We know this from other money-saving messages. The moment something comes along that&apos;s even cheaper, you are off. That&apos;s how capitalist society works. You have competition on price: you have absolutely no loyalty to that decision.&quot; Which may explain the failure of the much-vaunted Residential Conservation Service, brought in by the US Congress. The act granted homeowners the right to free energy audits to find ways to save energy, and then interest-free loans to carry out the work \u2013 with the aim of cutting consumption by 20% per home. Nearly 6% of households targeted took up the offer, and 50% had work done as a result. Not wildly impressive, perhaps, but a lot better than nothing. However, says McKenzie-Mohr, a final evaluation revealed energy savings of no more than 2-3% per participating home \u2013 a pretty paltry return. The National Research Council concluded that the service had assumed that people would make all necessary changes to save money \u2013 forgetting the &quot;rich mixture of cultural practices&quot; that influence what we do in our homes, and how far we&apos;ll change them. &quot;Of course, if you give someone an astounding amount of money, you get a dramatic rate of change.&quot; concludes Raymond De Young. &quot;But you have to ask, would they do it without the reward? Could they convince their friends to do it?&quot; If anyone can convince their friends to do something, it&apos;s Hermione Taylor. When she decided to cycle over 2,000 miles to Morocco, she felt a bit bad asking her cash-strapped mates to sponsor her. So instead, she asked them to do something instead. Over 200 friends, and friends of friends, agreed to specific carbon-saving actions, from washing their clothes at 30\u00b0C to cutting down on burgers. Together, they saved over 16 tonnes of carbon: the equivalent of 83 flights from London to Morocco. What&apos;s more, almost three quarters of the sponsors carried on the actions beyond the two months. &quot;The response was staggering&quot;, says Taylor. &quot;Even my &apos;meatoholic&apos; brother now only eats meat once a week. He realised that he didn&apos;t become a raving hippy just by changing his habits.&quot; Taylor founded The DoNation to encourage other social groups to show support for each other by doing, not spending. &quot;Your friends know what you&apos;ve pledged, and can (informally) monitor whether you&apos;re sticking to it&quot;, says Taylor. &quot;And you&apos;re going to stick to it, because you&apos;re not the only one making an effort, and because you get the chance to talk about how well you&apos;re doing, or ask for help if you&apos;re finding it tough.&quot; Taylor isn&apos;t the only one to have spotted how great a difference the desire to impress or fit in with others can make. Such &apos;social proofing&apos; is key to many successful strategies. &quot;A live, warm, blood-thumping human being is top trumps when it comes to changing behaviours&quot;, explains Townsend. &quot;It&apos;s one of the reasons we still have car showrooms. Human interaction is much more likely to affect your decision than anything you read online \u2013 however logical, clear and comprehensive that is.&quot; In fact, our concern for how we are perceived is so great, she argues, that we&apos;re affected by people we don&apos;t even know or like. &quot;So, if the car salesman, or another dad you meet in the park, says, &apos;I don&apos;t see you as being a Volvo man&apos;, you don&apos;t then make a decision about whether or not you are going to accept that label. It just sneaks into your head.&quot; You buy it, in other words. And you don&apos;t buy the Volvo. Another effective behaviour change box ticked by Taylor&apos;s model is a sense of solidarity. &quot;One of the reasons why people are passive&quot;, explains John Th\u00f8gersen, Professor in Economic Psychology at the Aarhus School of Business and Social Sciences, &quot;is that they feel no one else is doing anything. When it comes to climate change, your contribution is so small it doesn&apos;t really matter. What matters&quot;, he goes on, &quot;is what other people do. If you don&apos;t perceive that many people are also saving energy, then you [feel] a bit of a sucker, because you lose something without helping the problem.&quot; For Th\u00f8gersen, this suggestibility comes down to the basic way we function as humans: &quot;We&apos;re social animals, and we learn the right way to act by observing others. That&apos;s how we conquered the world.&quot; It&apos;s hardly surprising. For the vast majority of human evolution, we have lived in small groups, on which we&apos;ve pretty much depended for our survival. We learnt the hard way that we were much more likely to get eaten by a tiger or killed by marauders if we strayed from the group, stood out from it too much, or lost its approval. So it&apos;s not surprising that some of the most effective behaviour change techniques are those that involve people doing things together. It&apos;s a lesson taken to heart by Transition Together, part of the Transition Towns movement, which aims to help communities make the switch to a low-carbon, &apos;post-oil&apos; lifestyle. Transition Together, a finalist in this year&apos;s Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy, features groups of neighbours and friends in the Devon town of Totnes, who meet up regularly to work out what they can do by way of living more sustainably, and support each other in doing it. The actions may be simple enough \u2013 buying local food, using low-energy lights. But as Peter Capener, an independent energy and community adviser who has observed it closely, points out, the scheme &quot;generates real enthusiasm that is based as much on the social interaction as it is on the subject matter&quot;. People love coming together in a shared endeavour, says Capener, and &quot;it creates the kind of reservoir of commitment&quot; that can keep the momentum going over time. This can help people to go beyond the &apos;been there, done that, changed the light bulb&apos; approach to behaviour change \u2013 and instead look at the roots of their unsustainable behaviour, &quot;at the stories we tell each other around what success means in society&quot;. Having your commitment witnessed by your neighbours can be a spur, too, says Christopher Rootes, a Professor of Environmental Politics and Political Sociology at the University of Kent. Take a walk down the streets of Hampshire, for instance, and you won&apos;t have to go far before you come across a house with a card in the window which lists a number of energy-saving activities and highlights the ones that household is putting into action. It&apos;s part of a simple scheme called the Greening Campaign, the beauty of which, says Rootes, is that it &quot;starts small, asks little and tries to establish a community norm. Bigger changes can be the sum of small changes.&quot; Indeed, the Greening Campaign has saved 3,000 tonnes of CO2 across 180 communities \u2013 so far. Such &quot;tangible markers of progress&quot; are key to sustaining motivation, says Capener. Barnet Council in north London now uses posters to publicise individual actions. These show how many households on that street have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint. There&apos;s a similar scheme in Kansas called the Take Charge Challenge: a &quot;friendly competition&quot; between 16 towns to reduce their energy use and so take charge of their energy future. Over 6 million kWh were saved in 12 months, and the measures taken have &apos;locked in&apos; future savings amounting to 7 million kWh a year. A range of supporting events included one where children played vampire hunters \u2013 scouring their homes for &apos;energy vampires&apos; that sucked the most power. Some behaviour-savvy brands have cottoned on to this approach. Take Unilever&apos;s Cleaner Planet plan, currently being promoted in the UK through the Persil brand, with the strapline &quot;lots of small actions = a big difference&quot;. Consumers behave very much like a flock, observing each other&apos;s movements and following trends, says Sally Uren, Deputy CEO of Forum for the Future. So if you motivate them as a group you can convince them that their own simple steps can indeed make a difference. But, she adds: &quot;The consumer is also very clear that business needs to do its bit. There needs to be a clear contract between the brand and the consumer, based on a sense of: &apos;I will if you will&apos;.&quot; As with The DoNation, a lively relationship is at the heart of any success. Brands need to keep on their toes with this, says Uren, because that relationship is changing fast: &quot;The traditional model of a linear value chain with consumers at one end and producers at another, with multiple intermediaries in the middle, is rapidly evolving. Consumers are now often producers themselves, too. So, a brand that makes no reference to the origins of its production can&apos;t engage the consumer effectively.&quot; Tea brand Tetley has taken this on board with its Farmers First Hand initiative, where tea drinkers in Britain chat via Facebook with tea pickers on the Lujeri estate in Malawi. Farmers and estate workers upload photos, messages and video clips; consumers can come back with questions and comments. Recently, John from the Mulanje district told the group how the Rainforest Alliance has supplied Lujeri with separate bins for organic waste and plastic, to keep waste out of the rivers. Kelly from Sunderland responded: &quot;Pleased you can have a cleaner environment. Still in the UK not everyone does what you&apos;re doing now \u2013 it only takes seconds.&quot; It&apos;s a safe bet her teabags go into the compost caddy. Other campaigns target the sense that your own personal behaviour doesn&apos;t really matter, by creating peer groups across vast geographies. Advertising agency Wieden and Kennedy decided to cut energy use in its office by 10% over a year. But instead of just keeping the savings, they launched the &quot;OFF-ON&quot; campaign, teaming up with the non-profit SolarAid to fund PV panels to provide lighting for The Cheryl Children&apos;s Home in Nairobi. So, turning the monitor off at the end of the day might mean a child has enough light to do her homework. For a community to embrace lasting change, argues De Young, it needs two things. One is a clear idea of the problem to be solved. The other is for its members to play an active role in figuring out and implementing the solution. He gives the example of a community in west Berlin challenged by a research group to reduce, not just their waste output, but their commercial intake. Neighbourhoods were brought together and asked to experiment, and the result was a 16% decrease in the weight of new purchases over six weeks. The researchers went away happy with the initial results, and came back a year later, fully expecting the level of consumption to have bounced back. But not only had the cut been maintained: it had dropped by a further 5%. Why? &quot;It was the group process&quot;, De Young explains. &quot;There&apos;s no reason that the experimentation and sharing would stop when the researcher goes away, because the reward is in the activity itself.&quot; Trying a solution out for size makes it much more likely to stick. Take cycle hire schemes, says Townsend. &quot;Buying a bicycle is a major commitment: it&apos;s not just a financial outlay; you&apos;re also putting a line in the sand to say that you&apos;re actually going to cycle. That&apos;s quite scary, and not something many people are prepared to do. A &apos;Boris Bike&apos; [the London cycle hire scheme named after the city&apos;s mayor], on the other hand, allows you to have a little bit of a pootle about, and see whether you&apos;ve got the gumption and the leg power to actually get around.&quot; The bikes tick several behaviour change boxes: they&apos;re simple, cheap, effective and there&apos;s obvious social approval \u2013 the streets are full of them. They&apos;re both a cause and a consequence of the surge in cycling in the capital, which has now clearly passed a tipping point on the journey from eccentric to mainstream. They also imbue an element of fun \u2013 another obvious, but rarely used, technique for breaking down established behaviour patterns. That&apos;s the premise behind Volkswagen&apos;s Fun Theory website. It offers a showcase for creative projects, such as an &apos;arcade&apos; bottle recycling bank that mimics a slot machine and has proved 50 times more popular than a &apos;standard&apos; bottle bank nearby, and the piano staircase in the Stockholm metro which has tempted many a pedestrian away from the escalator by making music as they trot up and down. Toyota echoed the approach with a novel way to cut fuel consumption. This has been the subject of numerous public education campaigns, along the lines of &apos;save money \u2013 save your engine \u2013 save the planet&apos;, which have largely failed to make a difference. Toyota took a different tack. If you put a tumbler of water on your dashboard, and then tried to avoid any of the contents splashing over the rim, you&apos;d incidentally be driving in just about the most economical way possible. Toyota invited drivers to try it, filmed them, and even created an app: a picture of a tumbler full of water fills the screen of your iPhone. When the phone moves, so does the virtual tumbler, splashing water over its sides in proportion to the motion. So just put your iPhone in its cradle on the dash, and see if you can keep the glass full\u2026 Such prompts for instant behaviour change are unlikely to result in immediate, sweeping changes in long-term habits. You&apos;d be a fool to expect any old staircase to make music for you, just because one of them did. But what such creative campaigns can do is make people stop and think about habits they normally don&apos;t even perceive. &quot;There&apos;s no silver bullet [for them]&quot;, says Steve Connor, Director of communications consultants Creative Concern. &quot;But we do know that people aren&apos;t constantly searching the net for information on sustainability: they&apos;re looking for porn and cheap flights. So we need to cut through that and take more risks if we are going to encourage more urgent action. We need to be more creative \u2013 we need to make change irresistible.&quot; One way of doing so is to spring a surprise into the daily routine. The China Environmental Protection Foundation took this approach to prompt the people of Shanghai to walk more and drive less. It had a simple message: by walking, you can create a greener environment. So it stretched huge canvases across seven of the city&apos;s busiest pedestrian crossings. On the canvas lay the outline of a big black leafless tree. On either side of the tree, along the pavements, were sponge cushions soaked in green, washable, quick-dry paint. As pedestrians trudged over the crossing they stepped on the sponges and their soles left leaf-like prints on the tree. The green pedestrian crossing was then extended to 132 roads in 15 cities across China. The mix of physical art and a campaign video reached nearly four million people across the country. The video went on to scoop the Green Awards 2010 Grand Prix and Best Green Advertising Award. A zebra crossing that turns into a tree &apos;works&apos; by introducing the unexpected into the everyday. An alternative approach focuses on what Whitmarsh describes as &quot;those disruptive moments in people&apos;s lives when they are more receptive to new ways of doing things. For example, if they are moving house, they might well be more likely to reconsider how they get from home to work.&quot; It holds out the tantalising prospect of estate agents playing an unlikely role as green messengers\u2026 Less traumatic (usually) than a house move is a music festival. This is one of the most exciting things a large proportion of the audience have ever done, which by Whitmarsh&apos;s logic makes them far more open-minded. And this means there&apos;s more chance of inciting sustainable thoughts. Green power outfit Eco Charge exploited this by designing an installation using solar and pedal power to recharge 2,000 mobile phones and cameras a day. &quot;We were the busiest area of the festival \u2013 apart from the bars and stages,&quot; says Eco Charge Director, Alex Brenan. &quot;It was a great way to connect with a massive amount of people and deliver a sustainable message. We were receiving messages from fans asking how to build their own pedal power rigs at home.&quot; Whatever approach is taken, painting attractive pictures of sustainable lifestyles is a crucial part of the package, says Caroline Fiennes, Executive Director at the Global Cool Foundation. For too long, she says, sustainability campaigns geared towards changing behaviour have been dreamt up by the greenies, for the greenies. &quot;So they perk up and everyone else switches off.&quot; &quot;Environmentalists&quot;, comments Townsend acidly, &quot;are very good at identifying what people should desire \u2013 not what they actually do desire.&quot; For Fiennes, that means &quot;we need to shut up about being green, and instead make carbon saving cool by appealing to more people about the things that interest them&quot;. So, get on a bus because you get lots of lovely time to yourself; go on holiday by train rather than flying, because you&apos;ll have a better adventure; turn your heating down because it&apos;s better for your skin. Global Cool teamed up with Eurostar, RailEurope and Mr and Mrs Smith Hotels to film various celebrities on train-based holidays, featuring the destinations reachable within a sensible time \u2013 and the pleasure you can have on the way. &quot;We showed that you get time to read, have lunch with a friend in Paris and dinner in Geneva. And how good the bars are on German trains,&quot; explains Fiennes. It addresses what Townsend describes as one of the biggest obstacles to behaviour change: &quot;No one has bothered to find out what is actually desirable about a low-carbon lifestyle&quot; \u2013 and so our visions fall rather flat. &quot;People are supposed to think eating healthily is desirable. It&apos;s not. What&apos;s desirable is what comes from healthy eating: having better sex, feeling lighter, having more energy and so on.&quot; The trick then, is to identify ways in which we unconsciously associate living greener lives with ones that are more pleasurable and satisfying, too \u2013 and which bring us closer to our neighbours and our friends, enjoying the fruits of a shared endeavour. It really does seem to be as simple \u2013 and as challenging \u2013 as that. How not to do it... Despite mountains of evidence that the fear factor fails to win hearts and minds, governments and greenies alike keep pressing the scary button. As part of its widely derided &apos;Act on CO2&apos; campaign, the UK Government blew a reported \u00a36 million on a series of ads themed around nursery rhymes. Picture two children peering into a stone well against an arid backdrop, with copy lines which read: &quot;Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. There was none as extreme weather due to climate change had caused a drought.&quot; Then it added: &quot;It&apos;s our children that will really pay the price.&quot; Effective? &quot;It&apos;s a perfect example of everything that can be done wrong&quot;, says Townsend. &quot;First, it tells people they&apos;re bad parents \u2013 never a good thing to do when you&apos;re trying to get them on your side. And it creates a sense of fear without first giving people a sense of agency \u2013 a belief that they can do something about it. That&apos;s actually been shown to suppress immune systems. So is it any wonder that people respond by going deep into denial? That&apos;s a pretty natural reaction and I have enormous sympathy with it. You&apos;ve just dumped a whole bucket-load of fear and guilt on them and told them their children will suffer, for heaven&apos;s sake!&quot; It&apos;s a telling comment which highlights just how damaging scare tactics can be. &quot;By raising fear, without raising a sense of agency, we are making people more stressed, more worried, less healthy and less likely to take positive action. I actually use [those ads] as an object lesson in how not to do it&quot;, says Townsend. &quot;They were that bad.&quot; Schoolchildren were also the subject of another high profile flop last year, but this time they weren&apos;t going thirsty, they were being blown up. As was Gillian Anderson (star of The X Files), and ex-footballer David Ginola. The viral video, directed by Richard Curtis for the one year anniversary of the well-respected and \u2013 until that point \u2013 largely successful 10:10 campaign, shows a variety of people dying in an explosion of blood and gore after they confessed to not doing their bit on climate change. It ends with the caption: &quot;Cut your Carbon by 10%. No pressure.&quot; Intended to be hip, witty and ironic, it rebounded spectacularly. It succeeded in portraying environmentalists as guilt tripping, callous and vindictive \u2013 exactly the colours in which climate change deniers had been painting them for years. The video was promptly pulled by 10:10, but the damage had been done.", "tags": ["GSB Editorial Network", "Guardian sustainable business", "Behaviour", "Communication"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-12T16:39:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/13/rafael-nadal-andy-murray-rome-masters", "sentences": ["Last year, [he won] Toronto and Shanghai and he has a good chance for a lot of points [to qualify for the World Tour Finals]."], "title": "Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray win to reach semi-finals of Rome Masters", "article": "The good news for Rafael Nadal and tennis is that his mysterious fever looks to have passed like a zephyr in the night. The not quite so thrilling news for those left in the mix here in Rome, including Andy Murray, is that he is more determined than ever, after recent embarrassments, to go to Paris with his Masters title tucked away in his suitcase. &quot;Much better today,&quot; was his verdict on a virus that has struck him down twice in the past two years, in Switzerland and more dramatically at the Australian Open in January. He is neither sure what it is, when it will strike nor how viciously it will bring him down. &quot;It has no name,&quot; he says. For now, he is smiling again. &quot;[On Thursday] I felt bad at the start but, at the end of the day, I started to feel a little bit better. Today I was able to move faster, play more aggressive. The legs were strong, and the shots.&quot; Nadal, not quite back to his best, was still too good for the Croat Marin Cilic, winning their quarter-final 6-1, 6-3 in an hour and 25 minutes. Earlier on the Campo Centrale, in killing midday heat that grew steadily more oppressive, Murray took nine minutes longer to beat the unseeded and unorthodox Florian Mayer 1-6, 6-1, 6-1. &quot;He&apos;s a very tough player,&quot; Murray said. &quot;He hit probably 90% of his backhands cross court and his slice was with two hands on the racket. He had a pretty good variation with that, a very tricky guy to play against.&quot; Murray would relish a final against Nadal, having played some of the best tennis of his impossibly erratic season when losing to the Spaniard in their semi-final in Monte Carlo. Nadal, similarly, would enjoy another big-match workout against an opponent who invariably gives him a good physical as well as cerebral argument. First he must negotiate a semi-final on Saturday against the Frenchman for whom the word enigma might have been invented, Richard Gasquet. He beat Tomas Berdych 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in a tight quarter-final. &quot;I don&apos;t see any reason why Andy cannot play well on clay,&quot; Nadal said, echoing a widely held sentiment. &quot;He has all the potential to play well on this surface, good movement. It&apos;s more mental than anything, but I think he&apos;s having a very positive time, playing consistently, semi-finals in Monte Carlo, semi-finals here. He lost [in Madrid] against Thomaz Bellucci, but Bellucci was playing fantastic. &quot;He didn&apos;t play well after Australia, but now he&apos;s playing well in our time and, for him, the second part of the season was always better than the first part. Last year, [he won] Toronto and Shanghai and he has a good chance for a lot of points [to qualify for the World Tour Finals]. He&apos;s doing great. He would like his chances to be in the top 10.&quot; Murray seems to have recovered from his elbow niggle and has already turned his season around considerably from an appallingly low base. While few would fancy him to win the tournament, becoming the first British player in 79 years to reach the semi-finals of what used to be known as the Italian championships has given his revival the stamp of history. It might not matter much to a modern audience that George Hughes, better known to his friends as Pat and Fred Perry&apos;s occasional doubles partner, won the 1931 equivalent, in Milan, and got to the final the following year, but Murray gets a lift from it. Anyone who has witnessed the Caledonian rollercoaster without the breaks on will appreciate that he takes comfort from such intangibles. If Murray has heard of Hughes, though, it would be a surprise. He had not heard much about Mayer, apart from the word on the grapevine that he was a very tricky customer indeed. He beat good opponents in J\u00fcrgen Melzer and Juan Ignacio Chela to reach his sixth ATP World Tour quarter-final of the year. Although Murray hit only five unforced errors in the first set, he was pleased to come back from an exacting opening in which the tall, athletic German caught him off-guard with his tough-to-read ground strokes and a deceptively languid service action. When Nadal emerged on the same court soon afterwards, the temperature had risen further and so had the stakes. Defeat for the world No1 after dropping a set to Feliciano L\u00f3pez in the third round, and his travails against Novak Djokovic, would have dealt player and tournament a serious blow. A certain stability would seem to have returned the past day or so. Whether or not it stays like that is part of the game&apos;s current fascination.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Rafael Nadal", "Andy Murray", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-13T18:21:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/14/science-fiction-authors-interviews", "sentences": ["JG Ballard 1930-2009 As I wrote Empire of the Sun I could see the way in which the landscapes of Shanghai had permeated all my previous novels in disguised form, and it always struck me as odd that I should have waited 40 years to write about my wartime experiences.", "But I realise now that I probably was writing about them all the time, and that one of the reasons I chose to write science fiction at the beginning was that it offered me a way in which I could remake the landscapes of the England I knew in the 1960s and 1970s, in the way that the surrealists worked, to make them resemble unconsciously the landscapes of wartime Shanghai.", "Did\u00a0you read it as a child in Shanghai, for example?", "At the same time I read an enormous number of American comics because Shanghai was an American zone of influence.", "At the school I attended, the clergyman who ran the cathedral school in Shanghai would give lines to the boys as a punishment."], "title": "Great voices of science fiction", "article": "Douglas Adams 1952-2001 Where did the idea for The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy come from? DA: Various different places. The actual title came when I was hitchhiking round Europe in 1971. I was lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck \u2013 I&apos;ve now told the story so often, I can only remember the story and I can&apos;t remember the event any more, so I have to take my own word for it that it&apos;s true \u2013 I was lying drunk in this field in Innsbruck and I had with me a copy of the Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to Europe. And it occurred to me as I stared up at the night sky that somebody ought to write a hitchhiker&apos;s guide to the galaxy. I think this is largely because I thought that Innsbruck was dull. But had you been keen on science fiction before, was it your thing? DA: Yes and no. I&apos;ve started most science fiction books but only got to about page 10, I&apos;m afraid, usually. So Hitchhiker&apos;s got rather more to do with Monty Python than it has Asimov? DA: In a way I think so, yes. Python was a huge, huge influence on me. Python sketches would create a new world, with a new set of rules. That really was the line I was taking. Let&apos;s start out with a world that has certain rules and just see where that goes in the long run. Something that starts out as a silly idea actually has to have consequences in the real world. Did the names of the characters mean anything \u2013 Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod? DA: They were just made up. I used to be a great fan of doing crosswords. When you&apos;re fiddling around with anagrams, you get wonderful jumbles of syllables that become interesting. It was one of the most perfect radio creations, wasn&apos;t it? Because it leaves an awful lot to the imagination, although you&apos;re leading the listener there. DA: Absolutely. To be honest, the reason I did it on radio to begin with was because at that point I was too junior to do television. But that was the best thing that could possibly have happened to me, because I discovered what a wonderful, extraordinary medium radio is. Let&apos;s talk about computers, how many have you got? DA: I haven&apos;t counted them recently I&apos;m afraid. An awful lot? DA: A lot, yes. What do you imagine the computer is going to do for us in the 21st century \u2013 how much more? Well I think one of the major effects it has had is in changing the whole way in which we do science. Ever since Newton we&apos;ve done science by taking things apart to see how they work. What the computer enables us to do is to put things together to see how they work, we&apos;re now synthesised rather than analysed. I find one of the most enthralling aspects of computers is limitless communication. I mean, I now use a great deal of the internet, 20 million different computers in the world are all connected together via this thing called the internet and it means you can exchange ideas, letters, programs, music, anything you like, just from your computer keyboard. But when you begin to talk about the machine almost replacing the human brain, then one begins to think is the human brain outdated? Is that what you&apos;re saying? This phrase &quot;virtual reality&quot; needs to be explained, because in fact we all live in virtual reality. We think that the world is a solid, vivid place, full of shape and colour and solid objects like this table and this microphone and so on, but we actually create that in our heads out of the bits of information that hit the back of our eyeballs, or hit our eardrums, or hit our tongues, or whatever. It&apos;s very raw data, and we have wonderful pattern-matching systems inside our head that we use to synthesise the world, which we then move and walk through. But there are all sorts of things we don&apos;t see, we don&apos;t hear, patterns we fail to respond to, things that get filtered out because they were not appropriate to cavemen. What the computer in virtual reality enables us to do is to recalibrate ourselves so that we can start seeing those pieces of information that are invisible to us but have become important for us to understand. Isaac Asimov 1920-1992 Time magazine described you as an incurable explainaholic. Is that the most important part of your work, understanding things and passing that understanding on to other people? IA: Yes, it is. Everything I write is intended to enlighten, even my science fiction. That doesn&apos;t mean, you understand, that it does enlighten, but that&apos;s its intention. Obviously you&apos;ve got a way of explaining things. Is that something that\u00a0just came naturally to you, or do you have to work at it? IA: Apparently, it came naturally, because I followed the great principle of trying to explain something sufficiently simply so that I could understand it. My feeling was that if I could, anyone could. How many books have you written now? IA: It bothers me a lot, because I&apos;ve become really freakish. My total number of published books right now is 444. And a few more on the stocks I suppose. A couple of dozen. Science fiction is probably the thing for which you&apos;re most famous, and among your science fiction writings the Foundation series is perhaps one of the favourites. Could you very briefly sketch the background to that? IA: Back in the 1940s I decided to write a series of historical stories of the future, a tale of the fall of the galactic empire and the interregnum that came before the rise of the second galactic empire, and I&apos;ll tell you frankly, I got the idea from Gibbon&apos;s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. So I wrote story after story for about eight years, then got tired and quit. They put them together into three books, Foundation, Foundation and Empire and Second Foundation in the early 50s, and I felt that was it. I went on to other work. But little by little the pressure has built enormously and Doubleday, my publisher, insisted I write another one. So, in 1981, I wrote another Foundation novel, the fourth, and it was a huge success \u2013 and after that I was sunk because Doubleday insisted I keep on\u00a0going. The thing that comes out of the Foundation series is this science \u2013 I suppose you can call it a science \u2013 of &quot;psychohistory&quot;. Can you explain that? IA: I got that idea from the kinetic theory of gases, which I was studying when I first started the Foundation series. You can&apos;t tell what an individual molecule is going to do, but if you deal with trillions and quadrillions and quintillions, you can tell very accurately what they&apos;re going to do on average. I thought maybe you could do that with human beings too. You could tell what huge masses of human beings would do, provided they didn&apos;t know what the predictions were so they couldn&apos;t distort their own behaviour, and provided you had a large\u00a0enough number, and I felt that with the galactic empire you&apos;d have a large enough number. I don&apos;t really believe it&apos;s going to work, but it made a good background for the stories, and I was always able to use my &quot;psychohistory&quot;\u00a0to show how things became inevitable, economically or sociologically and so on. It made for interesting historical novels. I think a few people will be disappointed\u00a0to hear that you don&apos;t really believe that &quot;psychohistory&quot; will work.\u00a0Is it just that there aren&apos;t enough people on Earth? IA: Not only are there not enough people, but actually their behaviour is far too complicated. They&apos;re not like individual molecules. Molecules have limited modes of behaviour and human beings are far less limited, so that human history is more chaotic. In fact, so chaotic that it probably can never be predicted, and in my later Foundation novels I dragged this in. But of course when I first started I didn&apos;t know anything about this new theory of chaos. Do you think that we&apos;re going to overcome the problems of overpopulation and the environment? IA: That&apos;s hard to say, but if we do \u2013 let&apos;s say we do \u2013 we&apos;re going to develop a space-centred civilisation. We&apos;re going to expand throughout the solar system. We&apos;re going to have a kind of computerised world in which the concept of work will change, the concept of education will change. Things will be so completely different that it will\u00a0seem to us that with the beginning of the 21st\u2011century humanity ceased being children and became adults. Arthur C Clarke 1917-2008 What was the first branch of science to interest you? ACC: Originally, I think, palaeontology. I collected fossils and had a small collection. I had a mammoth&apos;s tooth. What was your first job when you left\u00a0school? ACC: I went straight into the civil service, into the exchequer and audit department, and came to London and worked first in Whitehall, at the old Board of Education, and then went to the Post Office, and then the war began and we were evacuated. I was then with the Ministry of Food. We were evacuated to North Wales and then I went from there into the air force. In 1945, while still in uniform, you wrote a piece about communication satellites. ACC: Yes, this was the paper which started the com sat business. I wrote it early in 1945 and it was published in Wireless World in October, just after the war had ended, and it laid down the principles which now determine the world&apos;s communication system, the idea that you&apos;d have satellites poised at such a height above the earth that they remained stationery in the sky and so-called synchronous, or geostationary, orbit. Did anybody take your idea up and get excited about it? ACC: A few people got excited about it. I know that the Americans did first and I have reason to believe that this was one of the stimuli which started the American satellite programme off. What happened to you when you left the Royal Air Force? ACC: I decided not to go back to the civil service, but to take a degree, and I went to Kings College London, and I took my degree in physics and pure and applied maths and some postgraduate work in astronomy. I then became a science editor and worked with the Institute of Electrical Engineers as editor of Science Abstracts, the chief scientific abstracting journal. Who were the pioneers of science fiction \u2013 HG Wells of course. ACC: And Jules Verne, and in this country particularly Olaf Stapledon, who wrote a magnificent history of the future called Last and First Men, which I discovered soon after it was published in 1930. This book, the history of the next 2,000m years, had more influence on me than anything else I&apos;d ever read. It opened my mind to the possibilities of time and space, and directly influenced many of my early books. With scientific progress moving so fast, it must be a job keeping in advance of the real thing. ACC: It&apos;s almost impossible. Many of the things that I&apos;ve described have become history \u2013 not in the way that I said, because I wrote a book in 1948 about the first landing on the moon, which I put in 1978. I thought it was ridiculous putting it only 30 years in the future, but in fact my deadline was\u00a0beaten. You commentated for American television on some of the Apollo missions, including the moon landing. ACC: Yes, I was actually at Cape Kennedy for the launch of several of the missions, including the historic Apollo 11, the first landing on the moon, and I was with Walter Cronkite during the commentary and that of course was an unforgettable experience. I&apos;ve met about half of the American astronauts and quite a few of the Russian cosmonauts. Your most celebrated work of course is 2001: A Space Odyssey, the story of the film. How did that project start? It started with a letter that Stanley Kubrick wrote to me, soon after Dr Strangelove had been released, saying that &quot;I&apos;ve been interested in doing the proverbial good science fiction movie and do you have any ideas on this subject?&quot; And I did have one or two ideas, and we got into correspondence and it so happened that I was coming to New York to work for Time Life on a book about space. I met Stanley and I moonlighted, or moonlit, with Stanley while I was working at Time Life. When that job finished, I went over full-time with Stanley and 2001 the novel was written actually in New York. JG Ballard 1930-2009 As I wrote Empire of the Sun I could see the way in which the landscapes of Shanghai had permeated all my previous novels in disguised form, and it always struck me as odd that I should have waited 40 years to write about my wartime experiences. But I realise now that I probably was writing about them all the time, and that one of the reasons I chose to write science fiction at the beginning was that it offered me a way in which I could remake the landscapes of the England I knew in the 1960s and 1970s, in the way that the surrealists worked, to make them resemble unconsciously the landscapes of wartime Shanghai. I could flood London and the drowned world, I could reshape the everyday reality of Britain, western Europe and the United States. You talk about science fiction and the way in which it gave you a form. How\u00a0consciously did you look for it? Did\u00a0you read it as a child in Shanghai, for example? JGB: I had a very mixed kind of childhood reading. I read the childhood classics like Robinson Crusoe, Alice in Wonderland, Chums Annual. At the same time I read an enormous number of American comics because Shanghai was an American zone of influence. It was Coca-Cola, it was American cars, commercial radio stations pumping out Superman serials every hour of the day and night. So it was a very mixed sort of cultural diet, rather similar to that which, say, a 10-year-old has in England today. Were you writing as a child? JGB: I started writing in a rather curious way. At the school I attended, the clergyman who ran the cathedral school in Shanghai would give lines to the boys as a punishment. They expected you to copy out say 20 or 30 pages from one of the school texts. But I found that rather than laboriously copying out something from a novel by Charles Dickens, it was easier if I made it up myself. I remember handing in this bundle of paper to the master, who after glancing through it overnight called me to the front of the class the next day and said: &quot;Ballard, the next time you pick a book to copy from, don&apos;t pick some piece of total rubbish.&quot; He didn&apos;t realise that this piece of mock GA Henty \u2013 Adventure on the Spanish Main \u2013 was my own entire invention. That set me off, and probably all my writing has been done\u00a0within the same seditious framework. No, I was writing through my teens at school. There have, of course, been a whole tradition of English writers who&apos;ve used science fiction forms \u2013 George Orwell and Aldous Huxley, also HG Wells at the beginning of the century. Do you see yourself as related to that tradition of writing? JGB: I&apos;d like to think so. I read Wells as a child. It&apos;s impossible to write science fiction without being aware of the shadow cast by Wells. What those novelists show is that one must think of science fiction as something not limited by the narrow definition it&apos;s been given by Dr Who, Star Trek, Star Wars and so on, and by the American writers of commercial SF in the 1950s and 60s. The scientific romance has long been part of English fiction, going back two or three centuries. Very few of the great British writers of the past have not at some point written something very close to science fiction. I think of science fiction as being part of the great river of imaginative fiction that has flowed through English literature, probably for 400 or 500 years, well predating modern science. You are the first writer I know of to have prophesied Ronald Reagan as president. Do you feel that&apos;s a genuine function of science fiction? JGB: I think science fiction always has had a predictive role, and many of its prophecies have come true. I don&apos;t think now, oddly enough, that the predictive function is the main task of SF \u2013 in the sense of the nuts and bolts of our lives. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the job of the science fiction writer any more to predict a new kind of air travel or a new kind of washing machine. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s on the level of technological change that science fiction has its greatest value. I think it&apos;s the psychological realm where SF is most valuable in its predictive functions, because what it does is to put the emotion into the future. It looks at our conscious and half-conscious responses to all sorts of trends that are flowing out of the future towards us. I think in its anticipation of this strange mental environments of the world of tomorrow that it has its greatest value now. Throughout your work there is an emphasis on psychological metamorphosis, on the way in which human beings change, first of all in relation to natural or manmade disasters and then in the work in the 1970s in relation to image society. How far do you think you&apos;re describing real psychological metamorphosis and how far is this a sort of metaphor? JGB: It&apos;s used metaphorically. Crash is a metaphor for what I see as the dehumanising elements that are present in the world in which we live. We&apos;re distanced by the nature of the society we inhabit from a normal human reaction. We&apos;re crossing some complex flyover in our cars, we perhaps see an accident on a lower level \u2013 people clustered around a fallen victim. We feel a moment&apos;s pity, but we&apos;re swept on by this elaborately signalled highway landscape. We have no time to stop and express our normal human feelings. And Crash is an extreme metaphor of the dangers that I see lying ahead of us. Kurt Vonnegut Jr 1922-2007 Your first novel, Player Piano, is set in the future although it seemed very much like your present, but what it did do was to tag you as a science fiction writer. Brian Aldiss said of your relationship to science fiction that you sped right out of the field as soon as you had the price for the gasoline, but that&apos;s not entirely true, because you do keep returning to it. What is the attraction of science fiction as a place to visit, if not a place to live, for you? KV: Well I actually live there, I just decline to say I&apos;m from there, because there are social consequences. We have the mainstream, and this is some little backwater. Science fiction writers customarily have written very fast and have not cared much about literary niceties or have not usually spent much time on drawing characters. How did the science fiction element come to be in Slaughterhouse-Five? KV: It&apos;s essentially an irrational act, as is skiing, and if you have to think about it, forget about it. You have to be lucky, and you have to be intuitive. And in order to be lucky you need a lot of time. Most people don&apos;t have it. That&apos;s why it&apos;s so tough to be a storywriter at night or on weekends, you need a continuous concentration. So I don&apos;t know why I did it, but it seemed like a good idea. I&apos;ve tried all kinds of things which the world had never seen \u2013 you know, [I thought] this is not a good idea and threw it in the wastebasket. And on Slaughterhouse-Five again and again and again I said, &quot;So it goes&quot;. If I&apos;d decide that was a bad idea, as many critics did, nobody ever would have seen it. I just would have crossed them out, you know, without asking anybody about it. Most of your novels, such as Hocus Pocus, seem to offer a kind of ironic commentary on America, or at least what America&apos;s become. Somewhere in you there seems to be a civics teacher. KV: I hope so. One thing I put in Hocus Pocus [was] about the Alamo, which is one of our great monuments. This is when a bunch of white men, Yankees, went down there and took property and were part of Mexico and operating under the Mexican government. Then they \u2013 our guys, the white guys \u2013 revolted and became an independent country, and after they became independent their first great battle was lost at the Alamo, which is this great monument to freedom. Well, the reason they stopped being part of Mexico was that Mexico said it&apos;s against the law in our country to have slaves. All you&apos;re ever told is that Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, the inventor of the Bowie knife, and all these other guys, fought to the death. It&apos;s never said what the hell they fought to the death for. It was for the right to own slaves! But how seriously should we take literature? You&apos;ve said on the one hand that it&apos;s harmless, but you&apos;ve also said that literature is like the canary in the coalmine. It keels over first as a warning. KV: The primitive Baptists and the lunatic right are right to be afraid of books with regard to children. If you think of yourself as a child, there&apos;s a period where you have no immunity to ideas. You develop that immunity later on. So I say that literature is a slow-acting poison, because a person will become infected when he or she is unable to defend himself against this infection. But then it&apos;s 20 more years before this person has any power in adult society. I was infected by the essentially socialist writers of the 1930s, Steinbeck and Upton Sinclair and so forth, and so that&apos;s what I am. It&apos;s in my bones. If it had been a disease, it would be a mortal disease. I have tried to infect young people with humanity \u2013 an unwillingness, a great reluctance to kill. It seems to me there&apos;s another horror in the books, and that is the America that you portray is an America without any sense of a real culture or real community. It&apos;s a fragmented world. KV: It is. America&apos;s a very lonely society, because it&apos;s so mobile and because it&apos;s a nation of immigrants who don&apos;t have extended families, so there are all these people that, no matter what their trouble is, can only call the police department or the fire department. There&apos;s nobody else to ask for help. But if America is fragmented, so is your prose style. How come you chop it all up into sections instead of letting it flow?  KV: Because I&apos;m a teacher and I want people to pay attention. I don&apos;t want them to turn on the automatic pilot. If you deliver a classroom lecture, if you&apos;re a silver-tongued orator on any subject, and famous for this in the university, and other people come to listen, they&apos;ll listen to your voice. They&apos;re there for the music and not for the content. In order to make students pay attention to content you have to suddenly bang on the desk with your fist or get up and write on the blackboard, and if you&apos;re lucky the chalk will squeak, and the people will wake up and pay attention. It&apos;s a teaching problem. Of course, reviewers get old and realise this is all they&apos;ve done all their\u00a0lives. They have read book after book after book and they do want to turn on the automatic pilot and just go\u00a0through this thing as fast as possible. It&apos;s a gruesome job they have now, and so if I put in these impediments intended for book enjoyers, then for them it&apos;s a terrible inconvenience as they&apos;ve got to get on to another book right away. But I do this in order to make people pay attention. The big question is: &quot;Am I worth paying attention to or not?&quot; \u2013 and that&apos;s for God to say. I don&apos;t know.

Crusoe is an exile, and exile has proved a perennial theme within the genre of science fiction. Of all its great themes, lingering on the fringes of comprehension is Star Maker, by Olaf Stapledon (1882-1950). Stapledon was an exile, his childhood spent between Egypt and England. Star Maker is both illuminated and darkened by a feeling of not belonging, the essence of exile. It was published in 1937, when it received a rather chilly reception; the public did not know what to make of it. If it was influenced by Milton&apos;s Paradise Lost, it was doubtless also formed by the terror of the war against Nazi Germany, which was about to descend upon us. The opening sentence of Star Maker is: &quot;One night when I had tasted bitterness I went out on to the hill.&quot; The lonely voyager through the cosmos finds world after world, some worlds inhabited by races of bird-clouds, some by insect-like creatures, each of whose swarms form the bodies of a single mind. Such is the mystery of creation; what of the spirit itself? &quot;When I tried to probe the depths of my own being, I found impenetrable mystery.&quot; Something of which we all know but can hardly enunciate \u2013 certainly not as Stapledon does. The speaker, on its spiritual odyssey throughout creation, gains a cold, almost incomprehensible confrontation with the Star Maker itself. What can we make of this terrible thing creating and controlling entire galaxies? &quot;All passions, it seemed, were compromised within the spirit&apos;s temper: but mastered, icily gripped within the cold, clear, crystal ecstasy of contemplation.&quot; Stapledon&apos;s book embraces the firmament. Read it and you will be forever changed. Margaret AtwoodFahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury (1953) As a young teenager, I devoured Ray Bradbury&apos;s Fahrenheit 451 by flashlight. It gave me nightmares. In the early 1950s television was just rolling forth, and people sat mesmerised in front of their flickering sets, eating their dinners off TV trays. Surely, it was said, &quot;the family&quot; was doomed, since the traditional dinnertime was obsolete. Films and books too were about to fall victim to the new all-consuming medium. My own parents refused to get a TV, so I had to sneak over to friends&apos; houses to gape at The Ed Sullivan Show. But when not doing that, I fed my reading addiction, whenever, however, whatever. Hence Fahrenheit 451. In this riveting book, books themselves are condemned \u2013 all books. The very act of reading is considered detrimental to social order because it causes people to think, and then to distrust the authorities. Instead of books the public is offered conformity via four-wall TV, with the sound piped directly into their heads via shell-shaped earbuds (a brilliant proleptic leap on the part of Bradbury). Montag, the main character, is a &quot;Fireman&quot;: his job is to burn each and every book uncovered by the state&apos;s spies and informers. But little by little Montag gets converted to reading, and finally joins the underground: a dedicated band of individuals sworn to preserve world literature by becoming the living\u00a0repositories of the books they have memorised. Fahrenheit 451 predated Marshall McLuhan and his theories about how media shape people, not just the reverse. We interact with our creations, and they themselves act upon us. Now that we&apos;re in the midst of a new wave of innovative media technologies, it&apos;s time to reread this classic, which poses the eternal questions: who and how do we want to be? Stephen BaxterHothouse by Brian Aldiss (1961) Billions of years hence, the sun hangs swollen and unmoving in the sky. Across Earth&apos;s sunward face a riotous jungle is dominated by a single continent-spanning banyan tree. And in the canopy, Gren, an adult at nine years old, the size of a small monkey, is one of the last humans: &quot;[Earth] was no longer a place for mind. It was a place for growth, for vegetables. It was a hothouse.&quot; When I first read Hothouse as a teenager I was thrilled by the vivid detail of Brian Aldiss&apos;s fecund far-future jungle, set within a grander Stapledonian vision of an Earth blooming in the light of its long evolutionary afternoon. The vividness surely derives from Aldiss&apos;s own youthful experiences; he served in the chaotic second world war theatres of Borneo and Sumatra. Meanwhile the book&apos;s depiction of a devolved mankind in a wistful far-futurity recalls scenes from HG Wells&apos;s The Time Machine \u2013 Aldiss has always been a great Wellsian. This is a very British evocation. In the hands of an American author there might have been some way out; Gren might have been allowed to discover ancient machineries, to reconquer the Earth. Aldiss, like Wells, is pitiless: &quot;Man had rolled up his affairs and retired to the trees from whence he came.&quot; But the book was embraced by the Americans too; it won a Hugo award, science fiction&apos;s Oscar, named for Hugo Gernsback, king of the US pulp-fiction magazines. Looking at Hothouse now I can see foreshadows of Aldiss&apos;s later works; for example, it is an audacious exercise in world-building, like the Helliconia trilogy of the 1980s. And I can admire its technical audacity. Its depiction of not-quite-human consciousness recalls Golding&apos;s The Inheritors. Hugely inventive, straddling genre forms and literary aspirations, and at once chilling and consoling in its long perspective, Aldiss&apos;s great book thrills me now as much as it did when I first discovered it some four decades ago. Lauren BeukesWatchmen by Alan Moore (1986-7) It took me years to read Watchmen. Every time I&apos;d get to the men in tights and the giant naked blue guy, I&apos;d think, &quot;Ack! Superhero comic!&quot; and put it down again. It wasn&apos;t that I was against comics. I&apos;d\u00a0read 2000AD Monthly religiously since 1989 and Alan Moore&apos;s The Ballad of Halo Jones, about a girl from an interplanetary ghetto who wanted to get &quot;out&quot;, was my favourite series of all. But I liked the dark, twisty stuff that had something to say about the world and superhero comics seemed tediously codified with no room for moral ambiguity. I should have known\u00a0better. What Moore does best, even at his silliest or most obtusely philosophical, is subvert. He uses story to crack open the dark places of the human soul like a crab shell, revealing the pasty meat within, and then pokes it with a cattleprod to see it writhe. He&apos;s the kind of writer who makes you feel very smart (Kitty Genovese and the moral bankruptcy of crowds in Watchmen, for example) and very stupid (a dozen obscure Victorian literature references interwoven into every page of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) at the same time. He pushes the medium. Every panel, every background detail, every interlude, whether a vaudeville song or a beat-style short story or seemingly wholly unrelated pirate horror comic, counts. He stretches the boundaries of storytelling in ways other writers wouldn&apos;t attempt, let alone pull off \u2013 and does it with a ferocious social conscience that challenges everything we are. And when he has a mind to, when he&apos;s not off on some grand mal meditation on the nature of magic or sexual desire or what stories mean, Moore tells the perfect story. Inventive. Surprising. Original. Utterly devastating. From being the comic I couldn&apos;t read, Watchmen became the narrative I hold up as what fiction can be. John Clute City by Clifford D Simak (1952) We know better now, of course. But they still entrance us, the old page-turners from the glory days of American SF, half a century or so ago, when the world was full of futures we were never going to have. In the mid-1940s, when he began to publish the episodes that would be assembled as City in 1952, Clifford Simak, a Minneapolis-based journalist and author, could still carry us away with the dream that cars and pollution and even the great cities of the world \u2013 &quot;Huddling Place&quot;, the title of one of these tales, is his own derisory term for them \u2013 would soon be brushed off the map by Progress, leaving nothing behind but tasteful exurbs filled with middle-class nuclear families living the good life, with fishing streams and greenswards sheltering each home from the stormy blast. Fortunately, Simak soon gets past this demented vision of a near-future world saved by technological fixes, a dementia common then to SF writers and gurus and politicians alike, and launches into an astonishingly eventful\u00a0narrative of the next 10,000 years as seen through the eyes of one family and the immortal robot Jenkins, and all told with a weird pastoral serenity that for a kid like me seemed near to godlike. In its course City touches on almost everything dear to 1940s SF, and to me remembering. Robots. Genetic Engineering. Space. Jupiter. Domed cities. Keeps. Hiveminds. Matter transmission. Telepathy. Parallel worlds. Paranormal empathy. Mutants. Supermen. It&apos;s all there, and, thanks to Simak&apos;s skilled hand at the wheel, it&apos;s all in place: suave, sibylline, swift. The whole is framed as a series of legends told by the uplifted Dogs who have replaced the human race, now gone for ever. They have been bred not to kill. At the end, only Jenkins remains to keep them from learning how to repeat history and die. It all seemed immensely sad and wise then, but fun. It still does. Jon Courtenay GrimwoodLight by M John Harrison (2002) Light is the kind of novel other writers read and think: &quot;Why don&apos;t I just give up and go home?&quot; That was certainly my first reaction on reading its mix of coldly perfect prose and attractively twisted insanity. It&apos;s also the only book to bring me unpleasantly close to sympathising with a serial killer. But this is M John Harrison: so antihero Michael Kearney is a mathematically brilliant, dice-throwing, reality-changing hyper-intelligent serial killer haunted by a horse-skulled personal demon. Harrison&apos;s genius is to tie Kearney&apos;s narrative thread to those of Seria Mau \u2013 a far-future girl existing in harmony with White Cat, her spaceship, surfing a part of the galaxy known as the Kefahuchi Tract \u2013 and Chinese Ed, a sleazy if likeable cyberpunky chancer with a passion for virtual sex. This is not a kind book, or even a particularly likeable book. But then I suspected it was never intended to be, and the author wouldn&apos;t want the kind of people who want to like characters as his readers anyway. What it is is stunningly written, meticulously plotted, hallucinogenically realised and brutally honest. No one who reads\u00a0it could doubt that Harrison might win the Booker if he could be\u00a0bothered. Light is also the book that novelist and critic Adam Roberts was so sure would win the Arthur C Clarke award, he offered to change his name to Adam Van Hoogenroberts if it didn&apos;t. We&apos;re still waiting . . . Andrew CrumeyThe Brick Moon by Edward Everett Hale (1870) The term &quot;science fiction&quot; hadn&apos;t been invented in 1870, when the American magazine Atlantic Monthly published the first part of Edward Everett Hale&apos;s delightfully eccentric novella The Brick Moon. Readers lacked a ready-made pigeonhole for it, confronted by a fantasy about a group of visionaries who decide to make a 200-ft wide sphere of house-bricks, paint it white, and launch it into orbit. Jules Verne&apos;s From the Earth to the Moon had appeared five years earlier, so Hale&apos;s work was not unprecendented, but while Verne chose to send his voyagers aloft using a giant cannon, Hale opts for the equally unfeasible but somehow more pleasing solution of a giant flywheel. Hale gives technical details and calculations to support the plausibility of the venture. He even works out the total cost of the bricks ($60,000). There is an info-dump about latitude and longitude: the brick moon is designed to orbit from pole to pole so\u00a0that people anywhere can determine their location by observing it. There are ruminations and speculations \u2013 and, to be honest, quite a few longeurs, even in a compass of only 25,000 words. But crucially there is humour. The brick moon gets launched accidentally with some people inside. Those left behind watch\u00a0through telescopes as the travellers make their own little world, communicating by writing signs in big letters. They grow plants, hold church services, and their brick moon becomes a tiny, charming parody of\u00a0Earth. The Brick Moon did not appear in\u00a0book form until 1899, when Hale was\u00a0in his 70s, by which time HG\u00a0Wells\u00a0had appeared on the scene and Hale was slipping into obscurity. Nowadays he is little more than a footnote, remembered for having been\u00a0the first to imagine artificial satellites. But what makes The Brick Moon still worth reading is not scientific vision, but sheer joyful quirkiness. William GibsonThe Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester (1957) The idea of literary &quot;favourites&quot; makes me uneasy, but Alfred Bester&apos;s 1957 novel The Stars My Destination has remained very close to the top of my list for science fiction, since I first discovered it as a child (though I much prefer Bester&apos;s original title Tiger, Tiger, which was evidently deemed too arthouse for the trade). Bester was an urbane and successful Mad Av dandy, an anomaly among American SF writers of his day, and his best work is deliciously redolent of the brains and flash and bustle of postwar Manhattan. TSMD is a retelling of Dumas&apos;s The Count of Monte Cristo, its protagonist one Gully Foyle, lumpenprole untermensch turned revenging angel in a world utterly transformed by the discovery that teleportation is a natural and teachable human talent. Perfectly surefooted, elegantly pulpy, dizzying in its pace and sweep, TSMD is still as much fun as anything I&apos;ve ever read. When I was lifting the literary equivalent of weights, in training for my own first novel, it was my talisman: evidence of how many different kinds of ass one quick narrative could kick. And that sheen of exuberant postwar modernism? They just aren&apos;t making any more of that. Ursula K Le GuinVirginia Woolf (1882\u20131941) You can&apos;t write science fiction well if you haven&apos;t read it, though not all who try to write it know this. But nor can you write it well if you haven&apos;t read anything else. Genre is a rich dialect, in which you can say certain things in a particularly satisfying way, but if it gives up connection with the general literary language it becomes a jargon, meaningful only to an ingroup. Useful models may be found quite outside the genre. I learned a lot from reading the ever-subversive Virginia Woolf. I was 17 when I read Orlando. It was half-revelation, half-confusion to me at that age, but one thing was clear: that she imagined a society vastly different from our own, an exotic world, and brought it dramatically alive. I&apos;m thinking of the Elizabethan scenes, the winter when the Thames froze over. Reading, I was there, saw the bonfires blazing in the ice, felt the marvellous strangeness of that moment 500 years ago \u2013 the authentic thrill of being taken absolutely elsewhere. How did she do it? By precise, specific descriptive details, not heaped up and not explained: a vivid, telling imagery, highly selected, encouraging the reader&apos;s imagination to fill out the picture and see it luminous, complete. In Flush, Woolf gets inside a dog&apos;s mind, that is, a non-human brain, an alien mentality \u2013 very science-fictional if you look at it that way. Again what I learned was the power of accurate, vivid, highly selected detail. I imagine Woolf looking down at the dog asleep beside the ratty armchair she wrote in and thinking what are your dreams? and listening . . . sniffing the wind . . . after the rabbit, out on the hills, in the dog&apos;s timeless world. Useful stuff, for those who like to see through eyes other than our own. Russell HobanHP Lovecraft (1890\u20131937) The main thing about HP Lovecraft is his too-muchness; he never uses three adjectives when five will do, but he writes words that haunt the memory: &quot;In his house at R&apos;lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.&quot; My recall of the multiplication table is shaky but those words disquiet me today as freshly as when I first read them. Where did dead Cthulhu come from? Why did he rise up from the murky depths of Lovecraft&apos;s mental ocean? I say it&apos;s because there is a need for him and the rest of the maestro&apos;s monsters. Why is there such an appetite, such a hunger for scary stories and films? I think there is a primal horror in us. From where? From the Big Bang when Something came out of Nothing? From the nothingness we must become at life&apos;s end? I don&apos;t know, but I know it&apos;s there and we like to dress it up with a bolt through its neck or a black rubber alien suit; or as Cthulhu. Get a load of this: &quot;A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings&quot;, with elements of &quot;an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature&quot;, &quot;but it was the general outline of the whole that made it most shockingly frightful&quot;. Close your eyes and try to imagine this creature of non-Darwinian evolution. Just the look of this bozo is already a major horror, and we&apos;re not even into the story yet. While he&apos;s dead and dreaming in his house at R&apos;lyeh (&quot;Dun Foamin&quot;?) his Cthulhuvibes are spreading worldwide and causing strange rites and observances here and there. Lovecraft is not everybody&apos;s mug of Ovaltine but I have always found him horribly cosy. Liz JensenThe Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham (1951)  As a teenager, one of my favourite haunts was Oxford&apos;s Botanical Gardens. I&apos;d head straight for the vast heated greenhouses, where I&apos;d pity my adolescent plight, chain-smoke, and glory in the insane vegetation that burgeoned there. The more rampant, brutally spiked, poisonous, or cruel to insects a plant was, the more it appealed to me. I&apos;d shove my butts into their root systems. They could take it. My librarian mother disapproved mightily of the fags but when under interrogation I confessed where I&apos;d been hanging out \u2013 hardly Sodom and Gomorrah \u2013 she spotted a literary opportunity, and slid John Wyndham&apos;s The Day of the Triffids my way. I read it in one sitting, fizzing with the excitement of recognition. I knew the triffids already: I&apos;d spent long hours in the jungle with them, exchanging gases. Wyndham loved to address the question that triggers every invented world: the great &quot;What if . . .&quot; What if a carnivorous, travelling, communicating, poison-spitting oil-rich plant, harvested in Britain as biofuel, broke loose after a mysterious &quot;comet-shower&quot; blinded most of the population? That&apos;s the scenario faced by triffid-expert Bill Masen, who finds himself a sighted man in a sightless nation. Cataclysmic change established, cue a magnificent chain reaction of experimental science, physical and political crisis, moral dilemmas, new hierarchies, and hints of a new world order. Although the repercussions of an unprecedented crisis and Masen&apos;s personal journey through the new wilderness form the backbone of the story, it&apos;s the triffids that root themselves most firmly in the reader&apos;s memory. Wyndham described them botanically, but he left enough room for the reader&apos;s imagination to take over. The result being that everyone who reads The Day of the Triffids creates, in their mind&apos;s eye, their own version of fiction&apos;s most iconic plant. Mine germinated in an Oxford greenhouse, in a cloud of cigarette smoke. Hari KunzruRoadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky (1972) Soviet-era Russian science fiction deserves a wider audience in English. The Strugatsky brothers collaborated on numerous novels and stories, the best known of which is this, partly because it was filmed by Andrei Tarkovsky as Stalker, in 1977. The novel takes place 10 years after a mysterious alien visitation, which seems to have no rational explanation. No one saw the visitors. Their presence caused disease and blindness in the areas where they landed. Now, in the six &quot;Zones&quot;, the laws of physics (and, seemingly, of reality) are disturbed by anomalies, and littered with inexplicable, deadly wreckage. Only a few brave &quot;stalkers&quot; risk their lives to enter the zones to gather alien artefacts for sale. Some of these artefacts offer the promise of extraordinary powers. Unlike Tarkovsky&apos;s film, which concentrates on the hallucinatory, vacated landscape of the zones, the novels portray a society adapting to an inexplicable, terrifying event, an eruption of the unknown. Though written in 1971 and published in English in 1977, the novel was heavily bowdlerised by Soviet censors, and an authoritative text wasn&apos;t available in Russian until 2000. It&apos;s a book with an extraordinary atmosphere \u2013 and a demonstration of how science fiction, by using a single bold central metaphor, can open up the possibilities of the novel. Kelly LinkDiana Wynne Jones (1934\u20132011) I can&apos;t pick just one book by Diana Wynne Jones. She wrote so many books, all of them essential, and funny, and weird, and true. She mixed up fantasy and science fiction and the domestic so that unhappy families and awkward adolescents got smooshed up, quite believably, with mythological figures, extraterrestrial powers, and all other sorts of dangerous beasties. I was already a science-fiction reader before I found Dogsbody. But I might have outgrown science fiction quickly, moved on to books about horses and girls and high schools, if it weren&apos;t for books such as Dogsbody and The Homeward Bounders and Archer&apos;s Goon, and if it weren&apos;t for characters such as Kathleen, who rescues a puppy and falls in love with a star, and Jamie, who spies on a dangerous game that They are playing, and Howard, with his two very complicated families. Wynne Jones&apos;s books are often literally about other worlds, but her characters belong very firmly to this one. They are eccentric, flamboyant, pragmatic, lonely, sometimes selfish, often stubborn, always recognisable. How they navigate the territory that they find themselves in is, I suppose, a kind of metaphor for the process of growing up. But I&apos;m grown up now, and have a child of my own, and I rely on her books, her pinprick insights into familial relationships, her astonishing way of seeing the worlds. Ken MacLeodA Canticle for Liebowitz by Walter M Miller Jr (1960) Walter M Miller Jr&apos;s A Canticle for Liebowitz is one of the few SF novels to have won lasting mainstream literary acceptance. It is also one of the very few SF novels to present the Roman Catholic church in a kindly light. Its premise is straightforward: centuries after our civilisation self-destructs in a nuclear war, the church preserves fragments of its scientific knowledge in the desert monasteries of a battered America. A Jewish convert, the engineer Liebowitz, played a major part in saving books from the anti-science backlash after the war. These ancient texts \u2013 the Memorabilia \u2013 spark a new Renaissance, to eventually reboot an industrial civilisation more advanced than ours. This civilisation, in its turn . . . but you&apos;re ahead of me, yes? So is the church, which this time takes its remnant \u2013 and the vastly expanded Memorabilia \u2013 to the stars. This millennial tale is told in close-up. We follow monks reverently copying diagrams they don&apos;t understand, and venerating relics we know to be detritus. We hear litanies in which Fallout is the name of a demon. Dramatic ironies multiply as the first of the new scientists scoffs at an abbot&apos;s quaint belief in evolution. And although the successor civilisation has interstellar colonies, the texture of its daily, earthly life is the same as ours, or rather that of the 1960s: cars, television, communications satellites, cold war, nuclear tensions. This isn&apos;t a failure of imagination: Miller was, as his many short stories show, well capable of imagining far-future worlds. It&apos;s a dramatic device to bring us to the most chillingly science-fictional recognition of all: that our civilisation, too, is one of post-catastrophe recovery. We smile at the monks of the Order of Liebowitz, laboriously inking in a blueprint instead of just copying the lines, but the joke is on us. We&apos;re Rome, rebooted. China Mi\u00e9villeThe Island of Doctor Moreau by HG Wells (1896) In his own thoroughly strange 1946 novel Life Comes to Seathorpe, Neil Bell appropriates the term &quot;rare books&quot; to designate members of a new, dissident literary canon. A book, he says, is rare if &quot;[i]t stood by itself . . . among all books . . . [and] was in a way unique.&quot;\u00a0Of those mooncalf, ill-fitting, ineffably strange examples he lists, his first and most outstanding is The Island of Doctor Moreau. He is right. This short, merciless novel of a vivisectionist&apos;s efforts to remake beasts as humans is a shattering text. A peerless piece of science fictional horror, saturated with wrongness all the more powerful for its cold prose, it doesn&apos;t evoke so much as demand visceral, social, philosophical dread. Wells was always politically the most interesting and cantankerous of the Fabians, but, as so often, the critiques, contradictions and catastrophes in his fiction go further by far than those in his self-consciously political non-fiction. Like all worthwhile fiction, the book evades allegorical reduction, but among the phenomena it is &quot;about&quot;, one, ostentatiously, is colonialism. It oscillates in extraordinary superposition between two countervailing critiques of empire: one we might roughly gloss as reactionary \u2013 that those colonised cannot be &quot;civilised&quot;; the other more radical \u2013 that the colonial project is a nightmarish House of Pain. Like its earlier close relative Frankenstein, Moreau is regularly traduced as a warning against hubris, of the dangers of Meddling With Things that Should Be Left Alone, and so on. In fact, both texts are rebukes to that tedious and craven fingerwagging \u2013 though, published a mere biblical lifespan apart, in poignantly opposed ways. Where for Shelley monstrousness arises out of Frankenstein&apos;s refusal to engage with the social reality of what he has done, for Wells, it is brutal, ongoing engagement itself that is the cause of the horror. Frankenstein warns of disaster if we fail the Enlightenment: in nihilist Fabian terror, Moreau cries out that the Enlightenment has failed. Michael MoorcockThe Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester (1956) Bunyan&apos;s The Pilgrim&apos;s Progress was the first book I bought with my own money. It made such a strong impression on me that, still a convinced agnostic, I started out believing a book should have at least two levels and contain some sort of moral element. Christian learning to be a decent man by facing the dangers and temptations of the world was a pretty good lesson for a would-be writer. I searched out other visionary texts. Milton&apos;s Paradise Lost was the natural successor and a subtler one, for here the villain is enormously attractive and appeals to all our emotions, including pity. Blake made up the initial three. Magnificent visions, strong moral voices. Christian&apos;s adventures are dreamlike and powerful and possess some tremendous prose. The book contains everything I came to look for in imaginative fiction, even when an author denied he had no specific moral purpose. In science fiction such as Alfred Bester&apos;s The Stars My Destination, the author refuses allegory (though not idealism) and insists all he&apos;s doing is telling a romantic story based on The Count of Monte Cristo, set in the future, but I already found a little more to it when I read it in Paris at the age of 16, sitting outside Shakespeare and Co, having earned the money to buy it from busking. Bester&apos;s predictions included a world where all the powerful aristocratic families carry the names of Heinz, Chrysler, Sara Lee and most of the brands we are familiar with; a world where democracy has been subverted and strange cults, reflecting aspects of our modern world, have grown up. For me, it made as strong an impression as Bunyan and reminds me why the best science fiction still contains, as in Ballard, vivid imagery and powerful prose coupled to a strong moral vision. Patrick NessQuicksilver by Neal Stephenson (2003) Bypassing all requirements of &quot;importance&quot; or &quot;influence&quot; or &quot;classic status&quot; \u2013 though I&apos;d argue that it has all of those things \u2013 I&apos;ve simply gone for the sci-fi novel I enjoyed reading the most. Neal Stephenson&apos;s Quicksilver is a huge (900-plus pages), brilliant, Arthur C Clarke award-winning story about the founding of modern science. It&apos;s also \u2013 incredibly \u2013 outrageously good fun. Packed with research, a mind-boggling array of real historical characters from Isaac Newton to William of Orange, and digressions on anything from philosophy to finance to cryptography, Quicksilver manages to never be obnoxious about its smarts. The destinies of fictional early scientist Daniel Waterhouse, &quot;King of the Vagabonds&quot; Jack Shaftoe, and former-harem-girl-turned-economics-wizard Eliza improbably (yet inevitably) weave together through court intrigue, Le Roi himself and the founding of the Royal Society, but even that doesn&apos;t begin to cover Quicksilver&apos;s joyous sprawl. It&apos;s funny, cheerfully violent, and eye-wateringly ribald. You&apos;ll also thank your lucky stars you never had a kidney stone in 1661. Exhilaration is too rare in fiction. That rush of delight, that desperate need to get back to the pages to find out what happens next, particularly in a novel as clever as this one, is worth cherishing. When Quicksilver first came out, I described it as less a book, more a place to move into and raise a family. I still believe that. The best science fiction, indeed the best fiction, contains whole worlds. You&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find one as splendidly entertaining as Quicksilver&apos;s. Audrey NiffeneggerTime and Again: An Illustrated Novel by Jack Finney (1970) Time and Again is an original; there is nothing quite like it. It is the story of Si Morley, a commercial artist who is drawing a piece of soap one ordinary day in 1970 when a mysterious man from the US Army shows up at his Manhattan office to recruit him for a secret government project. The project turns out to involve time travel; the idea is that artists and other imaginative people can be trained (by self-hypnosis) to imagine themselves so completely in the past that they actually go there. Si finds himself sitting in an apartment in the famous Dakota building pretending to be in the past . . . and ends up in the Manhattan of 1882. The story makes good use of paradox and the butterfly effect, but its greatest charms lie in Si&apos;s good-humoured observations of old New York and the love story that gradually develops between Si and the beautiful Julia, who doesn&apos;t believe Si when he tells her he&apos;s a time traveller. Time and Again is laden with authentic period photos and newspaper engravings which Jack Finney works into the narrative gracefully. When I first read WG Sebald&apos;s Austerlitz, a very different book in both subject and mood, I realised that it owed something to Finney&apos;s innovative use of pictures as evidence within a novel. Really, the pictures seem to say, this did happen, I saw it, don&apos;t you believe me? The pictures cause us, the readers, to sway slightly as we suspend our disbelief; they look like proof of something we know is unprovable. Isn&apos;t it? There is something wistful about time travel stories as they age: 1970 is now 41 years past. A lot happened in those years, and these characters are blissfully unaware of the future. I get a little shiver of nostalgia in the book&apos;s opening pages: gee, people used to go to offices and sit at drawing boards and get paid to draw soap. What a world. Perhaps if I could imagine it completely enough, I could visit . . . but no. I&apos;ll just read about it, again and again. Christopher PriestThe Voices of Time by JG Ballard (1960) When he died two years ago, JG Ballard was widely celebrated for his novels, and rightly. Empire of the Sun, an account of his wartime internment in Shanghai, brought him a Spielberg movie and a worldwide audience, but he also wrote the remarkable novels Crash, High-Rise, Cocaine Nights and many more. Inspired by Dal\u00ed, De\u00a0Chirico, William Burroughs and Jean Genet, his talent was unique: his vivid,\u00a0surprising and often beautiful prose was put to the creation of dreamlike and sometimes shocking images, while telling a deceptively straightforward narrative. Ballard began writing in 1955 (he was in his mid-20s) and his first serious novel, The Drowned World, did not appear until seven years later. Before that he produced a stream of astonishing short stories, which to long-term admirers of Ballard&apos;s writing are among his finest fiction. In them he explored for the first time many of the themes which in new guises were to coil their way through his better known later work. Supreme in these stories is an extraordinary novella, The Voices of Time, first published in 1960 and later the title story of a collection. The plot almost defies summary. An imminent global disaster is seen from the viewpoint of a group of sleep-addicted scientists, slowly going mad in a desert installation surrounded by salt lakes, where genetic experiments have bred mutant animals to resist the radiated atmosphere. Meanwhile, a countdown to the end of the universe has begun, a suicidal madman engraves a mandala on the floor of an emptied swimming pool, a sleep-deprived astronomer cruises the dunes in a white Packard saloon, a raven-haired temptress named Coma plays the men off against each other. Somehow it all seems to make crazy and brilliant sense. I have read the story a dozen times, never actually understood it, but also have never failed to draw inspiration and encouragement from Ballard&apos;s pellucid writing and the amazing and surreal images. Alastair ReynoldsThe City and the Stars by Arthur C Clarke (1956) Everyone has their touchstone text, but for me it must be Arthur C Clarke&apos;s The City and the Stars. By the time I encountered it, at the age of 12 or 13 (I recall picking it out of a rotating bookstand, near the door of a bookshop in the Lake District, during one of those rain-sodden childhood holidays), I was already familiar with Clarke as the sober-minded chronicler of near future space exploration. In scores of short stories, and in novels such as Earthlight, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Rendezvous with Rama, Clarke took me to the Moon, Mars and beyond \u2013 always in that same benign, sceptical, calm voice of scientific reason. The City and the Stars was a magnificent shock to the system. Rather than being set a hundred or two hundred years hence, and rather than dealing with astronauts and implacable alien artefacts, The City slams us billions of years into the future, telescoping entire aeons and ages into mere eyeblinks. It&apos;s about Diaspar, the last city on Earth. And what an astonishing, beautiful creation it is. Rarely, for a novel written half a century ago (and which owed its origin to a work predating the second world war), The City&apos;s core ideas still feel bold and far-reaching. Diaspar&apos;s citizens entertain themselves in virtual realities, are born and reborn time and again from computer archives, their personalities remixed from iteration to iteration, and they can organise and edit their own memories at will. Their placid lives are perfect, their utopian city endlessly self-renewing. And yet . . . they have no interest in what lies beyond Diaspar&apos;s awesome walls. Until a citizen is born, Alvin, who seems never to have existed before. And Alvin very much wants to know what lies outside. Clarke was a scientist, and his work sits squarely in the tradition of &quot;hard SF&quot; \u2013 a largely detestable term, but we&apos;re stuck with it \u2013 which is to say, science fiction with one eye on strict scientific plausibility. Much hard SF is stylistically dry, with little concern for character or what one might consider the finer literary virtues. There was rather more to Clarke than mere nuts and bolts description, though. On a good day, he could rise to the genuinely poetic \u2013 Diaspar is a lovely, evocative name \u2013 and there are countless passages in his work where a genuine sense of wonder is achieved. The City and the Stars is full of them, and it remains my favourite novel of the deep, distant future. Adam RobertsDune by Frank Herbert (1965) Not my favourite SF novel, but my gateway drug: Frank Herbert&apos;s Dune. When I pick it up now I tend to see only its flaws (Herbert&apos;s leaden prose, incapable of concision; his limited, and essentialist and in some cases homophobic characterisation). But if I cast my mind back to my 10-year-old self, and remember the effect it had on me, I&apos;m able to remind myself that the book&apos;s strengths eclipse its shortcomings. It achieves a genuine grandeur, something that has a lot to do with the brilliance of Herbert&apos;s mise-en-sc\u00e8ne \u2013 the desert-world of Arrakis, the beautiful, imagination-snaring barrenness of his locations. Herbert is sometimes praised for his &quot;worldbuilding&quot;, but this isn&apos;t quite right (on the level of worldbuilding the novel has notable flaws, not least the absence of any means of oxygenating the planetary atmosphere). Rather, Dune&apos;s deserts function eloquently as metaphor and topographical signifier, empty enough of conventional geographical features \u2013 the frontispiece map is a blank page barely sullied by dotted-lines showing occasional features \u2013 to provide an uncluttered aesthetic and imaginative space. The novel presciently anticipated the sort of environmentalist concerns, &quot;ecology&quot; in the idiom of the 1960s, that have subsequently become culturally central \u2013 Dune was, indeed, the first novel with an ecological theme to have a significant impact. In a sense, Herbert&apos;s triumph in Dune is precisely finding simple but eloquent tropes for important but complex subjects such as these. His future society is clothed in the simplified feudal lineaments of a medieval fantasy \u2013 computers are banished by religious edict, society is strictly hierarchical \u2013 which enables him to sketch large questions of human social and political interaction. Even now I&apos;m an adult, Herbert&apos;s sandworms still move through the deserts of my imagination. Kim Stanley RobinsonThe Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K Le Guin (1969) One of my favorite novels is The Left Hand of Darkness, by Ursula K Le Guin. For more than 40 years I&apos;ve been recommending this book to people who want to try science fiction for the first time, and it still serves very well for that. One of the things I like about it is how clearly it demonstrates that science fiction can have not only the usual virtues and pleasures of the novel, but also the startling and transformative power of the thought experiment. In this case, the thought experiment\u00a0is quickly revealed: &quot;The\u00a0king\u00a0was pregnant,&quot; the book tells us early on, and after that we learn more and more about this planet named Winter, stuck in an ice age, where the humans are most of the time neither male nor female, but with the potential to become either. The man from Earth investigating this situation has a lot to learn, and so do we; and we learn it in the course of a thrilling adventure story, including a great &quot;crossing of the ice&quot;. Le Guin&apos;s language is clear and clean, and has within\u00a0it both the anthropological mindset of her father Alfred Kroeber, and the poetry of stories as magical things that her mother Theodora Kroeber found in native American tales. This worldly wisdom applied to the romance of other planets, and to human nature at\u00a0its deepest, is Le Guin&apos;s particular gift to us, and something science fiction will always be proud of. Try it\u00a0and see \u2013 you will never\u00a0think about\u00a0people in quite the same way again. Tricia SullivanOctavia E Butler (1947\u20132006) I was teaching in New York when I came across Octavia E Butler&apos;s Kindred in a secondary-school catalogue of novels recommended to support diversity. It caught my attention because Butler was described as a science-fiction writer. I thought I was familiar with science fiction, but I&apos;d never heard of her \u2013 nor have a great many other readers, I suspect. For many years, Butler was the sole African-American woman novelist in science fiction. Kindred tells the wrenching and unforgettable story of a\u00a0young black woman who time-travels\u00a0and saves the life of her slaveholder ancestor, but it is, in Butler&apos;s words, &quot;a\u00a0grim fantasy&quot;, not science\u00a0fiction. Beginning in the 1970s, Butler wrote three sequences of novels: the Patternist books, the Lilith&apos;s Brood series and the Parable novels (incomplete at her tragic death in 2006). Critically respected, she won the Hugo and Nebula awards, received a Clarke nomination, the PEN lifetime achievement award and a MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius&quot; grant. A serious writer working in a field that is seldom taken seriously, Butler addressed biological control, gender, humanity&apos;s relationship with aliens, genetics and even the development of a fictional religion. Her narratives leave space for\u00a0the reader&apos;s involvement while exploring the nature of change. They\u00a0gaze unflinchingly on power dynamics. &quot;Who will rule? Who will lead? Who will define, refine, confine, design? Who will dominate? All struggles are essentially power struggles,&quot; Butler stated, &quot;and most are no more intellectual than two rams knocking their heads together.&quot; Butler&apos;s writing is courageous, stimulating and infused with a rare purity of intention. Crushingly, she died at the height of her powers. Bloodchild and Other Stories is a good place to begin discovering her work. Scarlett ThomasNeuromancer by William Gibson (1984) I first read Neuromancer when I was living in Torquay in 1999. For me it was a time of cheap junk food, cigarettes, videogames, arcades and Hello Kitty hairbands. The novel was just the right thing for the time, and its post-industrial Japanese wastelands didn&apos;t feel so remote. There&apos;s so much trivia about Neuromancer, and everything it inspired, from the name &quot;Microsoft&quot; to the Matrix films \u2013 perhaps even the whole internet. But what I&apos;ve always loved about Gibson are the same things I love about Jane Austen and Chekhov. Gibson uses small, precise details to build a world in which people are defined by their contemporary technologies, fashions and material culture. In Neuromancer, as in Gibson&apos;s other books, you always know what the characters are wearing. Here, one character turns up dressed in a &quot;suit of gunmetal silk and a simple bracelet of platinum on either wrist&quot;. A woman&apos;s hairband &quot;might have represented microcircuits, or a city map&quot;. I&apos;m surprised Gibson is seen as a highly masculine writer, given the focus on fashion and the consistently romantic plots. Yes, there&apos;s hot RAM (the fact that people are trading RAM in megabytes in the &quot;future&quot; is one of very few details that date the novel), a military outfit called Screaming Fist and simstim consoles. But there&apos;s also the uber-cool razorgirl Molly, kicking ass in her &quot;cherry red cowboy boots&quot;. Gibson&apos;s prose style is in the tradition of Chekhov, Carver, Chandler, Burroughs and Hemingway. Lots of verbs, lots of nouns \u2013 things \u2013 as opposed to feelings, over-explanation and exposition. Before I began writing The End of Mr Y, I put three books on my desk as lucky charms, and this was one of them. My novel isn&apos;t cyberpunk, but I wanted my readers to feel something of what I felt when I first read Neuromancer.

On a track specially constructed for the Manchester City Games in the city centre, the 25-year-old beat her British rival, the American-born Tiffany Ofili, in an impressive time of 12.88sec to finish third overall against a field of specialists in the 100m hurdles. The time proved to be the fourth fastest of Ennis&apos;s career, offering a glimpse of what might be still to come this summer. Danielle Carruthers of the United States won, following up her Diamond League victory in Doha last week, in 12.74sec. &quot;If someone had said two weeks ago that I would be in Manchester running that sort of time, I would have been very happy with that,&quot; said Ennis. &quot;Coming into this, I just didn&apos;t really know where I was, to be honest, so to run 12.88 shows that I&apos;m in good shape.&quot; &quot;At one stage we weren&apos;t sure whether I would be able to do G\u00f6tzis [her first heptathlon of the year in two weeks&apos; time] and I definitely didn&apos;t think I&apos;d be able to do this, so to get into this shape so quickly is quite promising. &quot;One massive positive to take from the day is that my ankle feels good. I&apos;m back into competition now and hopefully I can just keep on improving all year.&quot; Ennis was less pleased with her run over 150m, where she finished second in 17.40sec after a poor start, but her coach, Toni Minichello, emphasised the positives. &quot;She should have got spanked well and truly and she was quite competitive, so that&apos;s quite pleasing,&quot; said Minichello. &quot;Overall she&apos;s running really well. We&apos;re a little bit behind in the jumps, the throws are going OK, so G\u00f6tzis is going to be tight. Don&apos;t expect too much in G\u00f6tzis \u2013 expect something but not too much. We&apos;re just running out of time. She wants to get a heptathlon in and that&apos;s the preferred one.&quot; Ennis next competes in the javelin in Loughborough on Sunday. Tyson Gay failed to beat his great rival Usain Bolt&apos;s 150m record, set two years ago on the same track, but despite a sore hip still managed to leave the rest of the field for dead as he sped away to finish in 14.51sec \u2013 0.16sec slower than the Jamaican&apos;s record. The American certainly impressed over the first 100m despite the rain and poor conditions, and his equivalent time of 9.91sec would have ranked him second fastest in the world this year. &quot;I wish I had covered my first 100m maybe a tiny bit faster but I&apos;m still satisfied,&quot; said the 28-year-old. &quot;That&apos;s kind of where everyone else is in the world right now, so that&apos;s not bad. &quot;I was just hoping I was somewhere close to last year. I was 19.41sec last year [over 200m straight], so 14.51 this year \u2013 that&apos;s not bad considering I missed a bit of training. I think I pushed my body as far as it was going to go today.&quot; Earlier in the day Haile Gebrselassie won the men&apos;s 10km road race in 28min 10sec and he was full of praise for Britain&apos;s Chris Thompson, who finished 11sec behind the Ethiopian in second place. In the women&apos;s event the European Indoor 3,000m champion, Helen Clitheroe, triumphed. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, China&apos;s Liu Xiang announced his comeback in the 110m hurdles with a sensational win at the Diamond League in Shanghai to end David Oliver&apos;s 20-race unbeaten streak and post a world-leading time of 13.07sec. In front of a screaming home crowd the former world record holder and 2004 Olympic champion, who has struggled with injury since pulling out of the 2008 Olympic Games, ran a phenomenal race against the American who has been unbeaten since August 2009. The 29-year-old Oliver did not look quite himself, smashing into two hurdles along the way, to finish second. &quot;He didn&apos;t surprise me. I&apos;ve just got to go back home and regroup. It was not my best performance but it wasn&apos;t terrible. I did a lot of losing before I did any winning, so I can use this to build for the season,&quot; said Oliver.

The duo behind No Logo are a similarly odd couple: Chinese ex-restaurateur Sam Gu, who happily admits he is not a particularly keen cyclist, and Alex Lewis, a young advertising copywriter and self-professed bike nut. After coming to the UK nine years ago to study and then setting out, somewhat unsuccessfully, in the restaurant trade, Gu ended up selling bikes made in his family&apos;s factory in Tianjin, an industrial powerhouse city near Beijing. The Teman-branded models \u2013 good value if unexceptional alloy road bikes \u2013 sold moderately well for a few years, both wholesale and via his makeshift shop near Bethnal Green, just east of the City. Then, 18 months ago, Lewis came to the store, initially as a customer. He had an idea: why not set the Gu family factory to produce a more fashionable model, a cheap, no frills but colourful single-speed machine of the sort pioneered by couriers and since adopted by thousands of mainly young, urban riders? After several prototypes and occasional confusion from the factory \u2013 &quot;They thought it was a bit weird having tyres and wheels in these funny colours,&quot; says Sam \u2013 the No Logo bikes were born.  There is only one model, a \u00a3270 alloy-framed bike with flat handlebars and a &quot;flip flop&quot; single-speed rear wheel, the sort you can turn around for either fixed-gear pedalling or a freewheel hub.  The clever bit is the choice of eight vibrant colour schemes on the frames, wheels, tyres, saddles and chains, and, as the name suggests, a near-total lack of visible branding, a conscious mimicking of the fixed gear pioneers who dragged aged track frames out of cellars or skips and refitted them with a functional but unflashy array of scavenged or salvaged parts. The bikes went on sale only three months ago and the response has been extremely positive, with more than 1,000 shifted already, both to direct buyers and to other independent cycle shops. &quot;We&apos;re selling them about as fast as the factory can make them,&quot; said Lewis. &quot;The customers are mainly young Londoners, although I did get a call recently from a dad in Hampshire. He claimed he wanted it for his son but I think it was for him. &quot;We&apos;re not pretending these are bikes with snob value. If you turned up at an LFGSS [London Fixed-gear and Single-speed, the sometimes ferociously snooty online forum for such bikes] meeting on one of them you&apos;d probably be turned away. But they&apos;re simple, well made, and ideal for urban riding.&quot; My overriding feeling at the explosion in single-speed/fixed-gear bikes in London and other urban areas is pretty straightforward: anything that gets people riding, particularly young people, is wonderful. Few sights make me happier than seeing the railings and lampposts around a pub festooned in bikes on a Friday night. Admittedly, I&apos;m a bit baffled by some fixie crazes, like those absurdly tiny upturned handlebars that look like they&apos;ve been pinched from a six-year-old&apos;s bike. I also have the ex-courier&apos;s instinctive mistrust of &quot;fakengers&quot;, with their suspiciously pristine track frames, Sidi shoes and Chrome messenger bags, along with well-paid office jobs and no real insight into a notoriously exploitative and often poorly paid industry. But I really like the No Logo bikes. They&apos;re self-confessedly derivative but great fun to ride, solidly built, nimbly responsive and, at a claimed 10.5kg, not absurdly heavy. In the wider scheme of things they&apos;re also pretty cheap. Intriguingly, the company is now trying to market the bikes back to their home country, exhibiting them at trade shows in Tianjin and Shanghai.

Some of the impacts would be of a &quot;major magnitude&quot;. The report also highlights four separate policies with which the planning application fails to comply.

The BBC reports that Sir Peter Soulsby, who stepped down as Labour MP for Leicester South to contest the mayoral poll, said he had taken the decision partly to save money, and added:  &quot;The chief executive has a very wide range of responsibilities, some at least of which I believe overlap with the newly elected mayor, particularly providing strategic direction.It&apos;s for that reason that I&apos;ve come to the conclusion, partly to save money but also because of this overlap of roles, that the chief executive&apos;s role can be removed from the organisation and that&apos;s the proposal that I&apos;m making.&quot;  (thanks @lgcplus) \u2022 The latest campaign from Every Disabled Child Matters, which is calling on local authorities to show they are committed to services for disabled children, despite budget cuts. Councils are being asked to signing up to a new Disabled Children&apos;s Charter (pdf), which &quot;will help councils to allay the fears of families with disabled children that they are no longer seen as a priority&quot;. EDCM board member Srabani Sen says: &quot;It will also ensure that they are well placed to meet their new statutory duties and to respond to new coalition government policies for disabled children.&quot; \u2022 The BBC&apos;s experiment The Street that Cut Everything, which aired last night. In this blogpost, the Beeb&apos;s political editor, Nick Robinson, who presented the programme, defends the rationale - and says we should be more sympathetic to those politicians who are having to make decisions on cuts:  &quot;For me, The Street That Cut Everything captures why running things isn&apos;t as easy as people often say, whereas it is all too easy for them to condemn politicians - local as well as national - as stupid, self-interested or corrupt.I&apos;m well aware that this is probably not a good time to ask you to spare a thought for our leaders. After all, we&apos;ve just had our first national referendum for more than 35 years in which one side told us to vote No to stop politicians lying and the other to vote Yes to stop them being lazy and corrupt.Nevertheless, what better time could there be after so many ordinary citizens put themselves up for election or rejection? If we want better politicians to make better decisions, we would all do well to consider the difficult choices they have to take in the face of confusing and contradictory advice from those of us who elect them.&quot;  \u2022 Question of the day, posed by Rachel Beer how much longer will it be before charities take social media \u2013 and other digital channels \u2013 as seriously as more traditional media? \u2022 The Hotlist, published by Mencap&apos;s Viewpoint magazine, which names 20 inspirational people with a learning disability. The list follows a poll for the charity, which found that over half the British population (52%) are unable to name a high profile person they have seen in the media with a disability - and when asked to name someone with a learning disability, the figure was 99%. \u2022 The Co-operative Group, which has set up a one-stop shop on setting up public service mutuals. It is partnering with law firm Cobbetts and consultancy Westminster Bridge and the joint venture aims to &quot;endorse the co-operative approach as a viable model for those looking for a different way of providing services which until now have been delivered by the public sector&quot;. \u2022 This new report, Get Heard, which says the voluntary sector should value communications more highly. The Chartered Institute of Public Relations&apos; voluntary sector group, Fifth Estate, surveyed more than 120 senior PR and communications staff in charities and voluntary sector groups across the UK and found that more than a third (38%) feel the role of communications is not valued by their organisation. And of them, three-quarters feel that communications are confused, inconsistent and lacking a clear strategy.

Tuesday&apos;s ceremonial launch of Silverstone&apos;s new \u00a328m pits and paddock complex took place in the presence of many of British motor sport&apos;s greatest figures, including Sir Stirling Moss, John Surtees, Sir Jackie Stewart, Sir Frank Williams, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill and Jenson Button, but without the man whose incessant goading could be said to have prodded the circuit into its latest phase of redevelopment. Two years ago Silverstone hosted what it thought would be its last British Grand Prix after Ecclestone handed the contract to host the race to Donington Park with the firm promise that the showpiece event would never return to the Northamptonshire plateau on which the modern Formula One world championship made its debut in 1950. A state of war had existed for years between Ecclestone and the British Racing Drivers&apos; Club, Silverstone&apos;s owners, whom the entrepreneur charged with being unwilling to update their venue, originally a second world war RAF base for Wellington bombers, to match the lavish facilities being built with government funds in such places as Shanghai and Abu Dhabi. When the Donington project collapsed through a widely predicted lack of funding, Ecclestone and Silverstone were forced back into each other&apos;s arms. The circuit was given a deal to hold the race for the next 17 years on the understanding that major improvements would be undertaken. On Tuesday the results were revealed, in the striking silvery shape of a complex to be known as the Silverstone Wing, a building 390m long and 30m high, containing pits, garages, hospitality suites, and conference rooms suitable for all kinds of functions when the engines fall silent. From some angles the Wing&apos;s jagged shape resembles the profile of one of the Tour de France&apos;s more mountainous stages; from others it suggests what might happen were a Stealth bomber to crash into one of those low-rise logistics centres one sees alongside the M1. Ecclestone announced his non-appearance less than 24 hours earlier and it fell to Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion and now the president of the BRDC, to read out his message. &quot;I&apos;m very sorry that I&apos;m not here for this important occasion for the future of Formula One and the future of Silverstone,&quot; Ecclestone wrote. &quot;But rest assured I&apos;ve followed all the progress and the pits and paddock complex is a state-of-the-art facility, and will form the backbone of Silverstone&apos;s plans to become a world-class facility. It&apos;s a great shame it couldn&apos;t have been completed 10 years ago \u2013 but well done, Silverstone.&quot; It was impossible to escape the conviction that had the event been held in a desert, not too far from an oil well, with a gaggle of sheikhs on the platform and the promise of sovereign wealth heading into his coffers, nothing could have kept Ecclestone away. But this was Silverstone, which still seems to exist in the 80-year-old billionaire&apos;s mind as a place of straw bales, Nissen huts, muddy car parks, inadequate toilet facilities and terrible weather, populated by buffoons in blazers and regimental ties who see it as their function to patronise the son of a Suffolk trawlerman. So he has made it his business to patronise them back, with some success. &quot;We&apos;d like to have seen Bernie,&quot; said Hill, who is definitely not a blazered buffoon. &quot;We did invite him, and we were very excited when he accepted, but we understand that he&apos;s very busy. Much of this is the way he wanted it, so he&apos;s got what he wanted.&quot; The profile of the 3.7-mile grand prix circuit remains unchanged from the layout adopted last year, when the new Arena infield section was added. But the Wing is situated at what used to be the back of the circuit, between Club Corner and Abbey, so that the latter, a fast right-hander, now becomes the first turn, followed by Farm Curve, a sweeping left-hander. &quot;I&apos;m really pleased with what I&apos;ve seen,&quot; Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, said. &quot;From the drivers&apos; and spectators&apos; point of view, having the first two corners flat out will be amazing. I&apos;d put Silverstone up with Spa and Suzuka as the best circuits, but you could say it was time for improvement, and this is outstanding. &quot;Among the things any driver really wants is to win his home grand prix, and I haven&apos;t managed it yet, so it&apos;s something to fight for this year.&quot; The greats queued up to salute the circuit&apos;s special character and the enthusiasm of the fans for their heroes. Surtees remembered riding a single-cylinder Norton to victory over the four-cylinder Gilera of Geoff Duke, the reigning world champion, in 1955. Stewart remembered exchanging the lead with Jochen Rindt 30 times on the way to victory in 1969 \u2013 without the aid of Kers, moveable wing flaps or artificial pit stops. John Watson remembered an epic battle with James Hunt. Mark Webber, who had driven his Red Bull into the opening ceremony in a blare of noise, remembered watching the television in Australia in 1991 and seeing Mansell give the stranded Ayrton Senna a lift back to the pits on the sidepod of his Williams \u2013 and how, when he first arrived in England, he drove straight from Heathrow airport to the Silverstone gates. Hill remembered having to stop his Brabham on the track when the crowd flooded over the barriers to acclaim Mansell&apos;s victory in 1992. Only Moss, who first raced in a British Grand Prix at Silverstone in 1952, went slightly off-message. &quot;It&apos;s always been a great circuit,&quot; he said. &quot;But the original one was better than the one today, in my view.&quot; No one is more entitled to an opinion than the greatest driver never to have won the world championship. But all British motor racing fans cherish their own Silverstone memories, whether of Jim Clark switching off his oil-starved engine through the corners on the way to his 1965 win, Jody Scheckter&apos;s impetuosity triggering the famous first-lap pile-up that eliminated 11 cars in front of the pits in 1973, Keke Rosberg blasting round on a qualifying lap in the turbocharged Williams-Honda at a record average speed of 160mph in 1985, or Michael Schumacher taking Copse Corner flat out in seventh gear. Valentino Rossi, the nine-times world motorcycle champion and one of yesterday&apos;s guests of honour, ended the day with a handful of laps on a screaming 1,100cc Ducati, under typically marbled Silverstone skies. For the place that Martin Brundle described, with pardonable hyperbole, as &quot;the centre of the universe for motor sport&quot;, there is more to come. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2011.

But, as you quickly realise when you step inside the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), there&apos;s precious little about the place that is obvious. The cello is resting in a corner of MIT&apos;s celebrated media lab, a hub of techy creativity. There&apos;s a British red telephone kiosk standing in the middle of one of its laboratories, while another room is signposted: &quot;Lego learning lab - Lifelong kindergarten.&quot; The cello is part of the Opera of the Future lab run by the infectiously energetic Tod Machover. A renaissance man for the 21st \u2013 or perhaps 22nd \u2013 century, Machover is a composer, inventor and teacher rolled into one. He sweeps into the office 10 minutes late, which is odd because his watch is permanently set 20 minutes ahead in a patently vain effort to be punctual. Then, with the urgency of the White Rabbit, he rushes me across the room to show me the cello. It looks like any other electric classical instrument, with a solid wood body and jack socket. But it is much more. Machover calls it a &quot;hyperinstrument&quot;, a sort of thinking machine that allows Ma and his cello to interact with one another and make music together. &quot;The aim is to build an instrument worthy of a great musician like Yo-Yo Ma that can understand what he is trying to do and respond to it,&quot; Machover says. The cello has numerous sensors across its body, fret and along the bow. By measuring the pressure, speed and angle of the virtuoso&apos;s performance it can interpret his mood and engage with it, producing extraordinary new sounds. The virtuoso cellist frequently performs on the instrument as he tours around the world. When Machover was developing the instrument, he found that the sound it made was distorted by Ma&apos;s hand as it absorbed electric current flowing from the bow. Machover had a eureka moment. What if you reversed that? What if you channelled the electricity flowing from the performer&apos;s body and turned it into music? Armed with that new idea, Machover designed an interactive system for Prince that the rock star deployed on stage at Wembley Stadium a few years ago, conjuring up haunting sounds through touch and gesture. Later, two of Machover&apos;s students at the media lab had the idea of devising an interactive game out of the technology. They went on to set up a company called Harmonix, based just down the road from MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from which they developed Rock Band and Guitar Hero. From Ma&apos;s cello, via Prince, to one of the most popular video games ever invented. And all stemming from Machover&apos;s passion for pushing at the boundaries of the existing world to extend and unleash human potential. That&apos;s not a bad description of MIT as a whole. This maverick community, on the other side of the Charles River from Boston, brings highly gifted, highly motivated individuals together from a vast range of disciplines but united by a common desire: to leap into the dark and reach for the unknown. The result of that single unifying ambition is visible all around us. For the past 150 years, MIT has been leading us into the future. The discoveries of its teachers and students have become the warp and weft of modernity, the stuff of daily life that we now all take for granted. The telephone, electromagnets, radars, high-speed photography, office photocopiers, cancer treatments, pocket calculators, computers, the internet, the decoding of the human genome, lasers, space travel . . . the list of innovations that involved essential contributions from MIT and its faculty goes on and on. And with that drive into modernity MIT has played no small part in building western, and particularly US, global dominance. Its explosive innovations have helped to secure America&apos;s military and cultural supremacy, and with it the country&apos;s status as the world&apos;s sole superpower.     A typical MIT student 'hack' or prank: a replica Apollo lunar module on top of the university's famous dome. Photograph: Erik Nygren    As the school marks its 150th anniversary this month, it seems the US has never needed MIT&apos;s help more than it does today. The voices of the nay-sayers are in the ascendancy, questioning the US&apos;s ability to reinvent itself, to heal its wounded economy and sustain its leadership in the face of a burgeoning China. Questions too, are increasingly being asked about the ability of science and technology to address the world&apos;s problems, as optimism about the future slides into doubt. &quot;There is a profound cynicism around the role of science that is debilitating for those in the enterprise, and devastating for this country,&quot; says MIT&apos;s president, Susan Hockfield. &quot;If we can&apos;t figure out how to make technological innovation the path to the future, then America is not going to have invented the future, some other country will have.&quot; She fears the US is increasingly suffering from what she calls a deficit of ambition. While 85% of MIT students are studying science and engineering, in the US as a whole the proportion is just 15%. That leaves the world&apos;s creative powerhouse vulnerable. &quot;If you travel to Asia, to Shanghai or Bangalore, you feel the pulse of people racing to a future they are going to invent. You feel that rarely any more in the US.&quot; Which makes MIT&apos;s mission all the more essential. &quot;MIT has an enormous responsibility right now,&quot; Hockfield says. &quot;We feel that deeply. It needs to be a beacon of inspiration around the power of science and technology to create a brighter future for the world.&quot; No pressure, then. From the moment MIT was founded by William Barton Rogers in 1861 it was clear what it was not. It was not like the other school up the river. While Harvard stuck to the English model of an Oxbridge classical education, with its emphasis on Latin and Greek as befitted the landed aristocracy, MIT would look to the German system of learning based on research and hands-on experimentation, championing meritocracy and industry where Harvard preferred the privileges of birth. Knowledge was at a premium, yes, but it had to be useful. This gritty, down-to-earth quality, in keeping with the industrialisation that was spreading through the US at the time, was enshrined in the school motto, Mens et Manus \u2013 Mind and Hand \u2013 as well as its logo, which showed a gowned scholar standing beside an ironmonger bearing a hammer and anvil. That symbiosis of intellect and craftsmanship still suffuses the institute&apos;s classrooms, where students are not so much taught as engaged and inspired. There is a famous film of one of MIT&apos;s star professors, the physicist Walter Lewin, demonstrating the relationship between an oscillating metal ball and mass. Halfway through the experiment he climbs on to the ball and starts swinging himself around the lecture theatre in a huge oscillating arch as though he were appearing in Spider-Man on Broadway. When Emily Dunne, an 18-year-old mechanical engineering student from Bermuda, was taking a course in differential equations recently, she was startled when her professor started singing in the middle of the lecture. &quot;He was trying to show us how to understand overtones. It was kind of weird, but then everyone here is a little quirky,&quot; she says. Mind and Hand applies too to MIT&apos;s belief that theory and practice go together; neither is superior to the other, and the two are stronger when combined. That conviction is as strongly held by the lowliest student as it is by its Nobel laureates (there have been 50 of them). Take Christopher Merrill, 21, a third-year undergraduate in computer science. He is spending most of his time on a competition set in his robotics class. The contest is to see which student can most effectively programme a robot to build a house out of blocks in under 10 minutes. Merrill says he could have gone for the easiest route \u2013 designing a simple robot that would build the house quickly. But he wanted to try to master an area of robotics that remains unconquered \u2013 adaptability, the ability of the robot to rethink its plans as the environment around it changes, as would a human. &quot;I like to take on things that have never been done before rather than to work in an iterative way just making small steps forward,&quot; he explains. &quot;It&apos;s much more exciting to go out into the unknown.&quot; Merrill is already planning the start-up he wants to set up when he graduates in a year&apos;s time. He has an idea for a new type of contact lens that would augment reality by allowing consumers to see additional visual information. He is fearful that he might be just too late in taking his concept to market, as he has heard that a Silicon Valley firm is already developing similar technology. As such, he might become one of many MIT graduates who go on to form companies that fail. Alternatively, he might become one of those who go on to succeed, in spectacular fashion. And there are many of them. A survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms between them generate global revenues of about $1.9tn (\u00a31.2tn) a year. If MIT was a country, it would have the 11th highest GDP of any nation in the world. Ed Roberts, MIT&apos;s professor of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, says such figures belie the fact that the institute is actually quite small, with just 10,000 students and about 1,000 faculty. &quot;That&apos;s not big. But when all those people sign up to a mission to forward entrepreneurship, you have a dramatically bigger impact. In MIT, people are encouraged not just to think bold, but to do it boldly. &quot;If you come up with a brilliant idea, that&apos;s OK. If you win a Nobel prize for your research, that&apos;s fine. But if you take that idea and apply it and make something transformative happen, then in MIT that&apos;s deeply admired.&quot; Inevitably, perhaps, there is a nerdy quality to the place that is reflected in one of its much cherished traditions \u2013 the student &quot;hack&quot;. Hack is a misleading word here, as it is less to do with cracking into computers than with hi-tech high-jinks. &quot;Prank&quot; is a better description. In the student canteen you can see two of the most famous MIT hacks preserved for prosperity \u2013 a police car that was balanced on top of the institute&apos;s great dome, and a functioning fire hydrant that was erected in one of the lobbies. The latter hack, dating from 1991, was a wry comment on a former president&apos;s remark that &quot;getting an education from MIT is like taking a drink from a fire hose&quot;. Then there is the Baker House Piano Drop, an annual institution ever since students first dropped a stand-up piano from a sixth-storey dormitory in 1972, then measured the impact that it made when it crashed on the pavement below. Wacky, perhaps. Geeky, certainly. But also extraordinarily difficult technically and requiring great imagination and ingenuity. MIT in a nutshell.     MIT linguistics professor Noam Chomsky in his office in the Stata Centre. Photograph: Rick Friedman/Corbis    The current president offers two other important clues to MIT&apos;s success as a cauldron of innovation. The first is meritocracy. Hockfield is MIT&apos;s first female president, which is significant for an institution that since the 1990s has been battling against its own in-built discrimination against women. Women still make up only 21% of the faculty. But the gender balance of its students is almost 50:50, and about 40% of its staff members were born outside the US, underlying how MIT remains a huge magnet for talented individuals around the world. &quot;It&apos;s one thing to talk about fostering creativity, but unless you strive for a true meritocracy you are driving away the best people, and what would be the point of that?&quot; Hockfield says. MIT delights in taking brilliant minds in vastly diverse disciplines and flinging them together. You can see that in its sparkling new David Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, which brings scientists, engineers and clinicians under one roof. Or in its Energy Initiative, which acts as a bridge for MIT&apos;s combined firepower across all its five schools, channelling huge resources into the search for a solution to global warming. It works to improve the efficiency of existing energy sources, including nuclear power as it has its own nuclear reactor, a lesser-known fact that MIT prefers not to brag about. It is also forging ahead with alternative energies from solar to wind and geothermal, and has recently developed the use of viruses to synthesise batteries that could prove crucial in the advancement of electric cars. Before my tour of MIT ends I am given a taste of what this astonishing abundance of riches means in practice. In the space of half an hour I enjoy the company \u2013 in the flesh and spacially \u2013 of three of the towering figures of the modern age. I begin by dragging Tim Berners-Lee away from his computer screen to talk to me about how he ended up here. The Briton who invented the world wide web is part of the global brain drain to MIT. He created the web by linking hypertext with the internet in 1989 while he was at Cern in Geneva, but then felt he had no option but to cross the Atlantic. &quot;There were a couple of reasons I had to come \u2013 one was because the web spread much faster in America than it did in Europe and the other was because there was no MIT over there.&quot; What is it about MIT that Europe could not offer him? &quot;It&apos;s not just another university, it has this pre-eminent reputation and that in turn sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy: as soon as it becomes seen as the cool place to go for technology, then people will head there as I did. Even though I spend my time with my head buried in the details of web technology, or travelling the world, the nice thing is that when I do walk the corridors I bump into people who are working in other fields that are fascinating, and that keeps me intellectually alive.&quot; Berners-Lee offers to take me to my next appointment, and in so doing makes his point about MIT&apos;s self-fulfilling prophecy even more eloquently. We walk along the squiggly corridors of MIT&apos;s Stata Centre, which was designed by Frank Gehry. It is a classic Gehry structure, formed from undulating polished steel and tumbling blocks of brushed aluminium that reminds Berners-Lee, he tells me, of the higgledy-piggledy Italian village one of his relatives grew up in. After negotiating a maze of passageways Berners-Lee delivers me at the door of Noam Chomsky. It sums up this wild place: the inventor of the web leads me through the work of a titan of modern architecture to one of the world&apos;s foremost linguists and anti-war activists. Chomsky is in a hurry. On the night of our meeting he will appear on stage alongside the Kronos Quartet at the world premiere of a new piece of music dedicated to him. The composer? Tod Machover, he of the Yo-Yo Ma cello. I put it to Chomsky that it&apos;s a revealing paradox that he, as a leading critic of the US&apos;s overweening military might, has been based, since the 1950s, at an institution that was centrally involved in erecting the burgeoning military-industrial complex he so incisively opposes. After all, MIT has long been a leader in military research and development, receiving huge sums in grants from the Pentagon. It was core to America&apos;s prosecution of the cold war, developing ever more sophisticated guidance systems for ballistic missiles trained on Moscow. &quot;What people don&apos;t understand is that the role of the Pentagon,&quot; Chomsky says, &quot;to a large extent was developing the technology of the future. There were some odd things about it. This building was also one of the centres of the antiwar resistance, and it was right in there, 100% funded by the Pentagon. But they didn&apos;t care.&quot; What does that tell us about MIT? &quot;I was just left alone to my own devices. Other people took days off to run their businesses; I went off as an antiwar activist. But no one ever objected. MIT is a very free and open place.&quot;", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "Massachusetts", "Technology", "US news", "World news", "Tim Berners-Lee", "Noam Chomsky", "Frank Gehry", "Art and design", "Science", "Science", "Research", "MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-17T23:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/18/towering-quality-for-liverpool-waterfront", "sentences": ["Liverpool is twinned with Shanghai and was the only British city to have it&apos;s own pavilion at the recent World Expo.", "It is against this background that the standoff between English Heritage and Peel Holdings over waterfront development should be viewed (Shanghai-style plan &apos;threatens Liverpool&apos;s world heritage status&apos;, 17 May)."], "title": "Letters: Towering quality for Liverpool waterfront", "article": "Liverpool is twinned with Shanghai and was the only British city to have it&apos;s own pavilion at the recent World Expo. Investment from China is likely to play an important part in the further development of the city. It is against this background that the standoff between English Heritage and Peel Holdings over waterfront development should be viewed (Shanghai-style plan &apos;threatens Liverpool&apos;s world heritage status&apos;, 17 May). The big question is, or should be, quality. Unfortunately, the track record of English Heritage is that they don&apos;t seem to have the will or the expertise to engage in rigorous assessments of the intrinsic quality of new developments, and resort to a kneejerk opposition to any new high-rise proposals on the waterfront. Or, they force proposals to be reduced in height, as they did previously, to negative effect, in Liverpool One and on Lime Street. Unfortunately, the higher the profile of the architect, the greater the likelihood of drawing English Heritage firepower. Meanwhile, numerous mediocre new schemes and the ongoing demolition of swaths of fine Victorian housing seem to go through relatively unchallenged. Most of us recognise the value of Liverpool&apos;s outstanding architectural heritage and the need to safeguard it, but this is all the more reason for seeking high quality in new developments. Whatever the fate of the Clarence Dock site (formerly a power station with three enormous chimneys, known as the three sisters), it should be a development of landmark status and quality. A preconceived assumption against high towers is, at this stage, unhelpful and does not contribute to the debate over quality.

If their prototype course works as well as they are hoping, then two days from now I will, as the spiel on Noble&apos;s website boasts, &quot;have learned to speak Chinese the way it is really spoken&quot;. It&apos;s a bold claim. Mandarin has a reputation as one of the hardest languages to learn. For one thing, it is tonal \u2013 each word has a variety of possible meanings, all dependent on the subtlest differences of pronunciation. A downwards, chastising inflection converts the word for &quot;buy&quot; into &quot;sell&quot;, while the incredulous falling and rising third tone transforms the word for &quot;mother&quot; into &quot;horse&quot;, and the same word, &quot;ma&quot;, used for horses and mothers, is appended to statements to transform them into questions, like a spoken piece of punctuation. The idea that any language, let alone one so notoriously difficult, can be taught in just two days struck me first as laughable and later, when I realised that I would be the guinea pig, terrifying. I approached the first class expecting to find myself face-to-face with the language-learning world&apos;s answer to Sue Sylvester from Glee, a megaphone-wielding, militaristic maniac forcing Chinese words into my head by rote until I curled up in a foetal position, wept blood and begged to go home. What I did not expect was a warm, soft-spoken man with a bright blond beard who reminded me less of a barking linguistic drill sergeant than a youthful Gandalf the wizard. Noble&apos;s teaching, it turns out, is entirely the opposite of the brain-straining I had envisaged. &quot;The important thing is to forget everything and make mistakes,&quot; he explains. &quot;I don&apos;t want you to try to remember what I teach you. In fact, I want you to forget it.&quot; This is going to be easy, I tell myself. Easy and, since I am going to forget it all, useless. My plan is to test Noble&apos;s teaching, when we&apos;re done, in conversation with native speakers. I have booked a table at a Mandarin-speaking restaurant in London&apos;s Chinatown, where I&apos;m hoping that my authentic Chinese accent will dazzle waiters and fellow diners alike. Ideally, an astonished waiter will ask: &quot;How long have you been learning Chinese?&quot; and I&apos;ll reply, nonchalantly: &quot;Oh, you know, just a couple of days, for a laugh.&quot; In Mandarin, of course. The lessons Noble&apos;s method, it turns out, is Socratic and simple, a variation of what&apos;s called the Lexical approach, which teaches language not as long lists of words but as a relatively small selection of set phrases \u2013 chunks of language that convey implicitly the rules of grammar and sentence structure. He teaches a handful of words and phrases to use as building blocks \u2013 I want, she wants, you want a sandwich \u2013 and we add prepositions, rules and verbs one by one. Pronunciation I learn from Kai-Ti, who repeats each sentence I say back to me, slowly and subtly correcting my often inventive pronunciation. Just as the chunked approach taught structure and grammar without making them explicit, by copying Kai-Ti I learn to use the four tones organically. Day one begins in the present tense, progresses to questions and then on to the past and future. By day two I am playing fast and loose with pronouns, possessives and conditionals, albeit with a very limited vocabulary. I can&apos;t help but see the process as a montage scene from a film, a time-lapsed conversation between master and pupil growing rapidly weirder and more complicated: &quot;I want to go to Beijing.&quot; &quot;Do you want to go Beijing?&quot; &quot;I want to go to Beijing but you want to go to Shanghai.&quot; &quot;Do you want to go to Shanghai because your mum went to Shanghai?&quot; &quot;I will go to Beijing because I don&apos;t like your mum.&quot; &quot;If you want to go to Shanghai I will go to Beijing and buy your mum.&quot; The narrow set of nouns and verbs is an integral part of Noble&apos;s technique. &quot;One of the worst things you can do with language teaching is teach someone a massive number of words. It&apos;s back-to-front \u2013 teach them to speak and then add to their knowledge. You have to become very fluent in a very small amount of the language.&quot; Many students, he says, are led astray by learning numbers, colours or days of the week before they&apos;ve learned any kind of framework with which to use them. &quot;The nouns are almost irrelevant. That&apos;s stuff you can learn yourself.&quot; Though his approach emphasises relaxation and experimentation, there are rules. Writing anything down is banned, as is all technical jargon \u2013 talk of participles, perfect tenses and the subjunctive makes Noble wince. &quot;The mistake with language learning is that it&apos;s seen as an academic subject, but it isn&apos;t; it&apos;s a practical subject. What you need is to be trained in them.&quot; He laments the state of language teaching in schools. &quot;I was naturally particularly good at languages but when I went to school they did German and I was utterly confused by it. I spent about eight years trying to learn and failed.&quot; It was only after leaving school and experimenting with commercially available language courses that he hit upon methods that worked for him and, he hoped, would work equally well for others. Though Collins has now published his courses for the public in French, Spanish and Italian, Noble&apos;s goal remains to change the way languages are taught in British secondary schools. &quot;If I had four years with kids in schools they would walk out fluent. Instead, I have 10 hours in a classroom on a weekend.&quot; After a hushed discussion in Mandarin, Paul and Kai-Ti give me one last crash course in preparation for my trip to the restaurant. They have chosen what I should order in advance, outlining a selection of standard dishes: Singapore chow mein (Shin-ja-poor chow me-en), Yang Zhou fried rice (Yan-Jo chow fan), Peking duck (Bei-jing kao ya) and, at my request, a glass of orange juice (Ju-tze shui). They teach me how to ask for the bill, how to ask the waiters whether or not they speak Mandarin (as opposed to Cantonese), and how to respond, when asked about the food, that it is tasty or, if the occasion warrants, delicious. I will not, Noble warns me, understand precisely what the waiting staff are saying to me. &quot;You cannot translate the words as they&apos;re being said. It&apos;s impossible. You just have to get a general sense.&quot; He returns to his notion of language learning as not academic but practical \u2013 less a quiz to be answered carefully than an assault course, to be fumbled through at speed. &quot;It&apos;s like using the force,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Don&apos;t try and understand; try and feel.&quot; The restaurant Six days later I am loitering nervously in the New World restaurant in London&apos;s Chinatown, its black-and-red exterior a willing embrace of stereotype, adorned with twin gold dragons and a pagoda-style roof of corrugated tiles. With the notable exception of China itself, it doesn&apos;t get more Chinese than this. I have spoken to the staff in advance \u2013 in English \u2013 and been assigned a Mandarin-speaking waitress, who agrees to indulge me while I road test my two days&apos; knowledge of the language. As I wait to be served I mutter to myself in Chinese, and, to my surprise, it&apos;s all coming back to me. &quot;Ni hao,&quot; she says, as she approaches. It&apos;s the standard Chinese greeting, which Noble tells me translates approximately as &quot;Y&apos;allright?&quot;. He suggests I use &quot;hao&quot; \u2013 the equivalent of &quot;fine&quot; \u2013 as a sort of catch-all response to any questions I don&apos;t understand, as it can mean yes, no, OK, good, bad, whatever. &quot;Hao,&quot; I respond. She asks for my order. This is the part I&apos;ve been practising longest, and I reel off my intended menu from memory, even managing to improvise successfully around the photographer&apos;s last-minute request for a can of Coke. Coca-Cola (in Mandarin, Ke-kou Ke-le) is a word taught early on in Noble&apos;s course, as a demonstration that the student already understands at least a little Chinese. She repeats the order in English so I can check that I&apos;ve said what I meant. It&apos;s correct. &quot;Hao,&quot; I say. &quot;You speak very well,&quot; she tells me. &quot;Sheh sheh,&quot; I respond: thanks. So far, so good, but then again, so on script. Ten minutes later, when she returns with the food, I resolve to move the conversation into bolder territory. &quot;Do you like him?&quot; I ask, indicating the photographer. She laughs, then looks confused and a little panicked. I replay what I&apos;ve just said in my head. What I&apos;ve actually asked, I realise, isn&apos;t, &quot;Do you like him?&quot; but &quot;Would you like him?&quot; A mistake which is definitely entirely my fault. &quot;Not would you like,&quot; I correct myself, &quot;Do you like?&quot; Which, while it is fairly simple, is not a phrase I&apos;d thought about in advance, or constructed in the lesson at all. It&apos;s a sentence I&apos;ve made up on the fly, suggesting that I have, against the odds, achieved some tiny degree of fluency. There are obvious deficiencies in what I have learned. Chief among them the fact that I know so few nouns; not even, for example, numbers, or months, or farmyard animals, which school language classes had conditioned me to think of as essential. I can, however, convert a verb into the past and future tenses, and say that I, you, we, they, he or she did it, and add an if, a but or a because, and offer, when the situation demands, to buy a stranger&apos;s mother or sell them a photographer. Which is more than I ever managed in five years of French at school. Have I really learned Mandarin in just two days? Well, yes and no. Mostly no, but sort of. Hao.

The game is designed to test both your brain and your mind \u2013 in terms of psychology LA Noire is a sophisticated journey. The mood is distinctly Elmore Leonard or Raymond Chandler, the white Anglo Saxon patriarchy and racism in place. Complexity of character matters here, there is a distinct move away from the archetypes of previous games. If Grand Theft Auto was Michael Mann then LA Noire is Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawkes.  Your alter ego in LA Noire is Detective Cole Phelps. Playing as Phelps you start the game without self-knowledge or memory and from the moment you press the right trigger you are in at the hard-boiled deep end. As the game progresses the mystery of Phelps&apos; inner psychological landscape is filled in, as flashbacks tantalisingly offer up key moments of insight. While second guessing psychopaths you come to understand &quot;Custer syndrome&quot; and your own redemptive drives.  Team Bondi have gone for a 1947 true crime content, all the cases are based on authentic events, the &quot;Elizabeth Short-Black Dahlia&quot; murder being the most infamous. LA Noire articulates the psychopathology of 1947 LA and the attention to detail is impressive. You get to chase suspects across Hollywood studio lots, climb over DW Griffith&apos;s epic Intolerance set of Babylon, while Orson Welles&apos; now classic noir, The Lady of Shanghai, is flickering at the down town picture house. One parallel story is of the &quot;shrink to the stars&quot;, the maverick psychiatrist Dr Harlan Fontaine, who sinisterly informs, &quot;The mind is the last great mystery in medicine.&quot; (Sodium pentathol, a long discredited &quot;truth serum&quot;, was commonly administered by psychiatrists in the 1940s.) The American dream prologue sets the scene of a post war LA population promised &quot;a city on the verge of greatness&quot;, but you/Phelps have to confront the truth of a nightmarish and toxic city on the verge of moral decay as police corruption, homicide and vice weigh heavily down upon you. It&apos;s your job and the raison d&apos;\u00eatre of the game for you to clean things up.  In so many video games accruing shooting points is what counts. Not so in LA Noire, in this game you earn &quot;intuition points&quot;. What is most striking about LA Noire is that you need to employ your emotional intelligence (EI) to enhance both your success and Phelps&apos; redemption. Police interrogations take place where you are required to mindread suspects by correctly interpreting their non-verbal communication. A flick of the eye-line, a shrug of the shoulders speak volumes, should you doubt them, believe them or accuse them? Make the wrong assumption and you will fail the case, losing precious intuition points. Sending an innocent to the electric chair is not good game-play.  In the late 1980s psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby theorised the human brain has innate mechanisms for information-processing and amongst the various modules regulating social discourse there is a distinct &quot;cheater detection module&quot;. Evolved and domain specific, your cheater detection ability predicates your deductive reasoning and can save your life. LA Noire&apos;s psychological concatenations are perfectly designed to test how well your cheater detection ability is wired.  The psychological challenge of an EI prerequisite to the game-play is technically possible courtesy of a brand new process called motion scan and capture. Here 3D facial geometry is captured via a high definition light scanner. An actor&apos;s depth and complexity of performance, the subtle movements, the voice, eye-line and every single nuance are captured, thus enabling a realistic and credible cinematic effect. In the real world, those endowed with the full quota of EI, experience mind-reading, emotional contagion/affective empathy (where feelings are felt) and theory of mind (ToM) which is an understanding of the levels of mind-reading of others and thus a Machiavellian appreciation of what they know and where and how they (and you) could lie.  In LA Noire the affective element of EI is missing, but Machiavellianism and recognition of betrayed facial emotions are very much in evidence. Video game developers have endured a great deal of negative criticism over the years. Typical bad press has been the assertion that gamers develop into bad tempered, sometimes even violent, loners. In 2006 Simon Baron-Cohen&apos;s research team at the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge developed an award winning video game for Autistic Spectrum (AS) children; The Transporters. Using a technique of green-screen plus digital compositing of live actors with 3D CGI, a child plays by identifying varied expressions of emotions on actor&apos;s faces. The Transporters game can improve the social skills of AS children who play the game regularly. Similarly to The Transporters, the 18 certificate LA Noire offers its adult players a chance to hone their interpersonal skills as they interview witnesses and interrogate suspects. Making LA Noire possibly the first mainstream multi-platform video game to offer EI therapy.  But could Rockstar have shot themselves in the foot by employing a requirement for intuition? After all some keen gamers are likely to be high systemisers and high systemising geeks are not known for their EI. No need to fret \u2013 attention to fragmented detail and good working memory for clues also benefits players, so systemisers can succeed too. It is possible LA Noire&apos;s ideal gamer might be those with balanced brains, folk equally good at seizing upon detail as reading the social world. A sure sign of genuine sociality is the need for a &quot;shared experience&quot; \u2013 does LA Noire offer this? Well, I played with friends and there was much shared attention and debate over suspects&apos; behaviour. But no matter how sharply focussed you and your friends&apos; cheater detection modules, MacGuffins, red herrings, and double bluffs lurk in both the shadows of Cole Phelps&apos; mind and in the dark corners of the game. You better fasten your seatbelts, because all you Cole Phelps&apos; out there are in for a bumpy ride.\u00a0", "tags": ["Psychology", "Science", "Technology", "Games", "Game culture", "Xbox", "PS3", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-20T11:26:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/20/architecture-liverpool-shoreditch", "sentences": ["When you hear people joking about British cities turning into lesser versions of modern Shanghai \u2013 all shiny high-rise towers \u2013 you should ask them to take the subject more seriously.", "Liverpool is twinned with Shanghai, and just as the two cities boast superb early 20th-century waterfronts \u2013 Liverpool&apos;s Pier Head and Shanghai&apos;s Bund \u2013 so Liverpool now wants to emulate its Chinese twin&apos;s bombastic new Pudong district.", "If the city grants planning permission for the Liverpool Waters development proposal put forward by Peel Holdings for a shock of Shanghai-style skyscrapers, its historic centre could well be struck off the official list of World Heritage Sites.", "Liverpool Waters does resemble a parody of Shanghai or Dubai; if nothing else, developing it will make Liverpool look behind the times now that the tide is turning against such over-the-top Blingitecture."], "title": "Constructive criticism: the week in architecture", "article": "Ambition can get the better of architects, buildings and even entire cities.

Photograph: David Levene    Amanda Levete was also in hot water this week, criticised by Turner prize winning artist Rachel Whiteread over her design for a twisting, shining and very prominent 225ft skyscraper planned for Shoreditch, north of the City of London. As Chris Dyson, a local architect, told Building Design, &quot;The choice of architect is glamorous and she [Levete] is very good, but the building is inappropriate for the context.&quot; Shoreditch is not downtown Chicago, where Jeanne Gang has designed an eye-catching skyscraper that rises elegantly and appropriately from its site. In her tower&apos;s defence, Levete told The Architects&apos; Journal: &quot;I understand the emotional issues raised by large developments. But the evolution of a city is bigger than us all.&quot; And, so much so, that if and when Shoreditch shoots skywards and goes slickly corporate, the very artists who have done so much to inject new life into this old quarter will probably move elsewhere.

Here, Gary Neville, the former Manchester United defender, has been granted planning permission to build a house that is either an interesting example of Land art, or else something to do with the Teletubbies.

Its factory in Trollhattan, which employs 3,400 people, has been idle for six weeks because its Dutch parent company, Spyker Cars, has been unable to pay its suppliers. Just 18 months after Spyker paid General Motors $400m (\u00a3246m) to take the loss-making firm off its hands, the future of Saab is again up in the air. Well, not quite. On Friday, one of the biggest Chinese car dealerships, Pang Da Automobile Trade, offered a \u20ac110m (\u00a396m) cash injection to get Saab back on the road. Pang Da has handed over \u20ac30m for the delivery to Shanghai of 1,300 vehicles, enough perhaps to allow Saab to restart production this week. But obstacles remain. Saab&apos;s suppliers need convincing that Spyker will be able to pay its bills regularly. And the biggest part of the deal with Pang Da, which will see the Chinese firm pay \u20ac65m for a 24% stake in the Dutch group, needs regulatory approval from Swedish stakeholders and the Chinese authorities \u2013 and that will take time. Saab has a complex ownership structure. A bigger problem is that Saab needs to set up a manufacturing joint venture in China to gain exposure to the booming Asian market. But Pang Da is not a producer, so the hunt is on to find a Chinese carmaker prepared to join the alliance. Only then will Saab have any hope of a go-ahead from Beijing. During its 20 years under GM ownership, Saab hardly ever turned a profit. The popular view was that as GM&apos;s finances deteriorated (it had to be bailed out by the US government in 2009), it starved Saab of investment. But Spyker, headed by the enigmatic Victor Muller, has hardly been more successful. Last year, it produced just 32,000 cars, shy of its 50,000 target and well below the 120,000 that analysts believe it needs to break even. Hence the liquidity crisis. According to Garel Rhys at Cardiff business school, Saab has been on borrowed time for years. &quot;People call it a niche player but it&apos;s going up against the likes of BMW, which sells 1.2m units a year. Nor does it have a big backer like Audi, owned by Volkswagen. These days, you need to be a global player, and Saab isn&apos;t one.&quot; Saab&apos;s heyday was in the 1970s and 80s, when it was one of the first car firm to popularise the turbocharger and the front-wheel drive. Tim Urquhart, an analyst with IHS Global Insight, says recently Saab has been unable to differentiate itself from its German rivals. And it needs to come up with successful new models, in particular a replacement for its nine-year-old 9-3, its most popular car. He says: &quot;If Saab is going to work in China, it probably needs to go more upmarket. The Chinese don&apos;t want a reheated old-fashioned product. They want something classy and new.&quot; Arguably, what Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation has done with MG Rover could be a template for Saab. SAIC is creating new models out of MG for the Chinese market, and slowly introducing them to Europe. The new MG6 five-door &quot;fastback&quot; is a case in point. But that still leaves Saab fumbling for a Chinese manufacturing partner, and it must be a good one. SAIC is China&apos;s biggest carmaker. Geely, which took over Volvo last year, is the country&apos;s fifth-largest. &quot;It&apos;s important they get in bed with the right company because the Chinese are looking to consolidate the sector, so an alliance with a two-bit player won&apos;t work,&quot; says Rhys. Last week, Muller said he was optimistic about Pang Da, which he described as &quot;a forward-looking, profitable and well-capitalised public company that sees enormous potential for our brand in their home market.&quot; Pang Qinghua, chief executive of Pang Da, was equally enthusiastic, saying new products such as the new Saab 9-5 and 9-4X, &quot;make this the right time for Saab to enter the Chinese market&quot;. Separately, Spyker said last week that a new version of 9-3 could be launched &quot;at some point in 2012&quot;.

Denying reports that the government would allow universities to recruit above their student number limit so long as the extra students paid higher fees, he was adamant. &quot;There is no question of people being able to buy their way into university,&quot; he said. But universities are already allowed to recruit extra students who pay higher fees \u2013 if those students are foreign. With students carrying more of the burden of funding in future, as home and EU tuition fees rise to up to \u00a39,000, and with government support for humanities subjects being withdrawn, will foreign students become ever more valuable as cash cows? &quot;Most universities&apos; costs are close to \u00a39,000 or very nearly,&quot; says Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire and chair of the university thinktank Million+. &quot;Many people feel that by the time they have made provision for the spending required by access agreements and the abolition of the Hefce [Higher Education Funding Council for England] central grant, they will be getting less from home students than they are at the moment, so it makes them even more interested in the international market.&quot; The average overseas student fee for 2010-11 was \u00a311,435 \u2013 more than \u00a32,700 higher than the average home/EU fee expected to be charged from 2012. Unlike for home students, there is no cap \u2013 Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College, London, all charged more than \u00a318,000 for lab-based subjects last year \u2013 and no obligation to ensure fair access for different social groups. Institutions can recruit as many international students as they like and recruitment is positively encouraged by the government as foreign students contribute an estimated \u00a38bn in fees and other spending to the UK economy. Financial forecasts published by Hefce last month showed that universities&apos; income from overseas students had more than doubled over the last 10 years, rising to 9.6% of the higher education sector&apos;s total income by the end of 2009-10. For 2010-11, English higher education institutions aimed to increase this income still further, from \u00a32.1bn to \u00a32.3bn, a rise of 9.5% \u2013 higher than for any other income source. While 21 institutions forecast a reduction in overseas income this year, they were in the clear minority, and the same number were expecting this source of income to increase by more than 25%, prompting Hefce, which will publish the sector&apos;s longer-term forecasts in July, to warn of &quot;optimism in current growth forecasts&quot;. Among those looking to increase overseas recruitment are Durham, which aims for a 97% increase in the number of non-EU undergraduates by 2015, increasing their proportion of the student body from 9% to 16%; Exeter, which plans a 28% rise in the same timescale \u2013 73% in colleges other than the business school \u2013 and Middlesex, which recently won a Queen&apos;s Award for Enterprise for outstanding achievement in international trade, after growing its overseas income by \u00a310m over the last three years. It has overseas campuses in Dubai and Mauritius and a new centre opening near Delhi in October. Michael Driscoll, Middlesex&apos;s vice-chancellor, says: &quot;Because of changes to the way English universities will be funded, the success of our international operations is more important than ever.&quot; Ebdon echoes this sentiment. Bedfordshire, which also received a Queen&apos;s Award this year, has nearly trebled its number of international students in the last three years to nearly 4,000, and wants to increase this by another 1,000. &quot;We spent some time concentrating on growing our home market and then growth in the home market was stopped, so it has been the only growth area available to us,&quot; says Ebdon. He says that, like other universities, Bedfordshire is looking to offer a wider range of programmes on its UK campus that appeal to students from different countries, such as international business and law programmes, and possibly a degree programme in Islamic banking, and is also considering partnership arrangements with campuses overseas. But Shaun Curtis, director of International Exeter, a new internationalisation strategy at the University of Exeter, says that his university&apos;s plans to increase overseas student numbers from just under 3,000 last year to 4,000 by 2015 is not about raising money \u2013 he argues that the shrinking differential between home and overseas student fees will actually make this less of an issue. Instead, it is about ensuring a diverse student body. &quot;We believe that if we want to be a global university as opposed to a national one we have to recruit the best students, not just around the UK but around the world,&quot; he says. Exeter has just become the first British university to open an office in Bangalore, and in the last couple of years has opened offices in Shanghai and Beijing. But its Chinese offices are looking not at recruitment, but at employability options for returning Chinese and home students, raising Exeter&apos;s profile and keeping in touch with alumni. &quot;With the new fee regime, the pressure on universities to demonstrate value for money in the student experience is going to be immense and every good university is going to want to be able to offer a proper international experience,&quot; he says. Durham University also insists that recruiting more international students is less about the bottom line than about ensuring that &quot;all of our students benefit from the diverse educational environment which produces global citizens&quot;. Matthew Andrews, academic registrar at Oxford Brookes University and chair of the Admissions Practitioners Group, says that all universities recognise the importance of having dynamic international student bodies, but they also realise that having too many overseas students could put pressure on facilities and make for a worse student experience. As a result, he does not anticipate that the new fee regime will lead to huge increases in overseas recruitment. &quot;Universities want to maintain their overseas numbers, and that&apos;s certainly our position at Oxford Brookes,&quot; he says. For many institutions, simply maintaining numbers is becoming more difficult. While the exchange rate has been in their favour in recent months, they are facing increasing competition from within the UK and abroad, and must now cope with changes to the visa system. These state that from July, foreign students at private colleges will no longer be able to work during their studies, and the right of foreign students at all institutions to work in the UK after graduating will be restricted. Dominic Scott, chief executive of the UK Council for International Student Affairs (Ukcisa), says that these changes will make the UK a far less attractive option for overseas study and predicts that many private feeder colleges could go under by the summer, with knock-on effects for universities. Worst hit are likely to be poorer overseas students. While foreign students from wealthier backgrounds tend to go to Russell Group institutions, he says, those who are less well-off often choose private colleges in the UK that charge much lower fees for franchised courses. &quot;The ones going into the private colleges will be the ones no longer entitled to work part-time,&quot; he says. &quot;The sad thing is, those kids will suddenly realise that the package doesn&apos;t add up any more.&quot; He suggests that some will calculate that it is worth paying a higher fee for a university course if it means they can work part-time, which could benefit some universities lower down the league tables. Others could choose to study elsewhere, or stay at home. Whatever the government&apos;s intentions for home students, when it comes to international students, ability to pay and ability to learn have long been hard to separate. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 May 2011.

There was work experience, but that was something you did for a couple of weeks while you were at school and was more than likely to involve an unfulfilling stint fumbling with the photocopier at a local business. If you had dreams of a career that required you to get some practice, you might devote some of your summer holidays to it. But formal intern positions were something largely associated with the US, or Bill Clinton. Today, internships are both ubiquitous and highly contentious. There are campaigns denouncing the ethics of requiring young people already saddled with thousands of pounds of debt from their degree studies to do unpaid work, and debate over the morality of a system that allows those from well-to-do families to exploit their connections and secure opportunities that give them even greater advantage over those from humbler backgrounds. Last month, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, called for the trend to be reversed, only for it to turn out that as a teenager he himself had got a placement through his father&apos;s influence. Yet with competition for graduate jobs more intense than ever \u2013 last week a survey showed applications were likely to be up by a third this year \u2013 internships are still widely accepted as crucial for those seeking the best positions after university. Demand shows no sign of dropping \u2013 and now it seems increasingly that the pressure to bag a career-boosting placement is leading students not just to work for free, but to pay for the privilege. Growing numbers of recent graduates are paying thousands of pounds to companies that specialise in securing placements overseas. And auctions held in aid of charity continue to offer internships to the highest bidder, Education Guardian has discovered, despite controversy over previous sales. Work experience placements donated to four charities by the auction house Christie&apos;s over the last year have each raised up to \u00a33,000, while, in November, the charity Pilotlight, which sends volunteers from the world of business into small charities to help them work more efficiently, attracted a top bid of \u00a33,000 in an online auction for a week at GQ magazine. The placement was one of 20 up for grabs via an online auction that saw a week at the offices of the handbag designer Anya Hindmarch go for \u00a32,600, and a week at Bruce Oldfield&apos;s workrooms for \u00a32,250. A week at leading international law firm Herbert Smith, sitting with an associate solicitor and taking part in &quot;real client work&quot;, was billed as &quot;arguably a great opportunity&quot;. It sold for \u00a31,150. Meanwhile firms offering to arrange internships abroad for a fee, usually in China or Australia, are growing in size and number. One, CRCC Asia, has increased the number of placements it offers in Beijing and Shanghai, in areas including law and green technology, fivefold in three years. This year, 3,600 students applied for its one or two month internships, easily filling the 1,300 places. It expects to expand further next year and possibly start offering opportunities in Hong Kong. Students, who are assessed for suitability, pay \u00a31,495 for a month in Bejing and \u00a3100 more for Shanghai. As well as a fee for arranging the placement, the figure includes accommodation, a visa and other extras. But students must cover their flights and living costs while in China, separately. The firm&apos;s London director, Edward Holroyd Pearce, says employers in the UK are particularly impressed by students who can offer insights into working in China given its importance as a fast-growing economy. The one-year-old company Standout Internships offers placements in Sydney, in everything from finance, banking and law to fashion and event planning. Jonathan Manning quit his City job to co-found the firm with a friend after seeing graduate friends struggle to get jobs because of a lack of work experience. Interest in its programmes \u2013 an 11-week summer internship costs \u00a33,000, including accommodation but excluding flights \u2013 is growing rapidly, Manning says. They have fielded over 1,000 inquiries this year, although, so far, actual applications total just 20. &quot;The fact that students are doing an internship helps them in their applications for a paid job. You need the experience to get the job and if you have to pay for it then it is worth it.&quot; Critics disagree. Already concerned that unpaid internships put poor students at a disadvantage, they say asking students to spend large sums for such opportunities harms social mobility even more. &quot;It&apos;s incredibly worrying that we&apos;re moving from a situation where people don&apos;t just have to work for free but are having to pay to work,&quot; says Ben Lyons, the co-director of Intern Aware, which campaigns for interns to be paid the minimum wage. &quot;It puts these experiences and opportunities out of reach of the vast majority of young people.&quot; Sophie Corcut applied for an internship through CRCC Asia after studying history and French at Bristol and finding herself unsure what career she wanted to pursue. While at university she had already done several unpaid placements, mostly arranged through personal contacts . Using a combination of savings, paid work and a loan of \u00a31,500 from her parents, she got together the \u00a33,500 she needed to cover the trip, including flights, and spent two months  in Beijing doing a marketing internship at a fair trade company. On her return she was quickly accepted on a graduate scheme at management consultants Accenture. Corcut says she is sure the internship played a big role in her getting the job. &quot;Coming back from China, you&apos;ve got this one thing on your CV that makes you stand out,&quot; she says. &quot;I was asked a lot about it and I was keen to use it. I suppose it shows you have some get up and go.&quot; The 23-year-old, who went to a fee-paying school near her family home in Pinner, north west London, says she appreciates she was lucky in having contacts who could get her placements, and her parents&apos; help to pay for her China experience upfront. She believes it was a worthwhile investment. &quot;If you really want to do something you can make the money, however long it takes you.&quot; That was true for Laura Palmby. After finishing her law degree at the University of Northumbria, she decided to sign up with Standout Internships after having no luck securing an internship in the UK. &quot;I thought &apos;I&apos;m going to have to get some kind of work experience to make myself stand out a bit&apos;,&quot; she says. &quot;Law is all I&apos;ve ever wanted to do, but it&apos;s so competitive. You&apos;re half expected to work for free, and you have to do everything you can to get some kind of competitive edge.&quot; At the end of June, she will go to Sydney for two months to work at a law firm, and hopes it will help her to get a job on her return. She is paying for the trip using savings and money she has earned in an admin position since moving back to her mother&apos;s house in Downham Market, Norfolk, last summer. &quot;I don&apos;t have lots of money and I&apos;m not from a rich background, but I&apos;ve saved to be able to do it,&quot; she says. &quot;It really comes down to motivation. The way of the world is that it&apos;s not what you know, it&apos;s who you know. But if I work hard enough I can make my own contacts.&quot; Martin Birchall, managing director of High Fliers Research (HRF), says it&apos;s no surprise graduates are so keen to find placements. &quot;Employers have been looking for more than just the basic degree for some time, and the recession accelerated that process,&quot; he says. &quot;In the past work experience was a &apos;nice to have&apos;. Now it has, in effect, becoming a pre-requisite.&quot; The NUS&apos;s vice-president for society and citizenship, Susan Nash, is concerned that young people may be having to resort to funding opportunities abroad. &quot;People shouldn&apos;t have to pay to find work experience that enables them to get into the job market,&quot; she says. &quot;The government must wake up to the fact that there needs to be more attention to this area.&quot; Paul Redmond, head of careers and employability at Liverpool University, accepts the increased importance of experience, but says: &quot;Students should never have to work for free \u2013 and higher education institutions must work to ensure they don&apos;t have to. &quot;We take widening participation really seriously. The use of internships as the crude oil of the job market can keep people out of it. The value of experience is rising ever higher, so it is the responsibility of universities and career services to offer some kind of internship for everyone.&quot; Lyons says if Clegg is serious about making internships fairer, he should crack down on auctions selling them, a trend that started in the US. The website charitybuzz.com, which sells placements alongside a variety of other items and experiences, recently raised $14,400 for the RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights with a two- to three-month internship at the Huffington Post. Plenty of British bidders use the site too, according to communications director Glenda Luft, with a few dozen chasing after internships at workplaces like Rolling Stone and Elle magazines in the past. Someone in the UK recently bid $500 for a chance to spend five weeks at designer Lulu Guinness&apos;s studio in London, but has already been outbid. Another British bidder once offered $26,000 for a package that involved three weeks interning for Richard Branson, followed by three weeks with hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, but was quickly outbid in a sale that eventually reached $85,000. Pilotlight stresses that the work experience placements it auctions have been created especially for the charity, so are not taking opportunities away from anyone else. A spokesman for Christie&apos;s says that while it does occasionally offer special work experience placements to raise money for charity, its formal internships, which anyone can apply for, are paid. And Holroyd Pearce says CRCC Asia offers scholarships on its programmes and is encouraging universities and corporations to sponsor places. But critics&apos; concerns are unlikely to be easily quelled. &quot;Giving people the chance to pay for an internship, whether through an agency or auction, actively excludes those who may be just as talented but don&apos;t have the hundreds \u2013 often thousands \u2013 of pounds which will guarantee them this incredibly valuable introduction to the world of work,&quot; says Becky Heath, the chief executive of Internocracy, a youth-led social enterprise. &quot;It is a crucial issue if we are to achieve a fairer, more open internship system.&quot;", "tags": ["Students", "Work & careers", "Work Experience", "Student work", "Higher education", "Education", "Graduate careers", "Money", "Student finance"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-24T06:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/may/24/kenyan-athletes-london-2012", "sentences": ["Last week, in the Diamond League track meeting in Shanghai, Chepseba won his third race of the season \u2013 out of three \u2013 beating 13 other Kenyans, including the Olympic champion, Asbel Kiprop, to post the fastest 1500m time in the world this year."], "title": "Which Kenyan athletes will triumph at London 2012?", "article": "Every morning I get up, lace up my trainers and head out for a run. All around me, hundreds of skinny, determined runners pound up and down the hills, sweating with the effort. In Iten, Eldoret, Kaptagat, Ngong, Kericho, Kabernet and a hundred other places in between, the dirt roads are lined each morning with groups of athletes, almost every one fast enough to be a national champion in virtually any other country in the world. In the last Olympics in Beijing, Kenya won 14 medals (all in middle- and long-distance running events). It was Kenya&apos;s best Olympics ever, but from all those thousands of talented hopefuls, it&apos;s really only a handful who manage to reach the absolute pinnacle of the sport.  So, with London 2012 on the horizon, who are the Kenyans that will make it? I recently asked one of the athlete managers the same question and he laughed. &quot;It&apos;s easier to pick a needle from a haystack than answer that,&quot; he said. From my time here in Kenya, a few names do leap out. Probably the safest choice for gold is the current 800m world record holder, David Rudisha, although even he is not a certainty \u2013 he is currently injured and is yet to win a medal at a major championships.  Another good bet is the recent London marathon winner, Mary Keitany. A shy girl who lives near Rudisha (and me) here in Iten, she also broke the world half marathon record earlier this year. I visited her recently and asked her whether she thought she could win gold in London. She looked at me hesitantly. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she said. In Kenya, with so many other amazing athletes around, nobody is guaranteed a place on the national team, so talk of winning medals a year in advance can seem a bit presumptuous, even for world record holders.  Another man to watch out for \u2013 if he makes the team \u2013 is the Boston marathon winner and new fastest marathoner of all time, Geoffrey Mutai. I saw him canter to victory in February at the Kenyan cross country championships, which is just about the toughest race in the world to win. In the Olympics there are only three Kenyans in each race. In the national trials in Nairobi, Mutai beat over 200 of Kenya&apos;s fastest runners. Keen athletics watchers, I&apos;m sure, will be thinking that I&apos;ve hardly stuck my neck out with my predictions so far. So for my final Olympic tip, I&apos;ll go for someone less well known. I first met Nixon Chepseba in January at his training camp in Kaptagat, about 40 miles from Iten. He had a calm confidence that seemed to radiate as he sat on the grass, his long legs folded up under him like a praying mantis. Although he was only just 21 and hadn&apos;t raced much outside of Kenya, his coach was full of praise for him, telling me that he had recently broken the 1500m record at the local track by three seconds. In most places in the world, breaking a local track record is a relatively minor achievement, but considering the roll-call of athletes who have raced on the Kipchoge Keino track in Eldoret, it was worth noting. &quot;He was reading a book on the last lap, he was so easy,&quot; eulogised the coach.  Last week, in the Diamond League track meeting in Shanghai, Chepseba won his third race of the season \u2013 out of three \u2013 beating 13 other Kenyans, including the Olympic champion, Asbel Kiprop, to post the fastest 1500m time in the world this year.  I went back to see him after his win in China and turned up at the training camp to find him demonstrating to his fellow athletes how he could lift his leg behind his head. I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s helpful with 1500m running or not, but he seemed quite pleased with himself.  I sat with him for a while and asked him if he thought he could win the Olympics next year. He looked at me with a grin that said, &quot;Are you really thinking that far ahead?&quot;.  Like Keitany, Chepseba knows that in Kenyan running, a year is a long time. Who knows how many other, faster athletes will have emerged by then?  So even though Chepseba isn&apos;t predicting glory for himself just yet, he is certainly one to watch.

Even he has difficulty keeping track of all the new talent. &quot;Time was you knew there was this or that rising star in Shanghai, Canton or Chengdu. Now there are dozens, all very interesting, in loads of Chinese cities. And they are very prolific,&quot; he says. For the second year running Rong is organising Caochangdi Photospring \u2013 Arles in Beijing, in partnership with the French curator B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Angr\u00e9my. The festival features plenty of foreign photographers but youthful Chinese talent has grabbed the limelight. &quot;Photographers born in the 1980s or even 1990s focus on much more varied subject matter than we did. Some have studied photography abroad. They seem to have cast off the burden of historic symbolism, but they also explore their inner feelings more and try to put them across,&quot; Rong says. One of the most original artists is Ren Hang, 24, who weaves a strange visual poem with his male and female nudes, between apathy and sexual longing, boredom and sensuality, solitude and coupling. Another startling discovery, Zhe Chen, 21, bases her work on self-mutilation. She has just completed an as yet unreleased series on the victims of self-inflicted violence, whom she photographed. As part of Arles in Beijing, the founder of the French website Photographie.com, Didier de Fa\u00ffs, and his team gave 24 young Chinese photographers 24 hours to photograph whatever interested them. Selected shots were posted on the 24h.com site. This experiment in &quot;neo-media&quot;, which enables a photographer&apos;s work to be posted very quickly, was first used last October for the Nuit Blanche Parisienne and the Hanoi Millennium. The Beijing version started with a day with Cheng Gong, who usually specialises in official sporting events. For a change he trailed Ling Yi \u2013 a heavy-metal combo with Tibetan and voodoo influences \u2013 from the time they got up to the end of that night&apos;s gig. Most of the young artists concentrated on the city&apos;s changing face. In his Past and Present series Zhang Bing used mirrors to fragment the urban scene. Yuan Yangyang, who is studying in Britain, felt she had lost touch with Beijing. The neighbourhood where she lived as a child has been demolished. She wanted to show Beijing people in a park decorated with replicas of famous international monuments. &quot;Nowadays there is so much demolition and rebuilding in China it inevitably becomes a dominant theme for photographers.

For an &quot;underground&quot; church it was very rowdy. Housed in a bland conference room at a state-run television studio, the church was crammed with some 300 people scrabbling for foldaway chairs. In the corner, a Yamaha keyboard accompanied a lilac-robed choir. When the pastor took to the stage the congregation burst into hymn with a gusto only surpassed by the rocking, whispered prayers that came after. Seven weeks ago that congregation was scattered by government officials. On Monday, when Shouwang attempted to hold an outdoor service, 27 people were detained, including a woman in her 80s and a two-year-old child, according to a witness. It&apos;s been the same story for the last seven Sundays, with several hundred detained in total and six church leaders placed under house arrest. The crackdown is seen as part of a larger tightening of state control since the Middle East unrest. Google continues to be tinkered with and Ai Weiwei has all but disappeared. In China, a country studded with Buddha statues not crucifixes, Christianity has been secretly blooming. Though Protestantism is one of China&apos;s five officially recognised religions (along with Buddhism, Taoism, Islam and Catholicism), the vast majority of Christians choose to be members of &quot;house&quot; churches, technically illegal gatherings with evangelical leanings, that take place in people&apos;s homes, town halls and empty restaurants. Founded in 1993 in a home by a small group of believers, Shouwang&apos;s congregation now numbers over 1,000. On my visit, a member explained why worshippers preferred the house churches: &quot;They take Christ as the head of the church, with the bible as the only moral standard. The state-run church is very much influenced by politics.&quot; The rate of conversion to Christianity in China is staggering. There were about 2 million Christians 30 years ago. Today there are between 23.5 million (the official statistic taken from state-run churches) and 130 million (including house churches) according to China Aid, a Christian charity working in China. Though the latter figure is debated, if it&apos;s in the ballpark it means the number of Christians outstrip Communist party members (78 million) by tens of millions. And, for the first time, the underground Christians are standing up for themselves. Two weeks ago, 19 house church leaders delivered a petition to the National People&apos;s Congress appealing to lawmakers for the right to worship freely. The letter, which has been posted on the internet, says: &quot;With the incessant growth of the number of urban Christians \u2026 the conflict between State and church of this sort is likely to continue to break out. In view of this \u2026 we hereby lodge this petition.&quot; The church leaders, who come from eight major cities including Beijing and Shanghai, fear the petition will spark a new round of action against them. It might, but what the petition signifies is the growing gall of the house churches. When I met with Li, a house church leader in Shanghai, she told me that the government &quot;knows everything&quot;. Li&apos;s church, located in Sheshan just outside Shanghai, took precautions by splitting itself between two venues, and leaders attended monthly meetings to placate officials at teahouses. The important thing was to &quot;let [the officials] know we&apos;re under their control&quot;. What the government fears is the allegiance of its people to something other than China. Christianity has proved disabling to totalitarian regimes in the past. Just across the Yellow Sea in South Korea, some experts credit the rise of Christianity in the 1960s as one catalyst that pushed the country from dictatorship to democracy. Tellingly, the church leaders opened their letter with: &quot;We are Chinese citizens. We love our country \u2026 and obey and respect the authority of the government to maintain social order.&quot; But, it seems, they&apos;re determined to worship on Sundays. This continued defiance of the government sends a clear message: we are here. To stem the spread of Christianity in China, the party is going to have to do more than place a handful of house church leaders under arrest.", "tags": ["China", "Religion", "Christianity", "Communism", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-24T15:30:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/25/china-drought-crisis-yangtze-dam", "sentences": ["Shanghai, Jiangsu and Hunan are also severely affected."], "title": "China crisis over Yangtze river drought forces drastic dam measures", "article": "The Yangtze \u2013 Asia&apos;s biggest river \u2013 is experiencing its worst drought in 50 years, forcing an unprecedented release of water from the Three Gorges reservoir. The drought is damaging crops, threatening wildlife and raising doubts about the viability of China&apos;s massive water diversion ambitions. Between now and 10 June the dam will release 5bn cubic metres of water \u2013 equivalent to the volume of Lake Windermere in Britain every day \u2013 as engineers sacrifice hydroelectric generation for irrigation, drinking supplies and ecosystem support. The drastic measure comes amid warnings of power shortages and highlights the severity of the dry spell in the Yangtze delta, which supports 400 million people and 40% of China&apos;s economic activity. From January to April, the worst hit province of Hubei has had 40% less rainfall than the average over the same period since 1961. Shanghai, Jiangsu and Hunan are also severely affected. Regional authorities have declared more than 1,300 lakes &quot;dead&quot;, which means they are out of use for irrigation and drinking supply. Shortages affect 4.4 million people and 3.2 million farm animals, according to the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters. The narrowing and shallowing of the Yangtze and its tributaries has stranded thousands of boats and left a 220km stretch off limits for container ships. The central government has dispatched water pumps and diesel generators to Hubei and Hunan to ease the impact. This is expensive and adds to the pressures on China&apos;s energy supply system at a time when the state grid authorities are warning of the worst summer power cuts in seven years. &quot;The primary cause of this drought is a lack of rainfall. But we can also be certain that the Three Gorges dam has had a negative impact on the water supply downstream,&quot; said Ma Jun, founder of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. &quot;This is a reminder that the water in the Yangtze is not unlimited. We cannot bet everything on this river. We need to focus more on conservation.&quot; Desperate farmers are pumping water from nature reserves, prompting alarm among conservationists about the loss of habitat for several endangered species including the finless porpoise \u2013 the last remaining cetacean on the Yangtze after the demise of the baiji dolphin. At the Swan Island national nature reserve the depth is three metres lower than last year \u2013 which was then a record low. According to Wang Ding, a dolphin expert at the Hydrobiology Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the habitat of a pod of 30 porpoises has halved in length from 21km to 10km. &quot;Finless porpoises cannot survive if the level continues to drop,&quot; Wang told Xinhua news agency. &quot;If the activity area is reduced they might be stranded on the bank and will die if they can not swim back.&quot; There are believed to be 1,000 porpoises left in the river. The authorities have attempted cloud seeding to induce rain but a brief shower at the weekend was far from enough. China&apos;s meteorological administration sees little prospect of rain before the end of the month and says temperatures in the affected region could rise to 36C. To minimise the impact, the Three Gorges authority has been instructed to open the sluice gates. It has already discharged 1.8bn cubic metres of water this month, taking the level of the reservoir below 153m from a peak of 175m. The dam&apos;s role in the drought has been the subject of a fierce debate. Downstream communities have accused the Three Gorges of holding back too much water to generate power. Environmentalists say this has contributed to the demise of lakes and wetlands, which are already under pressure from urban development and the demands of agriculture. The operators, however, say the reservoir is helping to ease shortages through a timely release of water. Last week the state council \u2013 China&apos;s cabinet \u2013 acknowledging that Three Gorges faces &quot;urgent problems&quot; of geological disaster prevention, relocation and ecological protection. It noted the negative impact on downstream water supplies and river transport. The dam is not the only hydro-engineering project that has come under scrutiny as a result of the drought. The state&apos;s massive south-north water diversion project, which aims to tap the normally moist Yangtze basin to supply arid northern cities like Beijing, is also being called into question because one of its source reservoirs at Danjiangkou has fallen 4m below the minimum requirement for its operation. &quot;This is bound to have an impact on the diversion project,&quot; said Zhang Junfeng, an environmental activist with Green Earth Volunteers. &quot;Water storage at Danjiangkou reservoir is already at a dead level and I think the situation will get worse year by year because this is partly due to climate change.&quot;", "tags": ["Drought", "China", "Energy", "Flooding", "Agriculture", "Wildlife", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-25T10:35:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/diageo-greeniq-medals-staff-initiatives", "sentences": ["Winning sites were chosen from across the world, including Shanghai, London, Buenos Aires, Budapest, Dublin and Menstrie in Scotland, home to this year&apos;s GreenIq hero.", "In Shanghai, the green team devised a highly visible carbon dashboard to involve staff in cutting CO2."], "title": "Diageo - Olympic-style medals for green staff", "article": "Companies often talk about the importance of getting employees fully involved in sustainability projects, but relatively few design specific initiatives to make sure this happens. Drinks giant Diageo realised that employee engagement could be a missing link in its bid to achieve a range of tough environmental targets by 2015. It decided it needed an inspirational engagement programme to capture the interest of the 20,000 people working at all levels in the business and in 80 sites across 40 countries, and to find a way to help people share ideas. It came up with the GreenIq competition through which teams compete to win Olympic-style medals for completing environmental initiatives. Green teams are put together on site and can use an internal website to find out how to complete various initiatives. These range from bronze medal projects \u2013 such as setting environmental targets \u2013 to gold medal achievements like sending zero waste to landfill. After 12 months of intense activity the first set of awards were announced in August 2010, with over 80 medals awarded, including 32 golds. Winning sites were chosen from across the world, including Shanghai, London, Buenos Aires, Budapest, Dublin and Menstrie in Scotland, home to this year&apos;s GreenIq hero. Each winner was awarded \u00a315,000 to invest in a new environmental initiative, either on site or locally. Navarro Correas wines, for example, was recognised for cutting the amount of water used to make its products by 60% over two years, while Diageo&apos;s London head office managed to stop sending waste to landfill. In Shanghai, the green team devised a highly visible carbon dashboard to involve staff in cutting CO2. The challenge now is to keep building on this momentum. One idea under review is to introduce a new platinum category to reward gold medal sites that help another facility start a green team. But the most lasting impact of the campaign is that it is encouraging people across the business to think of more environmentally friendly ways to work and to share their ideas and successes.

One of the two cards congratulates Moscow for holding a successful, peaceful Pride. The other sends commiserations for failure. The Equality Network and our supporters will deliver one of those cards to the Russian Embassy in Edinburgh on Monday 30 May. I don&apos;t know yet which one, though I fear I can guess.  Why Moscow Pride? What connection can there be between Moscow and Edinburgh? When there are 70 countries around the world where homosexuality is outlawed and six where homosexuality carries the death penalty, why stand up for the right to Pride?  This month the Ugandan Parliament were on the brink of passing the infamous Anti-Homosexuality Bill, which would have added one more country to the list of those where being gay can get you executed. Last week in Montenegro at concert held to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, the audience was attacked with teargas. In Cambodia, a bar celebrating Pride Week was subjected to a &quot;vicious and unprovoked homophobic attack by neighbours, which left several people badly injured and caused significant damage to the bar&quot; and the police refused to intervene.  Why does Pride matter? Flashback. It&apos;s February 1984. I&apos;m 17. I&apos;m walking hesitantly down Broughton Street, in the dark of the early winter evening, looking for 58a \u2013 a basement where, I&apos;ve found out, the Edinburgh lesbian and gay youth group meets on Sunday evenings. I still live at home, and my parents don&apos;t know I&apos;m here. I&apos;ve never been able to say out loud to anyone that I&apos;m a lesbian, only &quot;I think I might be&quot;, and &quot;I wonder if I am.&quot;  I think everyone who grew up lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered, knows that feeling. Do you tell? When can you feel sure enough of yourself to say so? Is there anyone else out there like you? At what point do you stop feeling &quot;There&apos;s something wrong with me&quot; and understand that there is something wrong with a world that makes you feel that way. This is shame. This is the opposite of Pride.  Flashback. It&apos;s June 1985. I&apos;m 18. I&apos;m in London, on my own, for the first time in my life \u2013 except not alone: I&apos;m going to the Lesbian Strength March, a women-only Pride march to the new London Lesbian and Gay Centre in Farringdon. This is the first time I have ever seen a thousand queer women in one place. Overnight by bus, crash space in the flat of a woman I didn&apos;t know, and hundreds on hundreds of women with banners, marching through the grey London streets.  I went to Prides in London many times since that first 1985 trip \u2013 they got bigger, they got louder, they got more colourful \u2013 and mostly, they were ignored by the mainstream. Not just the media: London Transport used to pretend it had no idea that on a Saturday in June 30,000 people would be marching through London and then going to what was then the largest free music festival in the world, perhaps thinking that if every year they pretended it wasn&apos;t happening, we&apos;d go away.  Flashback. It&apos;s June 1995. There are 3,000 of us \u2013 lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and trans people. We&apos;re marching up Broughton Street. It&apos;s broad daylight, it&apos;s Saturday, this is the same street I crept down so often, so many years ago, when no one knew, when I wasn&apos;t out to anyone except a few other lesbians. The drummers sound like joy. I could hug the world.  Show your support  Pride creates an illusion. I&apos;ve been to twenty Prides or more since 1985, and I love the illusion. Together, thousands of us, we create a world for a day where none of us need feel ashamed, or frightened, or alone: a kind of rainbow picture of a world where being straight isn&apos;t normal, just common. Around the world, in Cambodia and Mexico, in Rome and in Shanghai, we celebrate Pride.  Flashback. It&apos;s July 1996. I&apos;ve got a new job and I&apos;m good at it and I like the people I work with. The managing director spots my coffee cup in the office kitchen \u2013 a mug that says &quot;8 out of 10 cats prefer lesbian owners.&quot; He wants to know who that belongs to, and being told, he wants to know what on earth I think I&apos;m doing, having something like that at work. And I take the mug away and I never bring it out again. It will be seven years before the UK government makes it unlawful to fire me for being a lesbian.  For six years, a handful of people in Moscow have tried to exercise their lawful right of free assembly, and hold a Pride march. So far, they&apos;ve always been met with violence and denial by people who think they should be ashamed. It is their government that should be ashamed. To oppose that, we need Pride.  If you would like to send a message to Moscow to be delivered on Monday 30 May, the cards are on display in the LGBT Centre for Health and Wellbeing, 9 Howe Street, and can be signed any time on Thursday 26 May: or leave a message here. If you&apos;d like to show your support on Monday, we&apos;ll be delivering the card to the Russian Embassy at 58 Melville Street at lunchtime \u2013 check out our website for updates.  Montenegro&apos;s first Pride march was planned to take place on 31st May, but the organisers have suspended it until the authorities make clear they will protect the marchers. This action is in support of the right of all LGBT people, everywhere, to assemble openly and to march and rally in Pride.

Terry Smith, chief executive of Fundsmith fund management group, said UK investors are in danger of buying ETFs in the mistaken belief they will all perform in the same way as simple index funds that track the likes of the FTSE100 index or the Dow Jones. &quot;Some ETFs are [like that], but many aren&apos;t. In particular, the performance of short ETFs and leveraged ETFs may diverge markedly from what an investor who believes they are simply index funds would expect,&quot; he said. &quot;It isn&apos;t hard to give examples in which investors would lose money on a leveraged long ETF if the market went up over a period of significant volatility, or in which they lost money owning a short ETF and the market went down over a period in which there were some sharp rallies.&quot; In April, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that assesses vulnerabilities in global financial markets and helps implement regulatory policies in the interest of financial stability, published a note on potential financial stability issues arising from recent developments in ETFs, claiming they &quot;warrant closer surveillance by regulatory authorities&quot;. It said strong growth and rapid innovation had led to increasingly complex ETF structures that could confuse retail investors who, in today&apos;s low interest rate environment, are searching for returns from riskier sectors. It added that work is already in hand to assess whether regulatory action is needed to address &quot;potential shortcomings in the management of counterparty, collateral and liquidity risks, and in market transparency&quot;. Smith said many ETFs don&apos;t contain a basket of the underlying securities or assets which they are attempting to track. Instead they hold asset swap agreements which aim to replicate the performance of the index or asset concerned, and these agreements raise similar risks to those that caused problems during the credit crisis. These are known as swap-based ETFs. &quot;A good example of the potential risk here is given by PEK, the New York Stock Exchange-listed Market Vectors China A shares ETF,&quot; Smith said. &quot;It is illegal for foreign investors other than licensed institutions to buy A shares listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen, so the ETF owns swaps with brokers who are licensed to hold the underlying shares. If PEK owned a significant portion of the float in A shares and its holders tried to liquidate at speed it might be interesting.&quot; Often, Smith said, swap-based ETFs and their derivative trading counterparts hailed from within the same group, leading to conflicts of interest. Potential conflicts of interest ETF provider iShares welcomed the FSB&apos;s call for disclosure and enhanced transparency. Joe Linhares, head of iShares EMEA, said he agreed with concerns arising from potential conflicts of interest. &quot;iShares has long supported the physical replication model, but we have recently engineered a leading swap-based ETF platform which is in response to the rapidly growing appetite for exposure to difficult to access markets, combined with a desire for transparency, disclosure and minimised counterparty risk,&quot; he said. &quot;The iShares swap funds offer non-affiliated multiple swap counterparties, are over-collateralised and provide investors with full transparency regarding collateral holdings, swap costs and fund exposures.&quot; Ben Johnson, Morningstar&apos;s director of European ETF research, said there is still a great deal of hunger for information about ETFs: &quot;Individual investors are particularly in need of further assurance and information before stepping into this asset class, although signs of growing interest have emerged.&quot; He said that despite a number of high-profile steps taken by providers of swap-based ETFs \u2013 such as Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and iShares \u2013 to improve the level of transparency and investor protection in their product lineups, respondents to its recent ETF survey remain wary of the products. By the end of March 2011 the global ETF industry comprised 2,605 ETFs with 5,905 separate listings and assets of $1,399.4bn, encompassing 142 providers on 48 stock market exchanges around the world. Smith said: &quot;Some commentators claim we need not worry much about retail investors misunderstanding ETFs because, in Europe at least, they are mainly used by institutional investors. This, of course, misses the point that the underlying clients for many of those &apos;institutions&apos; are individual investors \u2013 do they really understand the risks their private wealth manager is running with ETFs? &quot;The pace of development in the ETF area has been described as &apos;breakneck&apos;. I just wonder whose neck will eventually get broken.&quot;", "tags": ["Investment funds", "Investments", "Shares", "Money", "Investing", "Financial sector", "Business", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2011-05-27T10:06:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/28/ai-weiwei-artist-hari-kunzru", "sentences": ["In 2000 he organised a counter-exhibition to the Shanghai bienniale, with the blunt English title &quot;Fuck Off&quot;, a phrase deadpanned into Chinese as &quot;Unco-operative Approach&quot;.", "In January this year Shanghai authorities demolished his new studio, claiming it had been built illegally.", "Yet at the same time there is something distasteful about the spectacle of chic art-folk performing their outrage in the safety of London or New York or Berlin, while raking in the cash in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong."], "title": "Ai Weiwei: the dissident artist", "article": "As I write, the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei has been in detention for 51 days and 6 hours. I know this so precisely because someone who goes by the handle &quot;loveaiww&quot; has placed a counter on the web. On the door of my flat is a poster with a silhouette of Ai, made from a photograph taken during a period when he was interested in getting (and giving) weird haircuts. His\u00a0round head is surmounted by two long tufts of hair, like horns. It looks wild, comic. &quot;Weiwei works here&quot; says the text. We are all Ai Weiwei, is the message. Where we are, he is too. And wherever he is, we are with him. Ai disappeared on 3 April, as he was\u00a0about to board a plane at Beijing international airport. Until 16 May, when his wife secured a 10-minute visit, there was no official word of his whereabouts. Three days after he vanished, Xinhua, the Chinese government news agency, put up a story saying he was to be charged with &quot;economic crimes&quot;. It was only online for a few minutes, before being taken down. Around the world supporters mounted protests outside Chinese embassies and consulates. In New York a couple of hundred of us were corralled at the side of the busy West Side Highway, the police having thoughtfully positioned us almost out of sight of the consulate and forbidden the organisers to use a megaphone. On 20 May the Beijing police finally confirmed that a company owned by Ai was being investigated for tax evasion. There is still no word of when he will be charged, let alone released. As a global art star, co-architect of the Beijing Olympic stadium and outspoken dissident, Ai has become internationally famous. His recent Sunflower seeds installation at the Tate Modern won him an enthusiastic British audience. Zodiac Heads, a group of giant bronzes recreating pieces looted from Beijing&apos;s Old Summer Palace by British troops during the second opium war, is currently on show at Somerset House. There is no comparable figure in Europe or America. Imagine if one of the faded British celebrities of the 1990s Sensation generation, or the New York art-market titans who paint in $3,000 suits were using their money and fame to confront corruption and become a voice for the powerless. The publication of Ai Weiwei&apos;s Blog: Writings, Interviews and Digital Rants, 2006-2009 has, for the first time, given non Chinese speakers access to writings which circulated among millions of people until the authorities took the blog offline two years ago. Ai&apos;s comments on everything from street furniture to capital punishment have become an integral part of his identity as an artist. &quot;All people have a responsibility to speak their opinion on\u00a0things,&quot; he wrote in 2006, &quot;to state the simple principles of their lives.&quot; Ai exercises this responsibility in a muscular way, berating his fellow citizens in the strongest possible terms. &quot;The People, the so-called People, are really simple-minded loafers . . . who have abandoned their rights and responsibilities, who walk like ghosts on the ever-widening streets, and whose true emotions, dreams and homes are long lost.&quot; China is &quot;a land with no truth, no justice and no soul&quot;. His criticisms often have a bitter humour. &quot;If national honour did exist, it would merely be something that the autocrats busied themselves with ruining.&quot; Ai&apos;s detention is, among other things, a watershed moment for the international art world, the equivalent of the moral tests so badly flunked by technology companies like Cisco and Yahoo when faced with the dizzying financial vistas of the Chinese market. Notoriously fond of adopting radical postures, and notoriously shy of turning down money, players in the business of contemporary art \u2013 gallerists, collectors, curators, auctioneers and fellow artists \u2013 must now decide what risks (if any) they are prepared to take in defence of one of their own. In the US, the Milwaukee Art Museum, which is about to host a &quot;Summer of China&quot; in collaboration with the Palace Museum in Beijing, has become a focus for discussion about what role museums can or should play in the debate about artistic censorship and human rights. Stung by online criticism of its decision to participate in the Hong Kong International Art Fair, Ai&apos;s London dealer, the Lisson Gallery, recently announced that, while it &quot;deplored&quot; the artist&apos;s detention and was &quot;committed to the campaign to secure his release&quot; . . . to &quot;withdraw from ART HK and not show work by the artist would make us complicit in the authorities&apos; attempt to silence him and his supporters&quot;. His German dealer, Neugerriemschneider, has placed a banner on the outside of its Berlin building, asking &quot;Where is Ai Weiwei?&quot; and distributed badges designed by Ai&apos;s friend, the Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija. They will also be at ART HK, where they intend to &quot;make Tiravanija&apos;s statement visible&quot;. The website of Ai&apos;s Swiss dealer, Galerie Urs Meile, which has a space in Beijing, offers images of his work but mentions nothing about his detention. Galerie Urs Meile, which did not respond to a request for comment, will also exhibit in Hong Kong. Is &quot;being present&quot;, as the Lisson put it, just code for &quot;business as usual&quot;? Or do the galleries intend to use that presence (and their networks of wealthy and influential Chinese collectors) to further Ai&apos;s cause? Ai&apos;s confrontation with the Chinese authorities has been a long time coming. One could say, without being melodramatic, that he was born into it. He is the son of the admired poet Ai Qing, a communist who had been with Mao in Yan&apos;an in the years before the 1949 revolution, but fell foul of the party during the anti-rightist movement of the late 1950s and was declared an enemy of the people. In 1957, shortly after Weiwei&apos;s birth, Ai Qing was sent for &quot;re-education through labour&quot;, first to a forest in Heilongjiang (Manchuria), then to the far western highlands of Xinjiang, where the family lived for a time in a pit dug out of the earth, and Weiwei would go to watch his father, aged almost 60, cleaning the public toilets for a village of 200. Xinjiang, where winter temperatures can drop as low as -20C, was Weiwei&apos;s world until the age of 19. In 1976, as the terror of the cultural revolution abated, Ai Qing was rehabilitated and the family moved back to Beijing. Weiwei began to draw, tutored informally by friends of his father. He was also given three art books, an incredible rarity in China at that time. Two \u2013 one on Impressionism and a monograph about Van Gogh, he kept. The third, on Jasper Johns, went in the bin. &quot;I just couldn&apos;t figure out whether it was art,&quot; he later explained. In 1978 he enrolled at the Beijing film academy and was soon part of a milieu of artists and radicals who took advantage of the thaw in Communist party policy to voice their desire for change. That December, a long brick wall in Beijing&apos;s Xidan street became the focus for dissent. Ai was one of a small group (he estimates it at fewer than a hundred) of activists who pasted posters and broadsides on the so-called &quot;Democracy Wall&quot;. The movement was suppressed after a young electrician called Wei Jingsheng put up a poster calling for a &quot;fifth modernisation&quot;. It was party policy to push for progress in four areas \u2013 industry, agriculture and national defence. Wei wrote that &quot;we want to be masters of our own destiny. We need no Gods or Emperors. We do not believe in the existence of any saviour. We want to be masters of the world and not instruments used by autocrats to carry out their wild ambitions. We want a modern lifestyle and democracy for the people. Freedom and happiness are our sole objectives in accomplishing modernisation. Without this fifth modernisation all others are merely another promise.&quot; Wei was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in a labour camp. Ai was profoundly affected by the fate of Wei Jingsheng and the other leaders of the Democracy Wall movement. As soon as he could, he left China for the US, winding up in New York, where he lived on the Lower East Side and moved in the fringes of the vibrant downtown scene. For a time he studied at Parsons School of Design, but his teacher, the artist Sean Scully, pronounced that his technically adept drawing had &quot;no heart&quot;, and Ai, &quot;ashamed&quot;, soon dropped out. He supported himself with a variety of odd jobs, including an extremely successful stint as a blackjack player, during which he headed up to Atlantic City two or three times a week for marathon card sessions. Though Ai was an obsessive gallery-goer (&quot;I must have seen every exhibition in the 1980s,&quot; he claims) he found little to connect with in the then-fashionable Neo-Expressionist painting of Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. His two great New York discoveries were Dada and Andy Warhol. The readymades of Marcel Duchamp, and the notion that functional objects could be subverted to make them &quot;useless&quot; and strange, were fascinating to a young man who had only been exposed to extremely traditional forms of art. Of Warhol he wrote that he &quot;was a self-created product, and the transmission of that product was a characteristic of his identity, including all of his activities and his life itself&quot;. The possibility that art could be present in all the actions and gestures of the artist was to be the foundation of his future practice. By about 1986 he had given up painting and was making objects out of coat-hangers, shoes, raincoats and other everyday items. On his return to China in 1993, Ai brought with him a commitment to conceptualism, and a lofty notion of Modernism, which he saw as a kind of total interrogation of the human condition: &quot;Modernism has no need for various masks or titles; it is the primal creation of the enlightened, it is the ultimate consideration of the meaning of existence and the plight of reality, it is keeping tabs on society and does not cooperate. Enlightenment is attained through a process of self-recognition, attained through a teeming thirst for\u00a0and pursuit of an inner world, attained through interminable doubts and puzzlement.&quot; The idea that the &quot;pursuit of an inner world&quot; is a primary artistic activity may seem banal to anyone who grew up with conventional western Romantic notions of art, but Ai has made it the foundation of his challenge to the Chinese state, which he accuses of producing &quot;a society without citizens&quot;. &quot;A person with no true rights cannot have a complete sense of morality or humanity,&quot; he wrote in 2008. &quot;Freedom of expression is one of life&apos;s basic rights . . . Modernity cannot exist without freedom of speech.&quot; Ai&apos;s connection of artistic Modernism to human rights and a kind of relentless questioning of the political, social and psychological status quo is arguably one of the most important developments in Chinese art since it opened up to the West at the end of the Cultural Revolution. In the 1990s, Ai published a series of influential underground books, known as the &quot;Red Flag books&quot;, which introduced other Chinese artists to his ideas and tried to prod them into thinking more critically about their art-making. He also produced thousands of photographs, many of them witty and provocative, such as the now-famous image of his wife-to-be, Lu Qing, winsomely lifting her skirt in Tiananmen Square, or the series drily titled Studies Of Perspective, in which the photographer gives the finger to the White House, the Eiffel Tower and other national cultural monuments. In 2000 he organised a counter-exhibition to the Shanghai bienniale, with the blunt English title &quot;Fuck Off&quot;, a phrase deadpanned into Chinese as &quot;Unco-operative Approach&quot;. Seen by many international curators and critics, it turned Ai into a fully fledged art-star. One of Ai&apos;s productive borrowings from Warhol was the idea of the factory. Very quickly, he was running an atelier with a huge number of technically skilled assistants, producing large-scale sculptural pieces. Like other Chinese artists, who have access to cheap labour and unusual materials, this positioned him perfectly to perform in the environment of international biennials, the artworld equivalent of the blockbuster summer action flick, where grandeur and scale of statement are everything. After he designed a house for himself in 1999, a string of architectural commissions ensued, as developers in the booming Chinese regions scrambled to add some cultural gloss to their portfolios. His architectural style is simple and unadorned. As he wrote, &quot;I don&apos;t aspire to be surrounded by precision, and my own life experiences have little to do with precision, but I do aspire to rationality and reason in art.&quot; One side effect of China&apos;s breakneck development has been the wanton demolition of old neighbourhoods. In Beijing, huge swaths of the city&apos;s old hutongs, or lanes, have been erased to make way for a new urban landscape of high-rise condos and malls. Ai&apos;s art is intimately bound up with this, in complex and sometimes troubling ways. Many of his large sculptures use wood and furniture from Ming and Qing dynasty structures (often temples) which have been demolished by developers. Ai salvages and makes these once &quot;useful&quot; or functional things into oddities: a beam pierces a table; stools cluster together like huddled people; a map of China is drilled through a lintel like words in a stick of rock. In a 2007 piece called Template, decorative doors were fixed together to make a monumental structure with a temple-shaped cut-out at its centre. Ai is clearly aware of what is being lost through the thoughtless destruction of China&apos;s heritage. &quot;The extermination of a nation&apos;s collective memory and its ability for self-reflection is like a living organism&apos;s rejection of its own immune system. The main difference is that this nation won&apos;t die, it will only lose its sense of reason.&quot; However he seems to feel a tension between the wish to acknowledge history and a contrary wish to overcome it. In 2008 he wrote that &quot;creativity is the power to reject the past, to change the status quo and to seek new potential&quot;. Much of his work involves rejection of the most violent kind. In 1995 he had himself photographed dropping a Han dynasty (206BC\u2013 AD202) urn on to a hard tiled floor. This shocking act has analogues in western contemporary art. Robert Rauschenberg erased a drawing by Willem de Kooning and the\u00a0Chapman brothers made cartoonish alterations to a set of Goya&apos;s Disasters of War etchings, titling the result, Insult to\u00a0Injury. The art market fetishises objects in the name of preserving their value as commodities, and this is something artists have frequently felt the need to kick against, but in the Chinese context Ai&apos;s act has a second set of meanings. China is a place that has sometimes staggered under the weight of history and has more than once attempted to erase it. The &quot;first emperor&quot;, Qin Shihuangdi, is said to have decreed the burning of the entire corpus of historical knowledge, and murdered 460 Confucian scholars by burying them alive. During the cultural revolution, museums, archives and temples were ransacked. Ai helped his own father destroy his library. &quot;We had to burn all his books because he could have got into trouble. We burned all those beautiful hardcover books he collected, and catalogues \u2013 beautiful museum catalogues. He only had one book left, which was a big French encyclopedia.&quot; Some of Ai&apos;s destructive gestures are hard to stomach. In Colored Vases (2006), he started with a group of 50 neolithic vases, dating from between 3,000 and 5,000 years BC. They are beautiful, delicately painted in red, black and ochre, a precious link to prehistory. Ai drenched them in lurid industrial paint, turning them into objects that seem crass and banal. He has painted other vases with corporate logos and ground rare porcelain into powder. Yet he railed against the Beijing city authorities for painting the streetscape of the hutongs a uniform grey in preparation for the Olympics. A clue to this apparent contradiction may be found in Ai&apos;s valorisation of people over objects. Though he speaks of human rights, and much of his thinking is evidently influenced by western liberalism, many of his statements echo the classical Marxist formulation of alienation: &quot;The more the worker expends himself in work the more powerful becomes the world of objects which he creates in the face of himself, the poorer he becomes in his inner life, and the less he belongs to himself.&quot; His idea of Modernism as a rediscovery of the inner life of people necessarily involves having an antagonistic relationship to the world of things. In 2006, internet portal sina.com helped him start his famous blog and in 2007 he used it to gather participants for Fairytale, a profoundly humanist project in which he took 1,001 Chinese to Germany for the Documenta exhibition. The participants, from all walks of life, were not themselves &quot;exhibited&quot;. They did not become things. The experience was theirs. Ai&apos;s intention was to offer them the &quot;fairytale&quot; scenario of foreign travel, alongside a second fairytale for the citizens of Kassel, the experience of seeing and meeting Chinese people in their small town. In 2008 he collaborated with Herzog &amp; de Meuron on the &quot;bird&apos;s nest&quot; Olympic stadium, but rapidly became disgusted with the &quot;pretend smile&quot; he felt China was putting on for the games and announced he would not attend. He publicly excoriated the film director Zhang Yimou (Raise the Red Lantern, House of Flying Daggers) and the artist Cai Guo Qiang (the man whose firework dragon failed to ignite on the Thames at the millennium) for creating the opening ceremony, which he termed &quot;a visual crap-pile of phony affection and hypocritical unctuousness . . . an encyclopedia of spiritual subjugation&quot;. On 12 May 2008 came the turning point, when this provocateur and prankster became a genuine threat to the Chinese state. An earthquake of magnitude 8.0 hit Sichuan province, its epicentre 50 miles north-west of the capital Chengdu. Official figures later confirmed 69,000 dead and 374,000 injured, with another 18,000 unaccounted for. As the scale of the devastation became clear, Ai wrote a series of blog posts, at first grief-stricken and then increasingly angry as it became apparent that school buildings throughout the region had been disproportionately affected by the earthquake. Up to 7,000 schools collapsed, often in places where surrounding buildings remained standing. An unknown number of pupils were inside. The so-called &quot;tofu dregs&quot; construction of these schools appeared to be the result of official corruption and siphoning off of funds. Because of China&apos;s one-child policy, many families had lost their only son or daughter. It soon became clear that the authorities were attempting to hush up the deaths of children in the &quot;tofu dregs&quot; schools. Parents were harrassed. No official list of the dead was published. Incensed, Ai financed a so-called citizen investigation to pressure the provincial government to take responsibility for the deaths and release the list of names. Volunteers met with bereaved families and collected footage for a documentary that Ai distributed freely throughout China. After the citizen investigation, Ai&apos;s phone was tapped, surveillance cameras were mounted conspicuously outside his house, and the sina.com blog was closed. Ai turned to Twitter, and began to incorporate imagery of the earthquake into his monumental international commissions. At Munich&apos;s Haus der Kunst, he exhibited thousands of children&apos;s backpacks, covering the museum&apos;s facade, spelling out a quote from the mother of one of the victims: &quot;She lived happily in this world for seven years.&quot; In August 2009 Ai went to Sichuan with his usual entourage of assistants and videographers, to testify at the trial of Tan Zuoren, another activist for the rights of earthquake victims. He was woken at 3am in his Chengdu hotel room by police pounding on his door. As they tried to gain entry, Ai was struck on the head. It was only when he left the country for the Haus der Kunst show the following month that his subsequent headaches were diagnosed as a cerebral haemorrhage, and he underwent surgery. In January this year Shanghai authorities demolished his new studio, claiming it had been built illegally. As the pitch of his confrontation with the authorities increased, some observers began to fear for Ai&apos;s life. Others believed his international fame made him untouchable. After the so-called jasmine revolutions swept the Arab world at the beginning of the year, the Chinese authorities mounted an extensive campaign of detentions and ramped up censorship. As the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre approaches on 4 June, it seems to have been decided to remove Ai from circulation. The news that he is to be prosecuted for fraud seems to be a tactic to discredit him within China, where many people see him as unpatriotic, his human rights activism no more than &quot;shameless&quot; publicity-seeking. Whether it is possible for the international artworld (or even international governments) to influence the Chinese authorities to bring about his release is an open question. Simplistic calls for protests and boycotts have to confront the ineffectiveness of such tactics in previous situations of this kind. Some China-watchers feel that international support for prisoners of conscience like the Nobel prizewinner Liu Xiaobo and journalist Shi Tao have made their freedom less, not more, likely. Yet at the same time there is something distasteful about the spectacle of chic art-folk performing their outrage in the safety of London or New York or Berlin, while raking in the cash in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The art market is essentially no more than a high-end service industry catering to the global elite, and it&apos;s perhaps asking too much for it to have a moral conscience. Yet art makes high claims for itself, and perhaps players in the 21st-century artworld need to pay more than lip service to the ideals of Ai Weiwei. On 23 August 2009, he tweeted this: &quot;If there is one person who is still not free, then I am not; if there is one person who still suffers from insult and humiliation, then I do. Do you understand yet?&quot; If he is not free then we are not. If he suffers from insult and humiliation, then we all do. Wherever he is, we are with him. Do we understand yet?

One of the country&apos;s biggest manufacturers of the weather-modifying ordnance said its warehouses were empty despite raising production by 30%, operating on weekends and adding two hours to shift times. Workers on the assembly lines of Jiangxi Gangsi encase catalytic chemicals \u2013 usually silver iodide or liquid nitrogen \u2013 in shells, which are fired by cannon or dropped from aircraft, to create water droplets in clouds that will fall as rain. Since 2000, the company has played a key role in China&apos;s weather-modification programme, thought to be the world&apos;s biggest, with an annual budget of \u00a365m and offices in 30 provinces. It is one of the nation&apos;s biggest makers of cloud-seeding shells, but company managers told the Guardian that they have struggled to meet a surge of demand during an unusually hot, dry spring. &quot;There is demand but not enough supply. This year is special,&quot; said Gu Jiangjun, a sales manager. &quot;We normally produce 3,000 shells a month but now we are aiming for 4,000 to 5,000.&quot; Even for a country that is used to drought, this year&apos;s arid spell has been shocking because of its duration and location: the Yangtze region is usually considered one of the lushest in China. But Asia&apos;s greatest river is shrinking and shallowing, along with many of the lakes around it. Shanghai is in its longest dry spell for 138 years, according to People&apos;s Daily. Further upstream, Hunan is suffering the worst drought since 1910, affecting water supplies for 1.1 million people and 157 urban areas. Television bulletins and newspapers are filled with images of dead fish, stranded ships and dry river beds. Hydropower production has been slashed and vast swaths of paddy fields are parched. The Three Gorges dam has been forced to cut hydropower generation and open its sluice gates to provide more water to downstream areas. Recent cloudbursts \u2013 some precipitated by weather-modifying techniques \u2013 have raised hopes that the rainy season may finally have arrived. But the China Meteorological Administration forecasts a short, sharp \u2013 and possibly dangerous \u2013 flood season, amid a long, hot summer. Agency officials encouraged local governments to make continued use of weather-modifying techniques. &quot;We attach great importance to artificial rainfall in the effort to ease the drought,&quot; said the administration&apos;s vice director, Chen Zhenlin. Chinese scientists claim that cloud-seeding can increase precipitation in targeted areas by 10-15%. However, production of the shells may be hindered by government price controls. Each cloud-seeding shell costs about 1,000 yuan (\u00a394) \u2013 a figure that has been set since 2000, which means there is little financial incentive to boost production. &quot;We proposed a price increase to our senior executives,&quot; said Gu. &quot;They sent a team to investigate the cost-production capacity.

China now has the world&apos;s third-biggest stock markets after the US and Japan. Quelch said Coca-Cola&apos;s move was the latest signal in a wider shift in the world economy. &quot;The percentage of the market cap of global companies that is currently held by US investors is going to decline. In 10 years&apos; time, I&apos;d predict that 20 companies in the Fortune 500 will have Asian chief executives.&quot; Last year, Coca-Cola&apos;s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said that the company intended to spend $2bn in China. The firm&apos;s Sprite brand is already the country&apos;s top selling soft drink. But competition is fierce from local brands Wahaha and Kangshifu and American arch-rival Pepsi, which has a deal with Yum Brands, owner of KFC and Pizza Hut. China is Yum Brands&apos;s fastest growing market: the company opened 500 new restaurants there last year. It now has over 4,000 outlets including the local Little Sheep Mongolian barbecue chain.

Overseas companies can list in Hong Kong but they are barred from doing so in mainland China. Chinese investors can only buy overseas-listed shares through special investment programmes. Plans to allow the listing of foreign firms have been under discussion since 2007. But the financial crisis is believed to have delayed the authorities&apos; plans to allow qualified foreign companies to issue yuan-denominated stocks.

Sky News was giving free publicity in April to the installation of a large statue beside a London office block, telling viewers that the 4.5-metre bronze figure was one of surrealist artist Salvador Dal\u00ed&apos;s &quot;most famous sculptures&quot;, which had travelled on exhibition round the world. This gargantuan Alice in Wonderland is for sale to City traders at a hefty \u00a31.535m, along with two dozen less expensive smaller bronzes also from the Modern Masters Gallery. Some are priced at \u00a3400,000-plus, and others around the \u00a320,000 mark. Dal\u00ed sculptures have ballooned into a very big business. The exhibition at Moor House is part of a worldwide phenomenon: such sculptures were previously on sale at the Dal\u00ed Universe (the former County Hall site on London&apos;s South Bank), in Paris and in Shanghai. A show is now open in Venice. Another has just closed at the Warner Centre in New York including, according to the New York Times, two pieces: Woman Aflame and Persistence of Memory, priced at more than $1m (\u00a3612,000) apiece. Another three of the bronzes have already reportedly been snapped up from a show at the Art and Science Museum in Singapore. Dal\u00ed, the celebrated showman of surrealism, died in 1989 at the age of 84, after spending some years in an enfeebled state. He was primarily a painter, but since his death thousands of these sculptures have been retailed under his name, making fortunes for the sellers. Art insiders estimate that continued control of the Dal\u00ed sculpture trade is worth at least \u00a360m to the rights owners. But a Guardian investigation has revealed growing concern among experts and the art market. One dealer says: &quot;Those in the know call these sculptures &apos;Almost Dal\u00ed&apos;.&quot; The official Dal\u00ed foundation in Spain says it will not offer authentications of any sculptures, and wants to mount an investigation of the whole business. A variety of offshore entities promote the sculptures through impressive-sounding exhibitions, colourful websites and glossy literature. They include IAR Art Resources, a Cyprus-registered corporation; a foundation based in Liechtenstein; and a Swiss foundry. Other companies involved are called Camblest, Jemelton and InterArt Resources. But behind much of this facade is a single figure, a millionaire international entrepreneur, the Italian art dealer Beniamino Levi. He says he purchased a number of rights from Dal\u00ed&apos;s former manager, Enrique Sabater, as well as signing some contracts with Dali while he was alive. The sculptures that Levi manufactures and sells were not, however, actually made by Dal\u00ed. Many are now being produced, in &quot;editions&quot; of sometimes more than a thousand at a time, years after the painter&apos;s death. They are based on images in Dal\u00ed pictures, but it is often unclear what role, if any, the painter played. Alice in Wonderland, for example, is on sale both in the 4.5-metre version and a smaller one-metre size, priced at \u00a319,500. In the Moor House catalogue they are described as &quot;conceived in 1977&quot;. In the price list, it is disclosed that the large Alice is in fact one of a series of eight, all identical. The smaller figure comes, it says, in a far bigger &quot;limited edition&quot; of 350. This itself turns out to be far from the whole story. The small print in the catalogue makes a number of further carefully worded statements. The edition of 350 turns out to be a potential mass production of more than 1,000, in shades of blue, green or brown, because &quot;the sculpture . . . is cast in three separate editions, each with a different patina&quot;. The Alices were not originally made in 1977 as the unwary might imagine. Instead they were &quot;cast at a later date&quot; with an initial piece &quot;first cast in 1984&quot;. The sculptures, the catalogue concedes, might, in fact, have been manufactured as recently as 2005, when the artist was dead for 16 years. Manufacturing can presumably continue into the future, as long as the market will bear it. The Guardian observed sales staff assuring potential buyers that Dal\u00ed made the original wax models, or maquettes, for such sculptures with his own hand. But scrutiny of the small print reveals that this is not necessarily so. When challenged, Levi admits such claims are sometimes a &quot;mistake&quot;. Some particularly artful phrasing in the catalogue claims only that the sculptures come from moulds &quot;originating in the artist&apos;s lifetime&quot; that are &quot;realised from&quot; an original artwork by Dal\u00ed. Buried in a technical description, it is said that the model to be cast can be first created by the foundry artisan and that a two-dimensional drawing &quot;can form the basis for the sculpture&quot;. In fact, the Alice in Wonderland statues appear to be simply clumsier 3D versions of a Dal\u00ed design that first surfaced in 1977 on a tapestry. This depicts Alice on a geometric background. There, she throws a strong shadow, and has a slightly different headpiece. But the run of Alice sculptures clearly come from a sketch of this design, rather than a wax or plaster maquette made by Dal\u00ed&apos;s own hands. According to two proffered &quot;certificates of authenticity&quot;, these Alice sculptures were &quot;authorised by written contracts signed by the artist or the artist&apos;s [un-named] legal representative&quot;. One certificate is signed by IAR Art Resources Ltd of Cyprus and the other by Perseo SA, a foundry in Mendrisio, Switzerland. According to Swiss company records, both are controlled by Beniamino Levi himself. Levi will not reveal the contents of the actual contracts, nor the records of the total number of statues his foundry has turned out. The Modern Masters Gallery in London, which currently sells the sculptures, and is planning to market more at Henley Festival this July, is in turn run by a subsidiary of Levi&apos;s private company, IAR Art Resources. The &quot;Almost Dal\u00ed&quot; trade, which has several rival publishers but is dominated by Levi, is immensely profitable. One dealer, who asked to remain anonymous, estimated that it would cost Levi no more than \u00a31,000 a time to have a foundry manufacture one of the bronzes subsequently priced at more than \u00a325,000. Levi&apos;s displeased reaction suggests this estimate is not too wide of the mark. He says: &quot;You know how much it cost Jeff Koons to do the sculpture he sold for \u00a320m? \u00a33,000! So why you asking me this question?&quot; According to insiders, a wealthy South African property developer once purchased an entire run of 29 statues to which Levi has rights, when they were on display on London&apos;s South Bank. Carlos Slim, one of the world&apos;s richest men, also splashed out on 38 of Levi&apos;s Dal\u00ed sculptures in 2008, via a Florida dealer, Robert Priess of R&amp;R Bond Gallery, to stock a large museum the Mexican telecoms tycoon has personally constructed in Mexico City. Perhaps as a result of such transactions, the octogenarian Levi, along with his New York-based art dealer wife, has a sumptuous residence on Ibiza, as well as his house in Switzerland. Levi presents himself primarily as a philanthropist in his publicity material. He is president of the Stratton Foundation, registered in the secretive tax haven of Liechtenstein. This is, he says, &quot;a non-profit organisation dedicated to promotion of culture and the arts&quot;. However, the official Salvador Dal\u00ed Foundation, based in Spain, takes a dim view. Its head, Joan Manuel Sevillano, whose organisation sells its own lines of Dal\u00ed merchandise, describes the swelling sculpture trade as &quot;a vast illusory world&quot; of over-priced pieces of dubious artistic merit. &quot;Promoters of sales of thousands of multiple editions of Dal\u00ed sculptures are living in another world,&quot; he says. &quot;There is a grey area around Dal\u00ed sculptures. A lot of material Dal\u00ed authorised through licensing, or contracts, were based on drawings by him \u2013 but often were not created by him.&quot; These multiples, he says, &quot;are being marketed as a commercial exercise, very similar to luxury merchandising. You look at a sculpture and you don&apos;t know what you are seeing \u2013 is it one out of 10, or 300 in three different patinas, so it&apos;s 900? And did Dal\u00ed make it or not, or is it made by a third person with Dal\u00ed&apos;s permission or not?&quot; Sevillano says some of the pieces that Levi puts on show cannot be classified as works of art. &quot;These are commercial sculptures, made for decorative purposes.&quot; There seems to be little market for them at major auction houses. Sotheby&apos;s in New York says only three Dal\u00ed sculptures have been accepted since 2008 and they were unsold. In Sotheby&apos;s London only three sculptures sold in the same period, and Christie&apos;s appears not to deal in such pieces. &quot;Serious collectors won&apos;t touch this stuff,&quot; claims one London-based dealer. Dawn Ades, a leading UK Dal\u00ed scholar and a professor at the University of Essex, says of the sculpture trade: &quot;Dal\u00ed&apos;s name has been exploited, taking advantage of an all-too-gullible public.&quot; She says: &quot;It&apos;s a murky area.&quot; Art historian Dr Elliot King of Colorado College agrees: &quot;When people see an enormous Dal\u00ed sculpture like Profile of Time that was once on display at Kew Gardens, they automatically think the artist was like a Michelangelo, but you have to be clear what these giant sculptures are: figures based on works Dal\u00ed has done. That&apos;s why it&apos;s all very sticky \u2013 the number of editions that are made and the different patinas. Which ones Dal\u00ed actually signed, which ones are legitimate, which ones are not.&quot; The Guardian put these allegations to Levi in Paris, where he was presiding at his Dal\u00ed exhibition between trips to Ibiza and Switzerland. He said of the Dal\u00ed foundation: &quot;They are very jealous. I bought everything before them.&quot; The foundation accepted, he pointed out, that he had legitimate rights to the Dal\u00ed images that he purchased from the painter&apos;s secretary: &quot;I gave a lot of money to Sabater.&quot; He confirmed that the Alice sculpture was based on a drawing, according to rights he bought in 1984 and 1989. &quot;I have a document in French. In 1983 Sabater signed it with Dal\u00ed to have the rights to create the sculptures in different sizes and patinas based on a plaster someone else did, based on Dal\u00ed&apos;s drawings. . . This paper says that this plaster was made in Spain and Italy, and Dal\u00ed approved it. I don&apos;t know: I was not there.&quot; Asked if he could claim to collectors that these sculptures would increase in value, like Dal\u00ed paintings, Levi replied: &quot;If I am honest, I can&apos;t say that, as I can&apos;t say it about the stock market . . . If you like it, buy it. I can&apos;t guarantee anything.&quot;", "tags": ["Salvador Dal\u00ed", "Art and design", "Sculpture", "Art", "The art market"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-02T19:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/02/andrew-marr-megacities-tv-review", "sentences": ["He hangs with a man named Hang in Shanghai, where the buildings grow like bamboo (Marr says it&apos;s &quot;like a German forest of skyscrapers&quot; but my way of describing it is better, given the rate at which they go up and where we are in the world)."], "title": "TV review: Andrew Marr's Megacities", "article": "Andrew Marr is in the slums.

By 2050, 70% of the world will live in cities, he says. By the end of the century three-quarters of the planet will be urban. So, just 5% up on 50 years earlier, but that&apos;s still a hell of a\u00a0lot. It is the big story, the migration of\u00a0people from the country to the city. And Marr tells it well, with both thoughtfulness and the bouncy enthusiasm he&apos;s so good at \u2013 half swotty schoolboy, half favourite history teacher. Dhaka grows by half a\u00a0million every year, which is, as Andy says, like the population of Liverpool turning up on your doorstep every year. Imagine it, an extra half million scousers, every year! Where he&apos;s staying in Dhaka is definitely more Huyton than the Wirral. But the people are lovely \u2013 of course they are, they always are in the slums. They call him Mr Bean. He helps with dinner, hacking the tail off a fish with what looks like a gardening implement. And he forms a slightly embarrassing friendship with a boy called Musharraf (let me help you carry the water, no I\u00a0need to experience the whole water-carrying experience etc). Was Andy in these parts before, I\u00a0wonder, around 14 years ago? I&apos;m just looking at Musharraf&apos;s ears, and thinking a DNA test wouldn&apos;t be unreasonable . . .

He faces biblical swarms of mosquitoes, rats the size of small ponies, toilets almost as bad as the ones at Glastonbury. But he has some of his best thoughts here in the slums at the dead of night. &quot;I think the village is the natural unit and perhaps every megacity is like a huge body crammed with millions of ghostly villages of which this is just one,&quot; he says as the mosquitoes drain his blood. I think he may be right. He visits other megacities. He hangs with a man named Hang in Shanghai, where the buildings grow like bamboo (Marr says it&apos;s &quot;like a German forest of skyscrapers&quot; but my way of describing it is better, given the rate at which they go up and where we are in the world). And Tokyo, still the mega-est of megacities, where, in a tiny glass apartment, he says he feels like &quot;a nude frog in a box&quot;. Eh? I&apos;m finding some of Andy&apos;s similes quite hard to follow today. He&apos;s not much taken with Tokyo, finds it cold and mechanical. And lonely. London&apos;s better, with its street skaters, flash mobs and free runners. It has \u2013 or soon will have \u2013 its brilliant new Shard, like a . . . well, let&apos;s hear what Andy comes up with.

He&apos;s having a bad metaphor day, I think; we all have them. Mexico City, despite all the crime, the traffic and the pollution, is the best of all. There&apos;s no Japanese frog-in-a-box depression and loneliness here. It has a spirit and a vitality about it, and it brings out the same in Andy. He makes friends over grasshopper tacos, and dances with ladies in the square, practises his funny Italian-Spanglish on them. &quot;Scusi, I&apos;m talking to the camera, si, I\u00a0was talking to camera, scusi, una momenti, OK?&quot; he says to a woman who&apos;s hitting on him hard (careful se\u00f1ora, she may not know this man&apos;s reputation).

Since then, protests in his support have been held around the world, and figures such as Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel have called for his release. Ai&apos;s image was projected onto the wall of the Chinese consulate in New York. Hong Kong has been plastered in stickers. In Beijing, artists Lin Bing and Fei Xiaosheng were detained for having the temerity to include a blank wall, &quot;attributed&quot; to the absent Ai, as part of a group show. Though most of these gestures will have little visibility and less effect in China, international museums and galleries are, at least, being forced (somewhat reluctantly) to think about their relationship to wider political contexts. An interesting case is that of the Montreal Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA). Since February, long before Ai&apos;s detention, the MMFA has been host to &quot;The Warrior Emperor and China&apos;s Terracotta Army&quot;, an exhibition of archaeological treasures from the mausoleum of the Qin monarch Shi Huangdi, who united China as &quot;first emperor&quot;, from 221-210 BCE. Like the Milwaukee Art Museum, which is about to open a major summer season of Chinese art, the MMFA has become a target for supporters of Ai, who feel that it should be using its show as a platform to draw attention to the artist&apos;s plight, and the wider human rights situation in the People&apos;s Republic of China. The MMFA has made no public statement, and held no events relating to Ai Weiwei, though the signature of its director and chief curator, Nathalie Blondil, appears alongside those of many other prominent museum directors on a petition organised by the Guggenheim museum, demanding Ai&apos;s release. Questioned by the blog Artists Speak Out, Sabrina Merceron, head of public relations at the MMFA, was quoted as saying:  &quot;We don&apos;t do any politics, we just support art as this is the mission of a museum. It&apos;s very important that you make the distinction as one can perfectly cohabitate [sic] with the other.&quot;  Whether Merceron sincerely believes this, or is just making a mildly incoherent attempt to deflect unwelcome attention, she happens to be wrong. By hosting the terracotta army, the MMFA is &quot;doing politics&quot;, of a kind that is acutely relevant to the case of Ai Weiwei. Since 2007, when the British Museum opened a blockbuster exhibition of artefacts from the first emperor&apos;s mausoleum (drawing more visitors than any exhibition since the Tutankhamun show in 1972), the terracotta warriors have been on almost continuous display in museums around the world. Along with the 2008 Olympics and this year&apos;s Shanghai Expo, the warriors are an integral part of the PRC&apos;s cultural outreach programme, doing the work that pandas used to in the 1970s, when images of cute black-and-white creatures frolicking in the zoos of major world capitals were used to offset China&apos;s forbidding international image. The terracotta army also has a particular political meaning for the Chinese state; it is as a projection of Chinese soft power that it is sent out to march through the world&apos;s cultural centres. The curators of the MMFA are, no doubt, well aware of the history of these artefacts, but perhaps they have failed to connect the story of the first emperor with the situation that has developed in contemporary China since their exhibition opened. The first emperor is, above all, a symbol of unity and harmony, qualities prized in China, where a metaphysical notion of balance is often explicitly related to social and political stability. His reign ended the &quot;warring states period&quot; (from around 475 BCE to Qin Shi Huangdi&apos;s ascent to the throne in 221 BCE), when seven kingdoms battled for supremacy. As unifier of China, Shi Huangdi organised his empire into administrative divisions, standardised weights and measures, and constructed the first Great Wall to separate his kingdom from the nomadic tribes to the north. He was China&apos;s first &quot;great helmsman&quot;, a figure of absolute authority and quasi-mystical power, who brutally crushed all dissent. After unification, the so-called &quot;hundred schools of thought&quot; were suppressed and Legalism became the official ideology of the Qin empire. This ruthlessly utilitarian philosophy held that the only way of ensuring social order was absolute subservience to the state. Control of knowledge and creativity was essential to maintaining harmony, because the ultimate guarantor of stability was a public set of laws, and citizens could not to be permitted to deviate from the behaviour specified by those laws. To avoid scholars being tempted to question the accepted theory, Shi Huangdi ordered almost all books to be burned; 460 scholars were buried alive for owning forbidden texts. When he died (possibly poisoned by mercury, which he was swallowing as a medicine, in the belief that it would make him immortal), a huge mausoleum was built to house the emperor&apos;s remains. Legend has it that 700,000 men were employed in its construction, and it is said to have contained a kind of scale model of the known world, with mercury rivers and seas. The terracotta army was fashioned to guard Shi Huangdi in this underworld. They are, not to put too fine a point on it, the honour guard of an ancient totalitarian state. The parallels between the China of the first emperor and that of the contemporary PRC are clear enough. The terracotta army provides historical legitimacy for the suppression of Chinese freedoms: China, goes the argument, was unified and made great by such tactics. Anyone who supports democracy opens the country to the perils of disharmony and instability. The Chinese people seem, by and large, to believe that as long as the state is bringing them prosperity, the burning of a few books and the burying of a few scholars is a price worth paying.  It seems to me that in the final days of its (no doubt, excellent and beautiful) show, which finishes later this month, on 26 June, the MMFA would only help its project of bringing Chinese history and culture to the people of Montreal by addressing the question of Ai Weiwei. He has been buried alive, and the political order that has buried him has its origins with the terracotta army. It is clear that Ai&apos;s detention is damaging China and weakening its standing in the world. Perhaps, if the Chinese authorities can be persuaded that their crackdown on Ai and his missing associates is not a sign of strength, but of weakness, they will find a way to release him. This, more than moral arguments based on western notions of human rights, may, in the end, hold the key to his freedom.", "tags": ["Ai Weiwei", "China", "Canada", "Art", "Human rights", "US news", "World news", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-03T17:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/05/andy-murray-french-open-rafa-nadal", "sentences": ["Last year, Murray beat Nadal and Federer in the same tournament, the Rogers Cup in Canada, and he went on to beat Federer in the final in Shanghai; important psychological milestones in his growth as a player."], "title": "Andy Murray yet to master key moments against his three big rivals", "article": "There is no dynamic in sport as fascinating as that in tennis between the top four players in the world, who are trapped, willingly, in a symbiotic relationship that will be stretched to the limits of its possibilities for the rest of the summer. And there is no member of that quartet more complex than the No4, Andy Murray. The Scot&apos;s view of his rivalry with Rafa Nadal (1), Novak Djokovic (2) and Roger Federer (3) is that they are tantalisingly beatable on any given day, but that he has yet to settle on a reliable method of disturbing them on the big\u00a0occasion. Nadal and Federer have no such doubts; Djokovic? He might have one or two now, after losing here to \u00a0Federer. Last year, Murray beat Nadal and Federer in the same tournament, the Rogers Cup in Canada, and he went on to beat Federer in the final in Shanghai; important psychological milestones in his growth as a player. The best match he played all year \u2013 better than anything he had managed en route to the earlier Australian Open and surpassing anything he produced in reaching the final in Melbourne a few\u00a0months later \u2013 was his semi-final against Nadal at the World Tour Finals in London. He was inspired that night, a loser and winner at the same time. So hard did he push Nadal that the Spaniard was shattered by the time Federer beat him up in the final. Earlier, Federer had also dismissed Djokovic in their semi-final. How the game moved on after that \u2013 and how quickly it has come full circle. When Djokovic lost for the first time in 43 matches it was to Federer on Friday night and he was beaten mentally as much as physically. Murray and Nadal? Theirs is a relationship built on warmth and respect \u2013 and fierce competitiveness on court. Murray is suspicious of Federer&apos;s calm, but more comfortable in the raw company of Nadal. That is why, when they met in their semi-final, Murray&apos;s first visit to this stage of the tournament, he did not feel inferior. Indeed, he relished the fight. Weirdly, it is against qualifiers, wild cards, lucky losers and also-rans \u2013 such as Eric Prodon, Simone Bolelli and Michael Berrer in the early rounds here \u2013 that Murray is vulnerable. Even Viktor Troicki, a step up from those opponents, hurled him against the wall and bashed him about until the Scot was inflamed to response. Juan Ignacio Chela, the oldest player left in the draw at that point, also embarrassed him. Yet Nadal did not. For much of the three hours and 17 minutes their match lasted, Murray was on level terms. He lost on incremental mistakes, not a failure of will or spirit. Failing to convert 15 of 18 break points is a bald statistic of uncertainty in the moment. Tennis is comprised of hundreds of moments and the important ones arrive whether the player is prepared for them or not. As the wind swirled and the red grit got in his eyes and in his head, Murray&apos;s composure deserted him. Nadal used the wind, Murray fought it. It was a demon, not a\u00a0friend. He had a string of excuses if he needed them, but let them lie. He will not decide until Tuesday if his sore right ankle is strong enough to endure Queen&apos;s. Wimbledon, plainly, is his priority. If Murray had a full-time mentor, maybe he would have handled the many problems and the moments better. But his other defining quality is stubbornness and he will not be bullied into taking on a coach. Afterwards he spoke of the coherence the part-time adviser Darren Cahill has brought to his preparation and expressed no wish to explore other possibilities. &quot;He&apos;s got a lot of experience,&quot; Murray said of the Australian they call Killer, &quot;and he has worked with many different players. He didn&apos;t just steam in and say, &apos;You need to do this, you need to do that&apos; and start telling everyone what to do. He spent a few days not really saying much, but he was figuring everyone out. He just brought stability, which was something I needed. &quot;He&apos;s someone who has been around big events and he&apos;s someone who has played at a high level as well, so he knows how to deal with things emotionally, knows how a player feels. He&apos;s been great and I have really enjoyed working with him.&quot; Murray (alongside the boxer Amir Khan, the most misunderstood athlete in British sport) often gives the impression that contentment eludes him. He left Paris smiling, though, and pleased that his &quot;attitude has improved&quot;. There was nothing to be ashamed of in losing such a major test in a grand slam, because of the level the tennis reached and the convergence of the big moments.

Born in 1963, into a family of artists in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, 200km south-west of Shanghai, Wu entered the Beijing Conservatory in 1977. Among others she was taught by Lin Shicheng, a proponent of the Pudong school of pipa, one of the dominant styles in Chinese classical music which emerged in the 18th century. Wu still plays traditional music but has increasingly focused on more contemporary works. Since moving to America in 1990 she has worked with the Kronos Quartet, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and composers such as Terry Riley and Philip Glass. At her Paris concert she sometimes retreated to the back of the stage, to give her fellow musicians the audience&apos;s full attention.

With the rain pouring down, and Bob Marley blaring over the loudspeakers, Bolt delivered his verdict. &quot;I&apos;m happy I&apos;m back to being Usain Bolt \u2013 it&apos;s not perfect but I&apos;m getting there,&quot; said the 24-year-old. Bolt has been under intense scrutiny following his first two races of the season \u2013 both over 100m \u2013 where, despite victories, his efforts ranked him fourth in this season&apos;s world rankings. But having nailed down an impressive time in Oslo, Bolt responded to his doubters. &quot;I think people expect too much from me sometimes,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m only human but I&apos;m working my way up and I&apos;m getting there.&quot; Pushing all the way, Bolt&apos;s victory never looked in doubt, but he was never likely to be threatened by a field in which only one other athlete had ever run under 20 seconds \u2013 Norway&apos;s Jaysuma Saidy Ndure \u2013 and that was almost four years ago. Still, Bolt is experienced enough to know that he is running against the clock, and for an athlete who has struggled with injury since retiring early from his 2010 season 10 months ago, this was an emphatic return over his preferred distance. And with the news that his biggest rival, Tyson Gay, may not compete over both distances at the world championships in South Korea this summer the path to defending his 200m world title looks rather straightforward. &quot;I think Tyson is thinking about his injury, he has a really bad groin problem which has been bothering him and\u00a0that&apos;s\u00a0why he hasn&apos;t been running 200m all season,&quot; Bolt said. &quot;But for me it&apos;s not about one person, if you only focus on one\u00a0person someone else can come sneaking in.&quot; In the women&apos;s 800m the world champion, Caster Semenya, finished third in a strong field that included all three medallists from the last world championships, as well as Mariya Savinova the European and world indoor champion. Posting a season&apos;s best of 1min 58.61sec, Semenya, who is yet to win a major race this year, said she feels she is still on target to defend her world title. &quot;The Diamond League is not in my mind now, I&apos;m just trying to train for the world champs so I&apos;m not worried about the Diamond League, I&apos;m just going to try and enjoy my races and go home. I think I&apos;m doing quite well, compared to last year, I&apos;m improving.&quot; The South African led the field, with a pacemaker pushing the group hard round the first lap, right up to the home straight where she suddenly faded, finishing behind the 22-year-old Moroccan Halima Hachlaf, and the Russian Savinova. Recovering from illness Britain&apos;s Jenny Meadows was pleased to finish in fifth place with a season&apos;s best of 1min 59.27sec. Having won the first two races of her season, in Shanghai and Hengelo, the 29-year-old had struggled in Rabat \u2013 a race she said she probably was not well enough to compete in. Meadows ran on Semenya&apos;s shoulder all the way to the final bend but, like the South African, faded in the final stages of the race. The 30-year-old was, though, happy with the result. &quot;I knew that with 100m to go I wasn&apos;t myself but after the week after I&apos;ve had, I&apos;m really pleased that I put myself in contention. In a week or two, hopefully I&apos;ll be a lot stronger.&quot; But it was Perri Shakes-Drayton who\u00a0gave the best British performance of the night. The Londoner ran the third fastest time of her career \u2013 improving her season&apos;s best by over half a second \u2013 to finish second in the 400m hurdles. The 22-year-old posted a\u00a0time\u00a0of 54.77sec in only\u00a0her second hurdles race of the season, a time bettered only by her performances at the European Championships in Barcelona last summer, where she won bronze. &quot;I&apos;m very happy with that,&quot; said Drayton. &quot;It felt good and I&apos;m pleased there wasn&apos;t that much of a gap between me and the winner. I wanted to run faster than I did in Eugene last week and come out and run a 54. I did that so I&apos;m very happy.&quot; &quot;My target this year is to go to the worlds and make a final, and I would love to run 53.

It began with the city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) announcing a \u00a360m plan to remodel its riverside centre along the lines of London&apos;s South Bank. &quot;All the [city&apos;s] agencies have come together&quot;, said Mamata Banerjee, the newly elected chief minister of West Bengal, &quot;to convert Calcutta into another London.&quot; If all goes to plan, there will be a &quot;Kolkata Eye&quot;, based on London&apos;s, turning above the River Hooghly somewhere close to Howrah Bridge; a new look for the city&apos;s Alipore Zoo modelled on Regent&apos;s Park Zoo, while Curzon Park, described by the Times of India as &quot;infested with rats ... a dungeon of criminals, pimps and addicts after dark&quot;, will be transformed into a public space of &quot;Hyde Park standards&quot;. This plan has historical precedents: Calcutta was founded by the British in 1690, and with its white stucco neo-classical architecture, ambitious parks and riverside setting, by the mid-19th century it was somewhat reminiscent of London. Today, of course, the British capital is much influenced by Indian culture. Restaurants, cinema, literature, music and fashion aside, even the Jaguars chauffeuring senior politicians up and down Whitehall are made by a subsidiary of the Indian manufacturing giant, Tata, whose chairman, Ratan Tata, very nearly became an architect after studying at Cornell University. From Richard Rogers to Terry Farrell, many British architects have created buildings in China. Until this week however, when Lyndon Neri and Rosanna Hu were announced as the winners of a competition to transform the former Bow Street magistrates court in London&apos;s Covent Garden into a hotel, Chinese-based architects had yet to build in Britain. While a report in Building Design magazine suggests that Neri and Hu undercut their British rivals for the commission in terms of fees, there should be no doubt that these US-trained architects, who set up together in Shanghai in 2004, are capable of very beautiful work. Have a look at the Beijing Whampa Club, opened in 2007, a glamorous remodelling of a redundant courtyard house that might otherwise have been demolished.     Fair game ... Spanish City in Whitley Bay, Tyneside, is set for a \u00a323m revamp    ADP Architects, which has an office in Delhi, as well as several in Britain, has won a commission to lead a \u00a323m regeneration of Spanish City. This is not some blazing hot Mediterranean metropolis, but the old funfair in Whitley Bay, Tyneside facing the sunny North Sea. Centred on an ambitious domed building of 1908 designed by the Newcastle architects Cacket and Burns Dick, Spanish City opened daily from 1980 to the sound of Tunnel of Love, a song written by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, who says he heard his first &quot;really loud&quot; rock concert here. The new-look Spanish City \u2013 named, by the way, after an Edwardian Toreador dance troupe from the Theatre Royal, Hebburn (Geordies in bullfighting gear) \u2013 will feature a four-star hotel and a new YMCA, although for music fans there will be &quot;performance, recording and exhibition spaces&quot;.     Watts Gallery in Compton, Surrey, will reopen on 18 June. Photograph: Richard Bryant/arcaidimages.com    This week, the reopening of the Watts Gallery in Compton, Surrey, was announced. Both admired and maligned in Britain, the prolific and highly eclectic artist George Frederic Watts (1817-1904) was much feted abroad. He was the first living artist to enjoy a solo show in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and won gold medals at the Paris Universal Exhibitions of 1878 and 1889 (the one the Eiffel Tower was built for). Watts built a gallery for his own art, designed by the Arts and Crafts architect Christopher Hatton Turnor, and now renovated by ZMMA. Close by the chapel designed by his wife, Mary Seton Watts, it is as exotic, or even as happily topsy-turvy, as anything in Britain this side of Spanish City or a super-chic Neri &amp; Hu hotel will be in Covent Garden.

Linnaeus, Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace made systematic collections of creatures and things. Linnaeus in the 18th century travelled widely and sent students all over the world. At his death in 1778 Joseph Banks tried to buy his collection, which was finally sold to James Edward Smith in 1783 and is now housed in the Linnaean Society in Burlington House in London. There were 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects and 1,564 shells. His pioneering geological collection appears to have been thrown away by the carriers as just bags of old stones. Collecting has its terrors and tragedies. Wallace spent four years in the Amazon and collected and mounted thousands of specimens of plants and animals, only to lose them all in a fire at sea in the Atlantic. Humans also collect artefacts made by humans. Balzac, in the introduction to The Human Comedy, says that the world consists of &quot;men, women and things \u2013 that is to say, persons and the material representation they make of their thoughts \u2013 that is to say, man and\u00a0life.&quot; He seems to conceive the making of objects as a kind of evolution which differentiates one man from\u00a0another, one society from another. Almost a kind of DNA. In The Human Comedy battles rage for the acquisition of objects and collections. Lives are destroyed by rapacious aesthetes and dealers. And Balzac is a great describer of sculptures and clocks, plates and paintings. Freud too, as Jacqueline Yallop reminds us in her interesting book, was both a collector and interested in collecting. He collected antiquities and described intense collecting as a form of fetishism. In our own time The Antiques Roadshow and Flog It! have fed our interest in artefacts and added a new word, &quot;collectible&quot;, to our vocabulary. The surrealists collected random objects (a collection of which is now on display in Houston in the Menil Collection). Modern artists collect \u2013 Tom Phillips&apos;s amazing collection of African gold weights was recently on show, and Peter Blake apparently has to be restrained from excluding himself from his studio by filling it with found\u00a0objects. Yallop is interested in collecting as an expression of the Victorian age \u2013 &quot;a compulsive urge to do things bigger and better, to bring as many elements as possible under one protective umbrella, to control, to regulate and to extend.&quot; Her book tells the stories of five very different collectors, against a background of the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the birth of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. This was a time when aristocratic good taste was giving way to strong middle-class curiosity about crafts and domestic arts. Her collectors are interested in china and fans, in silver and fabrics, not only in great paintings and sculptures. She begins with John Charles Robinson, an aesthete who collected, in France and Italy, objects displaced or disturbed by the chaos of French politics after the revolution. Robinson was the superintendent of art collections at the South Kensington Museum, which became the V&amp;A, and was constantly at odds with the director of the museum, Henry Cole. They didn&apos;t like each other, but their battle was part of the larger battle between beauty and utility that went on in the world of museums and art education at the time. Cole, and Prince Albert, believed museums were educational and should show ordered examples of good and bad craft work for the instruction of British artists and craftsmen. Cole had instituted a Chamber of Horrors \u2013 a collection of bad taste, &quot;a gloomy chamber, hung with frightful objects in curtains, carpets, clothes, lamps and whatnots&quot;. Robinson collected for art&apos;s sake, and admired the continental museums where objects were displayed in recreated rooms of their periods. There was a school at the museum who believed in orderly rows of all possible knives and all possible bowls. Yallop&apos;s account of Murray Marks, a collector who was a friend of DG Rossetti, is about the aesthetic movement, about peacocks and blue and white china \u2013 sumptuously displayed in the current V&amp;A exhibition of The Age of Beauty. Her most vivid section is about the amazing and resourceful Charlotte Schreiber \u2013 an aristocrat who made two happy misalliances, and seems to have been indefatigable. As a young woman she learned &quot;many languages, including Arabic, Hebrew and Persian&quot;, read Chaucer and Ariosto and &quot;played a mean game of billiards&quot;. She had a flirtation with Disraeli but married a Welsh businessman and threw herself into workers&apos; welfare, education and the furnaces and forges at her husband&apos;s ironworks. She was active in work for the abolition of slavery, free trade and church reform. She found time to translate the Mabinogion from Welsh to English. When her first husband died she married her son&apos;s tutor, Charles Schreiber, and became a serious collector, and patron of Layard the archaeologist. Yallop&apos;s book describes the Schreibers, with their big red collecting bag, trundling across rural France to collect something, before it was snapped up by Duveen, and then proceeding to Paris, only to find that the city was destroyed by the Commune, the barricades and their aftermath. They nevertheless made some bargains with a dealer whose shop had not been ransacked or\u00a0burned. I was also fascinated by Yallop&apos;s account of Stephen Wootton Bushell, who went to Shanghai in 1868 as a young doctor and, as he is described here, took to educating himself about, and collecting, Chinese arts and crafts almost out of boredom, or loneliness. He ended up a great scholar, and went to study the Chinese porcelain collection of William Thomas Walters in Baltimore. In 1896 he published Oriental Ceramic Art, 10 volumes &quot;lavishly bound in yellow cloth, backed with yellow silk&quot; and &quot;full of colour plates and black and white illustrations&quot;. The brief biography of Jacqueline Yallop on the book jacket ends &quot;She does not collect anything.&quot; And as I read the book I thought to myself that I could have guessed that. She collects collectors but seems not to be essentially interested in objects; very few are described, and even the big red bag of Mrs Schreiber can be imagined only as an area of redness \u2013 we don&apos;t know if it is cloth or leather, what its handles are like, how it fastens. She is interested in the psychology of individual collectors \u2013 what tips a man or woman over into ferocious acquisitiveness, into seeking particular things across continents. She is interested in the competitiveness of collectors, their desire to have the first or the best example of something. She is interested in collaboration \u2013 Bushell and Walters \u2013 and in stealth and warfare and stealing marches. She is interested beyond that in dealers \u2013 whose social standing is much lower than that of the great collectors \u2013 and in fakes, and the dealers who deal in them. She has a splendid section on a fake bust of Flora &quot;by Leonardo da Vinci&quot; which took in the art world, and on the professional forgers \u2013 often highly skilled craftsmen \u2013 whose work sometimes stayed undetected in museums for decades. She is also very good on the relations between collections and the larger world around them. Several of her subjects instituted schools or libraries to educate the world. Joseph Mayer founded a public library and a museum in Liverpool and believed, Yallop says, &quot;that his memorial would be secure&quot;. The desire to leave a lasting memorial drove many of her collectors. But in more cases than not, she suggests, the collections are broken up by museum administrators and display artists. Labels that once carried the names of the collectors are replaced by educational ones. Mayer&apos;s library was too expensive to keep up, and the Egyptian collection in Liverpool was bombed. Collections in fiction tend to be sinister. Browning&apos;s last duchess is frozen into a smiling painting. In Balzac&apos;s Le Cousin Pons the skirmish over a collection destroys the collector. My favourite collector is the innocently smiling Adam Verver in Henry James&apos;s The Golden Bowl. He is an American who collects the rarities of old Europe and displays them in his museum in American City. He also collects, and marries, Charlotte Stant, his daughter&apos;s beautiful friend, who is having an affair with his daughter&apos;s Italian husband. Charlotte is &quot;shipped&quot; to American City. She is seen gracefully showing off the garlands looped round a specimen of vieux Saxe porcelain. Maggie, the daughter, perceives her on an imaginary &quot;long silken halter&quot;, describing the collection in a &quot;high coerced quaver before the cabinets in the hushed gallery&quot;. She has become an exquisite specimen.

Three soldiers knocked on the door and a message was passed by the &quot;No 1 boy&quot;, a footman, to Wilding&apos;s mother, Marie Elisabeth. A village on the Chinese mainland had been terrorised by a tiger, and a squad of soldiers was dispatched to kill it. They shot a tigress and ate two of its cubs in a celebratory banquet. One cub, still blind and just 10 days old, survived and the soldiers remembered that the &quot;crazy&quot; foreign wife of a customs official took in all sorts of creatures as pets. So they set off to Santuao, a semi-tropical island where Johnny&apos;s father, the commissioner for the Chinese maritime customs service, lived. If the soldiers hoped to obtain big money for the tiger cub, they succeeded: &quot;Boss-lady&quot;, Marie Elisabeth, purchased Tiggy the tiger for the princely sum of $36 . If the past is a foreign country, the story of Tiggy the tiger seems so exotic as to hail from another planet. Over just one lifetime, everything has changed. Tiggy and Johnny both eventually moved to Britain and Johnny, who is now 87, lives in a red-brick house in Rotherham with his wife, Thelma. They do not have any pets. Tragically, the South China tiger is today thought to be extinct in the wild. But the story of Tiggy and a lost world of white hats, hierarchy and very weird pets, lives on, vividly, in Johnny&apos;s photograph albums and in his memories. His father, Humphery (his name was misspelt by the registrar), mysteriously \u2013 and possibly scandalously \u2013 set out for China aged just 19. He found work at the Chinese customs, rising through the ranks and eventually marrying the Chinese-Danish daughter of his boss. Following his two sisters, Johnny was born in 1923. His earliest memories are not of his mother and father but of his amah, his nurse, and his small white terrier, Pahpee (his attempt to say &quot;puppy&quot;). As an important customs&apos; official, his father was given a lavishly staffed house. Almost 100 people served the family: butlers, waiters, footmen, coolies (cleaners), laundrymen, engineers, rickshaw pullers, boatmen, night watchmen, water carriers and &quot;untouchables&quot; who dealt with the family&apos;s excrement. &quot;My mother was the remote authority behind it all. She never did anything herself of course; it was &apos;Do this&apos; and it was done,&quot; remembers Johnny. His mother was shy and quiet but his parents were also creatures of their time; distant, &quot;like most Victorian and Edwardian parents&quot;, and aloof by the standards of today. Johnny would see them only briefly at breakfast and again at dinner; he cannot remember ever being held or touched by his mother. &quot;There was very little contact between parents and children.&quot; There was rather more contact between Johnny&apos;s mother and her menagerie. &quot;There was a deer and a porcupine and a pelican and a fox,&quot; says Johnny. &quot;There was a chimpanzee and, before my time, a leopard. They all more or less lived together. They each had their cages but would spend several hours each day mingling with the family and the dogs. It didn&apos;t seem to bother them that they were all different species.&quot; One of his earliest memories is of Micky the monkey, who sat on the shoulder of his eldest sister, Freddie, with its tail hanging down. &quot;Aged five, I found this irresistible and I pulled the tail. Calamity,&quot; he recalls. The monkey took fright and Johnny was sent off in disgrace. The bigger chimp, also treated as a member of the family, later created trouble when given a &quot;sly kick&quot; by one of the house &quot;boys&quot;, who routinely tormented it. This time the boy was bitten so badly he had to be taken to hospital. The chimp was put down. It is not the colour of the tropical butterflies and moths that Marie Elisabeth once collected that is lodged in Johnny&apos;s mind but the noise that some made. These spectacular insects were pinned in display cabinets, but his mother did not deploy the traditional &quot;killing bottle&quot;, containing cyanide, in which captured butterflies and moths were swiftly killed. Instead she just pinned up the insects \u2013 alive. &quot;I particularly remember the death&apos;s-head hawkmoths. When they are disturbed, they squeak. These poor things would squeak for a couple of days pinned to the board, but it didn&apos;t seem to bother my mother.&quot; She may have been quiet, but Johnny&apos;s mother was formidable. Their idyllic and privileged existence on a Chinese island came with all the downsides of a tropical paradise: typhoons, rats and snakes. One day, Johnny&apos;s amah rushed into the house to say that a huge snake was eating the pigeons the family kept in a cage outside. A large snake had slithered through a hole in the wire and could not now escape, on account of the large pigeon-shaped bulge in its stomach. Johnny&apos;s mother grabbed the snake and ran her hand up towards its head, ruffling the snake&apos;s belly scales in the wrong direction, a trick that caused it to become motionless, as stiff as a poker. The Chinese staff were impressed, and Johnny&apos;s mother gained a useful reputation as a bit of a sorceress. Proud of her Danish ancestry, Marie Elisabeth decided to breed Great Danes. At one point, she doted on 11 Great Danes and another eight dogs. Local people looked on in bewilderment, unused to the concept of pets, but those &quot;with an eye for an odd penny&quot; would take interesting animals around to their house to see if Johnny&apos;s mother would buy them. And so Tiggy arrived and, after some bartering cost rather more than a few pennies \u2013 $36 was a month&apos;s salary. Marie Elisabeth shared the cost with the wife of the British consul, although Johnny&apos;s mother assumed all responsibility for bringing the tiger up and, while Johnny was sent to boarding school in a remote part of China, bottle-fed it for several months. Barely 5lbs and just 19in from nose to tail when he arrived, Tiggy soon grew and was treated like one of the family dogs. He was very playful \u2013 a favourite trick was to hide behind a chair or door, then leap out and pounce, rehearsing his killer instincts. This was fun for the family at first, but when he became as big as the dogs, it was frightening. &quot;When he was big, Tiggy would jump out and knock you over and lie on top of you with his jaws open over your throat. It was all play and as gentle as anything, as far as it was possible for him to be gentle,&quot; says Johnny. Eventually, Johnny&apos;s mother realised that Tiggy was becoming dangerously boisterous. He could not be returned to the wild and Marie Elisabeth did not trust the Shanghai zoo. With the British consul&apos;s wife also applying pressure, the captain of HMS Kent, then posted in south China, was persuaded to give the tiger passage to a responsible zoo when he returned his ship to Chatham dockyard. Tiggy arrived in England in 1936 to some fanfare, with stories in the Observer and the Sunday Times. &quot;Every evening &apos;Tiger Tim&apos; played on the quarterdeck with the officers,&quot; reported one newspaper. &quot;He was a great favourite with the crew.&quot; It appears from the pictures of Tiggy on deck, assaulting the petty officer put in charge of his wellbeing, that this big cat was not remotely fazed by a few months floating on the high seas. He was found a new home at London Zoo. Soon afterwards, the Wildings travelled to Britain and Johnny&apos;s mother rushed to visit Tiggy at the zoo. Even though she was standing in a crowd, Tiggy recognised her straightaway, and leapt around noisily. &quot;He was obviously desperate to get close, so they allowed my mother \u2013 I don&apos;t know how they got away with that \u2013 to get into his cage and touch him,&quot; remembers Johnny. &quot;They were all over each other. When they parted, I was told that Tiggy kept on roaring for ages afterwards.&quot; All Johnny had known was China but, aged 13, he was sent to boarding school in Britain. &quot;The biggest shock in England was how quiet the nights were. Out in China all the creatures came out at night, and it was noisier than the day,&quot; he says. When the Japanese invaded China in 1937, expats were forced to leave the country, and his father and mother arrived in Britain on the eve of the second world war. Even though they had to flee on a truck through Vietnam and then on an overcrowded boat from Hong Kong, Marie Elisabeth typically managed to persuade the authorities to allow her last Great Dane to accompany her home. Johnny&apos;s father died soon afterwards but as Johnny studied to be a doctor and later became a pathologist, his mother, who had never previously lived in Britain, kept a rather more modest home in Cheltenham for many years with nothing more exotic than dogs to accompany her. Johnny and one of his sisters were forced to renounce their Chinese nationality when war broke out and neither they nor their mother ever returned to China. Nor did they ever see Tiggy again. When she walked out of the zoo, all Marie Elisabeth could hear were Tiggy&apos;s heartwrenching roars. &quot;It was too upsetting,&quot; says Johnny. She was so devastated by their parting that she was never able to visit Tiggy again. After our recent litter of stories \u2013 Tony Fitzjohn (the &apos;Lion King&apos;), Christian the Lion and now Tiggy the Tiger, we are not planning to run any more stories about big cats in the near future!

The basic facts behind why geologists are proposing a new era, are as follows: By the middle of this century the population is expected to be 9 or maybe even 9.5 billion \u2013 up from 2.8 billion in the 1950s. 98% of the extra people from now to 2050, will live in cities and in the emerging and developing markets. By mid-century, there will be at least another 800 million people with middle-class life-styles and many more who really, really want that lifestyle (you only have to travel to Shanghai or Mumbai or Sao Paolo to feel this.) The population growth will lead to a 50% increase in energy demand between now and 2030. A 50% increase in food demand by 2030, and a 30% increase in the demand for water over the same period. The CIA has been warning for years about the dangers of &quot;water wars.&quot; Increased population, growing urbanisation, many more wanting and getting higher standards of living \u2013 plus climate change. John Beddington, the government&apos;s chief scientific adviser calls this combination &quot;the perfect storm.&quot; The Economist&apos;s leading article says of the Anthropocene: What geologists choose to call a period of history normally matters little to the rest of mankind\u2026 The Anthropocene is different. It is one of those moments wherea scientific realisation, like Copernicus grasping that the Earth goes round the sun, could fundamentally change people&apos;s view of things far beyond science. It means more than rewriting some textbooks. It means thinking afresh about the relationship between people and their world and acting accordingly.&quot; The editorial goes on to argue: &quot;The challenge of the Anthropocene is to use human ingenuity to set things up so that the planet can accomplish its 21st-century task \u2026 For humans to be intimately involved in many interconnected processes at a planetary scale carries huge risks. But it is possible to add to the planet&apos;s resilience, often through simple and piecemeal actions, if they are well thought through. And one of the messages of the Anthropocene is that piecemeal actions can quickly add up to planetary change.&quot; This is why in a report updating the business case for responsible business, produced in partnership with Business in the Community (BITC) and launched formally last week, the Doughty Centre for Corporate Responsibility have identified one of the emerging business benefits as \u2013 and I apologise for the inelegant phrasing \u2013 &quot;macro-level sustainable development&quot; \u2013 the advantages ultimately derived for business by sustainable development \u2013 meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The Harvard strategy guru Michael Porter coined the phrase &quot;shared value&quot; in an article he wrote with Mark Kramer which was published in the January 2011 edition of the Harvard Business Review. They cited a number of companies around the world which are already deriving this shared value: corporate and societal benefits blended together, derived from new products and services addressing sustainable development. Sustainability as a key driver of innovation \u2013 another of the business benefits identified in the business case study. In our new &quot;business case for responsible business&quot; we have analysed a range of academic articles and studies published since BITC&apos;s last business case report \u2013 produced with Arthur D Little back in 2003. We also looked at what companies said in their Corporate Responsibility Index and BITC Awards for Excellence submissions. There was a remarkable consistency between the academic studies and what companies themselves said. The study found seven key business benefits: 1. Brand value and reputation 2. Employees and future workforce 3. Operational effectiveness 4. Risk management 5. Direct financial impact 6. Organisational growth 7. Business opportunity Now, of course, there is a subtle interplay which reinforces or undermines these benefits \u2013 and, of course, if we produce a 2020 or 2015 version of this study, we should see the accumulator effect \u2013 the companies which have accumulated years of heritage, longevity of commitment and continuous improvement in their management of environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts \u2013 and which can prove deep authenticity in their commitment to embedding sustainability and responsibility \u2013 should see the exponential business case benefits. In the report, we illustrate the case of Unilever with its dramatic new strategy: to double to size of the business while reducing its environmental impacts. This and some of the examples of other companies at the top of the CRI whose latest results are published today, are certainly recognising corporate social opportunity or shared value \u2013 but I would argue, in the face of the dramatic changes now evoked by the onset of the Anthropocene, that it cannot just be shared value \u2013 it has to be shared destiny. We are all in this together! Tinkering will no longer do, marginal improvements in business processes will not be sufficient \u2013 they will not satisfy concerned employees and customers \u2013 and they should not be acceptable to intelligent investors either. It has long been argued that managing the risks and opportunities of environmental, social and governance is a proxy for good management. I would now argue that with this business case and more fundamentally, with the Anthropocene \u2013 it is not a proxy for good management \u2013 it is good management, it is essential management \u2013 and investors should be demanding nothing less.

Now, in a hotel boardroom in Nottingham, with her agent and a publicist sitting in on a more formal interview as she prepares for next month&apos;s world championships in Shanghai, as well as this week&apos;s nationals in Sheffield, the 22-year-old looks more wary than the teenager I remember so vividly. She&apos;s still friendly but the breathless naivety has disappeared. Adlington seems mature and worldly. She might not be quite as endearing but she has become more interesting. Less than three years have passed since her life changed for ever in August 2008. Then, with victory in the 400m and an epic 800m swim that broke a 19-year-old world record, Adlington was splashed across TV screens and newspapers. But she seemed to be loved for her ordinariness rather than her sporting achievements. Since then, Adlington has suffered some hurtful defeats in the pool and had her appearance ridiculed on national TV. Yet it&apos;s hard not to warm to her when she&apos;s asked if some of these bruising experiences have made her more guarded. &quot;No,&quot; she says defiantly. &quot;With me, what you see is what you get \u2013 I&apos;m 100% me. I&apos;ve learnt that&apos;s the way to be.&quot; Some of her new poise melts away with the candour. &quot;After Beijing my mum and dad used to say to me: &apos;Oh, Becks, try to be a little bit posher \u2013 or maybe don&apos;t swear or maybe don&apos;t do that.&apos; And I was like: &apos;No, I&apos;m not one of them people who can do that.&apos; I said: &apos;Mum, I do swear. I do sound as if I come from Mansfield.&apos; Why should I deny that? People can judge me as they like. Of course some won&apos;t like it \u2013 but it&apos;s just opinion in the end.&quot; What has she liked least about the way her life has changed? After a long pause, Adlington shrugs. &quot;Nothing, really. Nothing has changed in the sense of training and swimming and, outside the pool, everyone&apos;s been so nice and supportive. A woman came up to me in M&amp;S the other day and said: &apos;Good luck next year.&apos; Everyone thinks I&apos;ve already qualified for the Olympics \u2013 but I haven&apos;t. So I just say, &apos;Er \u2026 thanks.&apos; Nobody&apos;s said anything controversial. People have just said, &apos;Well done or good luck.&apos;&quot; This is not quite true and, as awkward as it is to remind Adlington of Frankie Boyle&apos;s venomous barbs against her on Mock the Week, it would be wrong to pretend that everyone has been generous to her. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she says, &quot;it&apos;s obviously not the nicest thing but he&apos;s a comedian, isn&apos;t he? Comedians make jokes. I cannot say I don&apos;t laugh when a comedian tells a joke about someone else. So it would be hypocritical to turn round and say you can&apos;t joke about me. I&apos;m not trying to be an actress or a model. I&apos;m not trying to be anyone but a swimmer.&quot; The real point is precisely the fact that she is a swimmer. Even if she was attempting to get herself noticed by the paparazzi so she could land a small-time acting role or a gig as a honeyed TV presenter, Boyle&apos;s comments would have been cruel. Directed against Adlington, the world&apos;s best distance swimmer, who is fiercely concentrated on training and competing, they were vicious. &quot;It&apos;s hard for a woman,&quot; Adlington says. &quot;A woman has to deal with it \u2013 and that&apos;s never easy. A guy doesn&apos;t get comments on his weight or his looks. They just don&apos;t care, guys, do they? But for women it is difficult because we get criticised for our weight or how we look. It doesn&apos;t piss me off. It&apos;s just how it is. I&apos;ve chosen to ignore it now and I just want people to judge me on the swimming. I&apos;m not trying to be anything else. If I was trying to get on to TV then maybe I could be judged that way. But if only one person says something nasty it&apos;s kind of irrelevant.&quot; Adlington is at her most serious and sensible here \u2013 brushing aside the giggling sneers of Boyle. But real passion pours out of her as she addresses her most piercing disappointments in the pool. There have been three terrible days of competition which she remembers just as powerfully as her momentous 800m in Beijing. The first came at the world championships in Melbourne in 2007. &quot;It was my first senior world event,&quot; she says. &quot;I was just so scared. You know when you&apos;re young and you say [Adlington slips into a stage whisper]: &apos;Oh my God, there&apos;s so-and-so \u2026&apos; You get so overwhelmed. I was scared and nervous and after I didn&apos;t make the final I literally cried for three days straight. Bill Furniss [her coach] didn&apos;t know what to do with me. I was such a mess and men don&apos;t really know what to do when a girl cries, do they?&quot; How did she overcome an experience she has described as &quot;a psychological meltdown&quot;? Adlington leans forward, her eyes glittering with determination. &quot;I was driven from that point. I thought I&apos;m never letting that happen again.&quot; A year later she was supreme in Beijing. Her subsequent defeats in 2009 and 2010 were regarded as surprising by outsiders to her sport \u2013 and as mentally testing by Adlington herself. &quot;People don&apos;t really know much about swimming. The only swimmer they know is Michael Phelps. And so, with me, they thought, &apos;Oh, she won two golds in Beijing so she must be like Phelps \u2013 she should win everything.&apos; My first big race after the Olympics was in the 400m at the world championships in 2009. I had an amazing race against [Federica] Pellegrini and Jo Jackson. I came third but I swam faster than ever and Pellegrini smashed the world record. &quot;People were saying: &apos;Aw, I&apos;m sorry about your bronze.&apos; I said: &apos;What? I did a two second PB.&apos; I was so pleased to be in a race where someone went under four minutes. But it&apos;s hard for people to understand the difference between me and Phelps. No one wins all the time, but he does. The rest of us are just normal human beings.&quot; The 800m is the one race where Adlington can strive to be as imperious as Phelps. Yet, at those same 2009 championships, she endured the second in her trio of bitter defeats. &quot;The 800m was awful. I came fourth. I was so upset because the 800 is the one event I truly love. I always feel it&apos;s my race.&quot; A year later, again in the 800m at the European Championships, disappointment reoccurred. &quot;It was definitely a mental thing. I&apos;d lost quite a bit of confidence after the worlds and I let it get to me. I was jittery with nerves. You know when you drink too much coffee? I was like that.&quot; Adlington won the 400m but in her favourite race, drained by anxiety, she finished seventh. &quot;I never want to be that upset again. It was killing me, the whole race, and I was just thinking, &apos;When is it over?&apos;&quot; Since then, Adlington has swum magnificently at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi and in Britain this year. She is an ambassador for British Gas, the team sponsor for the world championships, but, more significantly, she is the only woman to have already secured one of two places in each of the 200m, 400m and 800m. She can afford to relax this week, as the nationals double as trials for the worlds, and might only swim heats in the 200m and 400m while competing in the 800m final. How has she transformed herself from the jittery wreck of less than a year ago? &quot;I remember to breathe. I know that sounds stupid. But it&apos;s so simple. All I need to do is stop, breathe, and feel calm. I&apos;m dead calm now. I just want to race well and as long as I&apos;m around my best, I&apos;ll be happy.&quot; If she swims well, in Shanghai and again in London at next year&apos;s Olympics, she should win the 800m and, possibly, the 400m as well. But Adlington adroitly eases the Olympic pressure by stressing that her main goal is simply to qualify. Competition is fierce and the 2012 team will be picked solely on the results of next year&apos;s trials. &quot;Unless you&apos;re seriously ill they won&apos;t make any exceptions. It comes down to that one day where you hope everything goes right and you qualify. It&apos;s the same at the Olympics. You only get one chance \u2013 so you&apos;ve just got to pray to God you&apos;re OK. But it&apos;s definitely a good thing. All the races are so close now in Britain it makes you work harder. Everyone&apos;s fighting for them two spots on the team. It pushes you on.&quot; Adlington hopes to replicate her Shanghai schedule by swimming four events in London \u2013 the 200m, 400m, 800m and 4x200m relay. Is she aiming to win another two gold medals? &quot;No, I&apos;m just targeting to go. Four years ago there were only two of us. Now five girls are fighting for two places. My God, you have to be on your game and that&apos;s nerve-wracking. It would be such a disappointment if I didn&apos;t make it to London. I&apos;d be distraught. It would absolutely break my heart to sit there, watching it on TV, seeing everyone else have the time of their lives.&quot; She shudders at the thought and it seems difficult to believe such an imposing competitor will not swim in London. It&apos;s easier to imagine her chasing down more gold. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she nods. &quot;Right now, I just want to get there. But come ask me this time next year and I&apos;ll probably give you an entirely different answer.&quot; Rebecca Adlington will compete for the British Gas GBR swimming team at the World Championships from 24 July.

El Gaucho Vive y Muere En Su Ley is one of our favorite songs from this new work, which comprises his acoustic-pop signature with strong melodies and fine arrangements. As he likes to say: rock without guitars.

CANADA       I(Heart)MusicSocalled - Work With What You Got       Hip-hop? Klezmer? Folk? Pop? Gospel? Some insane, wonderful combination of all of that (and then some)?

After years of thoughts, discussions and drunken promises, the pair have finally been in the studio for the past few months and the result is their eight-song debut release Eye Wonder. It&apos;s a jazzy, funked up, dubbed out Chinese language sonic assault and some of the most exciting music to come out of Shanghai in a while, already receiving radio play in London, LA, Europe and around Asia. Eye Wonder is a landmark release for Chinese underground music.

FINLAND       GlueSatellite Stories - Family       These four young lads from the Arctic city of Oulu play music to bring you nostalgia from events you never really experienced, like the 60s, the first kiss from your elementary school crush and the time you and your best friend bought that awesome 45 single and listened it on your parents&apos; record player. Satellite Stories bring all these feelings with cheerful and fast-paced indie music influenced by Vampire Weekend and The Wombats. FRANCE       Yet You&apos;re FiredMondrian - Or Unicorn       Mondrian are a young Parisian pop band formed in 2007. After releasing their first EP last year, Popshop, they dropped another one, Whippersnapper, just a month ago. Catchy beats, fresh voices and a talent for writing will surely bring them some success. They take everything that&apos;s good in pop to make the best out of it, creating addictive and lovely songs with a high-repeat listening potential. GERMANY       BlogparteiPetula - Wives       Where have they been all these years: playful electro-inspired German artists writing and reinterpreting great songs? Berlin-based Petula definitely is one of those with a wide and emphatic spectrum of styles. Wives is a wary, slightly more uptempo, more electronic cover of a Savoy Grand song. It has just been released on a split EP with all-girl band Candelilla. GREECE       MouxlalouloudaGravitysays_i - The Urge Of Identity / The Figures Of Enormous Grey    classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"350\" height=\"26\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\">    It&apos;s hard not to stare in open-mouthed amazement at the sheer brilliance of Gravitysays_i&apos;s superbly executed, intensely creative and nearly flawless sophomore album, The Figures Of Enormous Grey And The Patterns Of Fraud. They bring together experimental, dark, atmospheric elements along with Greek and Eastern traditional music and examine social values, institutions and morality as an extension of individual, as well as collective, conscience with an emotional clarity and narrative acuity that makes it an undeniable triumph. ICELAND       Icelandic Music MaffiaMorning After Youth - Lived    classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"350\" height=\"26\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\">    Morning After Youth is a four-piece band with a smooth and artsy sound to their music. They are working on their first album which will hopefully be ready this summer. Lived was recorded in the famous Studio S\u00fdrland with Adda 800 and B\u00f6rkur. INDIA       IndiecisionGoddess Gagged - Visionary       Goddess Gagged is a metal band from Mumbai. The band channel melodic post-hardcore in the vein of acts like Architects and Alexisonfire, a foundation given legs by frontman Siddharth Basrur&apos;s almost effervescent vocal delivery. Visionary is a new track, presumably from the band&apos;s upcoming debut album. We suggest you keep your eyes and ears open for that. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarPolyester Embassy - Space Travel Rock N Roll       Polyester Embassy have a deep affection for noises, sounds and a vintage synthesizer. After years of experimenting, they&apos;re bringing out a second album which sounds like Pink Floyd/Flaming Lips/Mogwai/Ride/Spiritualized mixed raw into their own style. IRELAND       Nialler9Ghost Estates - Paris       The members of the newly-formed Ghost Estates were previously of two pretty different bands SickBoy and 8Ball. Their new band may be named &quot;after the thousands of abandoned housing estates built in Ireland during the Celtic Tiger boom years&quot; but there&apos;s plenty going on in their music, from 80s guitar to processed beats to a spoken word interludes and, I kid you not, a treated saxophone solo.  ISRAEL       Metal IsraelSumo Elevator - Pedal Horse       Sumo Elevator is a group of five ex-metalheads with short hair mixing prog-rock/metal, electronica jazz and breakbeat into intense atmospheric electro-fusion pop-rock. Their eclectic line-up consists of traditional rock/jazz instruments (electric guitar, bass guitar and acoustic drums) and turntables, noise boxes, samplers and modern synthesizers. With two years of live performance and studio experience under their belts, Sumo Elevator is about to release a full-length album in 2011 called Breakfast, which Pedal Horse is taken from. ITALY       PolaroidKaribean - We Need The Sun       First day at the sea. The sun is shining, friends all around, Beach Boys playing on the jukebox, see The Housemartins on a surf, meet Vampire Weekend at the bar. It&apos;s all just perfect. One last thing: go here and download Karibean&apos;s free debut EP. It would be the icing on the cake. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaPellejos - Abuelita       Take some inspiration from Jack Kerouac&apos;s Mexico City Blues and recite it on a cantina filled with the country&apos;s intellectual cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, then leave them dumbfounded with the evocation of images of decay, corruption and nihilism. Pellejos started in 2005 when some refusing-to-age contemporary art-farts took a late chance to form a band led by visual artist (now bassist) Daniel Guzm\u00e1n. What seemed to be just some art-wank has endured six years of sporadic gigs that led to bear a (rotten) fruit with a debut LP - a fetid collection of ethylic spoken word from the hoarse mouth of vocalist Ignacio Perales, backed by what sounds like Tindersticks from the Third World. Abuelita is just a random nonsense collection of excuses to fall back into old patterns of drinking. Cheers! NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamSkip &amp; Die - La Cumbia Dictadura       Skip &amp; Die is a Netherlands-based outfit that began as a globally-infused collaboration between South African vocalist/visual artist Cata.Pirata and producer Jori Collignon (also of Dutch electronic experimentalists C-Mon &amp; Kypski and Nobody Beats The Drum), although these days they&apos;re a fully-fledged live band. Via their travels through the towns and cities of South Africa, they&apos;ve forged a contemporary and vibrant wall of sound that mixes electro, hip hop, Afrobeat and South American grooves. While specialising in sexy party bass hits that remind at times of Diplo&apos;s Major Lazer, there&apos;s always a more considered side to their art than simply noise and dance as Music Alliance Pact exclusive La Cumbia Dictadura shows. NEW ZEALAND       Einstein Music JournalCool Cult - Skulls       New Zealand&apos;s best young exponents of shoegaze styled no-wave. Described by UK music blog Sonic Masala as &quot;beautifully formed nuggets of sound that are brimming with exuberance and ebullience&quot;, Cool Cult&apos;s noisy rhetoric is a mixture of early Deerhunter and discordant Canadian punk wizards Women. Their debut album Try Crunch is full of carcinogenic guitar hooks and elegant vocal melodies, with a refreshingly mature approach to constructing traditional pop music. Skulls is the band&apos;s first single, featuring an observantly sleepy vocal melody overwhelmed by a crushing wave of distorted guitar. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceIhab - \u00c6 M\u00e5 F\u00e6r       Who would have thought that Bod\u00f8, a small city in northern Norway, would harbor so much good indie. So far there&apos;s Cold Mailman, Kollwitz, Kr\u00e5kes\u00f8lv and now Gabriel and Ihab, both on newly started Beyond Records. Ihab make quirky indie-rock reminiscent of 90s heroes like Pavement and Built To Spill as well as newer bands like Cymbal Eat Guitars and Algernon Cadwallader. PERU       SoTBIv\u00e1n Fajardo - Calma       Iv\u00e1n Fajardo is a constant in the musical innovation of Lima. In the first edition of MAP in October 2008, we had ERA, his band at that time. More recently Ivan has been working alone. Calma is the first preview of his new direction. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Kubik - Shina-Kak       Victor Afonso, a musician, music teacher and cinephile, had his first release as Kubik in 1999. Since then he has had a steady flow of releases and collaborations. His great love for cinema and music for films shows in his work. His talent has been recognized by artists such as Mike Patton, who invited him to open for Fant\u00f4mas. Shina-Kak is an exclusive download for MAP, taken from Psicotic Jazz Hall, which has just been released. ROMANIA      Babylon NoiseToulouse Lautrec - Yesman       With a name that recalls the famous French painter, the Bucharest trio started in 2009 as an alternative rock band with post-punk flavours. Although their image in the Romanian media is promoted through neo-Dadaist elements, there is nothing absurd in their music. The prominent basslines and the upfront beats remind me of Editors but without those dark guitar riffs. Whimsical and witty, Toulouse Lautrec is what you need now to give your day a push. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopSong Of Return - Trajectory       Trajectory simmers menacingly in a premeditated assault to the senses for two minutes before the drums crash in like a lightning strike and you very quickly realise your Facebook &apos;like&apos; button just isn&apos;t going to suffice. The Glasgow-based alternative dance band (who will appeal to fans of Delphic) is fronted by Craig Grant, formerly of Union Of Knives, and also features Louis Abbott, singer of Admiral Fallow, one of this country&apos;s best new bands. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...Humming Kitten - Monochrome       Little is known of Humming Kitten, and we get the impression they&apos;d like to keep it that way. It is a little disconcerting at first, approaching this musical project without any preconceived ideas of who or what the band members are, and appreciating their musical ideas purely at face value and on first impressions. However, once you soak it all in, you might feel that they&apos;ve been there all along, lurking at your blogs or gigs. Revealing the chief conspirator as an entity known as Keyboard Cat, and that they favour a lo-fi noise-pop approach to their pieces, Humming Kitten ultimately sound so lonely with solitude as their ally. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Simfonika Island - African Sunset       Simfonika Island is a project made up of two very talented individuals, Gianni Capri and Donny Halo. Both have diverse musical backgrounds, one from a very DJ-orientated world and one from a band. With African Sunset comes a song that crosses South African house with the influences of house music from New York City and Europe, all accompanied with some stirring piano and a dash of deep groove. It&apos;s magical.  SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKPigibit5 - Y.O.N.H.A       Sweet indie-pop act Pigibit5 claims kitsch to be the best description of its music, which is heavily based around a twee-pop and chamber-pop sound, also citing influences from folk and hard rock. The band is what remains of Pirigwa - where Ireland&apos;s So Cow on occasion could be found playing an instrument or two - and the members have returned to their former label, Beatball, with the release of first full-length album Cherryboy Revolution a few weeks ago. Y.O.N.H.A is a cheerful tune with a retro pop sound. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerFur Voice - Wimp       Fur Voice is the stage name of David Gracia, an actor and singer born in Murcia and living in Barcelona since 2006. Inspired by electronic and psychedelic acts such as Grizzly Bear and Animal Collective, Fur Voice builds a dark extraterrestrial atmosphere in his debut album, Onto Endo (self-produced and self-released). The first single off Onto Endo, Wimp, takes the best from noise, post-rock and psychedelia and turns it into a dreamy, catchy, epic tune with an ending that leaves you wanting more. SWEDEN      SwedespleaseSummer Heart - Please Stay       It&apos;s almost spring which means summer is still a while away. But we can dream, can&apos;t we? That&apos;s where this song from Malm\u00f6-based band Summer Heart comes in. It&apos;s called Please Stay, but with its Beach Boys harmonies, groovy beat and summer feeling, it may as well be the band&apos;s coup d&apos;\u00e9tat. SWITZERLAND       78sHuck Finn - Sofia       Huck Finn is the moniker of two singer-songwriters who teamed up for a project. Four years ago they won a few music prizes in Switzerland but they struggled to deliver a proper record. On the second attempt they succeeded. Breaking In, their debut album, is bombastic and emotional at the same time. Sofia, their first radio single, will make you weep like a dog. UNITED STATES     The flag of the United States of America     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingDale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. - Morning Thought       The Detroit duo released their full-length debut, It&apos;s A Corporate World, earlier this month, just in time for summer. It&apos;s the perfect season for this record too, full of catchy guitar riffs, melodious vocal harmonies and an added layer of production missing from their earlier works. Morning Thought hops along with glitchy effects, handclaps and enough thoughtful xylophone to keep wandering ears at bay. VENEZUELA     Flag of Venezuela     M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sElefreak feat. El Prieto - RockMafia       In Venezuela, not many rock and rap bands interact. But a couple of months ago, one of the most iconic rock bands, Elefreak, coupled with one of the great exponents of hip hop in the country and created RockMafia, a song loaded with great strength and lyrics that leave a message of reflection.

Then he ditched a spy movie rather than fill it with Communist party &quot;superheroes&quot;. The frustration of making films in a country with &quot;cultural over-cleanliness&quot; has led an internationally acclaimed Chinese director to lash out at its censors, a state news site has reported. Jia Zhangke won the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival in 2006 \u2013 apparently earning the approval of China&apos;s leader-in-waiting Xi Jinping, who is expected to become president next year. But he began his career as an &quot;underground&quot; film-maker \u2013 directing movies that were praised abroad but never saw official release in China \u2013 and he complained of ongoing battles with censors as he addressed a cultural forum in Shanghai. Unusually, his remarks were reported by an official news site, china.org.cn. &quot;The only reason that we cannot make genre movies is the barrier that censorship sets,&quot; Jia said. He said he scrapped a film about a man&apos;s sex life after an official decided it might break anti-pornography laws. He also abandoned a spy film about the Communist party and Kuomintang due to controls. &quot;If I want to make the movie here, I have to portray all the communists as superheroes,&quot; Jia said. &quot;This would betray my original idea and make it difficult to develop the story.&quot; He added: &quot;This kind of cultural over-cleanliness that bans the erotic, violent and terrifying is cultural naivety.&quot; China has a vast censorship apparatus, but films and television programmes are particularly tightly controlled. One film director told the Guardian that censors demanded 400 changes before they would pass his movie. Hong Kong director and producer Manfred Wong told the Shanghai forum that in crime movies made on the mainland all police officers must be portrayed as good guys, while romantic movies cannot show affairs or cohabitation before marriage. He argued that mainland film-makers need a ratings system. Some believe the government might relax constraints if age restrictions were introduced. But Li Hongyu, who writes about film for Southern Weekly newspaper, said it was simplistic to suggest a ratings system would result in less censorship. While western ratings systems focus on issues such as violence and pornography, China has much wider concerns about the content of films, he said. &quot;China&apos;s control over movies is more detailed. China has a movie censoring committee composed of approximately 30 or so staff whose backgrounds are very diverse, spanning from movie professionals, the Women&apos;s Federation, the [Communist] Youth League, teachers, and a religious committee to various governmental administration departments,&quot; Li added. &quot;The debate about introducing a ratings system has been going on for many years. But it is hard to implement, since if the system is used, it will not be easy to cover the government&apos;s other considerations. What if it is concerned about political views?&quot; Official requirements, which concern the moral as well as political qualities of content, can be baffling to outsiders: the head of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television recently denounced TV time travel dramas for their &quot;frivolous&quot; approach to history.", "tags": ["China", "Film", "Censorship", "World news", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-16T15:09:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jun/18/simon-hoggart-week-olympics-glyndebourne-ascot", "sentences": ["Main roads in the capital are to be closed off and guarded by the police so these people can glide in their limousines, without the inconvenience of traffic, to events where they have guaranteed tickets, as the rest of us struggle to find a way to work and while burglars know this is a perfect time to climb into our houses, if we aren&apos;t at home trying to watch something we have paid for, but only on TV, exactly like anyone in Sydney, Shanghai or Seattle, where nobody had to fork out."], "title": "Simon Hoggart's week: Olympic chiefs have built a Brigadoon for the rich", "article": "\u2712 Last week I mentioned how the Olympics, funded by you and me \u2013 especially me if you don&apos;t live in London \u2013 seem to be mounted largely for the toads of international sport administration, plus bankers and corporate businesses. Naturally it&apos;s worse than that. Main roads in the capital are to be closed off and guarded by the police so these people can glide in their limousines, without the inconvenience of traffic, to events where they have guaranteed tickets, as the rest of us struggle to find a way to work and while burglars know this is a perfect time to climb into our houses, if we aren&apos;t at home trying to watch something we have paid for, but only on TV, exactly like anyone in Sydney, Shanghai or Seattle, where nobody had to fork out. And it turns out that many of the constructions in the Olympic site are to be torn down as soon as all two weeks of the games are over. So in other words, the whole thing is little more than a Brigadoon for rich people. \u2712 I did pay for our tickets at Glyndebourne last week. We glided along roads that were deserted, not because the police had closed them off but because it was pelting with rain and nobody was going to Brighton for the day. Inside they were performing Donizetti&apos;s L&apos;Elisir d&apos;Amore (The Love Potion) set in a sun-sodden Italian village. Outside the rain sluiced down and the wind screamed through the trees. However, the opera was a joy. What made it specially piquant was that the lead tenor, Stephen Costello, had a throat infection and was replaced by an understudy making his Glyndebourne debut. So Michael Wade Lee had just 24 hours&apos; notice that he would have to sing, among other things, Una Furtiva Lagrima (A Hidden Tear) which is probably Donizetti&apos;s most popular aria and will be familiar to you from many film soundtracks, and for all I know, commercials for carpet cleaning products too. At the end he got a stamping ovation from the very fussy audience. As we tidied up our picnic he came dashing out of a side door and stopped for a chat. It turned out that he comes from San Antonio, Texas, home of the Alamo, and is known to his friends as Mike Lee. &quot;They made me use my full name, because otherwise people might have thought I was Korean,&quot; which in America means owner of grocery store. I wished him well and pointed out that if it all went sour, he could always stack shelves in Tesco. \u2712 I love Royal Ascot, not because I have ever been, but because Waterloo station \u2013 which I visit most days \u2013 is covered every day with the astounding outfits of the racegoers. I don&apos;t mean the over-the-top hats, which are sort of amusing, but what some people regard as apt and attractive attire. There seems to be a rule that the chunkier the thighs, the shorter the skirt. Heels must be so high that it&apos;s almost impossible to climb on to the train. Fascinators, many of which make Princess Beatrice&apos;s royal wedding titfer look tasteful, sometimes seem almost as big as the people under them. And it is weird to get off a boring old commuter train to be faced on the platform with a vast embonpoint, half swathed in shiny scarlet shantung silk, half exposed, like being attacked by a giant blancmange with strawberries. The men seem to have decided to follow, wearing anything that doesn&apos;t look like classic morning dress. So you see green ties with mustard waistcoats and even, on one grisly occasion, brown spats. I scurry off to the House of Commons, where everyone looks scruffy apart from Nicholas Soames. \u2712 You may have seen on the internet the wonderful Australian interview with the Dalai Lama. The breakfast time host, one Karl Stefanovic, decides to put him at his ease by telling \u2013 a Dalai Lama joke! &quot;The Dalai Lama goes into a pizza shop, and asks, &apos;Can you make me one with everything?&apos;\u2009&quot; (Easier to get if you think of it as &quot;make me One with Everything&quot;.) It&apos;s a very short clip, but you learn a lot from it. First, the arrogance of the TV presenter, who seems to think that it&apos;s the religious leader who needs to be put at his ease in the presence of such a glorious luminary as Mr Stefanovic. Interviewing the Irish prime minister, would he kick off with an Irish joke? But the most touching thing is the way that the DL, who I have only encountered once and seemed charming, clearly doesn&apos;t get the joke at all, or even know what a pizza is, but out of sheer politeness goes along with it, and in the end is laughing just as much as his ridiculous interviewer. Instead of giving him a big old slap, as anyone but a devout Buddhist would be tempted to do. \u2712Last week I mentioned a story in which the Duke of Edinburgh made rude remarks about trade unionists. So it&apos;s only fair that I tell a tale sent to me by David Buckle, who was the senior full-time official of the TGWU at the car plant in Cowley. Later Mr Buckle worked for the Industrial Society, which was visited by the duke, who asked him: &quot;Are you the person who is always calling the workers out on strike?&quot; Well, HRH got an ear-bashing. Was he aware of what it was like to work in dangerous and filthy conditions, for a company with a lousy management record? And much more. &quot;He replied: &apos;Thank you, I am much better informed than I was when I made my comments.&apos; I felt like saying &apos;Yes, you are.&apos; Instead I just nodded and walked away.&quot;", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Royal Ascot", "Horse racing", "Sport", "International Olympic Committee", "Glyndebourne", "Classical music", "Dalai Lama", "World news", "Prince Philip", "UK news", "Trade unions", "Politics", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-17T23:06:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/19/el-bulli-ferran-adria", "sentences": ["We won&apos;t see his like again in our lifetime.&quot; The 50 best: OFM&apos;s meal at El Bulli, course by course  beetroot and yoghurt meringuetomato cookieair baguettemojito - caipirinha sugar canemojito and apple baguettegin fizzspherical olivesmimetic peanutspistachio ravioliparmesan cheese &quot;porra&quot; parmesan cheese &quot;macaron&quot;gorgonzola balloonolive oil chipflowers papergolden eggsteamed shrimps with tearoses with ham wonton and melon waterham and ginger canapeJapanese raviolisoy matchesnori ravioli with lemonasparagus with misotiramisuoysters and bone marrow tartarparmesan frozen air with mueslicarbonara tagliatelle caviar cream with hazelnut caviarpine nuts shabu shabu&quot;perrechico&quot; cakepolenta gnocchi with coffee, safran, skin milk and caperstender almonds perfumed with trufflebarnacle with caviartwo cooking prawnslulo &quot;ceviche&quot; and molluskclam &quot;ceviche&quot;Oaxaca &quot;taco&quot;&quot;gazpacho&quot; and &quot;ajo blanco&quot;peas 2011sea cucumberShanghai lobsterhare frittergame meat cappuccinoblackberry risotto with game meat saucehare ravioli with bolognese and bloodpondyoghurt blini&quot;coca de vidre&quot; \u2013 crystal cakemini donutsapple rosebox THE WINES Dom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que 1973Dom P\u00e9rignon Vintage 2002Dom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que 1996Dom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que 1969Dom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que 1976vDom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que Ros\u00e9 1990 The timeline: 1961-2011 1961 El Bulli opens as mini-golf attraction in Roses, Catalonia, Spain."], "title": "El Bulli: the ultimate dining experience", "article": "I am still not sure why El Bulli made me cry. Or at least how it magicked a hot tear to my eye. It wasn&apos;t the intensity of taste, with shifting textures and notes that lasted longer than Pavarotti&apos;s C. It wasn&apos;t that I felt I had to close my eyes in a crowded room to savour and surf every wave of flavour. It wasn&apos;t even that &quot;peas 2011&quot; tasted more like my first peas than in any dish I&apos;ve eaten since I was seven. Nor was it, honestly, the toasty flow of Dom P\u00e9rignon 1973. It was simply, in the end, I think, the deliciousness that undid me. Not all the dishes were sublime, of course \u2013 I am not sure chef Ferran Adri\u00e0 is interested in that. He wants to make you think and to feel food, to orchestrate your mood, mess with your idea of what it could and should be. More flavour theatre than restaurant. We ate a Felliniesque, insane 50 dishes culled from Adri\u00e0&apos;s &quot;greatest hits&quot;, the oldest from more than 20 years before, the newest only finalised that morning (the menu was revised six times). Plus endless choices from a giant chocolate box that looked like a flashing organ coming out of the floor. But if we pass over the Japanese-style tiramisu (a sleight of hand with miso that was plain unpleasant), the disappointing trademark carbonara tagliatelle, and the &quot;challenging&quot; frozen gorgonzola balloon, El Bulli&apos;s 50 cooks still sent out close to 50 plates of food for 50 people that no other restaurant may ever match. As Ferran Adri\u00e0&apos;s heir apparent and current number one cook in the world, Ren\u00e9 Redzepi of Copenhagen&apos;s Noma, tells me: &quot;Ferran and his team are culinary freedom fighters. They helped free me.&quot; Our superluxe Spanish food trip started, surreally, in Luton, in an anonymous single-storey airport building where celebrities and top business people avoid civilians and waiting for flights. We had just missed Ozzy Osbourne shuffling though the lounge, and then Simon le Bon suddenly couldn&apos;t come. But 30 minutes before takeoff on our private jet \u2013 like a top-end Lexus limo with wings \u2013 actress Rosamund Pike has heroically stepped in for the year&apos;s hot meal ticket: an El Bulli supper, pitch perfect for a selection of rare champagne, devised by Adri\u00e0 with Richard Geoffroy, Dom P\u00e9rignon&apos;s effervescent chef de cave. Later that day, over dinner in a private Catalan castle, I am sitting opposite Hollywood&apos;s Heather Graham and Jason Silva, her film-producer boyfriend, who have also flown in for the feast, watching as the star of Boogie Nights and The Hangover delicately transfers her food from her plate to her partner&apos;s. While the rest of us gorge on octopus, Iberico ham and vintage fizz, she is saved from starvation by a strawberry kebab. But the star everyone is here to see is Ferran Adri\u00e0, the &quot;best cook on the planet&quot;, according to Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, and he should know, with his world-record 26 Michelin stars. &quot;I never said I wouldn&apos;t feed people,&quot; Adri\u00e0 smiles when I ask what he will miss when he closes his door at the end of this, his last season. &quot;After July, El Bulli won&apos;t be a restaurant, not open every day. But I\u00a0will still need feedback.&quot; Adri\u00e0&apos;s plan is for a nonprofit centre for &quot;culinary creativity&quot; opening in 2014, with a stream of new recipes posted on the internet. &quot;We are excited,&quot; he says through an interpreter (Adri\u00e0 doesn&apos;t trust his English to be precise enough for our purposes). &quot;Bulli has always been about change. Why does Madonna with all her money need to earn more? She could share, not her money but her creativity. The young share, and we at the top should, too. &quot;When we started there were eight of us, all bachelors; now we have families, kids. I don&apos;t have children but I am very happily married, with a wonderful wife. With the foundation I can give something back \u2013 my talent, my luck. I have created 1,846 dishes \u2013 80 per cent of new cookery techniques come from here \u2013 but no one can be number one for ever. Even those that love us get tired&quot; \u2013 though this may be news to the two million people who desperately tried to book when the news of El Bulli&apos;s closure was announced. &quot;I will be 50 soon, with maybe 25-30 years left,&quot; he laughs. &quot;I want to be happy like I have always been, and I can do this \u00a0by taking away the things I don&apos;t like. Do what I want, when I want, for who I\u00a0want.&quot; I head into the El Bulli kitchen in time to catch the team troop in at 1pm, seven hours before service: heads bowed, hushed, intent. More like medieval novices come to mass than chefs about to prepare perhaps the greatest avant-garde meal ever seen. Mateu Casa\u00f1as, who has been with Adri\u00e0 for 12 years, talks me through the preparation. Quietly, the chefs split into smaller teams. Ten start by teasing the germ from pine kernels, another six grade peas and skin them; 12 extract translucent filaments from sea cucumber to be intricately, delicately, lined into squares; four more sort papery yellow roses for perfect petals to be stuffed and steamed like dim sum. Seamlessly and almost silently, they shift between jobs, splitting young almonds to extract a jelly, making &quot;parmesan frozen air&quot;. I talk to Francesca, a Canadian of Asian heritage. On the day the call came from El Bulli she had been offered a staff position at Thomas Keller&apos;s three-star Per Se in New York. &quot;So did I take a paid job in New York,&quot; she smiles, &quot;or another &apos;stage&apos; in Spain where I didn&apos;t speak the language?&quot; And yet here she is in her second unpaid season, frothing and freezing buckets of cheese foam with a large grin on her face. Jason Atherton also worked a stage at El Bulli, in 1998 when he was 27 \u2013 the year Adri\u00e0 created his first foam. Before my trip to El Bulli we talk in the bar at Pollen Street Social, the British chef&apos;s celebrated new place in Mayfair. &quot;I had worked with great chefs before,&quot; he says, &quot;Marco Pierre White, Nico Ladenis, Pierre Koffmann, but it was from Ferran I learnt to question everything.&quot; It took a full three years, says Atherton, before he realised how much his time at El Bulli had changed him: &quot;There were 40 of us at the start of the season and at the end there were only 20 left. It takes a lot out of you, but the principles of how to run a great restaurant stay: the system, the time clock, the attention to detail. If I hadn&apos;t learn that, I wouldn&apos;t be here today. &quot;The sangria foam I serve at Pollen Street is the exact recipe I learnt, 12 years on. It is the lightest, airiest sangria you will ever taste. Why would I need to mess around with that? Chefs aren&apos;t geniuses, we are cooks,&quot; he says, &quot;but Ferran deserves the mantle. A place like El Bulli will never happen again. It is impossible. One man&apos;s vision of what you could do with food.&quot; Back in Spain, Adri\u00e0&apos;s relentless assault on my taste buds has driven me from the table overwhelmed, succumbed, surrendered, my hands and legs shaking, and we are &quot;only&quot; around 30 courses in. I have licked my plate of &quot;gazpacho&quot; and &quot;ajo blanco&quot;, oblivious to my more reserved, more refined companions. I have tasted five of Geoffroy&apos;s dazzling Dom P\u00e9rignons, but I need respite before the two hare dishes, the &quot;game meat cappuccino&quot;, the &quot;blood&quot;, the &quot;pond&quot;, the donuts, the other desserts and the &quot;box&quot;. I wander into the kitchen, where Observer photographer Howard Sooley is seven hours into his shoot \u2013 the first time Adri\u00e0 has let anyone photograph behind the scenes during service. Sooley used to work for US Vogue, and I watch as he slides between the chefs as they change direction like a shoal of silvery fish. And it strikes me: this is almost cooking as couture, backstage behind the catwalk as fantastical creations are pinned and primped into shape. I take in the dozens of tiny saucepans, the syringe-spiked dishes, a group of six young chefs intently plating up. All the cooks appear choreographed like a beautiful, complicated machine. Nothing is taken for granted, nothing is unconsidered. There is true art in the artifice here, an underlying integrity to every technique. But somehow my celebrity-spiked supper has conjured up memories and emotions as much as the expected exquisite tastes. The plate-licked gazpacho is saturated with Spanish holidays. The peas take me back to podding on the porch with my mother in her yellow summer dress. The smell of the hare stock I will carry with me for ever. At the perimeter of the kitchen, Ferran Adri\u00e0 paces in silence, quietly observing. The general, seemingly unemotional, almost uninvolved. But watching. His eye seeing everything, like an eagle hanging high in the sky to catch the movement of every blade of grass. He turns, sees me, too, standing there with lost eyes, and comes over. &quot;Magic,&quot; he smiles softly, and he is right. As\u00a0Jason Atherton says: &quot;The guy is a legend, simple as that. We won&apos;t see his like again in our lifetime.&quot; The 50 best: OFM&apos;s meal at El Bulli, course by course  beetroot and yoghurt meringuetomato cookieair baguettemojito - caipirinha sugar canemojito and apple baguettegin fizzspherical olivesmimetic peanutspistachio ravioliparmesan cheese &quot;porra&quot; parmesan cheese &quot;macaron&quot;gorgonzola balloonolive oil chipflowers papergolden eggsteamed shrimps with tearoses with ham wonton and melon waterham and ginger canapeJapanese raviolisoy matchesnori ravioli with lemonasparagus with misotiramisuoysters and bone marrow tartarparmesan frozen air with mueslicarbonara tagliatelle caviar cream with hazelnut caviarpine nuts shabu shabu&quot;perrechico&quot; cakepolenta gnocchi with coffee, safran, skin milk and caperstender almonds perfumed with trufflebarnacle with caviartwo cooking prawnslulo &quot;ceviche&quot; and molluskclam &quot;ceviche&quot;Oaxaca &quot;taco&quot;&quot;gazpacho&quot; and &quot;ajo blanco&quot;peas 2011sea cucumberShanghai lobsterhare frittergame meat cappuccinoblackberry risotto with game meat saucehare ravioli with bolognese and bloodpondyoghurt blini&quot;coca de vidre&quot; \u2013 crystal cakemini donutsapple rosebox THE WINES Dom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que 1973Dom P\u00e9rignon Vintage 2002Dom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que 1996Dom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que 1969Dom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que 1976vDom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que Ros\u00e9 1990 The timeline: 1961-2011 1961 El Bulli opens as mini-golf attraction in Roses, Catalonia, Spain.

Li&apos;s victory at the French Open \u2013 where she became the first Chinese player to win a grand slam singles title \u2013 has made her a heroine to compatriots. &quot;I was hugely inspired \u2026 Li Na is my model and there is so much to learn from her,&quot; said Song, of the Jiujiang Tennis Club, who won Jiangxi province&apos;s junior doubles title last year. &quot;Before, my friends did not really know about tennis, but now they do and many want to learn to play.&quot; The sport is counting on the 29-year-old Li to accelerate its development in China, where a growing middle-class is learning to love watching and playing tennis. &quot;Sometimes this kind of experience will influence a whole generation,&quot; said David Yang of China&apos;s Sports Illustrated, noting the surge of excitement and patriotic pride. The state broadcaster, CCTV, said 116m Chinese viewers watched the final of the French Open, almost doubling the previous high, for the Australian Open final when Li Na lost to Belgium&apos;s Kim Clijsters. Li was even plastered across the front of the staid official Communist newspaper, People&apos;s Daily, a privilege almost always reserved for the most senior leaders. Terry Rhoads, of the Shanghai-based sports consultants Zou Marketing, who first met Li when she was in her teens, believes her win has captured the interest of people who normally have no interest in sport. &quot;Chinese fans absolutely adore world champions. You can be a national champion and people won&apos;t pay that much attention but, if you can be the best in the world, it breaks right through,&quot; he said. Tom McCarthy, whose Beijing International Group promotes grass-roots and elite tennis, points out that her success follows other important landmarks such as China&apos;s first Olympic tennis gold medal in 2004 and its first grand slam title in 2006, when Zheng Jie and Yan Zi took the women&apos;s doubles at the Australian Open. They are among the reasons that the number of what he calls &quot;real&quot; players \u2013 who pick up their rackets more than once a week \u2013 has risen from one million in 2005 to 8m today. The Women&apos;s Tennis Association notes that there are 90,000 courts, with the number increasing by 15% a year. But good equipment and coaching are still expensive \u2013 and beyond the reach of most Chinese families \u2013 and Maggie Rauch, editor of the China Sports Today, suggests cultural factors hold back sport in general. &quot;[Given] the focus on culture and testing and the hours you have to put in with tennis, you have to have unusual parents who see the value of that,&quot; she said. Li&apos;s impact on other sports may be just as important because her victory in Paris has implications for the top-down, strictly controlled system China has built to create elite athletes. It follows the China Tennis Association&apos;s decision to &quot;free&quot; her and three other players \u2013 Zheng, Yan and Peng Shuai \u2013 in 2008. The &quot;fly alone&quot; policy allows them to set their own schedules, choose their own coaches and keep 65% of their earnings rather than 12%. &quot;We took a lot of risks with this reform. That they have now succeeded means our reform was correct,&quot; said Sun Jinfang, of the association, following the French Open. &quot;This will serve as a good example for reforms in other sports.&quot; Rauch said changes are unlikely before next summer&apos;s London Olympics but thinks the pressure for a shift is real. &quot;If they keep on doing what they are doing, I would expect them to continue to be at the top of the medals [table] at the Olympics but I think they want more. The government wants sports to be part of their soft power platform. To do that they have to do more than haul in a bunch of gold medals every four years,&quot; she said. Not everyone is convinced. &quot;Li Na&apos;s win will not change the situation of officials controlling sports at all,&quot; said Yang, who sees tennis as an anomaly. McCarthy also warned that athletes should be careful what they wish for. While most players hand over large chunks of their winnings, they receive regular funding and support, without which, many would struggle to survive. But if China wants to use sport to boost its soft power, Li&apos;s win is a good place to start. That she is not in the mould of most of its athletes \u2013 her thank-yous in Paris did not include her country \u2013 works in her favour overseas. &quot;She is right up there with [basketball&apos;s] Yao Ming in her ability to help people look at China in a different light,&quot; said Rhoads. Her tattoo and her fluent English help, as does her confidence. &quot;If I were a man, I would be as famous as Yao Ming,&quot; she told one interviewer. So, too, do her willingness to crack jokes about her husband&apos;s snoring and her victory at 29 after an unorthodox career. &quot;She worked so hard, had her ups and downs; it hasn&apos;t been a linear path,&quot; said Rhoads. &quot;She&apos;s had a lot of injuries. She quit the game for 18 months because she was burned out. She has really climbed a mountain and I think that&apos;s inspirational.&quot; Additional research by Han Cheng \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2011 to correct the spelling of David Yang&apos;s name.", "tags": ["Wimbledon 2011", "Wimbledon", "Tennis", "China", "Sport", "Asia Pacific", "Li Na"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-18T23:08:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/19/china-floods-food-price-rises", "sentences": ["The rains are expected to continue for two days, stretching from the financial hub of Shanghai in the east to rural Yunnan in the far south-west."], "title": "China floods bring steep food price rises", "article": "Food prices are expected to rise steeply in China after flooding inundated more than 1 million acres of farmland in eastern provinces, killing at least 100 people and displacing hundreds of thousands more.

Ministers were planning to sell down more of their 85% stake in the oil group on the Moscow and London stock markets in 2013 if the BP deal had gone through. Now they are looking at bringing this forward to next year and have said that they would be happy if BP bought shares in the company as part of a move that could see the government control falling below 50%. The plans were revealed in an exclusive interview given to the Guardian by Arkady Dvorkovich, chief economic policy adviser to Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president. &quot;We want Rosneft to be a normal commercial public company,&quot; he said. &quot;The original government proposals were to start [the share sale] in 2013 but maybe now it will be brought forward to 2012. &quot;It&apos;s not up to me to say what the best timing would be. That is up to the company itself and investment banks working on this.&quot; Dvorkovich denied suggestions that the failure of BP to win the backing of its Russian shareholders inside TNK-BP for the Rosneft deal had frustrated the Kremlin. The collapse of the equity and Arctic drilling agreement was regrettable but not something that should be expected to blight the British company&apos;s future in Russia, he explained. &quot;It was not about politics but a business deal and it did not happen. But BP is one of the biggest Russian partners in the energy sector and we expect it to continue to play a major role in Russia and elsewhere.&quot; Dvorkovich was building on comments made on Friday by Medvedev when he opened the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. The president explained that the domination of state-owned companies had led to low entrepreneurial and low investment activity. &quot;Such an economic model poses a danger for the country&apos;s future. This is not my choice,&quot; Medvedev said in a speech interpreted by some as using fast-track economic development as an electioneering message for another term of office. Under previous plans, the government has talked about raising $10bn (\u00a36.2bn) annually from such sales over five years. But Dvorkovich said that figure might now be raised by 50% to $15bn, meaning the Kremlin could be looking at a target of up to $75bn over five years. He indicated that the money-raising might happen in London but alternatively could be done in New York, Hong Kong or even Shanghai \u2013 or a combination of these. He said initial or further privatisation was on the cards for the grid operator FGC, former pride of the Soviet industrialisation programme, which quietly listed some existing shares in London three months ago. There are similar possible plans for the shipping group Sovcomflot, banks such as VTB and possibly some airports. But there are no plans currently for privatising in a similar way the giant gas group Gazprom. Dvorkovich cited the complexity of the domestic energy market, where the company is a monopoly provider. He said Russia recognised that its companies needed to attract new technology, stronger management skills and more vibrant research and development. Rosneft would continue to talk to companies such as Shell about Arctic drilling deals but few expect the kind of share swap that had been proposed with BP. Dvorkovich said he believed Russia had made progress convincing the European Union that his country did not want to use energy as a political weapon. Turning off gas supplies to Ukraine in previous winters amid price rows never was about politics, said the government official. But he agreed that the Russian government was aware that some had interpreted it in that way, and this had damaged Russia and Gazprom. Dvorkovich also accepted that there was ongoing tension with Europe over Russia&apos;s refusal to open its markets up to foreign competition. This was a difficult issue but he said: &quot;We are trying to find a solution to this.&quot; Medvedev is also keen to build Moscow and regional cities as financial centres but accepts that corruption must be tackled and corporate governance standards improved to achieve this.", "tags": ["Oil and gas companies", "Oil", "Commodities", "BP", "Energy industry", "Business", "Russia", "Europe", "World news", "South and Central Asia"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-19T16:33:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/20/david-dobkin-king-arthur-film", "sentences": ["David Dobkin, the director of Wedding Crashers and Shanghai Knights, has signed a deal with Warner Bros to direct and produce a re-imagined King Arthur film, based on his own script, with the help of Sherlock Holmes producer Lionel Wigram."], "title": "Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin set for new King Arthur film", "article": "David Dobkin, the director of Wedding Crashers and Shanghai Knights, has signed a deal with Warner Bros to direct and produce a re-imagined King Arthur film, based on his own script, with the help of Sherlock Holmes producer Lionel Wigram.

Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, and Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, have just confirmed that preliminary contacts are under way. Equally important, the UN security council&apos;s sanctions list has been divided so as to separate Taliban leaders from those of al-Qaida, making it easier politically to remove restraints on the freedom of Taliban leaders to travel safely to meet negotiators. There is a long way to go before full-scale talks begin, not least in creating a consensus in Washington behind their necessity. In a television interview on Sunday, Gates declared: &quot;We have said all along that a political outcome is the way most wars end. The question is when and if they [the Taliban] are ready to talk seriously.&quot; His other comments made it clear the same question applies to the Americans. Gates argued that further US military pressure was needed on the Taliban. &quot;Talks yes, but not yet&quot; has long been the Pentagon position, articulated repeatedly by General David Petraeus, the US commander in Afghanistan, who will have even more access to President Obama in his next post as CIA chief. Heated debate is going on in Washington over how many troops Obama will announce he is to start bringing out next month, and how soon the departing contingent will leave. Whatever number is chosen will be a fudge, designed to satisfy the majority of Americans who have lost faith in the Afghan war, as well as the military hawks. The Republicans are in an encouraging state of confusion with the first signs emerging that on Afghanistan, next year&apos;s presidential candidate might attack Obama &quot;from the left&quot; by arguing for a faster US pullout. But Obama&apos;s announcement on a limited withdrawal will mean little unless accompanied by a clear statement that he intends to negotiate an end to the conflict, just as Lyndon Johnson eventually promised during the Vietnam war, though it took the Republican Richard Nixon to carry the talks through. American decision-makers have still not grasped that the Taliban&apos;s main motivation \u2013 as revealed in several surveys of insurgents \u2013 is a desire to end foreign occupation of their country. US officials, political as well as military, produce endless briefings that claim people join the Taliban because of money, unemployment, or local disputes over land and family honour. When Karzai himself warned the Americans this weekend that &quot;history shows what Afghans do with trespassers and occupiers&quot; and made the blindingly obvious point that the Americans are in Afghanistan primarily for their own purposes, US commentators referred to him as &quot;ranting&quot;, &quot;erratic&quot;, and &quot;perhaps struggling with a mental illness&quot;. Karl Eikenberry, the US ambassador in Kabul, said he felt hurt by Karzai&apos;s statements because &quot;America has never sought to occupy any nation in the world. We are a good people.&quot; Karzai is in a difficult position. Like the Taliban, he wants to end his country&apos;s occupation though he is not sure how to do it, given the countervailing pressures from the insurgency and the Americans, as well as from the anti-negotiation Tajik warlords who surround him and his Pashtun cronies, who have done well economically from the money the Americans have thrown at the country. The main thing he must do now is postpone the talks on long-term US bases that the US is trying to push through under the guise of a &quot;strategic partnership agreement&quot;. Support for a long-term US military presence in Afghanistan flies in the face of serious negotiations to end the war. It will also undermine the prospects for any regional agreement between Afghanistan and its neighbours. Russia, China and the four central Asian states who make up the influential Shanghai Co-operation Organisation came out at a summit meeting last week for a &quot;neutral&quot; Afghanistan. That is also the position of India and Iran. No peace deal in Afghanistan will stick unless the era of outside interference by its neighbours comes to an end, so the concept of &quot;neutrality&quot; must be upheld. Having US forces in Afghanistan &quot;to protect Afghan neutrality&quot; is dangerous nonsense. Besides ending foreign occupation, the biggest challenge is to end Afghanistan&apos;s 35 years of civil war. Only talks among all the Afghan stakeholders and parties, including the Taliban, can do that. The Americans cannot control the outcome but they should not impede it either. That is why Obama&apos;s declaration of support for a ceasefire and negotiations on a full withdrawal of US and other foreign troops would be his best contribution to getting the comprehensive settlement that Afghans desperately want.", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "Taliban", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US foreign policy", "South and Central Asia"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-20T21:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jun/23/best-of-chatterbox", "sentences": ["What broke me was pure Bladestone, the thought of some poor schmuck, brought into this country in the bilge of a Shanghai merchant vessel, swam ashore from The Rock in the bay, his buddies - shark bait, or torn apart on the spikes down at Old King Allant point, just to smuggle this precious drug to these virgin shores."], "title": "Best of Chatterbox: LA Unconfidential", "article": "The journalist hunched over his battered Remington typewriter.

But any danger had long since passed and the only person in the alley was Keith, slumped against the brick wall, blood everywhere. &quot;Damn it! Too late&quot; Sam said as they rant over to help the young lad.  Fading in and out of consciousness Keith was talking gibberish.  &quot;\u2026Political punch ups\u2026.nhhh\u2026.Tim&apos;s abusive dad\u2026.&quot; Adenhart grabbed the boy and tried to shake some sense into him.  &quot;Who did this to you Keith?&quot;  No reply.

Adenhart let go of the youngster&apos;s lapel and he slumped back against the wall. &quot;He&apos;s gone\u2026&quot;  But Keith&apos;s lips moved, whispering the two words the PI didn&apos;t want to hear; the name of the man who flashed that evil smile from the speeding car earlier.  &quot;Charles\u2026. Arthur&quot; Witness statement of the day &quot;The gravitas of a wood unit&quot; Lazybones. Subject unknown. 01/06/11 The week was strange and getting stranger. There was no Monday, Tuesday was the same as last Friday and then from nothing I awoke to a fresh box. It seemed too clean, too perfect. I was already into this too deep with no signs of getting out, my instincts be damned, I had to find out what was going on. My first call was to investigate some complaints regarding the Olympic ticketing system. Killerbee was happy to go on the record:&quot;Could a more shambolic system of allocating tickets for a major sporting event have been devised if they&apos;d tried?&quot; I&apos;m not sure who he was complaining at; there wasn&apos;t much ire to raise amongst the rest of the community. A resigned sense of expectancy. Local (alleged) mob boss HereComesTreble put the matter to rest:  &quot;Pret a Manger is the official sandwich provider of the London Olympics, which says it all really.&quot;  The corporate talk was giving me a thirst. I swung by a local haunt for some afternoon refreshment. There was a guy in there, he hadn&apos;t been around much lately. Lazybones I think they call him. In the haze of the bar he announced:   &quot;Bought myself a frying pan last week. I don&apos;t know if I mentioned this. Do you think I have become more boring?&quot;  I declined to answer. Soon others joined in though. Frying pan discussion. Sizes, cooking techniques and Jamie Oliver. I just wanted some peace and quiet. SuperSmashin got involved:   &quot;You all need to aspire to live a one pan life. It&apos;s the Lazybones method and I endorse it.&quot;  Conversation turned to woks. I reconsidered my choices; that unfinished paperwork was suddenly looking more appealing. Then this broad appeared, peering through the darkened entrance. It was Herself. There was a murmuring at the bar. She&apos;s got some nerve, I thought. Caused a ruckus in here end of last year. But she wasn&apos;t here for trouble. When she left, eyes turned to Tim in the corner, he glanced up, unperturbed:   &quot; You know that novelty pizza cutter you wanted? It&apos;s mine now. And you can forget about visiting the cat.&quot;  Case closed. Late on, the bar&apos;s recent US acquisition, OpinionatedMike, stumbled in with a bone to picks with yours truly. &quot;I&apos;ve been depicted inaccurately in BestOf&quot; he drawled. &quot;Now I know what celebrities complain about when the media takes excerpts out of context!&quot;  I paid him little attention. He hobbled to a seat nearly falling in his high heels and quietened down.  As the day surrendered itself to the embrace of night, I left the bar, approaching my car with much on my mind. I instructed my partner to drive me home; as he did, he backed into four passing cars, ran over an elderly lady and destroyed two lampposts. A quiet drive home. The case notes started to organise themselves in my mind, but I was a long way from solving this.  Later, I had an uneasy feeling as I slumped back on my couch, glass of whisky in hand; the sirens of the night serenaded me into a troubled night&apos;s sleep.  A feeling that the worst is yet to come. Witness Statement of the day: &quot;@Flat bottomed woks: Make the woking world go round.&quot; EnglishRed. 02/06/11 The old man kept us waiting in the steam-filled sauna he passed off as a gardenia potting shed. I wasn&apos;t going to let him get to me, and no matter how much he turned up the heat, how much he filled the room with sweltering mooks, I wasn&apos;t going to break. Even when the paper snap on collar I wore over this two-bit thrift store suit melted into my shirt, and my eyes filled with sweat, blinding me to what was going on, I still wouldn&apos;t break. Even with the temptation of three free downloads from the fully restored PSN store, I wasn&apos;t going to break. What broke me was pure Bladestone, the thought of some poor schmuck, brought into this country in the bilge of a Shanghai merchant vessel, swam ashore from The Rock in the bay, his buddies - shark bait, or torn apart on the spikes down at Old King Allant point, just to smuggle this precious drug to these virgin shores. This is what broke me. Some gook threw me to the floor, the mickey-finn turning the already upside down world of not Thursday into some horror show re-run of the day before. He knotted my Macy&apos;s tie around my bicep, slapped my wrist for a vein to pump the pure Bladestone into, and ran me through with his needle. Having lost all concept of time, I couldn&apos;t tell you how long it was before I was seeing skeletons and dragons, leathery wasted men swinging at me with flaming swords, and angels and knights Templar on battlement walls. And then the acrid smell of swamp gas. I was falling through a fog gate, a gate of fog, golden, golden gate in the fog. This is San Francisco, this is NaN Thursday, this is just a precursor of a Dark Soul. And then I remember nothing. Until... 03/06/11 A tall blonde walked past my office window. I could tell she was tall as I worked on the second floor. I could tell she was blonde, because she moulted all over the swivel chair across from my desk. But these are the things you need to do when a private dick needs a secretary that will work long hours for short pay. Speaking of those who are working for short pay and paying a little too much attention to the dame in the chair, today was full of useful tips for interviewing skills. Seems that seven hours twelve minutes a day of internet time is not seen as productive time well spent by many of this country&apos;s captains of industry. Turned out I wasn&apos;t the only detective for hire looking to fill a blonde shaped hole in my office; Sorbicol had been interviewing some hopeful nineteen-year-olds, obviously to help him out with the extraordinary time he spent on the internet. The louse was keen to pass on the list of psychological profiling questions he had prepared. Not that he prepared them himself, he had some poor child from the HR department prepare them, plausible deniability, children, pay attention, this was the first lesson. It seemed Sorb was not the only one seeking new flesh. While the government was trying to tell us we were in a recession, BlueAndWhiteBoy seemed to think it would be okay to make his four candidates fight to the death for the three posts. I fought in a war so men like this could run this country. I should be so proud of these two. I was afraid for the rest of us proles, sitting on the other side of the interviewing desk was our lot.  Having debated the benefits of telling the truth in exit interviews, and the pros and cons of using Linkedin and Facebook to find dirt on your interview panel, the dame across from me opened her heart to us. She was attempting to answer that perennial interview question: &quot;What is you greatest weakness?&quot; This should have been obvious for a band of social misfits who spent all day every day talking about games, that they then spent all night every night playing. And I&apos;m not talking about healthy games, I&apos;m talking about Blood Bowl and World of Tanks, here. Backstreet dive games, for desperate men.

With both GCSEs and A-levels in progress, it&apos;s been about revision, more revision, then pre-exam nerves, followed by post-exam analysis. It wasn&apos;t helped by the education secretary&apos;s full-throttle attack on the very exams my daughters have been sitting as &quot;not tough enough&quot;. Well, they felt pretty tough; and in this household the Michael Gove gets an E for the timing of his comments. He should be in no doubt that undermining the exam system which has just dominated six weeks of teenagers&apos; lives is extremely demoralising. But, timing aside, was he right? There seems to be little doubt that Britain is falling down international league tables of maths, science and language abilities. And it&apos;s true that many of today&apos;s school-leavers are competing for jobs not with their friends, or even with German and French rivals, but with hungrier, more urgent students from China, India and elsewhere. This can be exaggerated, of course: many jobs, in the service sector, small-scale manufacturing and the professions, will stay stubbornly local. But the spread of genuine multinationals and of outsourcing, never mind inward migration, means the competition is fiercer. The Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests nearly half a million 15-year-olds to try to produce comparative results. Last year the UK fell from 17th position in reading in 2007, to 25th; from 24th to 28th in maths and 14th to 16th in science. On these rankings \u2013 and there are always quibbles \u2013 England&apos;s educational system was ranked below those of Estonia and Poland. That&apos;s after the big investment in schools during the Labour years, and was described by John Bangs of the Institute of Education as &quot;depressing.&quot; It isn&apos;t just a British problem: the brilliant performance of teenagers from Shanghai horrified the Americans. And there are endless different ideas about what&apos;s wrong in a British system, so stretched between top-performing elite private schools and some of the worst-performing state schools in Europe. But the structural questions are for another day: under a Conservative-led coalition we are not going to see middle-class parents being squeezed out of private education. Academies are spreading, and there are a tiny number of free schools, but there&apos;s no sign of a structural revolution. It&apos;s interesting and important, but for now we might as well concentrate on what Gove&apos;s talking about \u2013 exams and teachers. I&apos;m highly sceptical about comparing the O-levels I sat with today&apos;s GCSEs. Going through revision sessions, my impression was that the science papers and maths were actually harder than they used to be, while the language papers were far easier. But that&apos;s all it was \u2013 an impression. Furthermore, what people need to know is changing. The changes in neuroscience, biology, physics and even the climate means the curriculum of the 2010s has to be different from that of the 1960s and 1970s. Only a few schools are dipping their toes into language teaching that offers Chinese and Russian, rather than French and German. Above all, the internet means it is far easier to track down information. This doesn&apos;t necessarily mean the dogged learning of facts is now redundant. (Developing the memory matters.) But it does mean that what children learn is bound to shift. Take history, for instance. If you happened to want to check the kings and queens of Plantagenet England, or the exact date when the battle of Mons began, then Googling is so quick nobody actually needs to carry these facts around in their heads. But if you don&apos;t understand the larger timeline of British history so that you have some idea of what Plantagenet England was, and you know why the war to end wars happened but not why it failed to do so, then you are adrift in a Google-world of random meaninglessness. Or take another example, chemistry. Is it necessary for an all-round teenage education to know the entire periodic table? I suspect not. But should every school-leaver understand why we depend on the chemistry of the Earth, and how matter is held together? Without going into quantum mechanics, some understanding is surely now part of our common human heritage. Jump, finally, to language teaching. This is an interesting example because you can&apos;t dodge round the hard requirement to learn vocabulary and grammar; and while other subjects evolve, the basic Germanness of German doesn&apos;t very much. Here is the clearest and most worrying example of the stubbornly monoglot English getting even worse. So when Gove says he wants more traditional exams, obliging children to learn facts rather than to hop around using &quot;modules&quot;, I&apos;m with him. But these facts have to be threaded through a modern understanding of the world, which helps teenagers understand life, rather than an exercise in nostalgia. The bigger problem is that teachers seem to be getting a mixed message from the coalition. On the one hand, they&apos;re lauded as professionals and told they should have more freedom from Whitehall rules \u2013 and the government pushes Teach First to encourage graduates to think about teaching as a career. On the other hand, their pensions are shrivelled, their working lives are extended, they aren&apos;t listened to by ministers, and their social status has been horribly diminished since I was at school. It takes something for so many teachers to vote for strike action. The anger and upset is absolutely real. We know there is no money. We know there has to be temporary pain. But if ministers don&apos;t keep good people teaching, all the fiddling with school constitutions and exam systems in the world will make no difference. And we will continue to languish in international tables. And the economic consequences will be dire \u2013 for everyone&apos;s pensions, for everyone&apos;s future. So I&apos;d like to see good new housing specifically for teachers and promises of a pension review upwards as soon as the economy improves. If there&apos;s money in the private sector for investment in academies, why can&apos;t private firms be encouraged to subsidise their best employees to go and teach for five or 10 years? Just now, with this week&apos;s strike looming, ministers are on a collision course with teachers. That is disastrous. They \u2013 not ministers, not journalists, not bankers, not lawyers \u2013 are the key to a better future.", "tags": ["Education", "Education policy", "Politics", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Michael Gove", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-26T17:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jun/26/cameron-meet-jiabao-business-summit", "sentences": ["During the summit, the UK and China are expected to sign an agreement that will boost British businesses&apos; ability to branch out beyond Beijing and Shanghai, into other fast growing regional cities in China."], "title": "David Cameron to meet China's Wen Jiabao for business summit", "article": "David Cameron and the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao will meet for an Anglo-Chinese summit at Downing Street designed to seal \u00a31bn worth of bilateral contracts, including a raft of deals aimed at greening the industrial revolution transforming the Chinese economy at an unprecedented rate. Premier Wen is in the UK for three days. He started his tour in the Midlands on Sunday. One of the centrepieces of the Downing Street summit will be a multi-million pound commercial underground coal gasification deal secured by Seamwell International, a British company specialising in new clean coal technology. The technology could release 280bn tonnes of coal in inner Mongolia, at a 20% reduction on the CO2 emissions of a traditional coal fired power station and 50% if carbon capture and storage technology is also utilised. The two leaders will meet against a backdrop of heavily policed protests at the state of human rights in China and Tibet. Downing Street has promised Cameron will raise issues such as Tibet firmly in private, but he is expected to tread gingerly, aware that he does not want to jeopardise UK business access to the fastest expanding export market in the world. During the summit, the UK and China are expected to sign an agreement that will boost British businesses&apos; ability to branch out beyond Beijing and Shanghai, into other fast growing regional cities in China. The GDP of these regional cities has more than doubled between in just three years. At the beginning of the year, UK imports to China were only 1% of Chinese exports to the UK. Number 10 has said that Britain is progressing well on its target of $100bn of bilateral trade by 2015, with British exports to China up by more than a fifth since David Cameron took a large business delegation to Beijing in November. In a bid to show the Anglo-Chinese relationship is not entirely commercial, Cameron will also point to the development of &quot;a longer term strategic cultural dialogue&quot; between the two countries. A dialogue on broad ranging cultural issues will be agreed with annual ministerial meetings held alternately in the UK and China. Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, will lead on the British side. Hunt said: &quot;What this visit is about is saying that it&apos;s not just about jobs, it&apos;s also about a broader cultural relationship that is the best possible way to make sure we understand each other and avoid the kind of misunderstanding that so can bedevil relationships, as has happened in the past.&quot; On the eve of his visit to Europe, Wen ordered the release of two prominent human rights activists. Prominent artist and activist Ai Weiwei was released three days ago. At the weekend another prominent dissident, Hu Jia was reunited with his family after serving three-and-a-half-years in jail on subversion charges. It is not clear if the releases are directly linked to the visit to Europe. In a statement urging the Chinese to go further on human rights, Number 10 said: &quot;Our support for freedom of expression, development of independent civil society and our conviction that the transparent and consistent application of human rights under the rule of law, are essential prerequisites for China&apos;s long term prosperity and stability.&quot; On the first day of his three day tour of the UK, Wen visited the Chinese co-owned MG plant in Birmingham, as well as William Shakespeare&apos;s birthplace in Stratford-on-Avon. Wen toured the MG motor car factory in Longbridge where the new MG6 is assembled. The premier said &quot;The model can be summed up as designed in the UK, manufactured in China and assembled in the UK, thereby making the most of China&apos;s capital and markets, as well as the UK&apos;s technology and managerial expertise.&quot; Stephen Green, Britain&apos;s minister for trade and investment, said the partnership was a &quot;pioneer for Chinese investors in the UK&quot;. At the weekend, Wen reassured the markets that China would not offload its substantial holdings of European assets but would remain a long-term investor in European sovereign debt. Beijing is thinking of investing in the high speed line from London to Birmingham. The Free Tibet director Stephanie Brigden urged Cameron to take a strong public position on human rights. She said: &quot;Wen Jiabao himself speaks of reform when he is outside China, and will be conscious that in 2012 he will be passing on his legacy to the next generation of Chinese Communist Party leaders and to the world&apos;s history books. &quot;As things stand, Chinese concerns over internal security are fuelling an increasingly vicious cycle of repression and protest in Tibet and China. &quot;Analysts argue that the human rights situation is at its worst since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.

Ten would be too many. Five or nine would presumably produce an unaesthetic, wonky effect. So the smiling attendants on the test run of the Beijing to Shanghai high-speed rail link revealed precisely six to eight of their teeth to display their pleasure as the train pulled out of the capital. It had, admitted chief conductor Gao Dan, taken considerable practice; in some cases, with chopsticks jammed between their jaws. Extending 820 miles (1,318km), and spanning seven cities and provinces, China&apos;s landmark line was built in 39 months at a cost of 221bn yuan (\u00a321.4bn). But as those gleaming white teeth attest, no detail of this massive project was too minor to be subject to official scrutiny. The new link not only slashes train times between the country&apos;s political heart and its financial powerhouse, it also proclaims its power and accelerated development. It is no coincidence that the line opens to the public on Friday 1 July \u2013 the 90th anniversary of the Chinese Communist party. &quot;This is the pride of China,&quot; said He Huawu, chief engineer at the ministry of railways, minutes before the train pulled out of Beijing South station at 9.01am. It glided into Shanghai&apos;s Hongqiao station at 1.45pm, having briefly touched 190mph; usually it will restrict itself to 186mph. Officials said that 1,500 test trains had clocked up around 2m miles shuttling back and forth since exercises began in mid-May, but this was the first public glimpse of the flagship project. China is building the world&apos;s largest high-speed network, with around 10,500 miles completed or under construction. It has said it plans to spend $30bn (\u00a319bn) this year alone. But the scale of its ambition has been brought into question by concerns about waste, corruption and safety \u2013 particularly since the railway minister, Liu Zhijun, was dismissed this spring for &quot;disciplinary violations&quot;. In March, China&apos;s state audit office said nearly $30m of funds for the line were embezzled or otherwise misappropriated during one three-month period of construction last year. The cases are under investigation. But Hu Yadong, vice minister of railways, told a news conference last week: &quot;We will not slow down the pace, and there will be no cut in investments.&quot; The government has cut the top speed of the trains from 217mph to 186mph; a decision variously ascribed to safety concerns, environmental worries or simply a need to cut ticket prices by reducing fuel consumption. Even so, the Beijing-Shanghai link halves the journey time by rail from around 10 hours \u2013 at its fastest \u2013 to just four hours and 48 minutes. It appears an easy sell for business people, delivering a smooth journey with mobile phone signals (and, soon, onboard Wi-Fi) and none of the hassle of airport security. Airlines are reportedly slashing ticket prices already. Officials say they plan to run 90 trains a day, at 186mph and 155mph. Tickets for the fastest trains cost from 555 yuan (\u00a354) for standard seating. Upgrade to business class, for 1,750 yuan, and you gain fully reclinable seats with individual entertainment systems. In first class, which is pitched between the two, you get Jackie Chan&apos;s The Spy Next Door on shared overhead screens. Meanwhile, through the picture windows, labourers can be seen toiling in the fields. In one spot, three farmers in straw hats were dragging a plough through the rocky soil. Given the uneven nature of development in China, some see the country&apos;s massive investment in high-speed rail as a folly driven largely by the desire for prestige. While this link along the wealthy east coast is expected to make money, others are struggling. Some suggest expanded flights and freight rail capacity would be more sensible ways to connect remote areas. &quot;[The network] will be a liability, not an asset, for China,&quot; Zhao Jian, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University, told Reuters last week. He cited the example of a Henan-Shaanxi line, designed for 37 million passengers a year, which reported fewer than 2 million in its first six months of operation. Others fear that poorer travellers \u2013 such as tens of millions of migrant workers \u2013 will struggle as expensive high-speed services replace much slower, but much cheaper, trains. But supporters believe high-speed rail will help drive development in the poorer central and western regions, spreading wealth from the wealthy east and south. No one is more enthusiastic than Xu Yifa, who spent the first six years of his working life shovelling coal \u2013 8,000 tonnes in all, he estimates \u2013 into a steam train. &quot;We couldn&apos;t even have dreamed of this. It&apos;s hard to imagine China&apos;s railways could develop this fast,&quot; said Xu, now the deputy secretary of the Zhengzhou railway hub, as the train glided through Hebei province. &quot;It feels so smooth and comfortable. You can&apos;t compare it. [Back then in 1965] it was very shaky.&quot; After almost half a century working on, driving and then overseeing trains, he was thrilled by the changes in China&apos;s railway system \u2013 and keen to share its benefits. Beijing&apos;s ambassador to the UK suggested last week that Chinese firms could help build a high-speed line between London, the Midlands and the north, saying the country had &quot;the knowledge, expertise and experience&quot;. &quot;Of course! There&apos;s no argument,&quot; Xu declared when asked whether Britain should buy Chinese. &quot;China should be the first choice.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Rail transport", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-27T07:32:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/28/china-shakespeare-wen-jiabao-visit", "sentences": ["However, in 1979, the Old Vic Company performed Hamlet in Shanghai with a simultaneous translation, and in 1983 the famous actor Ying Ruocheng translated and directed The Merchant of Venice at the People&apos;s Art Theatre in Beijing."], "title": "Why does China love Shakespeare? | Frances Wood", "article": "Before beginning his formal programme of meetings in Britain, China&apos;s premier Wen Jiabao visited the MG car factory and Shakespeare&apos;s birthplace. In response to a comment by Peter Mandelson about the selection of these places, Wen thanked the previous Chinese ambassador Fu Ying for her advice, but said that Shakespeare was his own choice. He returned to the subject of his boyhood love of Shakespeare in his speech to David Cameron. Shakespeare occupies an interesting position in China, where major foreign writers such as Dickens, Conan Doyle, Balzac, Stendhal and the Russians were translated in the early 20th century and soon became household names. Many Chinese, including political leaders, take pride in being well-read. By contrast, how many English people, let alone political leaders, could name China&apos;s foremost 18th-century novelist, or the great poets of the 8th century? Though Dickens has always been politically correct, there are aspects of Shakespeare that have occasionally caused unease in China. There are his histories, dramas of the death of kings, and the overthrow of tyrannical rulers and even Hamlet contains &quot;political allusions too sensitive for a supreme dictator&quot; and a &quot;hero too tentative for the nation&apos;s militant cause&quot;. Though the plays were published in Mao&apos;s China, it was not until after his death in 1976 that they were actually performed publicly. In the 1980s and 1990s there were hectic Shakespeare festivals in China. The 1986 festival featured 28 productions of 12 different plays within a fortnight, including the Merchant of Venice performed in English by the Arts Academy of the People&apos;s Liberation Army, Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream performed by the China Coal Miner&apos;s Drama Troupe and Othello by the China Railways Drama Group. After the appearance of the first translations in the early 20th century, for much of the period from 1949 to the late 1970s, Shakespeare was known only through the text and any literary criticism was rooted firmly in Marxism and Leninism. King Lear was described as &quot;a portrayal of the shaken economic foundations of feudal society&quot; and Romeo and Juliet, &quot;the desire of the bourgeoisie to shake off the yoke of the feudal code of ethics&quot;. However, in 1979, the Old Vic Company performed Hamlet in Shanghai with a simultaneous translation, and in 1983 the famous actor Ying Ruocheng translated and directed The Merchant of Venice at the People&apos;s Art Theatre in Beijing. Many of Shakespeare&apos;s stories have almost universal appeal and have been adapted to various traditional Chinese forms. I saw a very lively and amusing Peking Opera version of Othello in the mid 1980s, which showed how easily the story could translate, while Shakespeare&apos;s language can be very difficult. In China, the stories came first, with Lamb&apos;s Tales From Shakespeare &quot;translated&quot; in 1903. Lin Shu has been described as &quot;the most popular English-Chinese translator of the early 20th century who rewrote in classical Chinese prose a large number of novels by 19th-century writers including Dickens, Scott, Hugo and Balzac.&quot; &quot;Re-wrote&quot; is the key to Lin Shu&apos;s approach for he said &quot;I have no foreign languages&quot; but &quot;several gentlemen who interpret the texts for me.&quot; China&apos;s foremost 20th-century playwright Tian Han translated Romeo and Juliet in 1922, when he was a student in Japan so this, too, was probably a third-hand version. The two major translators of Shakespeare in China were Zhu Shenghao (1912-1944), who almost managed the complete works before his death from TB, and Liang Shiqiu (1903-1987), about whom more is known. He studied at Harvard and Columbia universities and conceived the idea of translating Shakespeare in 1930, finally finishing the task in 1967. Liang became a professor of English, teaching at Peking University and Tsinghua University and argued bitterly with leftwing writers such as the great scholar, satirist and short-story writer Lu Xun before moving to Taiwan in 1949. He translated Peter Pan, Silas Marner, Wuthering Heights and, unsurprisingly, given his disagreements with the left wing, Animal Farm. His own collected essays were published in English in Hong Kong under the faintly unfortunate title From a Cottager&apos;s Sketchbook. Liang&apos;s Shakespeare translations were more confident that Zhu&apos;s. His witches in the opening scene of Macbeth speak in regular lines of seven syllables, not in rhyme, but with the cadence of poetry, whilst Zhu&apos;s witches speak in prose. On the other hand, Zhu&apos;s translation of Hamlet&apos;s &quot;To be or not to be&quot; soliloquy retains the balance and repetition of the verb whilst Liang&apos;s rendering is complex: &quot;To live or to destroy, this is a question which merits thought&quot;. Both have their partisans. It is likely that Wen read Liang&apos;s version of the Complete Works since, despite Liang&apos;s defection to Taiwan, they were published in a good new edition in Beijing in 1954 when the future premier was 14. A self-confessed Shakespeare lover, Wen is a geologist by training, but he is well known in China for beginning many of his speeches with a poetic reference and the usefulness of Shakespeare in that context has not passed him by. But neither should we ignore the possibility that his stress on Shakespeare during his visit to England is a graceful gesture, a reminder that culture is important, both at home and in international relations and that this visit need not be entirely devoted to economic questions.", "tags": ["Wen Jiabao", "William Shakespeare", "Culture", "China", "World news", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-28T14:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jun/28/inside-weekly-1-july-deveney", "sentences": ["It&apos;s fine writing by Tania Branigan, who on the same page rides the high-speed rails on the new bullet train from the capital to Shanghai."], "title": "Inside the 1 July edition", "article": "It&apos;s mid-afternoon and as I think of this column, I&apos;m also thinking about a cup of tea.

She is proud of the little flat she moved into this year with her new husband. She spends her money on clothes, eating out and thick programming manuals. But like most of this new generation of urban, tech-savvy women Xiao Ya is a country girl at heart. Her mother, a farmer in North-West China&apos;s Shaanxi province, has lived through the most rapid reduction in human poverty the world has ever seen. Since Xiao Ya was born it is estimated more than 520 million Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty. By increasing agricultural productivity China now manages to feed 20% of the world&apos;s population with 10% of the world&apos;s arable land.  It has done this by focussing on small holder farming and &apos;firing from the bottom&apos;. Women like Xiao Ya&apos;s mother, along with men, have been encouraged at local agricultural centres to use more advanced seed strains and to look for off-farm opportunities to generate extra income. For Xiao Ya&apos;s mother, this meant buying a tractor-bike and sending her less entrepreneurial husband out to taxi other farmers along the long straight roads that crisscross bleak and featureless fields. She has a sideline in catching rabbits. She still lives in a squat concrete compound with no heating. But she has a huge TV, she eats well and she has paid for her daughter&apos;s university education. Long before Millennium Goal Three on women&apos;s rights was born Chinese leaders recognised they could only fight the starvation that stalked the countryside by focussing on rural women&apos;s development. Now China-watchers and agricultural professionals say there is evidence China seeks to show its trading partners in Africa that feeding their populations is only possible when women are empowered. Professor Sally Sargeson, who focuses on politics and land reform at the Australian National University, says women like Xiao Ya&apos;s mother have been at the heart of China&apos;s success. The ruling Communist Party ensured in 1949 that women&apos;s rights were embedded in the laws and regulations that govern land and employment. Throughout the experimentations and upheavals of the sixties and seventies, women&apos;s equality remained a priority. By making women better farmers, the government enabled vast numbers of men to migrate to cities. &quot;China was way ahead of the game in terms of women&apos;s development. The rights of women have been improved perhaps more than in any other developing country,&quot; she says. &quot;In terms of the millennium goal indicators for women&apos; equality, it hasn&apos;t gone as far as India if you are looking at women in government for example. But in terms of women as part of the paid workforce, China is right up there with the US.&quot; She sees the Chinese government as eager to find ways to look good on the international stage \u2013 but it takes two to make a cultural exchange. The technical agricultural universities could train African women to up skill like their counterparts in China. But the feminist professor says male-lead governments in Africa waste these opportunities. &quot;People are already sent to China to learn \u2013 but they tend to be people on a bit of a junket, they are not poor women farmers who would actually benefit.&quot; Land rights are key to rural development. Experts say African governments must take China&apos;s lead and enshrine equal access to land in constitutions. Not that it is an issue without ongoing gender politics in China. Current land reforms that include geo-mapping land and &apos;parcelling&apos; it out to farmers are designed to give certainty for investment and create a land market. But the government ignored calls from women&apos;s groups to list every adult in households on new land deeds meaning 84 per cent of the contracts only register the land to the head of the household \u2013 in most cases a man. Current debates around a new land administration law are seen as another chance to counter tradition. Elisa Scalisa at Landesa, an organisation that promotes land rights for women, says despite the difficulties, the world can learn from China&apos;s focus on equality. This year she starts a new programme bringing together women from East Africa and China to share tactics in getting their signatures on land deeds. &quot;The crucial point is that the Chinese government has committed itself to addressing the reforms in the land sector in China, and are committed to ensuring women are not left out of the process. They recognize that land sector reforms and inclusion of women is one of the keys to future stability, economic growth, and prosperity.&quot; This focus on what sub-Saharan Africa can learn from China is the subject of the China-DAC study group, made up mostly of African and Chinese policy wonks from the OECD and International Poverty Reduction Centre in China. They have been charged with coming up with a plan to translate China&apos;s agricultural revolution to Africa.  Shengen Fan is an optimistic Chinese man who grew up on a Chinese smallholding and ended up at the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute. A member of the study group, he says the potential for Chinese and African women to learn from each other is huge. He believes China&apos;s policy of non-interference in countries it trades with is increasingly unrealistic, and thinks women&apos;s rural development could become the way China seeks to soften its image as chief plunderer in Africa. &quot;Women always form a far larger share of the poor and hungry in developing countries. There is a saying in China that women hold up half the sky \u2013 but I say they do this all over the world with half of the resources, particularly in agriculture.&quot; Fan and his colleagues report back at a final conference in Beijing later this year and concrete development policies to channel Chinese aid and investment in Africa will follow. But already the low skill base of Africa&apos;s farmers, who are mainly women, is seen as a key problem. Securing the land rights and interests of women farmers is a key recommendation.

In a highly choreographed event that was broadcast live across the nation, Hu lauded the achievements of the venerable and vast political party but emphasised the need for greater internal discipline. His message was partly overshadowed by the mysterious absence of his predecessor, Jiang Zemin, from the lineup of senior cadres. &quot;If corruption does not get solved effectively, the party will lose the people&apos;s trust and support. The entire party should stay alert and fully appreciate the long-term complexity and arduousness of the fight against corruption, and make more efforts in fighting corruption and building a clean government,&quot; Hu said. Corruption is endemic. Revelations of bribery, influence peddling and misuse of public funds are a regular staple of the domestic media. Among the most recent cases was the sacking of the railway minister, Liu Zhijun, who was accused of taking 1bn yuan (\u00a395m). The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that 800bn yuan (\u00a376bn) was transferred overseas by officials and executives who later fled the country. Far more is likely to have been squirrelled away or lavished on banquets, second homes and lovers inside China. Hu gave little hope, however, to those seeking wider political reform that might curb the power of cadres, some of whom he acknowledged were &quot;incompetent&quot; and &quot;divorced from the people&quot;. Instead of radical change, he said, the party needed more internal democracy. His comments reflect the transformation of the Chinese Communist party, which started in 1921 as a revolutionary organisation with a dozen founders, and is now a technocracy with 80 million members and distinctly aristocratic tendencies. Many senior cadres - large numbers of whom are now the &quot;princeling&quot; sons and daughters of former leaders - use party connections for self-enrichment in an increasingly divided society. Lacking an electoral mandate, the party has built its legitimacy on managerial competence and national strength, particularly with economic growth and engineering prowess. This week&apos;s political celebrations have coincided with the unveiling of three mega-projects: the world&apos;s longest sea bridge, which spans the 16 miles (26km) from Qingdao to Huangdao; the world&apos;s longest gas pipeline, which stretches 5,400 miles (8,700km) from Xingjiang to Guangzhou; and a new high-speed railway, which cuts the travelling time between Beijing and Shanghai to less than five hours. In the runup to its own birthday this week, the party has also ramped up the propaganda volume with a series of high-profile events, including a &quot;Red Song&quot; contest in Chongqing that reportedly drew 100,000 people, the premiere of a star-studded historical drama about the founding years, and lavish TV galas. State media have run extensive special issues highlighting the successes of the party in ejecting foreign colonialists, taking power under Mao Zedong in 1959, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty and maintaining stability. Little or no mention has been made of the party&apos;s failings, including famines that killed tens of millions of people after the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s, the murderous political chaos of the Cultural Revolution, and the massacre of several hundred protesters after the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989. Hu only said lessons had been learned. &quot;In some historical periods, we once made mistakes and even suffered severe setbacks, the root cause of which was that our guiding thought then was divorced from China&apos;s reality. Our party managed to correct the mistakes by the strength of itself and the people, rose up amid the setbacks and continued to go forward victoriously,&quot; he told the thousands of senior cadres gathered inside the Great Hall of the People. The biggest surprise was the non-appearance of the former president and party leader Jiang Zemin, prompting speculation of illness or a rift within the higher echelons of the party. The former is more likely, given that Jiang is 84, but he also represents a different strand of opinion about the future direction of the party and the nation. Internal party debates are carried out behind closed doors, but there has long been a divide between those like Jiang on the &quot;right&quot; who favour more deregulation, opening and market reform and those on the &quot;new left&quot; who favour a more interventionist, egalitarian and authoritarian approach. Hu was seen as being closer to the former when he took power in 2002, but he has spent much of his time as state president and party secretary straddling the two camps.", "tags": ["China", "Communism", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-01T11:12:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/03/beauty-industry-turns-east", "sentences": ["Last month it opened a research centre in Shanghai to reinforce its &quot;strong commitment to local consumers by developing products tailored to the specific needs of Chinese and Asian skin&quot;."], "title": "Changing faces: cosmetics firms are forced to find a new image as beauty goes truly global", "article": "The fashion industry has long been criticised for promoting a narrow ideal of beauty: the world&apos;s highest-earning models have been predictably white and blonde, led by pneumatic Brazilian Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Heidi Klum and Kate Moss.

The ad aims to convey that &quot;diversity is beautiful&quot;. The American beauty giant says the campaign is a nod to the late Lauder herself, who apparently had the &quot;unshakeable belief&quot; that &quot;every woman can be beautiful&quot; (the name of the ad campaign). At the launch her granddaughter Aerin, the company&apos;s creative director, burbled about a new chapter for the 65-year-old company: &quot;Est\u00e9e&apos;s choice of models throughout the brand&apos;s evolution was always extraordinary\u2026 we continue this legacy with a new group of diverse faces that truly represent a modern vision of beauty.&quot; The message is not new. But the industry&apos;s commitment to reflecting reality is often questioned, with even successful models like Naomi Campbell complaining of racism. She told Glamour magazine two years ago: &quot;You know, the American president may be black, but as a black woman I am still an exception in this business.&quot; Geoffrey Jones, a Harvard Business School professor and author of Beauty Imagined, says the popularity of the &quot;white, blonde and blue-eyed&quot; look has been declining for some time as the global cosmetics industry, in which sales approached \u00a3240bn last year, adapts to the growing markets such as China and Latin America. The latter is expected to overtake North America in size within four years. &quot;When China first liberalised and cosmetics companies first entered, consumers wanted western brands because they were associated with success and aspiration,&quot; says Jones. &quot;But in recent years they have become increasingly concerned with the local; they want brands like Est\u00e9e Lauder or L&apos;Or\u00e9al Paris, but they also want them to have a distinctive Chinese appeal.&quot; The cosmetics industry was battered by the financial crisis, and sales tumbled particularly in mature western markets \u2013 a weakness that has made it all the more important to conquer emerging markets. When he took over this year, L&apos;Or\u00e9al&apos;s new chief executive Jean-Paul Agon set the challenge to add a billion new customers in the next decade. This year fashion editors have been hailing the arrival of the Asian fashion pack, pointing to Liu, who is now the 10th-highest-paid model in the world, as well as Du Juan \u2013 the first Chinese model to appear on the cover of French Vogue \u2013 and Godfrey Gao, a Taiwanese actor who is the face of Louis Vuitton. Their supposed success has been undermined somewhat by a recent blunder in British Vogue, which confused pictures of Liu Wen and Du Juan in an article about their success. Sola Oyebade, the chief executive of Mahogany Models Management, Europe&apos;s largest agency for models of colour, argues industry power brokers are not convinced of their selling power \u2014 although the &quot;black issue&quot; of Italian Vogue in 2008 was so popular that an extra 40,000 were printed. &quot;I welcome that Est\u00e9e Lauder has or is attempting to make the brand more visually acceptable to the global market,&quot; he says, but adds: &quot;I don&apos;t think things are changing...this was a calculated business decision. It is well known that the economic downturn is having a serious effect on businesses who recognise that the new and emerging markets are Asia and Africa.&quot; It is a &quot;good thing&quot; that Asian models are enjoying success, Oyebade says, but even they are few and far between: &quot;When you look at them they are Asian models with strong European features... without a shadow of a doubt black models face discrimination.&quot; You only have to look at the luxury goods market to see the pull of Asia: Prada this year opted to list on the stock exchange in Hong Kong rather than in its native Milan on the basis that 40% of its sales are already in Asia. The beauty market in China is put at \u00a33bn and growing fast. Against that backdrop it is easy to understand the rise of Liu, who has graduated from an average adolescence in Yongzhou city, Hunan province, to international stardom. She got her big break in 2005 when her mother entered her in a modelling competition to stop her slouching. Since then she has become the first Chinese Victoria&apos;s Secret girl and the first on Est\u00e9e Lauder&apos;s roster of &quot;brand ambassadors&quot;. Now based in New York, she has worked on her English by watching TV and films \u2013 particularly the teen vampire saga Twilight. She told one interviewer recently: &quot;I didn&apos;t think before that an Asian girl could do a beauty campaign. I do the campaign for the world, not only for Asia.&quot; In China, Liu is not considered a &quot;classical&quot; beauty; the desired aesthetic is a doll-like face with big eyes and pale skin. That beauty is in the eye of the beholder is a truism the beauty giants are all too aware of as they cash in on the hang-ups of different races. Est\u00e9e Lauder&apos;s larger rival L&apos;Or\u00e9al spends more than \u00a3600m a year developing products to feed consumers&apos; hunger for new shampoos and lipsticks. It has more than a dozen &quot;evaluation centres&quot; around the world where, according to Patricia Pineau, its head of communication for research and innovation, it studies the idiosyncrasies of national beauty routines in mocked-up bathroom sets: &quot;We ask women to come with their beauty case and we observe.&quot; The results are surprising. &quot;A Korean woman uses 23 products and will spend 45 minutes getting ready,&quot; says Pineau. The lengthy session in front of the mirror involves the painstaking use of eyeshadow to &quot;design a double eye to make eyes look more open&quot;. One study revealed that women in Mexico City, where hair loss is a side-effect of pollution, crush contraceptive pills in their shampoo to aid hair growth. When Lauder started building a cosmetics empire in the second half of the 20th century, only Hollywood actors and the French had global appeal. That is no longer true today and Leonard Lauder, the founder&apos;s son who is credited with transforming the family firm into today&apos;s near-\u00a35bn business, talked of the arrival of &quot;beauty pluralism&quot; in an interview with Women&apos;s Wear Daily. He described a &quot;wave&quot; of Chinese consumption at home and abroad, with almost half the cosmetics sold in Galeries Lafayette bought by tourists. &quot;The Chinese are going there,&quot; he said. &quot;The Russians are coming to London. The people from the Middle East are coming to London. You advertise the right products with the right models in the right country.&quot; L&apos;Or\u00e9al has 25 faces, including Ethiopian model Liya Kebede, the athlete and double amputee Aimee Mullins, and Beyonc\u00e9. &quot;We aim to show a depth of personality, not just a beautiful face,&quot; says Gayle Tait, UK general manager for L&apos;Or\u00e9al Paris. Some stars, such as Cheryl Cole in the UK, have local contracts, while others, including Beyonc\u00e9 and Bollywood&apos;s Aishwarya Rai, feature in global campaigns. The &quot;every woman can be beautiful&quot; ads are showcasing a range of face creams deemed suitable for all skin tones, but Est\u00e9e Lauder is the owner of a cupboard full of brands including Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Jo Malone, and is not pushing a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach. Last month it opened a research centre in Shanghai to reinforce its &quot;strong commitment to local consumers by developing products tailored to the specific needs of Chinese and Asian skin&quot;. Skin whitening creams, for example, are big business for women and men in Asian markets. In India alone, the desire for fair skin has created a \u00a3300m a year trade in creams led by Unilever&apos;s Fair &amp; Lovely. Est\u00e9e Lauder&apos;s products include Cyber White Lightening lotion. The altered image of the beauty industry is also about change closer to home, says Jones. &quot;Major western markets have become multiracial in a way they weren&apos;t 10 to 20 years ago and using models of different ethnicities is a way to hit those markets big time.&quot;", "tags": ["Fashion", "Beauty", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-02T23:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/03/bjarke-ingels-incinerator-ski-slope", "sentences": ["For the 2010 Shanghai Expo he gave visitors a sense of sustainable life in Copenhagen by moving the city&apos;s most famous landmark, the Little Mermaid statue, to China, complete with her own pool of water from the city&apos;s harbour."], "title": "Bjarke Ingels designs incinerator that doubles as ski slope in Copenhagen", "article": "How do you turn a 100-metre-tall incinerator in the heart of Copenhagen into a social and cultural hub? By building a ski slope on the roof, of course. The unlikely combination of green energy and alpine sport was the winning bid in a competition to design a new waste-to-energy plant which aims to be one of the cleanest in the world when it opens in 2016. For the winning architect, Bjarke Ingels, it made perfect sense to inject a bit of fun into the proceedings. &quot;When you spend 3.5bn kroner [\u00a3424m] creating an energy plant in the middle of Copenhagen you make sure it doesn&apos;t become an ugly box that the neighbours will protest against and clutters the cityscape,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to make sure it becomes a public park, an attraction. And when the kids come to go skiing on top of the plant they will probably be curious to find out what&apos;s going on inside the mountain.&quot; Ingels grew up wanting to become a graphic novelist, but the 36-year-old Dane is now hailed as one of the most exciting architects of his generation. For the 2010 Shanghai Expo he gave visitors a sense of sustainable life in Copenhagen by moving the city&apos;s most famous landmark, the Little Mermaid statue, to China, complete with her own pool of water from the city&apos;s harbour. Visitors on bikes viewed it from spiralling cycle lanes inside the Danish pavilion. &quot;I work with the idea of hedonistic sustainability, which is sustainability that improves the quality of life and human enjoyment,&quot; said Ingels. &quot;The fact that Copenhagen is so clean you can actually jump in the harbour [water] in the city centre is almost a miracle. The city is sustainable but doesn&apos;t become synonymous with making lots of sacrifices. &quot;People are willing to make sacrifices from time to time but they are not going to stop driving their kids to football. People don&apos;t drive cars because they want to pollute; they drive cars because they want to visit their friends. It&apos;s not about changing our behaviour \u2013 it&apos;s about designing our society in a smarter way. For example instead of dumping our waste we start to see it is a resource \u2013 one tonne of waste almost equates to two barrels of oil.&quot; The waste-to-energy plant, which will be Copenhagen&apos;s tallest building, will replace a 40-year-old incinerator located in an industrial area on the fringes of the city centre. More than 50% of waste in Denmark is already used to create energy and the new power plant will be 20% more effective than its predecessor. The building will be wrapped in a green facade created from planters and a lift inside will guide visitors to the top of the &quot;ski mountain&quot; while offering them views of the machinery inside. To remind visitors of the city&apos;s carbon footprint, the smokestack on top of the plant will eject a 30-metre smoke ring every time a tonne of CO2 is released. &quot;One of the problems with emissions is that they are so abstract and intangible,&quot; Ingels said. &quot;You can see there is smoke coming out of the chimney but you don&apos;t really know whether this is a significant amount. In Copenhagen in 2016 you will simply have to count the smoke rings. &quot;You are turning a factory into a public park and the chimney, which traditionally is a symbol of the problem, is now becoming something playful.&quot; Ingels&apos;s studio, BIG, made its name designing a string of innovative residential buildings in Copenhagen, including the award-winning Mountain Dwellings, where flats were stacked on a multi-storey car park and furnished with individual roof gardens. The firm has won several international commissions in recent years, including an apartment building on Manhattan&apos;s west side and a new town hall in the Estonian capital, Tallinn. For the town hall project, Ingels plans to add a huge mirror to the slanted roof of the tower that houses the city council&apos;s meeting hall. He calls this the &quot;democratic periscope&quot;. &quot;When the politicians need to make a tough decision they can look up to the roof, which will work like a giant periscope, reflecting views of the city,&quot; he said. &quot;When citizens gather to protest the periscope will work the other way so they can see whether some of the politicians are absent or if they are asleep \u2013 and if people have binoculars they can even read the meeting notes. &quot;It&apos;s a type of radical architectural realisation of political transparency.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 3 July 2011.

And if you are wondering just who may emerge as an unexpected star of the 2012 Olympic Games, it may pay to start thinking about the sleek figure that Halsall cuts in the pool, whether swimming freestyle or butterfly, as she dreams of winning five medals just over a year from now. Next Monday, in another step of a sporting journey that could see her emerge as a face to remember during and after the London Olympics, Halsall will arrive in Japan with the British swimming team. There, in a holding camp before the world championships begin in Shanghai this month, Halsall will chat and kid around as much as anyone else in a squad that bubbles over with happiness and hope at the prospect of a competition that will serve as a crucial element of its Olympic preparation. Even the fact that she has just lost her No1 world ranking in the 100\u00a0metres freestyle, the event she describes as &quot;the blue riband race&quot;, cannot dent Halsall&apos;s\u00a0ebullience. &quot;Well, I was No1 in the world until last week,&quot; she says, punctuating her words with a throaty cackle, &quot;and then I lost it by a hundredth of a second. Femke Heemskerk, the Dutch girl, swam 53.60 [seconds] and I got 53.61 at the British trials a couple of weeks ago. I can swim much faster and, coming back from my ankle operation [last December], I&apos;m just building towards London. I actually like the fact that someone else has just swum quicker than me. It makes me step up my\u00a0game.&quot; Halsall sums herself up on her Twitter page as &quot;70% professional athlete, 20% krispy kreme addict, 10% rockstar&quot;. But her zany bonhomie should not disguise a ruthless love of racing; nor how a strong mind can offset the physical disadvantages she faces against much taller and more imposing swimmers. &quot;Yeah, it&apos;s me and the six foot club,&quot; the 5ft 7in Halsall quips. &quot;But I&apos;ve got long arms \u2013 so that helps.&quot; Halsall is one of Britain&apos;s most realistic hopes for a gold medal in a premier Olympic event, even if she describes the sprint as a &quot;bun fight&quot;. &quot;Unfortunately, a lot of girls are very good at the 100m and there is an awful lot of competition. Everyone wants to be the fastest in the world.&quot; Ranked fourth in the world in the 100m butterfly, and sixth in the brutish 50m freestyle sprint, Halsall can talk realistically of winning two further relay medals. Her chances of a five-medal Olympic haul have been boosted by her already achieving that mark in last year&apos;s European championships and also at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi \u2013 where she showed the steel beneath her sparkling persona while swimming despite being so ill she was restricted to a diet of water and rice. Asked which would mean more to her in London \u2013 five medals, coloured silver and bronze, or just a solitary gold \u2013 Halsall is emphatic. &quot;Definitely one gold\u00a0\u2013\u00a0especially in the 100m free because that&apos;s my event.&quot; Halsall sounds remarkably relaxed. &quot;I never have nightmares about the Olympics. My only bad dreams are where I&apos;ve forgotten my goggles or I turn up to race in my socks. Sometimes I dream about walking into a glass door \u2013 which is what generally happens to me at major competitions anyway. &quot;So I see 2012 as a happy thing. When I came into St Pancras today, I saw the Olympic rings and I was like: &apos;Oh my God, we really are hosting the Olympics. It&apos;s going to be so cool.&apos;&quot; Recovering from her ankle injury, Halsall will swim her two freestyle sprints plus a couple of relays while sitting out the butterfly in Shanghai. But she expects to qualify for the Olympic 100m butterfly, an event in which, she says: &quot;I stand a good chance of winning a medal. Anyone who qualifies for GB in the 100m fly will have a very good chance. It&apos;s all about flow and technique, whereas the freestyle is more power and hard work. The fly needs rhythm and because it&apos;s my second event I really loosen up. When I came second in the European championships I was so relaxed I thought: &apos;Gosh, this is strange. I don&apos;t even like butterfly!&apos;&quot; She faces different challenges in the freestyle. &quot;The 50m is about sheer force and anyone in the top 15 could make the final. In the 100m you need more experience and composure and &apos;women&apos;s strength&apos;. You also need to win the battle of the mind even before you stand on the blocks. If you have the slightest doubt you&apos;re not going to do it. Everyone has that battle but I clear my mind and, just before the start, I say something simple like: &apos;C&apos;mon, Fran, you can do it.&apos; And then I remind myself what stroke I&apos;m meant to be swimming.&quot; Sitting next to the river and looking across at Tower Bridge, Halsall screeches with laughter. Has she ever forgotten whether she&apos;s swimming butterfly or freestyle? &quot;Not yet \u2013 but I once did try and swim in someone else&apos;s lane by mistake. That was a bit embarrassing. But can you imagine swimming the fly in the free? Now that would be a good story!&quot; Halsall is deeply concentrated when racing and a reason for her appearing so lighthearted outside the pool resides in her wide range of interests in Loughborough, where she trains and lives with her boyfriend, Alistair Wilson, whom she met when he was playing hockey for Britain at the Beijing Olympics. As she had to abandon formal full-time education earlier than she had hoped, having been part of the British team since she was 15, the 21-year-old from Stockport is studying for her philosophy A-level. &quot;Aristotle is my main man,&quot; she says. &quot;Oh my God, he had all these ideas before anyone really knew anything \u2013 a whole new way of thinking was based around his thoughts. And this was like millions of years ago! It&apos;s crazy!&quot; She throws up her hands in delight at her own determined exaggeration before explaining, jokingly, why Aristotle is a more trenchant thinker than Thomas Aquinas. &quot;It seems to me as if Aquinas just blooming stole everything from people like Aristotle. But of course Aquinas is a very prestigious man of the church. I quite liked moving on from him to all these philosophical questions like &apos;Does God really exist?&apos;&quot; Has she decided on the answer? &quot;Oh, blooming heck,&quot; she laughs, &quot;it&apos;s a good question, that one. I don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s quite nailed it yet. But I like comparing the ontological view with the design argument. They all sound good then you get to this one point and you think: &apos;Oh no \u2013 why have you written that in there? You were going so well up until\u00a0that\u00a0point.&apos;&quot; Is she a more philosophical person now? &quot;I am, actually. Delhi [and her illness at the Commonwealth Games] proved that. I just got on with it. I had to grit my teeth and push myself to the extremes. I got whiter and whiter and people were thinking: &apos;Bloody hell, is she going to survive?&apos;&quot; Halsall lets rip with some riotous anecdotes about diarrhoea and blocked toilets. However, she is in her real element talking fashion \u2013 handbags by Chanel, perfume by Marc Jacobs and shoes by Brian Atwood [explaining that she saw &quot;Victoria Beckham wearing a pair of his shoes and I thought: &apos;I&apos;ve got to get some for me&apos;&quot;] \u2013 or when revelling in the brutal arts of ballet and kick-boxing. &quot;One of the things I love most about swimming,&quot; she says, &quot;is that, during cross-training, we try all these other things. I&apos;ve done running, gymnastics and the ballet! We do it to help our breathing, co-ordination, movement and rhythm. We try the simplest ballet moves and it&apos;s so hard. Ballet dancers are incredible.&quot; And what about kick-boxing, which crops up in conversation with Halsall? &quot;My kick-boxing is good even if I&apos;ve only got my white belt. I love the noises you&apos;re supposed to make \u2026 &quot; Halsall emits a series of high-pitched cries and guttural sighs as she shows off a few\u00a0of\u00a0her moves. &quot;Usually I&apos;m too embarrassed to do them that loud! But I like it because we get out of this gleaming pool and we go to another part of Loughborough and it&apos;s real street-style. Me\u00a0and the other\u00a0swimming girls put on these gloves that a million other people before us have worn. Can you imagine the smell? Afterwards, everyone&apos;s putting their smelly fingers in each other&apos;s\u00a0faces.&quot; It&apos;s hardly Coco Chanel? &quot;It&apos;s not. But I like it. All the girls get proper stuck in \u2013 more than the boys I reckon. I really go hell for leather against the pads as it&apos;s a good way of getting all the stress out.&quot; On the sunny banks of the Thames, having spent most of the day teaching children how to scale a climbing wall as part of &apos;Get Set, Go Free&apos;, a Nestle promotion to encourage families to try out new activities this summer, Halsall rocks delightedly in her chair. She&apos;s just remembered another anecdote. &quot;Alistair and I have two cats \u2013 Banks and Bella. Banks, the boy, catches bees in his hands and then goes like that \u2026 &quot; Halsall, so absorbed in her story that she seems to have forgotten that cats have paws, takes a great big gulp and makes a funny face which is meant to look like a cat with a bee in his mouth. &quot;You can hear the bee buzzing around in his mouth,&quot; she exclaims, &quot;and then he swallows it!&quot; Banks the cat sounds more hardcore than a ballet-dancing kick-boxer \u2013 if not an Olympic gold medal-chasing sprint swimmer. &quot;Yeah, I think winning an Olympic gold medal might be even harder than swallowing a bee,&quot; Halsall says, laughing. &quot;But I&apos;m ready to have a real crack at it.&quot;", "tags": ["Swimming", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games", "Fran Halsall"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-04T21:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fujisawa-sustainable-smart-town-future-model", "sentences": ["&quot;Industries are choosing not between countries, but between Frankfurt, Barcelona and Marseilles or Beijing and Shanghai.&quot; This raises another important issue."], "title": "Japan's Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town - a model for 'smart life'?", "article": "Picture life without traffic jams or petrol stations. Have your Smartphone automatically book your next doctor&apos;s checkup. Tootle off to work on an electric bike through manicured parkland. Reserve one of the 1,000 homes in Japan&apos;s Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town and such a low carbon, eco lifestyle is yours for the taking. Sound like a futuristic, eco-version of Yuppie-ville? Perhaps. But this conversion of a disused factory site into a purpose-built, green city could well be a sign of things to come. And not before time: by 2050, about eight in ten people will be living in cities, population experts predict. The implications of such rapid urbanisation are worrying environmentalists. The planet&apos;s future, many of them warn, could be won or lost on urban planners&apos; drawing boards. Authorities in the central Japanese city of Fujisawa are hoping their &quot;smart town&quot;, due to open its gates in 2013, might provide a model for the way forward. With a total budget of 60bn yen (\u00a3463m), the pilot experiment is expected to cut average carbon dioxide emissions by 70%. With the first brick laid only last month, the ink on the blueprints has yet to be completely finalised. But the city&apos;s backers \u2013 a consortium of nine companies, led by electronics giant Panasonic \u2013 aren&apos;t short on ambition. &quot;Our aim is to build a smart town that will be the model for &apos;smart life&apos; [that is being] called for worldwide,&quot; says Teruhisa Noro, a spokesperson for the project at Panasonic, which sees its involvement as part of Japan&apos;s rebuilding efforts after March&apos;s tsunami. As a minimum, every house will have solar power generator units and home fuel cells. Energy storage devices and heat-pump hot-water systems will come as standard. The same with energy-saving air conditioners and sensor-controlled lighting. Green energy systems lie at the heart of the leaf-shaped city, a structure intentionally designed to show the natural interconnectedness of its constituent parts. One of the critical innovations underpinning the project is a smart grid, which will see every villa, apartment and condominium hooked up to same real-time information network, enabling the supply of electricity to be lined up with demand. &quot;Fujisawa will be a town with power and information networks that are connected from the start,,&quot; says Noro. The statement holds an important clue as to the drivers behind the Smart Town idea. Saving the planet is part of it and Panasonic has set itself the target of becoming the world&apos;s greenest electronics company by its centenary in 2018. But sustainable cities promise to become big business too. By Panasonic&apos;s reckoning, global demand for new cities will hit 3,100 trillion by 2030. The consortium bankrolling the Fujisawa project includes utilities, a consultancy firm, several banks, a real estate developer, an architect firm and a construction company. All see it as an opportunity to test out products and solutions that can then be spun out elsewhere. Most of that demand will centre on Asia, where migration from the country into cities is set to explode. China alone is expecting its urban population to increase by 350 million over the next 10 years. The country has earmarked funds for at least a dozen new eco-cities as part of its five-year plan. Panasonic is involved with a number of other projects, including the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City project in China and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor in India. &quot;There&apos;s a convergent trend between companies and cities,&quot; says Bruno Berthon, managing director of sustainability services at global consultancy firm Accenture, one of the companies participating in the Fujisawa pilot. Part of that convergence centres on shared environmental targets. Carbon emissions in Europe are going up in every city bar one (Stockholm). Innovative business solutions are seen as critical to turning that around. Fujisawa&apos;s emphasis on healthcare also fits public policy objectives. The early plans promise technology link-ups with medical facilities and other ways to help older people live a comfortable life - important, given Japan&apos;s ageing population. Competition represents another overlap of interests. If the20th century was all about the competitiveness of nations, Berthon says, then the 21st century will be about the competitiveness of cities. Companies are looking to set up operations in urban environments with efficient transport links, low pollution and good housing options, he adds. &quot;Industries are choosing not between countries, but between Frankfurt, Barcelona and Marseilles or Beijing and Shanghai.&quot; This raises another important issue. The innovations being tested out at Fujisawa are designed not just with future greenfield cities in mind; existing urban conglomerations stand to gain much too. &quot;In theory, it&apos;s easier to get these &apos;smart cities&apos; right from the start. In Europe and elsewhere, the battle is to retrofit&quot;, says Paul Rainger, an expert on urban sustainability at Forum for the Future. The ultimate aim of these huge &quot;working labs&quot; is to engineer ideas that will become standard for future urban infrastructure across the board, argues Rainger. &quot;Companies are looking for the sustainability equivalents of the Sky dish or Edison light bulb.&quot; He cites the example of San Francisco, where the municipal transportation department has introduced an open source database and invited companies to devise businessideas on the back of it. A Smartphone app to determine when your bus or tram will arrive is just one of the ideas to have emerged so far. Another app uses sensors in the city&apos;s car parks to direct drivers to empty parking spaces. The big prize for companies focuses at the &quot;macro level&quot; ofrunning urban services, such as the power grid or water grid, argues Rainger. That requires an entirely different business model and skill set from current practices and will be less related to large scale power generation, for instance, and more about micro-managing energy networks.

The Twitter-like blog on Sina Weibo blog appears to be a virtual step behind the censors&apos; &quot;great firewall&quot; for the British band, who have never played in China and have publicly criticised Beijing&apos;s record on human rights, Tibet and the imprisonment of Nobel prizewinner Liu Xiaobo. It comes amid a fierce debate about whether China&apos;s increasingly influential and lucrative internet is being opened up by foreign artists and companies or swallowing them. In the past week, China&apos;s sovereign wealth fund has reportedly tried to buy a stake in Facebook, Microsoft has launched a search engine with Baidu, and Cisco has been linked with a planned surveillance network of 500,000 cameras in Chongqing. By comparison, Radiohead have \u2013 at most \u2013 only dipped a toe in the water. The band have yet to confirm ownership of the Weibo blog in their name that opened on 1 July, but the host, Sina.com, says it has certified the authenticity of the account. The inaugural three-word post was as bland as it was terse: &quot;Testing the weibo ...&quot; There has been nothing since, but the blog has attracted 65,119 followers, been forwarded 11,085 times and stimulated 4,335 comments. Few among this stadium-size audience of followers have seen Thom Yorke and his fellow performers live as the band have never played on the mainland, only in Hong Kong. Many comments urged the band to change this. &quot;People adore you here,&quot; wrote a commenter named vivsnoopy. &quot;I wish I could see you in my lifetime,&quot; read another. But that decision \u2013 like the contents of the microblog \u2013 will not rest solely with the band. &quot;Many Chinese promoters have tried to get Radiohead to play in China, but the government has not approved it,&quot; said Wang Shuo, a music critic and founder of Bad FM. Given this longstanding official unease, he doubted the authenticity of the microblog. Even if confirmed, he said, Radiohead should tread carefully. &quot;Political posts would be pointless. Nobody would get to read them because they would be immediately blocked.&quot; The internet is closely monitored. The government blocks foreign social networks, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Domestic sites must self-censor. Weibo is thought to employ at least 100 staff for this 24-hour operation, though it also sometimes pushes back the boundaries \u2013 most recently by encouraging its 140 million registered users to report cases of corruption. The discussion was closed down after several prominent exposures. &quot;Weibo is very powerful. If this account is genuine, then Radiohead need to take it seriously and update it or Chinese fans will feel neglected,&quot; said Hao Fang, former editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone&apos;s China edition. &quot;Most Weibo users are young and well-educated. They evaluate issues rationally. If Radiohead posts opinions on the environment, they may have a positive influence on their Chinese fans. But if they post their views on politics, there is a risk that the government may shut their microblog down.&quot; Other foreign celebrities with Weibo accounts, such as Tom Cruise and Bill Gates, have steered clear of contentious topics. Many performers, including the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, have also kept on the right side of the authorities in concerts in Shanghai and Beijing. But the record is mixed. Bj\u00f6rk has not been invited back since a 2008 show in Shanghai that she ended with a shout of &quot;Tibet! Tibet!&quot; for the final song, Declare Independence. Oasis blamed the sudden cancellation of their planned 2009 tour on the government&apos;s unease at Noel Gallagher&apos;s performance at a Tibet Freedom concert 12 years earlier. In the 90s, Radiohead CDs were so sought-after that they sold for 40 yuan, a small fortune in those days. One radio station had a programme named after the song Anyone Can Play Guitar. But the band is influential, rather than popular, in China. &quot;Radiohead has been very active in causes of all kinds, which is something that bites all kinds of folks on the ass,&quot; said Jonathan Campbell, author of Red Rock, a forthcoming book on China&apos;s music industry. But he said engagement would be worthwhile. &quot;If this blog is genuine, it will be easier for them to exist virtually in China ... If any band can attract a loyal, hip, intelligent and savvy group of netizens to help their cause, it&apos;s definitely Radiohead.

Simon Borrows who moved from Barings in 1994 to set up the European operations of Greenhill, a US investment bank, is joining the 3i board as chief investment officer this autumn. Shareholders, thought to include Schroders and Scottish Widows, are unhappy with the underlying performance of 3i&apos;s corporate investment portfolio. The firm was recently forced to take a \u00a3200m hit on its investment in Enterprise, the waste services group. But shareholder frustration bubbled over into a rebellion over the renewal of a share bonus plan when some 40% of investors failed to back its reintroduction at annual meeting. But 93% of investors voted for the re-election of chief executive Michael Queen and a large majority also backed the remuneration report Viewed as one of the City&apos;s leading dealmakers, Borrows replaces Ian Nolan, who is moving to a new job within the group which was founded in 1945. Borrows, who will relinquish his role as chairman of Greenhill International, acted for 3i when it floated in 1994, and has held advisory roles ever since. 3i has been rocked by investor discontent because its stock price has been trading at a discount to its net asset value. At the end of March, 3i&apos;s NAV stood at 351p against close of 287p on Wednesday. One analyst suggested chairman Sir Adrian Montague, a former boss of British Energy and Crossrail, had promised to look at shareholder concern before the annual meeting, defusing a possible row \u2013 at least temporarily. Montague, told the meeting he would &quot;take account and think about&quot; demands by some investors for a share buyback rather than reinvesting some of its \u00a31.9bn cash. Borrows&apos;s reputation as a dealmaker indicates Montague believes the time is ripe for further investment, although that doesn&apos;t preclude the possibility of a share buyback of up to \u00a3300m this year. Share buybacks are one way for management to strengthen a company&apos;s stock price. Iain Scouller, analyst with Oriel Securities said that the appointment of Borrows was positive, and it was a &quot;good move&quot; to appoint an outsider to the board. In a separate statement, 3i said investments in the quarter were \u00a3233m, more than double the same period last year as buyouts and deals for minority stakes in companies picked up. Realisations from sales of investments rose to \u00a3337m as the firm banked proceeds from the sale of hydraulic pumps maker Hyva and the IPO of vehicle clamp manufacturer Norma. With new deals for 3i picking up, echoing a wider rebound in private equity mergers and acquisitions(M&amp;A), observers said it is a good time for 3i to have cash to invest. 3i has been selected to take part in a pilot programme by the Shanghai government, allowing it to convert up to $100m (\u00a362m) into renminbi to invest in China.", "tags": ["3i", "Business", "Private equity", "Schroders", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-06T18:40:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/07/junior-boys-all-true-review", "sentences": ["Their latest was recorded after returning from an extended stay in Shanghai, and while its\u00a0subtle melding of icy electronica with\u00a0slick 80s R&amp;B isn&apos;t a\u00a0radical sonic departure, there&apos;s a definite sense of a band buffing what they do until it sparkles, and this time, the melodies genuinely engage you."], "title": "Junior Boys: It's All True \u2013 review", "article": "It&apos;s an article of faith among certain bloggers that Junior Boys should be huge, but the reason they aren&apos;t is probably quite straightforward: their songs don&apos;t always match the deftness with which the Canadian duo weave cutting-edge dancefloor influences into their sound.

Back in the 1970s, that was as automated \u2013 and fast \u2013 as most people could get in rural China. Today, however, he is out shopping on Beijing&apos;s swanky Jinbao (Treasure) Street for an addition to his Bentley and cannot quite decide which 300km/h (190mph) sports car to splash out on. &quot;I like Aston Martins because I used to watch James Bond films. But I think I prefer Ferrari, even though they are more expensive,&quot; muses the former farm boy, who has made a fortune as a yacht salesman. Each of these cars cost more than 4m yuan [\u00a3390,000] but price is not Zheng&apos;s main concern. &quot;Turning heads with a luxury car is not as easy as it used to be. They are common now. Many people can afford them,&quot; he says. &quot;So I focus on comfort.&quot; It is an increasingly familiar story as ranks of wealthy Chinese move from bike to Bentley and moped to Merc in a generation. This has not only transformed the streets of Beijing, it is reshaping the business strategies of the world&apos;s biggest carmakers. China&apos;s emergence as a car industry superconsumer is evident in Jinbao Street, where Zheng takes his wife and son shopping. This leafy promenade between the Forbidden City and the central business district opened in 2002 on the site of demolished hutong (alleyway) neighbourhoods. It aims to be Ginza \u2013 Tokyo&apos;s shopping and entertainment district \u2013 plus Mayfair and Park Avenue all rolled into one, with five-star hotels, plush restaurants and designer boutiques. But its most striking feature is a clutch of car showrooms. One side of the street is home to Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, Maserati, Jaguar and BMW. On the other, Lamborghini, Aston Martin and Mercedes. Most of these luxury brands have only moved in within the past few years, but the chief outlets on this street \u2013 and others like it in Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou \u2013 have rapidly become the leading profit centres for the world&apos;s prestige carmakers. Sales of ultra-luxury vehicles in China have increased by 30% in the past six months, after even more spectacular growth last year. Thanks largely to this surge, Mercedes \u2013 one of the first foreign firms into the market \u2013 recently announced the highest monthly worldwide car sales in the company&apos;s 110-year history. BMW has also just attributed its best ever six-monthly sales to high demand in China. Divided Audi \u2013 another early arrival \u2013 sold more than 200,000 cars in China last year, nearly overtaking Germany as its biggest market. Its vehicles are now the must-have status symbol for Communist party cadres and government officers. According to the finance ministry, the government spent 86bn yuan last year on official cars. Audi have tried to cement their hold on this lucrative niche by customising models with temperature-controlled holders for the tea-flasks carried around by officials. Cars have become one of the most visible symbols of an increasingly divided society. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of cars in China increased twentyfold to an estimated 270m cars and motorbikes. In the next twenty years, this is forecast to more than double again, which means there will be more cars in China in 2030 than there were in the entire world in 2000. But the pace of growth is as uneven as the society. In the past six months, the rise of overall car sales has slowed to single digits from the spectacular 20%-30% expansion of the past decade due to rising fuel prices, curbs on licence registrations in Beijing and government efforts to promote public transport. But the rich are not only getting richer, they are getting rich faster. The Aston Martin Rapide \u2013 which Zheng is considering \u2013 has a six-litre engine, a top speed of 303kmph and a price tag of 4m yuan. This is almost twice as expensive as in the west due to high import tariffs. According to the Hurun Rich List, China has almost a million dollar-millionaires, each of whom owns an average of three cars. Luxury car ownership has distinct Chinese characteristics. On average, Chinese owners are 10 years younger than their counterparts in the United States and Europe. They are also more likely to be women. Fiat estimates the percentage of women buying its Maserati models in China is triple that of Europe, while the percentage buying its Ferraris is double the global average. Regardless of the jams, China&apos;s nouveaux riches increasingly flaunt their wealth on the roads, much to the envy of others. Among the most widely circulated photographs on the internet in recent years are those of the ostentatious wedding parades for the daughters of Shanxi coal barons. One reportedly featured a parade of four Rolls-Royce Phantoms, four Ferraris, six Mercedes Benz, six Bentleys, 20 Audi Quattros, six Jeeps, a Hummer plus several BMWs, Porsches and Range Rovers. Foreign companies are cashing in on the growing obsession with status. Last year, Lamborghini sales tripled in China to 247 cars, Rolls-Royce&apos;s rose 146% to 678 cars \u2013 overtaking the UK and on course to soon surpass the US. &quot;It will only be a matter of time before the market becomes the largest market in the world for the company,&quot; Jenny Zheng, general manager of Rolls-Royce&apos; regional office, told China Daily. Bentley&apos;s sales almost doubled to nearly 1,000 cars, making it the firm&apos;s third-biggest market. Porsche \u2013 which has been in China for 10 years \u2013 sold 13,800 cars, up 60% from 2009. In recognition of where growth is coming from, Volkswagen, which encompasses the Audi, Bentley and Bugatti marques, plans to invest an extra $15bn (\u00a39.3bn) in a joint venture by 2015. Rising concern about the impact on traffic, the environment and fuel prices has prompted the government to promote energy-efficient vehicles and public transport. Beijing has sharply restricted issuance of new vehicle registrations, handed out rebates to millions of buyers of fuel-efficient cars and is doubling the length of its subway system with a 330bn yuan investment. High-speed rail networks are being rolled out nationwide, most recently from the capital to Shanghai. Analysts see little indication that the passion for big, fast engines will dampen any time soon. &quot;The appeal of the car is rising because in China, it has become the symbol of fortune and social class,&quot; said Hu Xingdou, economics professor at Beijing Institute of Technology. But China&apos;s traffic looks likely to slow of its own accord. Despite the surge in sales of 300kmph cars, the rush-hour speed in Beijing is rarely above 25kmph. Nor can the comfort of plush interiors fully compensate for the inconvenience of nightmarish congestion. According to a survey by IBM last year, seven out of 10 drivers in Beijing have at least once given up on getting to their destination and turned back because the jams were so bad. In a &quot;commuter pain index&quot; of 20 global cities, the world&apos;s most painful commute is into the Chinese capital.

The environmental pressure group has also linked hazardous textile plants in the Yangtze and Pearl river deltas to Lacoste, H&amp;M and half a dozen other international fashion brands despite many of those companies&apos; claims to set high environmental standards in their supply chains. The allegations follow a series of high-profile pollution scandals at Chinese firms that provide materials for multinational corporations. Chinese environmental activists say these cases highlight the hypocrisy of western outsourcers who promise high safety standards for rich consumers at home even as they trade with firms that benefit from lax environmental regulations overseas. In their one-year investigation into China&apos;s textile industry \u2013 the world&apos;s largest, with 50,000 mills \u2013 Greenpeace campaigners collected samples from factory discharge pipes and sent them for analysis at laboratories at Exeter University and in the Netherlands. They discovered a range of persistent pollutants in the wastewater from two major plants. The Youngor facility in Ningbo, near Shanghai, was found to have discharged nonylphenol, an endocrine disruptor that builds up in the food chain, perfluorinated chemicals, which can have an adverse effect on the liver and sperm counts, as well as a cocktail of other toxins. These chemicals were detected in small quantities, but they are hard to break down so they tend to accumulate in nature to dangerous levels. Many were found in fish during an earlier study of toxins in the Yangtze food chain. Although the chemicals are not yet illegal in China, they are banned in the EU and many developed nations. Youngor is China&apos;s biggest integrated textile firm and boasts some of the country&apos;s most advanced technology for dyeing, weaving and printing. Its Ningbo plant is also home to an in-house research centre and a Japanese-made sewage treatment system. Greenpeace says Nike, Adidas, Puma, H&amp;M and Lacoste have confirmed a business relationship with Youngor though all denied making use of the plant&apos;s wet processes, which are likely to be responsible for the pollution discharges into the Fenghua river. Adidas said its only relationship with the Youngor is for the cutting and sewing of fabrics. &quot;Adidas does not source fabrics from Youngor Group, which would involve the use of dyestuffs, chemicals and their associated water treatment processes,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;We continue to engage with Greenpeace and have offered our full support and cooperation. In response to questions from the Guardian, Puma also said its involvement was limited to a non-polluting subsidiary that it regularly audited. &quot;Our relationship to Youngor Group is, according to our information, restricted to the ready-made garments factory Youngor Knitting, which is not involved in any discharges into the Fenghua and does not operate any industrial wet processes. We are currently in contact and discussion with Greenpeace and open for further cooperation on our chemicals policies.&quot; H&amp;M said its business partner, Ningbo Youngor Yingchen Uniform, was a discrete legal entity within the Younger International Garment City complex that did not contribute to discharges into the Fenghua river. The company said its code of conduct only applied at suppliers with which it had a business relationship. &quot;However, we share the general concern about discharges of hazardous chemicals into the environment,&quot; H&amp;M said. &quot;That is why we run a set of activities and procedures to limit and eliminate hazardous chemicals and improve overall environmental standards throughout our value chain and the entire industry.&quot; Greenpeace says the foreign firms need to insist upon higher standards throughout their supply chains. In addition, the group says the brands have a moral obligation to phase out hazardous chemicals not just in the final product sold to first-world consumers but also in the industrial process that affect workers and the environment in developing nations. &quot;These companies are doing business with a polluter. We are not accusing them of being evil, we are challenging them to take the lead on eliminating toxins,&quot; said Li Yifang, who headed the investigation at the Greenpeace China office. &quot;There is no safety limit for these chemicals because they accumulate. So we ask Nike and the others to help phase them out over a reasonable time frame. That would send a signal to the whole industry.&quot; The other polluter accused in the report was Well Dyeing Factory in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, which is said to have discharged a range of heavy metals, including chromium and copper, in addition to alkylphenols, nonylphenols and other organic chemicals. Greenpeace noted the factory released hazardous effluent into the Shiji River at night \u2013 a common practice by factories in China that want to avoid scrutiny from governmental inspectors. Many other factories are likely to be guilty of even worse pollution but their activities go undetected because they bury their discharge pipes or mix their emissions with the effluent from other industrial plants. Greenpeace says it has approached both Chinese firms with its findings. Youngor has reportedly agreed to work with the environmental group to eliminate toxic chemicals, while Well Dyeing has denied it has a problem. China has been the world&apos;s biggest exporter of textiles since 1995, but other industries have made a big impact on the economy and environment. Last year, a coalition of Chinese environmental groups traced a link between lead and cadmium contamination scandals and the production of materials for mobile phone batteries and computer circuit boards for foreign technology companies. In a follow-up study earlier this year, the activists reporteddischarge violations at several Chinese firms that are thought to be part of Apple&apos;s supply chain. Many foreign firms privately complain that environmental groups hold them to higher standards than their Chinese counterparts, which undermines their competitiveness. The campaigners respond that the big companies profit from their brand reputation and thus have a greater responsibility to set a positive example.", "tags": ["Pollution", "Retail industry", "Greenpeace", "China", "Environment", "Business", "Activism", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-13T04:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/jul/14/ted-global-2011-killer-apps", "sentences": ["The average Korean works 1,000 hours more a year than the average German, and if you look at mathematical achievement, it&apos;s a district in Shanghai that leads the world."], "title": "TED Global 2011: Interspecies sex, the West's killer apps and expert liars | Carole Cadwalladr", "article": "   Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo: The DNA of people born outside Africa on average contains 2.5% Neanderthal DNA.

His evidence suggests that we did. Neanderthals were bigger and beefier than Homo sapiens, and it&apos;s not clear that they had language, but according to P\u00e4\u00e4bo they ran into modern man somewhere in what is now the Middle East, and, as he put it, &quot;mixed&quot;. The DNA of people born outside Africa contains on average 2.5% Neanderthal DNA.

Elizabeth Murchison: Tasmanian devils are prey to 'the ultimate cancer'.  Photograph: James Duncan Davidson/TED    Is cancer contagious? Terrifyingly, it can be. What&apos;s more, it&apos;s possible that a contagious form of cancer may wipe out an entire species: the Tasmanian devil. The world&apos;s largest carnivorous marsupial could be extinct in 20-30 years, according to Elizabeth Murchison, a Cambridge research fellow who studies the genetics of cancer.  It is, says, Murchison, &quot;the ultimate cancer&quot;, unconstrained by the body that created it. The animals bite each other in greeting, and thereby spread the malignant cells, developing terrible tumours on their faces. In some areas of Tasmania, more than 90% of the population has already been wiped out. Transmissible cancer is not confined to the Tasmanian devil. Dogs can develop a sexually transmissible form of cancer. &quot;We believe this cancer may be very old. Tens of thousands of years old. It may have arisen in a wolf that lived alongside Neanderthals.&quot; And people (gulp)? Can we catch cancer too? The answer is also yes. We&apos;re familiar with the idea that viruses, such as the human papilloma virus, can indirectly cause cancer. But in the 1950s, an American scientist, Chester M Southam, injected live cancer cells into unwitting inmates in an Ohio state prison. Most didn&apos;t go on to develop cancer, but some of them did. &quot;It&apos;s probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people,&quot; says Murchison. &quot;However, under some circumstances it can happen.&quot;     Mikko Hypponen: We need an Interpol for the internet.

Yes, the fax is back, and the overhead projector may yet have its time again, because when the man who knows more about computer viruses than almost anyone tells you a firewall is not enough, it&apos;s time to listen. Computers run everything in the modern world, but there are hundreds of thousands of computer viruses out there, and a whole business ecosystem servicing them. Forget teenage hackers, there are entire criminal underworlds dedicated to the creation and propagation of viruses.  They&apos;re almost impossible to find, and even when they are, the local police do little. What we need, says Hyponnen, is an Interpol for the internet. That, and a fax machine.

In fact there&apos;s as big a gap in mathematical ability between Chinese teenagers and Americans as there is between Americans and Algerians. We are living through the end of what Ferguson calls &quot;The Great Divergence&quot;, the centuries-long period of time in which the West overtook the rest of the world. Now the rest of the world is striking back, having acquired what he&apos;s cutely termed &quot;the West&apos;s killer apps&quot;: competition, the scientific revolution, property rights, modern medicine, consumer society and finally, that work ethic. &quot;The killer apps can be downloaded.

In fact he never has. Opening in the US on 22 May, at a cost of around $30m, it has already grossed in the region of $40m. Is that just Paris and &quot;midnight&quot;? Is it the amiable, lackadaisical air of the very light film? (If it wasn&apos;t on a string it might fly away.) Or is it Owen Wilson? He plays the screenwriter hoping to be more respectable who gets to meet Scott, Zelda, Hem and Gertrude Stein when a splendid antique car comes by on a back street at midnight? It helps a lot that Wilson isn&apos;t Woody. Allen cast himself as his romantic lead way too long, and it&apos;s refreshing to see Wilson \u2013 that rarity among male stars now in that he&apos;s a true blond \u2013 who looks smart enough to have written something, but anxious enough to be disappointed with it. The anxiety is more than an impression. The young actor-writer has had significant bouts with depression, and those can hardly be attributed to his career going badly. He has had much bigger hits than Midnight in Paris. The Jackie Chan vehicle, Shanghai Noon (2000), in which he co-starred, was a hit. Wedding Crashers (2005), in which he starred with Vince Vaughn, grossed more than $200m in the US, while Marley &amp; Me (2008), in which he played opposite Jennifer Aniston and a dog, has grossed close to a quarter of a billion dollars worldwide. Perhaps Wilson was the least essential of its three stars, but the public is comfortable with him and his natural, unforced sense of humour. So the easygoing exterior may be masking a lot. The key to Wilson&apos;s work so far is not the big hits. It&apos;s the importance of creative friendship and alliance. So Wilson is joined at the hip with director Wes Anderson. Wilson acted in and co-wrote Bottle Rocket (1996), he and Anderson wrote Rushmore (1998) together and then did the same on The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), for which they got an Oscar nomination for original screenplay (plus Wilson played the druggie friend of the family in love with Gwyneth Paltrow and rewriting classics of the west). Since that, he has acted in other Anderson pictures \u2013 The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004), The Darjeeling Limited (2007) and as the voice of Coach Skip in Fantastic Mr Fox (2009). The other important association is with the actor-director Ben Stiller. They worked together for the first time when Wilson played a part in the Jim Carrey film The Cable Guy (1996), directed by Stiller. They then acted together in the drug-ridden Permanent Midnight (1998), one of Wilson&apos;s few serious dramatic roles. They have also worked together in Zoolander, Starsky &amp; Hutch, the Fockers films and Night at the Museum pictures. It may depend on your mood, or your sense of life, as to whether or not you find that record depressing. Wilson has not had a writing credit since The Royal Tenenbaums (which doesn&apos;t mean he hasn&apos;t put pen to paper). So Allen&apos;s use of him in Midnight in Paris may not be incidental, and Wilson may have felt desperate occasionally over the comedies he was slotted into, and their\u00a0steady success. He did play a serial killer in The Minus Man (1999), and he was creepy and disturbing. Gene Hackman (who had been with him in Tenenbaums) got him to play the airman shot down Behind Enemy Lines (2001) in Bosnia, and Wilson seemed capable of fear \u00a0 and desperation. He keeps very busy and has done voices in the Cars films. Owen Wilson is reliable at the box office, funny, engaging and passably romantic. But suppose at 42 that he feels those strains running out and wonders if there might not be a grand challenge for him somewhere, a story that gets him to cut his hair and have the friendly grin wiped off his face. What&apos;s the point, you say, if your films have grossed over $2bn? But this guy apparently tried to kill himself and the writer in Midnight in Paris who seems to have the girl, the lifestyle and the confidence needs something else. It&apos;s not the craziest idea that Owen Wilson could try playing Scott Fitzgerald \u2013 good-looking, talented, well-married, a man of the moment, but\u00a0believing very little of it.", "tags": ["Owen Wilson", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-14T21:09:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/14/liam-tancock", "sentences": ["We&apos;ve got the world championships in Shanghai soon, and I&apos;m feeling fit and healthy and on target for next year."], "title": "Liam Tancock:  'I would always be in the fields looking for slow worms' | Small Talk | Alan Gardner", "article": "Hi Liam, how are you?

There are some really competitive times being set at the moment and there are really good swimmers from countries like Australia, South Africa, the United States, France, Japan. Even though I&apos;m the world record holder, I just see that as the time for everyone to beat, including myself. It&apos;s kind of like motivation to keep improving.     Liam Tancock in his trunks    Now, Small Talk doesn&apos;t like to mention this, but we understand that when you broke the world record at the 2009 world championships you were wearing one of those super swimsuits that have now been banned? That was a crazy time when loads of new records were set. Basically, the suits were better for swimming in than human skin, because they reduced friction and drag in the water, although everyone had the same advantage. Fina, swimming&apos;s governing body, decided to change the rules \u2013 you used to be able to be covered from your ankles right up to your neck but now it is just from your knees to your waist for men, kind of like trunks. Speedo have been really good in helping design the new gear, letting us test it out, so that has helped. Do you miss the old suits? No, not really! Even though you could go quicker in them? [Laughs] No. It&apos;s weird \u2013 I don&apos;t know the best way to explain it. It&apos;s like if there&apos;s a barrier, and someone goes through it, it encourages everyone to push themselves further. Mentally they then think &apos;we can do that&apos;. I&apos;m quite a positive person, and I think records are there to be broken. Ahead of London 2012, you&apos;re not afraid some fast young buck might come up through the GB ranks to displace you? There are some really good younger guys coming through, like James Goddard, who&apos;s a Commonwealth champion, and Joe Roebuck, who I also went to Loughborough with. It&apos;s a good thing for British swimming. The public recognise swimmers a lot more now, though perhaps the girls, like Rebecca Adlington and Jo Jackson, more so. Are they better than the boys? [Laughs] I don&apos;t know about that \u2026 We tend to see ourselves as a team, so we all support each other, and cheer for each other from the stands. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any sense of rivalry! You&apos;re going out with fellow GB swimmer Caitlin McClatchey \u2013 what&apos;s it like being in a relationship with someone you work with? It&apos;s cool, it hasn&apos;t caused any problems. She goes to Loughborough as well and it&apos;s good to be with someone who understands about my commitments and the travelling, that sort of thing. We don&apos;t train together, and we don&apos;t tend to talk about swimming too much \u2013 we just chill out. Speaking of Loughborough, are you still a student? I actually had my last exam and finished my final bit of coursework, which I handed in before we went on our training camp to Barcelona. [Small Talk mumbles congratulations] \u2026 Thanks. I studied sports science, and I&apos;ve been at Loughborough for eight years now, so it&apos;s good to finish! They&apos;ve been very helpful, letting me move my deadlines to fit around training and competitions. Did you experience the full gamut of student life \u2013 by which Small Talk obviously means getting drunk every other night? Well, no, there hasn&apos;t been much opportunity for that but I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;ve missed out. I&apos;ve obviously got to train most days and look after my body, which involves eating the right things and getting enough sleep. And what about all the early starts? I don&apos;t really find it too difficult, I&apos;ve been doing it since I was small. I guess I want to make the most of the day. Hmm, so you&apos;re one of those &apos;morning people&apos; we&apos;ve heard about. Moving on, you do backstroke \u2013 how do you see where you&apos;re going? Well, there are five metre flags, so you know when you&apos;re reaching the end of the pool because you can see them in your peripheral vision. You can also figure out where you are by looking at the ceiling, although that doesn&apos;t work if you&apos;re outside \u2013 I remember once getting a bit of a surprise in an outdoor pool in Australia when an albatross flew over! But I can time my swims down to fractions of a second, so I generally know where I am. You&apos;re from Exeter \u2013 what&apos;s the best thing about the West Country? What isn&apos;t the best thing about the West Country?! There&apos;s the coastline and beautiful beaches, three cities all within easy travelling distance, the countryside, friendly people. I should probably be some sort of official ambassador because I&apos;m always telling everyone what a great part of the world it is. I&apos;m definitely a proud Devonian! Presumably you&apos;re an Exeter City fan, then? Yeah, I am, I go along whenever I can. I think they&apos;ve just had their best season in about 30 years. Normally I go with a few mates, go and stand up on the Bank and get involved. They know who I am as well, so the last time I went, after the game I met some of the players and the manager. That&apos;s another one of the good things about being from the West Country \u2013 in the same way that I support them, they support me. If you weren&apos;t a swimmer, what other sport would you have played? I played rugby when I was younger, so probably that. I don&apos;t think I was good enough to have been a footballer \u2026 Exeter Chiefs have also had a really good year [their first in the Premiership]. I try and keep up with what&apos;s going on via the internet and Twitter, even though I&apos;m not down that way too often these days. According to your website, you&apos;ve seen 17% of the world. Do you have a favourite place other than Exeter? I thought that was a pretty cool figure when the programme on the computer worked it out! I do enjoy travelling, I like Australia, Spain \u2026 I&apos;d love to go to South America, as I&apos;ve never been there. But really there&apos;s no place like home. You mentioned Twitter and are an enthusiastic tweeter. Are you a fan? I do think it&apos;s a good thing. Usually I get interviewed straight out of the pool when I&apos;m dripping wet, so it&apos;s nice to be able to communicate via Twitter and show a bit more of my personality. Before, you couldn&apos;t do that sort of thing, or interact with the public, but now I can answer questions or give advice, which I think is a good thing. Who is your most famous follower? Um, I dunno, really \u2026 Lots of the media. Well, they don&apos;t really count, do they? [Laughs] Ha! I guess some of my team-mates \u2026 Actually, I tell you who I do like \u2013 Jake Humphrey, who does the BBC&apos;s Formula One coverage. He&apos;s very interesting on the F1, which I&apos;m a fan of. [Tentatively] According to Wikipedia, your nickname is Fatboy? Is this true or just a Wiki-lie? Yeah, that is true. Basically, when I was young, my older brother started calling me it \u2026 He wasn&apos;t being malicious, I was just a big lad, although I did have an ounce of fat on me. A few of the people I swam with in Exeter picked up on it, so it&apos;s kind of stuck. Careful, you&apos;ll be called Fatboy wherever you go now \u2026 I don&apos;t mind who calls me it really! It also says on your website that one of your hobbies when you were young was collecting insects \u2026 Well, it wasn&apos;t exactly a hobby but I used to spend a lot of time outdoors. I like nature, so I would always be out in the fields, looking for slow worms, that sort of thing. One person I would love to meet is David Attenborough \u2013 he&apos;s seen some really amazing things. I would love to do something like that in the future. Perhaps a post-swimming career as a naturalist beckons \u2026 What super power would you have? I&apos;d like to be able to just click my fingers and be somewhere else \u2026 Not like time travel but \u2026 [Small Talk interjects] Teleportation? Yeah, that&apos;s it. That would be great, I would click my fingers and be on the beach in California, or by the pool. And it would mean less time on planes. I could turn up for competitions really fresh! You wouldn&apos;t fancy having gills like Aquaman \u2013 or would that be too much like work? Nah, that sounds a bit boring! Fair enough \u2013 though Small Talk thinks you might win a few more medals. What would you put in Room 101? Wars \u2013 they&apos;re pretty bad, aren&apos;t they? And disease. They&apos;re certainly two of the big ones. What was the last CD you bought? Ooh, I don&apos;t know, it would have been ages ago. I normally download music now. One album I have been listening to a lot is HIStory, by Michael Jackson. A lot of stuff out now gets old really quickly but he&apos;s kind of timeless. And what about Jacko&apos;s moves? I&apos;m not much of a dancer \u2013 I&apos;m crap really! You&apos;re too honest. Finally, and this is a tough one, how much water does it take to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool? Actually, we worked this out a while ago \u2013 it depends on how deep it is, because that isn&apos;t always the same. But it has to be 50 metres long and 25 metres wide, so we did the maths \u2026 though I can&apos;t remember what we came up with now! If you had to have a guess? I&apos;d say about 500,000 litres. According to Small Talk&apos;s research [cough, Wikipedia, cough] it&apos;s actually 550,000 gallons \u2013 so that&apos;s about five times as much. Still, you were more prepared for that question that we expected. Ah well, at least the number was about right! Indeed. Anyway, it was good talking to you Liam, best of luck with everything. Thanks, and you too Small Talk. Bye! Liam Tancock is a Speedo ambassador.

She went on to survive a severe bout of Delhi belly at the Commonwealth Games last year \u2013 famously all colour drained from her face and she looked as though she was about to pass out when interviewed by Sharron Davies for the BBC \u2013 but she somehow repeated the five-medal feat and returned home triumphant. Widely tipped as the next Rebecca Adlington, she is currently ranked second in the world in the 100m freestyle \u2013 having lost her No1 ranking by just one 100th of a second to Femke Heemskerk of the Netherlands last month \u2013 she is also 9th in the world in the 50m freestyle. Halsall faces competition from Heemskerk who has won Olympic and world titles in the 4x100m freestyle relay but has so far struggled to win an individual title, but equally from the Australian Alicia Coutts who took three gold medals at the Commonwealth Games last year. Halsall is currently studying for an A-level in philosophy; her boyfriend, Alastair Wilson, plays hockey for the men&apos;s Great Britain team.

But frustrating results over the next few years \u2013 finishing sixth at the Beijing Olympics and sixth at the 2009 World Championships, both results in the 200m IM \u2013 dogged his progress until, finally, he broke through again last year to win two gold medals at the Commonwealth Games in the 200m IM and 200m backstroke. An eight-year gap between his first Commonwealth medal in 2002, and his most recent in 2010, tells its own story. Ranked third in the world in the 200m IM, he will need to fight Michael Phelps for the world title, as well as Thiago Pereira of Brazil. He is ranked sixth in the world in the 200m backstroke. The World Championships aside, he is desperate to produce a final flourish at the Olympics next year. &quot;I want an Olympic medal in London,&quot; says Goddard. &quot;I have finished fourth and sixth in Olympics so far.&quot; Hannah Miley200m/400m IM     Hannah Miley just missed out on a medal at the last World Championships in Rome in 2009 when she finished fourth.

Think Buenos Aires, runaway Nazis, giant dice in the opening shot and musical numbers \u2013 all grafted on to a three-way melodrama of outrageous sexual provocation and emotional blackmail that&apos;s played like a minuet by scheming adventuress Hayworth and her two knock-kneed beaus (itinerant gambler Glenn Ford and scarfaced casino boss George Macready) on a gigantic, lavishly appointed set that amounts to a fantasia on mid-century Hollywood&apos;s notions of Latin-Americanness. If you can dream up a better backdrop for the first postwar movie of the second most lusted-after pin-up girl of the second world war, then go ahead, impress me, but I think Vidor \u2013 and his female writers and producer \u2013 had this one pretty well covered. There are moments in Gilda \u2013 like the single-glove striptease that enlivens Hayworth&apos;s second rendition of Put The Blame On Mame, and much of the insanely ripe dialogue \u2013 when you suddenly understand why your grandparents used to say, &quot;I preferred it when they kept their clothes on.&quot; Hayworth&apos;s nakedness is constantly trompe l&apos;oeiled for a 40s audience by shoulderless gowns and diaphanous, breast-emphatic blouses. Howard Hughes was doing cruder, coarser, crasser things with Jane Russell&apos;s atomic d\u00e9colletage over at RKO in the same period, but Russell had Bob Mitchum&apos;s face while Rita Hayworth was a Max Factor girl voted &quot;Best Lips of 1945&quot; and had charms, talents and splendours that far outweighed the contents of Russell&apos;s cantilevered brassiere. Thus it is she, not Russell, who anticipates the is-she-naked-or-isn&apos;t-she Marilyn Monroe of the no less provocative Some Like It Hot. Rita Hayworth crops up in any number of great movies that I rarely think of as Rita Hayworth movies.

It must have inspired Harry Potter!), not enough attention is being paid to what seems to me a far more important literary property story. JG Ballard&apos;s house in Shepperton, London, is up for sale. This is where the writer lived and wrote from 1960 until his death in 2009. You don&apos;t need to blether about cupboards under stairs to make the case for its importance. Shepperton held a vital place in Ballard&apos;s imagination: he was drawn to its commercial nullity, its suburban Englishness crossed by shabby concrete carriageways, its proximity to those in-between places, such as airports and orbital roads, in which he thrived. It was around Shepperton that the protagonist of Crash, his novel about people being sexually aroused by car crashes, drove. In another novel, he wrote: &quot;The town centre consisted of little more than a supermarket and shopping mall, a multi-storey car-park and filling station. Shepperton, known to me only for its film studios, seemed to be the everywhere of suburbia, the paradigm of nowhere.&quot; It&apos;s strange that this strangest of writers should have been so devoted to so ordinary a patch of ground. But it&apos;s also a clue to how his life shaped his gift. The amazing thing about Miracles of Life, his 2008 autobiography, was that what seemed to be outlandish dream images in his early work \u2013 empty swimming pools and abandoned airstrips, the juxtaposition of good manners with outright psychosis, the strange conjunctions of the brutal and the decorative \u2013 were actually the fruit of his wartime childhood in China. When he came to Shepperton, Ballard was fascinated by the apparent perversity of civilisation pretending to be civilised. Here was his subject. Ballard went to where the weird was and stayed there. But what he saw as weird, we see as normal. The subtitle of his autobiography characterises the arc of his life as being &quot;from Shanghai to Shepperton&quot;. He liked to play himself. A friend of mine, who interviewed him a few years back, found herself inside his house &quot;staring warily at a length of yellowing net curtain in the window of the most dilapidated house in the row. The garden is overgrown and weeds threaten to bind the tyres of a silver Ford Granada to the driveway. &apos;I&apos;ll be looking out for you at 2.30, peering through my curtains,&apos; Ballard had said earlier that day.&quot; Simon Sellars, who runs the Ballardian website, has suggested fans club together to turn the house into a\u00a0museum. The asking price is \u00a3320,000, and the house is described as &quot;in need of refurbishment&quot;. Wouldn&apos;t it be wonderful to ensure that this &quot;refurbishment&quot; never takes place? When I looked at the estate agent&apos;s website, I could find no mention of the house&apos;s literary connection \u2013 but there was a button you could click for a slideshow. I\u00a0imagined it would nip briskly through some bright photographs of the different rooms inside the house. But it was actually more like an installation-art tribute to\u00a0the great man. A pop-up window appears. There&apos;s a photograph of the front of the house, a red-brick semi with a shabby yellow door and uneven nets in the curved window. It hangs there for a few seconds, then vanishes, to be replaced\u00a0by a photograph of a\u00a0completely overgrown garden. The image zooms towards the foliage. Then\u00a0the original image reappears and we zoom in again. Then we have the front of the house again, zooming in. House, garden, house, house, house, garden. It&apos;s mechanical, random, impersonal, and rather sinister. What&apos;s lurking in that foliage? What&apos;s this anxious zoom trying to show us behind\u00a0the net curtains? It is brilliantly Ballardian. His editor once told me that Ballard saw his role, as a writer, to be the man standing on the hard shoulder of a particularly hairy curve on the motorway of modernity, holding up a bent cardboard sign on which were scrawled\u00a0words to the effect of &quot;TROUBLE AHEAD!&quot; or &quot;BRIDGE OUT!&quot; If we can&apos;t buy the house, we could at least have a whipround for a\u00a0statue of the man holding just such a placard. He could be hanging over the side of Laleham Road, just where it passes over the M3.", "tags": ["JG Ballard", "Books", "Science fiction", "Fiction", "Culture", "Property"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-17T21:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/18/qriously-mobile-startup-apps-advertising", "sentences": ["That was challenging.&quot; In spite of the painful lessons of Shanghai, the trio managed to raise two rounds of venture funding and discovered, somewhere in the ashes, the concept for Qriously."], "title": "Qriously: A question of keeping it simple", "article": "Ask any developer and they will tell you that it&apos;s extremely complicated to make something very simple. That simplicity may turn out to be the biggest challenge for the startup Qriously, which replaces mobile ads with short, targeted questions to survey users. Just seven months old, Qriously has piqued the interest of both commercial and editorial clients, running targeted campaigns variously asking for the response to ads (Do you like the new Gatorade ad?) and reaction to tech news (was buying Skype a win or fail for Microsoft?). Clients pay per answer, but Qriously also offers the tool free to developers so they can solicit feedback from users within their own apps. With a modest 90-second delay between publishing a question on the system and seeing the answers roll in, Qriously also experimented by asking for feedback during a tube strike, when location-tagged answers produced a near real-time map of the worst affected parts of London. Though the editorial possibilities seem obvious, Qriously is quite understandably concentrating on commercial clients with budgets to match. The genesis of the idea began in 2007 in China, where co-founders Christopher Kahler, Gerald M\u00fcller and Abraham M\u00fcller built Urbian, a location-based mobile business that was a kind of Foursquare before Foursquare. It was a brave, or possibly foolhardy, decision for a team that now admits it just didn&apos;t understand Chinese internet users or the Chinese market \u2013 dynamics that have defeated even the biggest tech giants. &quot;We thought it was the most exciting industry in the world in the most exciting market in the world, but we were too naive,&quot; says Kahler. &quot;We were ruled by western aesthetics and western functionality, and basically had to trust the team to Chineseify it. That was challenging.&quot; In spite of the painful lessons of Shanghai, the trio managed to raise two rounds of venture funding and discovered, somewhere in the ashes, the concept for Qriously. With the VC funding running out in early 2010, Kahler&apos;s team focused on building a series of profitable Android apps that included brain training and puzzle games, a travel guide and a camera app. Urbian&apos;s attention to user experience and interface design gave it a significant edge over some rather mediocre competition on Android. But out of these rather random experiments came one important observation. &quot;Building all these free apps we questioned whether ads were really the sole form of monetisation,&quot; says Kahler. &quot;People have a voice, so is there a way to capture and monetise that instead? We thought about how we could ask people what they think, and started trying a few things out. When the answer rate went through the roof, we knew there was something there. There&apos;s an innate desire for people to express themselves, to make their voices heard.&quot; What they had devised was a simple interface for asking any short, targeted question to a mobile app user. The team went home to Austria in March 2010 to refine the idea, and by Christmas that year had raised $1.6m from the venture firm Accel to set the company up in London \u2013 although Kahler isn&apos;t bowled over by the capital&apos;s startup scene. &quot;It&apos;s not a great place for development. There&apos;s a lot of talent but it&apos;s very expensive and you compete with the banks for developers, and as it&apos;s a hot place for startups developers are very aware of the opportunities.&quot; He says he was reluctant to raise funding because the team felt better motivated and inspired by having to bootstrap their work. &quot;There&apos;s a freedom to that. When you have an investor there&apos;s accountability \u2013 entrepreneurs by definition don&apos;t like being accountable to anyone but themselves. But we knew the idea was huge and that we need to scale to fit the space \u2013 we were like cold gas in a hot room and needed to expand.&quot; What Qriously now offers is a lightweight tool to measure public sentiment. Its competition includes giant research firms like Nielsen \u2013 who are able to provide far more in-depth and traditionally robust research for clients. But Qriously has some critical advantages in being real-time and, by being on mobile devices, has location options so granular that answers can be gathered even from one street. It took three major iterations of the service to simplify the interface this far. Qriously has deals with several mobile ad networks, including MoPub, that are incorporating Qriously and helping expand its inventory. At the moment, the service can field 1,000 questions a day in the UK and clients use a simple web dashboard to compose and publish questions. Developers build Qriously into their Android and iOS apps using its software development kit, and an estimated 5m devices have used the service already. &quot;It seems simple, but communicating the value of what we&apos;re trying to do is really challenging,&quot; says Kahler. &quot;As soon as clients see answers to their questions coming in in real time, they totally get it. But helping them make sense of the data, helping them create the question \u2013 all those things we are still trying to solve.&quot; The goal, he says, is to create accurate results that can be condensed into a simple, actionable fact. &quot;Ultimately, when clients can act successfully on our data that is what gives our company value.&quot; Kahler claims Qriously compared results of its surveys with Pew and Forrester reports and found they corresponded to within 5%. He won&apos;t say anything about revenues yet, but the investors have clearly been shown some impressive forecasts. Qriously is in a subset of the international mobile advertising market that is now worth $3.5bn, and set to rise to $24bn by 2015. Future revenue streams could include a freemium or subscription offering for consumers, and the team is already developing a consumer-facing tool that will let users share results with friends. Qriously will also start to offer clients questions targeted to specific groups, so a fashion question is shown to users who have responded to similar questions before. Doesn&apos;t the area of personalisation and user history bring Qriously dangerously close to Facebook territory? &quot;Any form of traditional market research company would be our competition if they didn&apos;t move so slowly,&quot; says chief commercial officer Adam Paulisick, a former commercial director at Nielsen. &quot;The competition will be if Facebook comes more towards the mobile experience, or if someone else encroaches on that space. But people are looking to see if we succeed or fail first.&quot; The million dollar question, concedes Kahler, is whether Qriously can maintain that simple interface while adding value to its results by deepening the range, meaningfulness and context of its data. Perhaps that&apos;s the next question to ask its users.", "tags": ["Media", "Mobile phones", "Telecoms", "Technology", "Apps"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-18T07:21:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jul/18/for-profit-universities-public-private", "sentences": ["It is one of those elite institutions \u2013 29th in the world ranking produced by Shanghai Jiao Tong university, a few places behind Imperial."], "title": "Are private universities the way forward?", "article": "On the face of it, US universities are booming. The most competitive can afford to be more selective than ever before. And in the country that invented mass higher education, there is now a place at university for virtually anyone who graduates from high school. Of course, some say this is the boom that presages a bust. Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist who backed Facebook, has described education as &quot;a bubble in a classic sense&quot;. Morton Schapiro, an economist who specialises in higher education, gives this short shrift. &quot;A 30-year bubble \u2013 the increased focus on 50 of us [elite US universities] that started in the late 1970s and has continued since, that&apos;s one hell of a bubble. That&apos;s not tulips,&quot; he says, a reference to the speculative bubble in tulip bulb prices in 17th-century Holland. Schapiro, speaking to me on a visit to London, is president of Northwestern, a private research-intensive university in Illinois. It is one of those elite institutions \u2013 29th in the world ranking produced by Shanghai Jiao Tong university, a few places behind Imperial. This year, it had 31,000 applications for an intake of 2,000. His view is that private and for-profit universities are destined to continue thriving. But the outlook is bleaker for the public sector. It&apos;s a scenario that could become familiar here. A recent survey of vice-chancellors suggested that more than a third are looking outside the public sector for growth. The survey, for PA Consulting, identified two institutions actively considering going private, and nearly a quarter that expected government-funded activities to become less relevant to their business planning. Meanwhile, around half foresaw institutional failures and the takeover of struggling universities. BPP, the for-profit university, has launched an expansion strategy to run at least 10 public universities. Schapiro says: &quot;The real problem in American higher education is we have great public [universities] as well as private ones but the publics are struggling. They are supported by and large by the states, and the states are having a really tough time, critically, in the aftermath of the great recession, they have reallocated funding away from higher education.&quot; The loss of funding for public universities creates an opportunity for the private sector. At a university struggling for resources, it takes students longer to complete the components of their course. Schapiro suggests that a typical four-year course could balloon into five or more. This makes the difference in price between the sectors easier to justify, he argues. &quot;If you can go to one school like Northwestern and can get a degree in four years ... as opposed to taking five and a half, that difference of 12 to 18 months eliminates a fair share of the differential tuition. &quot;People say to me, it&apos;s so much cheaper to go to a public. Not if you think about the opportunity cost of your time. And the opportunity cost of your time is high if the counter-factual is: &apos;you&apos;re going to go to a private and you already have a degree&apos;.&quot; From a social pespective, this loss of funding for public universities is regrettable, as Schapiro is quick to point out. But it does hand universities like his \u2013 and the for-profit sector \u2013 an advantage. &quot;You ask about, say, the next 10 years, and I don&apos;t see the publics rebounding. Unfortunately, from a social point of view, they are really struggling. Look at the University of California, which is the flagship public programme. They have been decimated by budget cuts. It&apos;s terrible for California, it&apos;s terrible for the US, it&apos;s terrible for the world.&quot; The English and US systems are hard to compare. Our universities are more independent of the state than US public institutions. Lavish endowment funds are central to the financial stability of their private institutions, while even the wealthiest of ours remain dependent on public funding. The English analogy to America&apos;s savaged public sector might be the squeezed middle rank of universities, which have seen their teaching grant cut and are now at risk of losing student places at both ends of the spectrum \u2013 to more prestigious universities on quality, and to cheaper ones on cost. Meanwhile, for-profit education providers are snapping at their heels. Schapiro praises the for-profit sector in the US. The biggest of these, the University of Phoenix, educates more than 400,000 undergraduates. &quot;At their best, some of the for-profits could teach us things, they leverage student aid more effectively than some of the rest of us do. They get every dollar of student aid,&quot; Schapiro says. &quot;Sometimes they work pretty closely with business, with specific firms. &quot;At their best, they&apos;re not exactly the enemy and the end of all goodness that some people think. There&apos;s a system of community colleges, two-year colleges in the US, and they may compete with them, or less selective comprehensive publics. &quot;I like competitive markets ... If schools can&apos;t really prove their value, they lose some students to the for-profit sector.&quot; The increased competition the government proposes for England&apos;s universities may lead to greater specialisation. Critics warn that the recent white paper could lead to a more stratified sector, with the most prestigious brand names scooping up the highest-achieving candidates, an expansion of cheaper providers and middle-ranking institutions getting squeezed. Schapiro describes the variety of the US system with approval. This ranges from the simple diversity of location to ones of scale; Schapiro&apos;s previous job was as president of a liberal arts college with just 2,000 students. &quot;I like that idea [of specialisation] \u2013 we&apos;re really well known for journalism ... we have engineering, we have a music school, but we don&apos;t have other things. We don&apos;t do undergraduate business, [or] urban planning. We don&apos;t have a school of architecture, [or] a public policy school.&quot; Schapiro doesn&apos;t believe degrees are merely signals of underlying ability. This charge, that the university system is failing to educate young people, is levelled in the controversial new book Academically Adrift, by sociologists Richard Arum of New York University and Josipa Roksa of the University of Virginia. The authors say that, according to their analysis of more than 2,300 undergraduates at 24 institutions, 45% demonstrate &quot;no significant improvement in a range of skills \u2013 including critical thinking, complex reasoning, and writing \u2013 during their first two years of college&quot;. Schapiro responds to this by saying: &quot;Most universities in the US are open enrolment \u2013 they&apos;ll take anybody who applies. If you&apos;re talking about selective privates or selective publics, it&apos;s a whole different clientele, a whole different purpose.&quot; There&apos;s no question that the &quot;most highly selective, heavily endowed&quot; universities add a lot of value, he says. In any case, he adds, if the purpose of university were simply to screen out the most talented individuals rather than develop students&apos; potential, &quot;you would probably develop a screen that&apos;s less expensive than taking four years of your life and possibly $200,000 [\u00a3124,000]&quot;.", "tags": ["Students", "Access to university", "University funding", "Higher education", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-18T18:15:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/19/keri-anne-payne-gold-olympics", "sentences": ["  Just over a week short of the one-year countdown to the Olympics, the swimmer Keri-Anne Payne has become the first British athlete to guarantee her place at the Games after regaining her world 10km open-water title in Shanghai."], "title": "GB swimmer Keri-Anne Payne wins gold \u2013 and qualifies for 2012 Olympics", "article": "  Just over a week short of the one-year countdown to the Olympics, the swimmer Keri-Anne Payne has become the first British athlete to guarantee her place at the Games after regaining her world 10km open-water title in Shanghai. In contrast to the conditions Payne can expect in Hyde Park&apos;s Serpentine next summer, the 2008 Beijing silver medallist and one of Britain&apos;s best gold medal hopes for London 2012 overcame sweltering sea temperatures of 29C \u2013 only two degrees below the recommended safety limit \u2013 to reclaim the title she last won in Rome in 2009. Three competitors had to be rescued from the water during the race, but the Johannesburg-born Stockport swimmer completed the course at Jinshan City Beach in 2hr 1min 58.1sec, more than a body length ahead of the reigning world champion, Martina Grimaldi of Italy, with Greece&apos;s Marianna Lymperta some way back in third. It was Britain&apos;s first medal of the world championships. &quot;To be on that Olympic team at a home Olympics is going to be absolutely amazing,&quot; Payne said. &quot;It&apos;s a weight off my shoulders. I can concentrate on training now for next year and I don&apos;t have to worry about qualifying because I&apos;ve already done it. &quot;I have events to swim in the pool schedule next week [the 1500m freestyle and 4x200m freestyle relay] and then I&apos;ll return home and get straight back into the water and concentrate on my preparation for 2012. I&apos;m sure there will be added pressure on me going into the Olympics but I&apos;ll just work on that coming into it. I&apos;m definitely going to have a target on my back but we&apos;ll see how it goes.&quot; The 23-year-old needed only to finish in the top 10 to qualify, and although both shooting and archery already have qualified places for the Games, she is the first named athlete to secure her spot in a British team expected to total 550. Apart from open-water swimming, the other sports to have named places are boxing and tennis. The first boxers to make the Games could be confirmed by late September. &quot;That&apos;s one down, around 549 to go \u2013 well done Keri-Anne Payne for getting the ball rolling,&quot; said the Team GB chef de mission and British Olympic Association chief executive, Andy Hunt, who was watching in China. &quot;Keri-Anne&apos;s outstanding performance to win gold is a terrific personal accomplishment and the Olympic qualification represents a significant milestone on the road to 2012 for Team GB. &quot;The Games really do feel very real: the first athlete qualifying a week out from one year to go, it feels very real. It&apos;s brilliant for all the swimmers, all the athletes across the team. It is very appropriate that the first athlete to qualify a named place comes in an event which brought us so much success at the last Olympics, where Team GB&apos;s swimmers brought home half\u00a0of the six medals on offer in the open\u2011water discipline.&quot; Payne and the Welshman David Davies both won silvers in Beijing, while Cassie Patten claimed bronze in the 10km event that was then making its debut at the Olympics. However Patten has struggled to recapture that form following three years of injury and illness and on Tuesday had to be led away in tears after finishing down in 21st in a time of 2:02:33.01, ending her hopes of qualification. While Patten was being consoled, Payne&apos;s day became even more memorable as news was relayed to her that her sister, Janine, had gone into labour.

Until, that was, her Charlie&apos;s Angel moment. The Murdoch father and son were nearing the end of more than two hours of questioning when there was a sudden commotion. A woman&apos;s voice could be heard shouting &quot;no, no, no&quot; as the shaving-cream assailant, Jonathan May-Bowles, walked up to Rupert Murdoch, took aim and struck.           Deng lunged while startled police officers were barely off the back foot. While a roomful of male advisers also appeared stunned, she scooped up the paper plate fired at her husband and launched it like a grenade back at May-Bowles, a comedian, with an amazing right hook. Such was the force of her shot that the foam directed at her husband&apos;s face landed on a police officer and on her own blue-painted toes. Witnesses believed that if it wasn&apos;t for that officer she would have continued round the table to finish the man off. She capped this performance by proceeding to sit on the table in front of her husband, calmly wiping his foam-flecked face. That she reportedly laughed &quot;I got him&quot;, relishing the moment she swung a right hook at the comedian, indicates Deng is no shrinking violet \u2013 more Crouching Tiger, according to members of her instant global fan club. Her actions sent Twitterers into frenzy. &quot;Wow, wendy [sic] murdoch giving whole new meaning to the term tiger mother \u2026 insanity!&quot; tweeted the US TV news anchor Katie Couric. Another tweeted: &quot;OMG! Wendi Murdoch just crouching tigered across 2 people and head whacked a guy trying to pie Rupert! THAT is good TV!&quot; It seemed Deng had improved Murdoch&apos;s image far more than the public relations consultants he has been paying. &quot;That pie thrower did more for Murdoch than Edelman ever could,&quot; tweeted Katie Rosman, a technology and pop culture correspondent for Murdoch&apos;s own Wall Street Journal, in reference to Murdoch&apos;s recent hiring of the PR firm Edelman. At 5ft 10in and possessed of steely determination, Deng has always excelled at sport. It is undoubtedly because of her that Rupert finds himself pumping iron at 6am and downing a concoction of fruit and soy protein, as the News Corporation chairman once disclosed to Vanity Fair in a rare interview. A former school volleyball champion in China&apos;s southern city of Guangzhou, where the young Wendi was raised, Deng openly fusses over her husband and is said to regularly admonish him for not taking enough care of his health \u2013 scoldings Murdoch seems to enjoy. The mother of Murdoch&apos;s two youngest children, she has risen from the position of a junior executive at Star TV in Hong Kong to become his powerful right-hand woman, particularly in advising him on potential investments in the lucrative Chinese market. Deng, who was head of her school&apos;s athletic association and excelled at basketball and badminton, burst on to the US social scene after meeting Murdoch at a company party in Hong Kong. They were married in 1999, 17 days after his divorce from his second wife, Anna, mother to Elisabeth, Lachlan, and James. She was 30, and a newly appointed vice-president of his Star TV. He was 68. The daughter of a factory director left China as a teenager with the help of a Californian couple, Jake and Joyce Cherry. Jake Cherry was helping the Chinese build a factory to make freezers. Deng, who has two sisters and one brother, had enrolled in Guangzhou medical college at the age of 16. A Wall Street Journal profile, published in 2000, says the Cherrys&apos; interpreter introduced them to Deng, who was anxious to learn English, and Joyce Cherry offered her tuition. When Joyce returned to Los Angeles in 1987, her husband stayed on in China to finish the factory project. He rang her to say Deng wanted to come to the US to study, and the couple sponsored her application for a student visa. She moved into their home, claims the article, but all was not well. Joyce suspected her husband was having an affair with Deng, with whom he was reportedly infatuated. Deng, who was by now a student at California State University at Northridge, a commuter college in the San Fernando Valley, before going to business school at Yale, moved out. Cherry followed, and moved into a nearby apartment. Deng married Cherry, then 53, in February 1990, but they split up four months later because of her relationship with a man named David Wolf, who worked for an import-export company. Cherry later told an interviewer: &quot;She told me I was a father concept to her, and it would never be anything else. I loved that girl.&quot; In keeping with her keen interest in physical fitness, Deng, by now a US citizen, worked with Wolf at a Los Angeles gymnastics academy where she acted as a liaison between the gym&apos;s Chinese coaching staff and parents of the children who attended. She first appeared at Murdoch senior&apos;s side in 1998. By then she was working for Star TV, planning its activities in Hong Kong and China, in particular helping to build distribution for its music channel. She acted as Murdoch&apos;s interpreter on a visit to Shanghai and then Beijing. Rumours of their romance were fuelled when, after dinner meetings in Hong Kong, they were seen holding hands. He separated from his wife that year. Deng has been at his side ever since. &quot;Wendi gives News Corp a Chinese face in China,&quot; Joseph Ravitch, from the Goldman Sachs media practice that advised News Corp on its Asia strategy, told the WSJ. &quot;She represents not just the company but the owner, and that&apos;s criticial in a country where families are very important.&quot; She is also, it would seem, the media mogul&apos;s greatest protector.

Deng&apos;s agile slapdown of the British comedian who threw a foam pie at her husband while he was being questioned by a parliamentary select committee was the top story on Sina and other leading new portals. Commentators celebrated her vitality, while state news agencies tried to widen the discomfort of the press baron to the entire western media. Deng was praised as a &quot;tiger woman&quot; and &quot;Charlie&apos;s Angel&quot;. &quot;The image of Chinese women just got a lift,&quot; noted a post on the Weibo microblog by Toubenxingfu111. &quot;This adds value to the image of Chinese wives,&quot; said another under the name Jihua. &quot;They have previously proved their ability to cook and run a business. Now they can add bodyguard.&quot; Others noted that Deng \u2013 a volleyball player in her school days \u2013 had not just spiked the pie-thrower, she had also lifted the share price of News Corporation. Several posters said the incident had changed their views of Deng, who had tended to divide opinion in China. Deng was born in 1968 in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province. True to the Maoist spirit of that age her father \u2013 an engineer \u2013 named her Wenge (meaning cultural revolution). She changed it in her teens when a more open and international mood took hold. In 1987 she met Jake Cherry, a businessman from Los Angeles who was in China to establish a freezer-making factory. He and his wife, Joyce, sponsored Deng&apos;s visa to the US where, according to a 2000 profile in the Wall Street Journal, she shared a bedroom with their five-year-old daughter. Jake Cherry divorced his wife and in 1990 married Deng who had enrolled in California State University at Northridge. The marriage ended after less than three years but that was long enough for Deng to secure a green card and live in the US as a resident alien. Deng joined Star TV, part of News Corporation, as an intern in 1996. Reports on how she met Rupert Murdoch differ. One version has it that they were introduced at a party in 1998; another that she worked as his interpretor in Shanghai and Beijing. Rupert divorced his wife, Anna, a year later. Deng translates for her husband and acts as an intermediary or representative for many of his businesses on the mainland. The couple were reported to have bought a house in Beijing in 2004 for 30m yuan (\u00a32.9m), which was at the time the most expensive courtyard home sold in the capital. Although Deng is admired for her looks, her language skills and a spectacular social climb from a modest home, she is sometimes derided as a family wrecker and gold-digger. That view is being revised. &quot;I never used to like Deng because I thought she was too materialistic, but I like her now,&quot; said a blogger under the name Jixunli. The celebrity focus on Deng by bloggers contrasts with the political approach of the state media, who have tried to use the hacking scandal to score points against the western media. &quot;This incident directly exposes the inherent money-seeking nature of western media today, and the false nature of the concepts of &apos;freedom&apos;, &apos;impartiality&apos; and &apos;human rights&apos; that they have long bandied about,&quot; noted Xinhua news agency in an opinion piece. &quot;As the scandal has continued to develop, it has become a major assault on the model of media supervision and control in the west.&quot; Editorial control in China, however, is ultimately concentrated in the hands of the propaganda department, which faces less scrutiny, accountability and competition. &quot;The Xinhua piece itself, stripped of all nuance and serving the narrow objectives of China&apos;s Marxist view of journalism, is an illustration of much that is wrong with Chinese journalism,&quot; noted David Bandurski on the China Media Project website.", "tags": ["Rupert Murdoch", "China", "Media", "Phone hacking", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Press intrusion"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-20T09:54:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2011/jul/21/fake-apple-store", "sentences": ["She looked up Apple&apos;s official China site and lo - Apple has only four stores in China, two of which are in Beijing and two in Shanghai."], "title": "China's fake Apple stores: photos", "article": "A fascinating discovery by 27-year-old American abirdabroad, who works for a public health organisation in the rapidly developing city of Kunming, southern China.

One of three fake Apple stores in Kunming, China. Photo: birdabroad, used with permission     Grey slate floors, steel staircases, wood benches and staff in branded blue t-shirts. Everything appears routinely Apple. But look more closely and some of the branding is a little off (Apple doesn&apos;t write &apos;Apple Stoer&apos; [sic] under its logo) and the staff badges didn&apos;t have individual names. Those staff did, after a little gentle interrogation, appear to think they were working for the real Apple. But otherwise an astonishing piece of extreme bootlegging.  Our intrepid blogger was suspicious; although Kunming is typical of China&apos;s rapid development it is relatively remote. She looked up Apple&apos;s official China site and lo - Apple has only four stores in China, two of which are in Beijing and two in Shanghai. &quot;Being the curious types that we are, we struck up some conversation with these salespeople who, hand to God, all genuinely think they work for Apple,&quot; she wrote.  &quot;I tried to imagine the training that they went to when they were hired, in which they were pitched some big speech about how they were working for this innovative, global company \u2013 when really they&apos;re just filling the pockets of some shyster living in a prefab mansion outside the city by standing around a fake store disinterestedly selling what may or may not be actual Apple products that fell off the back of a truck somewhere.&quot; That&apos;s an interesting point - whether the owners of this store had wholesaled genuine Apple products or, as seems more likely, were selling fake products too. Either way you can be sure that Apple&apos;s brand protection team is already rolling out the big guns. This fake Apple store clearly took a significant investment, which means there must be serious money to be made by trading off the Apple brand. And Apple will expect to reap every penny of that itself. After all, it has those sky-rocketing revenues to protect. \u2022 Update: The Wall Street Journal has managed to speak to one of the store employees by phone, who said they are aware that the store isn&apos;t official but that the products are authentic. &quot;It doesn&apos;t make much of a difference for us whether we&apos;re authorised or not,&quot; he said. &quot;I just care that what I sell every day are authentic Apple products, and that our customers don&apos;t come back to me to complain about the quality of the products.&quot; WSJ suggested that the store could apply to become an authorised reseller, but it&apos;s questionable whether Apple would grant that given such a flagrant attempt to pass itself off as the genuine thing. \u2022 We asked Apple for any comment on whether it had started investigating these stores: it declined to comment. \u2022 Another update: the BBC has reported that authorities have moved to shut some fake Apple stores down.

Bleasdale, a 19-year-old pole vaulter who recently broke Kate Dennison&apos;s British record, sealed victory with a best clearance of 4.55m. Okoye, also 19 and who recently broke Perris Wilkins&apos;s 13-year-old British discus record, took gold with 60.70m. Great Britain finished the championships in second place with 19 medals. The open-water swimmers Dan Fogg and Tom Allen missed out on qualification for the Games, finishing outside the top 10 at the world championships. Fogg, 23, finished 15th, while the teenager Allen came home in 26th. Fogg and Allen will continue to chase the two slots available. 9 Work begins on Horse Guards Parade More than 100 trucks have delivered 2,274 tons of sand, as Horse Guards Parade near St James&apos;s Park prepares for next month&apos;s FIVB Beach Volleyball International \u2013 a London 2012 test event.

Another 200 people have been taken to hospital following the accident which occurred after the first train lost power due to a lightning strike and was then hit from the back by another bullet train following it, according to state television. A preliminary investigation by the Zhejiang provincial government showed that four coaches of the moving train fell off the viaduct, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The cars plunged about 20-30 metres from the elevated section of track. Several other carriages were derailed in the accident near Wenzhou, 860 miles south of Beijing. Both trains were headed for the coastal city of Fuzhou; one from Beijing, the other from Zhejiang&apos;s provincial capital, Hangzhou. &quot;The train suddenly shook violently, casting luggage all around,&quot; Xinhua quoted survivor Liu Hongtao as saying. &quot;Passengers cried for help but no crew responded.&quot; The total power failure rendered useless an electronic safety system designed to warn following trains of stalled trains on the tracks and automatically halt them before a collision can occur. Railways minister Sheng Guangzu ordered an in-depth investigation of the accident. China&apos;s government has spent billions of dollars improving the railway network of the world&apos;s most populous country and has said it plans to spend $120bn (\u00a373bn) a year over several years on railway construction. The vast network has been hit by a series of scandals and safety incidents over the past few months. Three railway officials have been investigated for corruption so far this year, and in February Liu Zhijun was sacked as railways minister for &quot;serious disciplinary violations&quot;.

The Fat Years, set in a China of 2011, appeared in Hong Kong in 2009. At first glance, it might seem that history has overtaken Chan Koonchung&apos;s book, since the terrible events it describes have not come to pass. But in fact, the book&apos;s central theme remains as valid as when Chan wrote it. Despite being officially banned, the novel has enjoyed a considerable underground audience in mainland China, even becoming a smart item for society hostesses to give to guests, as Julia Lovell notes in her illuminating preface. The Fat Years remains valid because it is not simply a &quot;what might happen&quot; exercise in futurism. Its central conceit \u2013 that collective amnesia overtakes the entire country \u2013 is an all-encompassing metaphor for today&apos;s looming superpower and the question that lies behind its material renaissance since the 1980s \u2013 namely, whether a booming economy and an increasingly free individual society can be contained within the political straitjacket of a one-party system that seeks to retain all the levers of power for itself. The novel&apos;s starting point is that a month has gone missing from the official record and from popular memory in a China which bestrides the globe economically, right down to owning Starbucks. Something terrible took place during the vanished month, but the regime, through nefarious means that are only revealed at the end\u00a0of the novel, has managed to\u00a0effect\u00a0a state of near total\u00a0forgetfulness. The central character, Old Chen, sets out to find what happened and to understand why everybody is so extraordinarily happy, as he himself is at the start of the book, living in Happiness Village Number Two, and content in the realisation that China has enjoyed continuing growth and ever greater social harmony while the west has wilted after the economic tsunami of 2008. The person who sets him on this quest is an old flame he meets by chance, Little Xi, an online dissident with an obnoxious Party-lining son. They join with others who question the country&apos;s euphoric condition. They meet characters who have made it materially and those who have suffered \u2013 on the one side, a real estate tycoon, a jetsetting political adviser and a high-price prostitute; on the other, an underground Christian and a former slave worker. To conclude their investigation, they kidnap a senior official and he spills the beans as to what lies behind the &quot;fat years&quot;. The theme of collective memory loss is particularly apposite in a country where the past is manipulated by those in power and where no public discussion of the official version of, say, the events of 1989 is permitted. Whether a nation can progress without confronting its own past is a question that hovers over the country, which again adds to the novel&apos;s pertinence. Sitting in the comfortable west, it is easy for critics of China to be censorious about the way so many people accept the rush for wealth accumulation and close an eye to the regime&apos;s political record and its human rights abuses. But the crude fact is that, after a terrible century and a quarter up \u00a0to 1978, in which China went through the worst protracted experience of any nation in history, the present era may, indeed, seem like the &quot;fat years&quot;. To touch on so many issues, either directly or by implication, in such a compelling narrative is a triumph, abetted by an excellent translation by Michael Duke. One can only hope that Chan, who was born in Shanghai and raised in Hong Kong, continues to write about the China of today from his\u00a0current vantage point in Beijing. That will, in its way, be a test of whether the warnings of The Fat Years come true. We can only hope not.

With time rapidly running out, El-Erian believes the dispute \u2013 carried out in full view of an anxious world \u2013 has left investors more wary about America&apos;s prospects. &quot;In most likelihood, a last-minute political compromise will avoid a default but will leave the AAA rating extremely vulnerable,&quot; said El-Erian, whose company is the world&apos;s biggest bond trader. &quot;The country can ill-afford to lose the confidence of large foreign holders of US Treasury bonds, overseas manufacturers with factories here, those that use the dollar as the reserve currency, and the many who have outsourced to here the intermediation of their hard-earned savings and pensions,&quot; added El-Erian, writing in the Huffington Post. Stock markets fell worldwide on disappointment that a deal has still not been reached, but predictions of heavy losses had not been fulfilled by noon.

Deadline looming Having reached its current debt ceiling of $14.3tn (\u00a38.7tn), America is likely to run out of money on 2 August unless Democrats and Republicans vote to raise it. Talks broke down on Friday night, with the two sides still unable to agree on a plan to address America&apos;s debts. Republicans accuse President Obama of undermining the talks by pushing for higher taxes, prompting UK business secretary Vince Cable to blame &quot;a few rightwing nutters in the American Congress&quot; for the crisis. Traders had been braced for heavy losses, fearing that the prospect of America defaulting on its debt could trigger a new phase of the economic crisis. China&apos;s Shanghai Composite index did fall sharply, losing 2.5%, but the impact was more muted in other regions. Japan&apos;s Nikkei closed 0.81% lower. In Europe, the FTSE 100 was down just 9 points at midday at 5925. Investors remained cautious, with the US debt debacle leaving many on the back foot, according to Chris Weston of IG Markets. &quot;With the world&apos;s largest economy now just eight days away from running out of money, once again we&apos;re left looking at the unthinkable proposition that Washington is pushed to default on interest repayments,&quot; said Weston. Gold hit a new record high on Monday morning, touching $1,622 an ounce. Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s has already warned that it could cut the US credit rating this autumn if Congress cannot agree a long-term debt reduction plan.

Two of the five fake Apple stores in the southwestern city of Kumming identified by the writer on the Birdabroad blog last week have since been shut down by Chinese officials, according to a local government website there. But Chinese officials said they would not be taking any action against the other three stores, which like the other two prominently displayed Apple signs and logos, because they did not find any fake Apple products for sale, according to a report by a local newspaper posted on the Kunming city government&apos;s website. Apple has 13 official resellers in Kumming, but no official stores.

The railways ministry has apologised for the collision in eastern Zhejiang province and announced an inquiry. Spokesman Wang Yongping added: &quot;China&apos;s high-speed rail technology is up to date and up to standard, and we still have faith in it.&quot; Internet users attacked the government&apos;s response to the disaster after authorities muzzled media coverage and urged reporters to focus on rescue efforts. &quot;We have the right to know the truth!&quot; wrote one microblogger called kangfu xiaodingdang. &quot;That&apos;s our basic right!&quot; Leaked propaganda directives ordered journalists not to investigate the causes and footage emerged of bulldozers shovelling dirt over carriages. Wang, the railways spokesman, said no one could or would bury the story. He said a colleague told him the wreckage was needed to fill in a muddy ditch to make rescue efforts easier. But Hong Kong University&apos;s China Media Project said propaganda authorities have ordered media not to send reporters to the scene, not to report too frequently and not to link the story to high-speed rail development. &quot;There must be no seeking after the causes [of the accident], rather, statements from authoritative departments must be followed,&quot; said one directive. Another ordered: &quot;No calling into doubt, no development [of further issues], no speculation, and no dissemination [of such things] on personal microblogs!&quot; Officials also ordered more coverage of &quot;extremely moving&quot; stories, such as blood donations, and said the overall theme should be &quot;great love in the face of great disaster&quot;. Beijing sees high-speed rail as a matter of national prestige, highlighting China&apos;s development, but critics appear to see the disaster as symptomatic of the country&apos;s problems. Internet users repeatedly described the crash as a man-made, not a natural disaster, and blamed officials. &quot;When a country is so corrupt that one lightning strike can cause a train crash \u2026 none of us is exempt. China today is a train rushing through a lightning storm \u2026 we are all passengers,&quot; ran one of the most frequently forwarded comments on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo service. The breakneck pace of the massive project had already caused safety concerns. In just a few years Beijing has constructed the world&apos;s largest high-speed network, with 10,500 miles completed or under construction. &quot;Overly rapid development has caused safety issues. This is the result of the irrational behaviour of the former leadership of the ministry of railways,&quot; said Professor Zhao Jian, a prominent critic of high-speed rail at Beijing Jiaotong University. The former railways minister Liu Zhijun, one of the project&apos;s keenest champions, was sacked in February for &quot;serious disciplinary violations&quot; \u2013 a phrase usually indicating corruption allegations. Six carriages were derailed and four of those plunged 20 to 30 metres from a viaduct in Saturday&apos;s crash, when a train stalled after being struck by lightning and was rammed by another one behind it. State media said the power failure knocked out an electronic safety system that should have alerted the second train to the problem. Zhao said the trains should have been equipped with an automatic braking system and that dispatchers should also have been able to halt the second vehicle. Chinese media had already highlighted the problem of lightning strikes after they halted several other trains earlier this month \u2013 including on the recently opened Beijing-Shanghai link. The state-run English language Global Times newspaper said the accident should be &quot;a bloody lesson for the entire railway industry in China&quot;, but said the crash should lead to &quot;safer, not slower, railway transportation&quot;. The Zhejiang crash involved the first-generation high-speed trains, launched four years ago, which have a top speed of 155 mph. The former railways minister said newer trains would travel at 217mph, but after his ousting that was cut to 186mph amid safety and financial concerns. China&apos;s railway system has been regarded as having a generally good safety record, although 72 people died in 2008 when an express train from Beijing to Qingdao derailed.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Rail transport", "Press freedom", "Media", "Asia Pacific", "HS2"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-25T16:24:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/25/london-2012-olympic-games", "sentences": ["Archery: Sara Symington We are having a good year and are making good progress but there is a lot of hard work to be done Athletics: Charles van Commenee We are working hard towards success at London 2012 with a target of eight medals including one gold Swimming: David Sparkes With a year to go an important test for us is the performance at the world championships in Shanghai Badminton: Adrian Christy For many of our squad this will be their first Olympic Games and our coaching team are focused on giving our players every chance to succeed Basketball: Chris Spice We have an important test event at the Olympic Park in August, which will be critical in preparing for 2012 Boxing: Rob McCracken The boxers have shown they can compete with the very best in the world and their results augur well for 2012 Cycling: Dave Brailsford With a year to go we&apos;re well placed and optimistic."], "title": "London 2012: 'Across the board, across all medals we're preparing well'", "article": "Archery: Sara Symington We are having a good year and are making good progress but there is a lot of hard work to be done Athletics: Charles van Commenee We are working hard towards success at London 2012 with a target of eight medals including one gold Swimming: David Sparkes With a year to go an important test for us is the performance at the world championships in Shanghai Badminton: Adrian Christy For many of our squad this will be their first Olympic Games and our coaching team are focused on giving our players every chance to succeed Basketball: Chris Spice We have an important test event at the Olympic Park in August, which will be critical in preparing for 2012 Boxing: Rob McCracken The boxers have shown they can compete with the very best in the world and their results augur well for 2012 Cycling: Dave Brailsford With a year to go we&apos;re well placed and optimistic.

Wednesday&apos;s events to mark the milestone, which will see the \u00a3269m Zaha Hadid designed Aquatics Centre formally handed over to organisers by the Olympic Delivery Authority and Tom Daley diving into the pool, will have an air of celebration. &quot;Marking one year to go, by diving in the Aquatics Centre is an incredible honour. Only a few years ago, this was a distant dream,&quot; said Daley, who finished fifth at the world championships in Shanghai on Sunday. &quot;I can&apos;t wait for next year and the honour of representing Team GB.&quot; But although world class athletes are beginning to test the venues, there remains much to do. Venues The Aquatics Centre is the sixth and final permanent venue to be handed over to organisers by the ODA, which has spent \u00a37.25bn of public money building them. Chairman John Armitt said the successful completion of the venues had helped boost the image of British contractors around the world. &quot;It&apos;s very satisfying to be handing it over on time and keeping within the budget. It&apos;s a great tribute to everybody that has played a part in this,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;It is something that as a country and an industry we should be proud of and we should try to maximise opportunities in other parts of the world while memories are still fresh about what the industry can do.&quot; Some venues, especially the velodrome that has already been nominated for the Stirling Prize, have garnered more plaudits than others. The clean lines and simplicity of the stadium have also been praised but there has been criticism of the ugly temporary &quot;water wings&quot; that have been attached to the aquatics centre to boost the capacity to 17,500 for the Games. When it was designed, the high cost was justified by the signature design, which will be obscured by the temporary stands. &quot;When you&apos;re inside it, it&apos;s fabulous,&quot; says Armitt, diplomatically. Despite outward appearances, the London organising committee still has a huge task. Each venue must be &quot;fitted out&quot;, a task that includes the laying of the track in the main stadium, and several major temporary venues must be built from scratch. They include a 15,000 capacity hockey stadium, a 23,000 capacity arena for the equestrian events at Greenwich Park and a 15,000 seat bowl on Horseguard&apos;s Parade for the beach volleyball. Tickets London organising committee chief executive Paul Deighton has confirmed the last batch of 1.2m tickets that will go on sale from December will first be made available exclusively to those who took part in the initial ballot in April and have yet to get a ticket. Around 6m tickets have already been sold, considered unprecedented with a year to go, with only around 1.5m for football matches around the country and those final 1.2m across all sports \u2013 to be made available when the final seating configurations are decided \u2013 remaining. Next year, Locog also plans to sell &quot;non-event tickets&quot; which will allow entry to the park but not the venues. Later this year, millions of free tickets for the live sites, with big screens and concerts in Hyde Park, Victoria Park and Potter&apos;s Fields will also be made available on a first come, first served basis. The mantra from Locog chairman Lord Coe and other organisers has been that while they understand the &quot;disappointment&quot; created by the huge demand, which saw 22m applications in the initial rush for tickets, they stand by the controversial process. Transport Ever since London was awarded the Games in 2005, transport has been considered a potential achilles heel. The ODA passed responsibility for operational matters to Transport for London last year, but retains an overall co-ordination role. The first stirrings of a backlash have already been felt about the so-called &quot;Olympic lanes&quot; that will whisk 18,000 athletes and officials around the capital during the Games. They make up roughly a third of the 109-mile Olympic Route Network and have already sparked loud protests from London&apos;s black cab drivers. Meanwhile, much will rest on the ability of organisers to persuade businesses and individuals to modify their behaviour during the Games. &quot;The message must be business as unusual,&quot; said Armitt. They take some comfort from the variety of routes into Stratford, including the Jubilee Line and the new Javelin train from St Pancras, but will be desperate to avoid a millennium eve style meltdown. On the nine busiest days of the Games there will be more than 1m Olympics-related journeys, with a report earlier this year warning of &quot;extreme&quot; conditions on a system already &quot;creaking at the seams&quot;. Security Olympics minister Hugh Robertson said that security plans needed rethinking when the coalition came to power. Before she quit, Lady Neville-Jones led a government review that resulted in the government predicting security at Games time could be delivered for \u00a3475m, though the overall \u00a3600m envelope will be retained. Ministers and organisers have sought to play down the significance of the resignation of Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, but he said in his own statement that a key reason for it was to allow time to get someone new in place for the Olympics. Locog will spend \u00a3282m on security within the venues, chiefly through contractor G4S, but there will also need to call on several thousand non-uniformed military personnel. &apos;Look and feel&apos; For all the operational challenges Coe&apos;s organising committee will face, in many ways the bigger challenge is building public enthusiasm for the Games to reach a crescendo around 27 July next year when the flame is lit. Coe has talked of Britain being a &quot;slow burn&quot; nation. He hopes the torch relay, which will begin at Land&apos;s End on 19 May and visit 74 locations in 70 days via 8,000 runners, will be the point at which cynicism is cast aside and enthusiasm ignites. Part of the task will be to keep those without tickets engaged, through the big screens planned for cities throughout the country and cultural events that will culminate in Festival 2012. London mayor Boris Johnson has a budget to &quot;dress&quot; key areas of the city, including placing Olympic rings on the capital&apos;s landmarks. The BBC, which has promised to broadcast every event from every venue live, will also have a big role to play. Legacy Given the relatively smooth progress of organisers to date, much of the controversy has centred on the legacy claims that helped secure the Games in the first place. The Olympic Park Legacy Company has taken on responsibility for the park after the Games and must prove it can make a commercial success of it while meeting the needs of local residents. The fate of the stadium, the object of a furious row between Spurs and West Ham, is mired in high court litigation and it will face searching scrutiny over the affordability of thousands of homes that will be left behind, partly the athletes village. One of the biggest challenges for the OPLC will be finding a tenant for the cavernous media centre, although there are renewed hopes that a major broadcaster may take an interest. But even more of a challenge is the &quot;soft legacy&quot;, with figures showing that the number of people playing sport is resolutely refusing to budge and ongoing debate about whether the predicted opportunity to get more young people engaged in sport, build links between clubs and schools and raise the profile and quality of coaching, is really being seized. They were famously planting the trees in Athens the day before the opening ceremony, but the landscaping on the Olympic Park is starting to take shape. More than 4,000 new trees are planned, with 1,500 already planted. Over 300,000 wetland plants have been planted and there are bold claims for the Park that will be left behind. Eventually, there will be up to 11,000 new homes on the site, in the heart of an area that the Olympic Park Legacy Company hopes will be resurgent. Westfield, the giant shopping mall at the entrance to the Park and on which politicians are relying for many of their legacy claims about jobs and regeneration, opens for business in September.", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "International Olympic Committee", "Tom Daley", "Lord Coe", "Sport", "London", "Transport", "UK news", "Boris Johnson", "London politics", "Transport policy", "Politics", "Zaha Hadid", "Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture", "Construction industry", "Business", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-26T17:47:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/26/eli-roth-horror-movies", "sentences": ["The director of Hostel (&quot;the goriest, sickest, bloodiest movie you&apos;ll ever see&quot;, according to one critic) has been hard at work near Shanghai."], "title": "Eli Roth: new blood", "article": "Eli Roth has just been to China. The &quot;gore hero of modern times&quot; (as Roth was recently labelled at the Neuch\u00e2tel International Fantastic film festival in Switzerland) is, at least for now, leaving torture chambers behind and embracing martial arts. The director of Hostel (&quot;the goriest, sickest, bloodiest movie you&apos;ll ever see&quot;, according to one critic) has been hard at work near Shanghai. &quot;Basically, it&apos;s a kung fu Star Wars movie,&quot; Roth explains of The Man With the Iron Fist, which stars his friend Russell Crowe. Roth co-wrote the screenplay with the RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan, and produced the film (which the RZA is directing). Roth hasn&apos;t actually directed a film since Hostel Part II in 2007. He explains that\u00a0he has been working on his screenplay for Endangered Species, a high-concept apocalyptic thriller whose storyline he refuses to reveal. He took time off from that project to act, co-starring as &quot;the Bear Jew&quot; in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Inglourious Basterds and has also been busy producing such films as The Last Exorcism and Chilean horror/earthquake film Aftershock. &quot;When you direct a movie, for me it is truly all-encompassing,&quot; Roth explains. &quot;I am involved in every aspect of the movie right up to the publicity. It&apos;s a roll of the dice that all comes down to one weekend where you might be up against another movie that&apos;s a hit, or the weather might be bad, or the poster is not great.&quot; Roth has seen his stock rise and rise in Hollywood. He may still bristle at being called a purveyor of &quot;torture porn&quot;, but is clearly proud of the massive blood infusion he managed to\u00a0give the horror film. &quot;It&apos;s very flattering to feel like you actually helped create a sub-genre,&quot; he says. &quot;People said: &apos;You made torture porn.&apos; I said: &apos;No, I made a drama.&apos; The truth is, all that fed into my character in Inglourious Basterds. When I came out of that cave, everyone said, &apos;Wow, if that&apos;s what he did to American backpackers [in Hostel], what&apos;s he going to do to the Nazis?&apos;&quot; A psychoanalyst&apos;s son from Newton, Massachusetts, Roth doesn&apos;t conform to stereotypes of exploitation directors: those neurotic, pale-skinned sorts lurking in the shadows. Personable, articulate, and with bulging muscles, he looks more like a Baywatch bodyguard than the outsider who would get sand kicked in his eyes. He became a tabloid property last year thanks to a brief relationship with Peaches Geldof. (The pair split in\u00a0November.) Recently, Roth was back in the news\u00a0when a paper picked up on an allegedly antisemitic Tweet that Russell Crowe had sent him. &quot;Crowe was asking me about circumcision,&quot; says Roth. &quot;Then, he writes, &apos;Oh, I love Jewish people, the\u00a0apples and the honey and the funny little hats \u2013 just stop butchering your babies.&apos; I thought it was hilarious. I knew Russell was joking. I wrote back to him saying, &apos;I was re-cutting you all afternoon.&apos; I had been in the editing room with Iron Fist. We were two friends teasing each other \u2013 as we do pretty much every day on Twitter.&quot; The next morning, there were stories about Crowe&apos;s &quot;antisemitic rant&quot;, claiming that Crowe had attacked Jewish director Roth. Roth was so angry that he immediately went on Twitter to refute the allegations. &quot;Twitter is wonderful,&quot; he says. &quot;You can kill rumours instantly. Crowe&apos;s from a different generation. He&apos;s not using it in the way I am. He is joking around on it. He&apos;s not reading other people&apos;s tweets. He is not like me, who is totally into it and knowing how it affects 100 different websites.&quot; Crowe plays a character named Jacknife, in The Man With the Iron Fist. &quot;You think he is just a stranger passing through town, but in the opening scene he makes a very big statement with his knife. The whole movie wasn&apos;t on Crowe&apos;s shoulders, so he was free just to step in and go completely insane \u2026 he just went wild with it.&quot; Roth has no further acting roles on the horizon. He is not involved in Tarantino&apos;s new spaghetti western Django Unchained: &quot;I don&apos;t think I am going to be playing a slave in the 1800s in America.&quot; Since the Hostel films, other directors have been pushing the horror genre in an equally extreme direction. Arguably the most divisive movie of last year among genre aficionados was A Serbian Film, about a retired porn star lured into taking one last role in the most hardcore film he has ever made. I ask Roth if he\u00a0has seen it. &quot;For me, the first 45 minutes were the most interesting part,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn&apos;t have any moral problem because it was just a movie with makeup and special effects. It was interesting that it was a comment on life in Serbia. But, as a film, it went so far in the violence that I stopped believing people&apos;s behaviour was real.\u00a0The reaction to it is like the reaction to Human Centipede II. Come\u00a0on, guys. It&apos;s just a movie. We&apos;re adults. We can handle it!&quot; You can&apos;t help but notice the irony in his answer. For a moment, as he frets\u00a0about the extremity of the violence, he sounds just like one of those shocked critics watching Hostel for the first time. Then again, Roth can\u00a0cope.", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Horror"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-26T20:45:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/27/debt-crisis-republicans-plan-bungle", "sentences": ["Folks here are shocked by the dysfunctional US political system,&quot; he tweeted from Shanghai."], "title": "Debt crisis: Republicans scramble to rewrite plan following figures bungle", "article": "The US debt crisis has escalated after Republicans were forced to rewrite their proposal to lift the debt ceiling, because they miscalculated how much the original plan would cut spending. In an embarrassing development for John Boehner, the Republican Congress speaker, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) ruled on Tuesday night that his bill would have only cut spending by $850bn (\u00a3517bn)over the next decade, not the $1.2tn he had aimed for. Republicans are now racing to rewrite the legislation, and have pushed back a congressional vote on the plan from Wednesday to Thursday at the earliest. Although Boehner was already struggling to find support for his package, the delay increases the risk that Washington will fail to agree a deal to raise the debt ceiling before 2 August, when the federal government is expected to run out of money. The dollar dropped against other currencies on Wednesday morning as investors faced the possibility that America could default. Several economists believe the country will lose its AAA credit rating within months, which would push up its borrowing costs, even if the $14.3tn debt ceiling is increased in time. Stock markets also fell heavily, with the FTSE 100 index down by 76 points, or 1.3%, in afternoon trading at 5852. The Dow Jones index fell 128 points in early trading on Wall Street, to 12373. The White House said on Tuesday it was working with Congress to devise a &quot;Plan B&quot; that might attract enough support. The two sides have been deeply divided for weeks, with Republicans demanding deep spending cuts and Democrats anxious to include tax rises as a major part of the deal. The US people may be losing patience with their political leaders. The congressional telephone system was swamped with calls from the public on Tuesday, coming close to collapse. The websites of several members of Congress have crashed this week, after president Obama urged Americans to make their voices heard. Across the globe, there is growing astonishment that the world&apos;s biggest economy is on the brink of a technical default because its elected leaders cannot hammer out a deal. Nouriel Roubini, the leading economics professor, said there was disbelief in China. &quot;Biggest concern in meetings in Hong Kong: will the US default on its debt? Folks here are shocked by the dysfunctional US political system,&quot; he tweeted from Shanghai. Traders are braced for the debt ceiling negotiations to go right to the wire. &quot;Equity markets remain on the back foot as the US debt impasse continues to dominate the agenda. The political spat continues and as a result the expectation is that negotiations will be ongoing into next week, right up to that August 2nd deadline,&quot; said Chris Weston, Institutional trader at IG Markets. Complacency rules, ok? Analysts have suggested that America may have more time to resolve the crisis than the government has admitted, with Barclays Capital calculating that the country might be able to function until 10 August before needing to borrow again. The yield, or interest rates, on US 10-year bonds remained below 3% on Wednesday \u2013 meaning America still enjoys some of the cheapest borrowing costs of any country. There are indications, though, that investors are becoming more anxious, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) volatility index, which tracks Wall Street confidence, rising by 4.5%. &quot;We are finally seeing a little bit of risk priced in, but not a lot is being priced in yet,&quot; said Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners. &quot;There&apos;s still complacency ... I don&apos;t think anyone expects this to go wrong.&quot; One possibility is that Obama could approve a short-term rise in the debt ceiling while Congress wrestles with a long-term fiscal plan. &quot;The can would then be being kicked down the road in the States as well as in Europe,&quot; said Cooper, referring to the eurozone&apos;s own debt problems. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that banks are now holding on to more cash, bolstering their liquidity levels in preparation for a US credit rating downgrade that could potentially prompt a second credit crunch. &quot;We&apos;ve been here before, post-Lehman Brothers, and we don&apos;t want to be there again,&quot; commented Cooper. The wrangling over the debt ceiling could do long-term damage to America&apos;s economic credibility, warned Christopher Molumphy, chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group. &quot;The lack of a credible long-term solution would likely raise questions about the creditworthiness of the US, push up the cost of capital for private and public borrowers and thus prove a further impediment to economic recovery. There is still time for a deal to be reached on raising the debt ceiling, but continued doubts about a longer-term solution to the US&apos;s federal deficit may well threaten the country&apos;s AAA credit rating and the status of US Treasuries as assets previously perceived as virtually &apos;risk-free&apos;, and against which many other products are gauged,&quot; said Molumphy.", "tags": ["US economy", "Economics", "Business", "Global economy", "Global recession", "John Boehner", "US Congress", "US news", "US politics", "World news", "Republicans"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-27T09:07:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/28/chinese-rail-crash-wen-jiabao", "sentences": ["Earlier the head of the Shanghai Railway Bureau said that a signal had turned green instead of red when the first train stopped near Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, and that dispatchers did not alert the second train to the obstacle."], "title": "Chinese rail crash: premier visits site amid mounting anger", "article": "     The Chinese government has sought to calm mounting anger over Saturday&apos;s fatal high-speed rail disaster, with officials blaming signalling design flaws and Wen Jiabao pledging &quot;a probe that will withstand the test of history&quot; as he visited the site. The premier said he had not travelled there earlier due to illness, an extremely unusual comment in a country where the health of leaders is one of the most sensitive topics. He promised to get to the bottom of the crash, in which at least 39 people died and more than 190 were injured, whether mechanical, manufacturing or management causes were to blame. &quot;If corruption is found to be behind this, we must handle it according to the law and not be soft. Only in this way can we be fair to those who have died,&quot; he said in a rare press conference. Earlier the head of the Shanghai Railway Bureau said that a signal had turned green instead of red when the first train stopped near Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, and that dispatchers did not alert the second train to the obstacle. The Beijing National Railway Research and Design Institute of Signals and Communications stepped forward to shoulder the blame, apologising for the equipment problems in a statement. It said it would &quot;have the courage to assume responsibility and accept the punishment deserved.&quot; But it is remains unclear whether other safety systems were in place and whether dispatchers were even aware the first train had halted. Wen told reporters that he had not been able to visit the scene earlier. &quot;I was ill and spent 11 days in bed in hospital. Today [Thursday] the doctor reluctantly allowed me to travel,&quot; said the 68-year-old leader, who will retire next year. He offered no further details of his illness. Some users on Sina&apos;s Weibo microblog posted pictures or details of meetings he had held in the last week, although all of those took place in Beijing. But most users praised him for travelling to the crash site and for his concern for victims. Known as &quot;Grandpa Wen&quot; to admirers, he is seen as the sympathetic face of the government and often attends disaster scenes. But the decision to hold a press conference, and the strength of his comments, demonstrate the government&apos;s concern at the public reaction to the crash and its handling. Wen acknowledged: &quot;After the accident occurred, society and the public had many suspicions about the cause of the accident and the way it was handled. &quot;I believe that we should earnestly listen to the public&apos;s views, treat them seriously and provide the public with a responsible explanation.&quot; Mainstream media have pursued the story aggressively despite propaganda edicts warning them not to report too frequently or cover the causes. An editorial on the front page of the People&apos;s Daily, the official party newspaper, warned on Thursday that China should say no to &quot;blood-smeared GDP&quot;. The Twitter-like Sina Weibo service has also carried millions of comments about the crash, many attacking authorities for their handling of the aftermath. State media reported that more than 100 relatives of crash victims protested outside a railway station on Wednesday, demanding the &quot;true cause&quot; of the crash. The Global Times said several also complained that it was inappropriate to discuss compensation before the investigation was complete. &quot;I believe there was human error behind the accident. The authorities should not hide anything from the public,&quot; Wang Hui, who lost her husband in the disaster, told the newspaper. Another protester who lost his brother, told the Yangcheng Evening News: &quot;After such a big thing has happened, the railway departments cannot hide while they let local government deal with it and solve it. They are slow and won&apos;t show their faces. Is it the government that wants to protect them, or has the government been threatened by them?&quot; Wen also called for a two-month rail safety campaign, announced after the crash, to be widened to deal with all transport infrastructure, coal mines, construction sites, and industries dealing with dangerous chemicals.", "tags": ["Wen Jiabao", "China", "Rail transport", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-28T13:48:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/28/china-fast-train-to-disaster", "sentences": ["Corruption also kills: it killed children in Sichuan in 2008 when their schools collapsed, and migrant workers in Shanghai last year when their apartment building became a deadly inferno; it killed babies who were given poisoned milk, drivers on collapsing bridges and thousands each year with vegetables irrigated with contaminated water."], "title": "China is on the fast train to disaster | Isabel Hilton", "article": "China&apos;s high-speed rail network seemed to symbolise the nation&apos;s unstoppable rise: since the first line opened in 2007, it has built more than 6,000 miles of track and seemed poised to spread the magic into overseas markets, bidding aggressively against established international players. Yet this week, families were mourning the 39 dead and tending the 200 injured in Saturday&apos;s crash, the latest and worst episode in the high-speed rail fiasco. A project said to show China was poised for leadership in advanced technologies is collapsing in death, anger and embarrassment. How it went so badly wrong carries some dark lessons for China. It&apos;s a story of corruption and corner-cutting and of responsibility passed around an opaque and untouchable bureaucracy. It is also a lesson in a nationalistic habit of &quot;digesting&quot; foreign technology, as one railway official put it, then changing it, so as to claim the result as a Chinese invention. The lines have been plagued by breakdowns; the track, according to foreign experts, is substandard and likely to crack. The railway minister has been sacked and is under investigation for corruption, and costs have tripled. Bloggers claim the government is more intent on a cover up than an investigation. These are not the only chickens coming home to roost. A series of scandals has wiped millions off the share price of several Chinese companies. Revelations of fraudulent accounting in China have shattered investor confidence. As with the rail, this has raised questions: without more accountability and transparency, is China really ready to take the next, difficult steps? How can a system that allows so little objective analysis ever achieve that accountability? These are questions that matter as much to China&apos;s partners as they do to the government. Corruption has destroyed confidence in China&apos;s prestige projects. Corruption also kills: it killed children in Sichuan in 2008 when their schools collapsed, and migrant workers in Shanghai last year when their apartment building became a deadly inferno; it killed babies who were given poisoned milk, drivers on collapsing bridges and thousands each year with vegetables irrigated with contaminated water. Corruption was a prominent theme in President Hu Jintao&apos;s speech to the Communist party&apos;s recent 90th birthday celebrations, as it has been in almost every leader&apos;s speech for decades. Yet the conditions that make such corruption endemic remain untouched: the monopoly of power in the hands of an untouchable institution. The prosecution of individuals, however high-profile the trials, has done nothing to change that. China&apos;s 30-year economic rise has been impressive, but suspicion over basic data makes it all but impossible to determine how sustainable it is. The boastful speed of railway construction recalls the Great Leap Forward in the late 50s, when officials were set absurd targets for food production and duly reported them met. Some 30 million people starved to death. The leadership&apos;s response to each of these disasters has been the same: to suppress discussion, silence the victims and paint itself as the solution, not the problem. Last week, when local witnesses protested that railway officials had hastily buried wrecked carriages, there was indignation but little surprise. China Digital Times reported that the central propaganda department had instructed the media that they &quot;must speedily report whatever information is released by the Railway Ministry&quot;. Unless systemic lessons are learned, there is more to fear. China is embarking on the world&apos;s biggest and fastest expansion of nuclear power.

With Wednesday marking one year until the Games, London was awash with celebrities and medal hopefuls. Events kicked off with the official handing over of the \u00a3269m Aquatics Centre in the Olympic Park, the last of the six permanent venues to be completed. In Horse Guards Parade David Cameron played a spot of beach volleyball, while at St Pancras Station, Lord Coe, chairman of the organising committee, and Colin Jackson, a silver medallist in the 110m hurdles at Seoul in 1988, were having their famous feet cast to represent &quot;the first steps to the Games&quot;. David Bond, who won a sailing gold medal at the 1948 London Olympics, reminded everyone that the Games will affect the rest of the country too, unveiling the Royal Mail&apos;s Olympic plans in Cornwall, which will include issuing a stamp for every gold medal won by Britain. Later in the evening all eyes were back on the Aquatics Centre, where the 17-year-old medal hopeful Tom Daley completed the pool&apos;s first dive during the evening ceremony. The International Olympic Committee&apos;s president, Jacques Rogge, was next to take centre stage, officially inviting the world to attend the 2012 Games, before Boris Johnson brought proceedings to a close, the London mayor leaving us with a customarily effervescent take on the new Olympic pool: &quot;Is it not mind-blowing? It is an architectural poem; it&apos;s a sinuous wave of beauty. That water looks good enough to drink. It is gin-clear.&quot; 3) Tweet of the Week &quot;little bit strange when you ring the surgery to check your vaccinations and they begin congratulating you on your season&quot; \u2013 Dai Greene. 4) Lord Coe names his greatest Olympians  Lord Coe gave his verdict on the greatest Olympic athletes of all time in an interview with Sport Magazine. The list included track greats such as Fanny Blankers-Koen, the star of the 1948 London Games, and Jesse Owens, who inspired a generation of black athletes at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Sir Steve Redgrave is chosen for his magnificent feat of five gold medals in five different Games. Coe also mentioned the Romanian gymnast Nadia Comeneci, who achieved a perfect score of 10.00 at Montreal in 1976. However, Lord Coe placed the great British decathlete Daley Thompson at the top of his all-time Olympians, describing the 1980 and 1984 gold medallist as &quot;an extraordinary competitor with unique mental and physical power&quot;. 5) Good week/bad week It was a good week for the American swimmers at the World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, notably Ryan Lochte. The 26-year-old set a world record on his way to gold in the 200m individual medley, and added another gold in the 200m freestyle to reinforce his 2012 medal credentials. It has been a bad week for Shanaze Reade, whose preparations for London 2012 were dealt a blow on Monday when she pulled out of the World BMX Championships in Copenhagen after aggravating a wrist injury. 6) Phelps wins gold at world championships Michael Phelps has been out of form and this trend looked set to continue at Shanghai&apos;s world championships as he finished third in the 400m freestyle relay on Sunday and second in the 200m freestyle on Tuesday. The swimmer who won a record eight gold medals in Beijing was back to form on Wednesday, however, sending an ominous message to his 2012 rivals in holding off Japan&apos;s Takeshi Matsuda to win his first gold of the championships in his favoured 200m butterfly. 7) Medal designs unveiled According to IOC president Jacques Rogge &quot;these beautiful medals will be a fitting reward for the Olympic medallists of 2012&quot;. The design consists of the goddess Nike, who is traditionally present, and several features of the host city including the river Thames. 8) British musicians reveal the Olympic anthem The British rapper Tinchy Stryder and the 15-year-old soul singer Dionne Bromfield have revealed the video for the official Olympics anthem. It involves Stryder driving a Mini over Tower Bridge and close-up shots of the Olympic Torch. 9) Sky Orchestra sets tone for Games If you&apos;re one of those people who wake up on Monday morning with a sinking feeling, you may have been in luck this week. The artist Luke Jerram was behind the Sky Orchestra project, in which hot-air balloons hovered over the London skyline and played scores provided by the award-winning composer Dan Jones. Boris Johnson hailed the stunt as &quot;a stunning preview of the astonishing variety of cultural events and activities&quot; surrounding the countdown to the Games. 10) Things you may have missed on theguardian.com Guardian.co.uk&apos;s guide to the 50 top British medal hopes ... ... a swishy 3D interactive guide to the London 2012 Olympic Park ... ...

Hordes of shoppers, workers, skinny expat wives pushing babies in prams and chic executives scurry across the thoroughfares, threading across some of the most expensive real estate in the world. In the sought-after Pedder Building, with its unusually high ceilings, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has taken a prime retail spot previously occupied by Shanghai Tang, a Chinese luxury brand, and is paying, according to Sir David Tang, a Hong Kong businessman and socialite, &quot;about \u00a35m a year in rent&quot;. State-of-the art shopping malls heave with customers all day long. Brands such as Louis Vuitton employ staff to stagger the queues that stretch around the block. Hong Kong&apos;s affluence began after the British handover in 1997 when borders were relaxed, visas became more easily available and Chinese mainlanders were able to come to spend. The richer China has become, the more they visit Hong Kong to shop. &quot;Luxury brands are forecasting year-on-year growth of 35%,&quot; says Helen Willerton, former managing director of Chlo\u00e9 Asia Pacific. &quot;Mainlanders fly in for a few days, save money on accommodation by staying in three-star hotels, and spend on high-end retail \u2013 watches, jewellery and fashion.&quot; But 14 years after the handover, Hong Kong is no longer just about shopping. Forget designer labels; this city state is experiencing a cultural boom that is proceeding at breakneck speed. The Chinese art market is now the second largest in the world after the US, with a global share of 23%. Hong Kong&apos;s unique position, poised between China and the west, is turning it into a cultural landmark. Gagosian Gallery, which owns spaces in New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris and Rome, opened in the Pedder Building in January. Earlier this month, White Cube announced the launch of its first non-UK space at 50 Connaught Road, close to the Mandarin Oriental hotel favoured by well-heeled westerners and the seriously rich Chinese, and to Tang&apos;s private members&apos; bar and restaurant, the China Club, which contains his unrivalled collection of Chinese contemporary art. Others are bound to follow. Hong Kong&apos;s four-year-old art fair, Art HK, has just sold a 60% stake to MCH Group, parent company of the world&apos;s pre-eminent contemporary art fair, Art Basel. &quot;Basel will change the quality of the art fair,&quot; says Xin Li, Asia business development director at Christie&apos;s. &quot;Also, it&apos;s at the same time as the Christie&apos;s contemporary sale. The Chinese market is young but I&apos;m always surprised \u2013 and I am Chinese \u2013 at how quickly the Chinese learn. They&apos;ll know nothing about [Damien] Hirst and then six months later they&apos;ll know everything.&quot; Whether ordinary Hong Kong citizens benefit directly from the economic boom is a moot point. Extortionate property prices mean tiny apartments and a phenomenal work ethic, and the galleries and art fair are seen to belong to an elite middle class rather than the masses. But &quot;wealth is followed by culture&quot;, says Tang, and western culture is what Hong Kong has been missing and now, it seems, can&apos;t get enough of. Last February, Lars Nittve, former director of Stockholm&apos;s Moderna Museet and one-time head of Tate Modern, was appointed chief director of the M+ museum of contemporary art, which will form part of the West Kowloon Cultural District (WKCD) development. People at all levels of Hong Kong society, it seems, are hungry for culture and galleries. This month&apos;s Hong Kong book fair attracted one million visitors (only 1% of whom were from the mainland), each spending approximately \u00a335 a head on books, with crowds of people attending more than 300 readings and seminars. &quot;They took \u00a335m in six days,&quot; says Tang, who moderated two public forums called &quot;How and What&quot; and &quot;Why do Writers Write?&quot;. Tang&apos;s speakers were David Starkey, Nicholas Coleridge, Tom Parker Bowles and AA\u00a0Gill, and his events were packed out. &quot;Where else do you find that thirst for knowledge, fervour for learning?&quot; he pointed out. &quot;That&apos;s why I do my forums, to give them access to thought.&quot; Starkey agreed, telling the 700 people politely firing questions at him: &quot;When I came into this fair, I couldn&apos;t believe the amount of people. It is inconceivable that this could happen in Britain.&quot; West Kowloon Cultural District is a semi-independent organisation with HK$21.6bn (\u00a31.7bn) in the bank and a chunk of land on which to build, with a master plan to be presented by Norman Foster Associates in September. New venues for existing performance arts groups will be created, but M+ will be a museum built from scratch that will include a permanent collection. &quot;The first phase of building is 43,000 square metres, which should open by 2015,&quot; says Nittve. &quot;The second phase takes us up to 61,000 square metres, but we will have nomadic exhibitions running from early next year.&quot; As well as being a venue where local people &quot;can see the best and most important art of the moment&quot;, Nittve is adamant that M+ is embedded in Hong Kong. &quot;Museums take their character from their environment; look at the Guggenheim in Las Vegas, closed after two years.&quot; The key, he says, is to develop the local art scene rather than concentrating solely on West Kowloon. Non-profit art collective Para/Site has managed to pull off top-quality shows in the kind of space we in the west would describe as a cupboard. But self-confidence has been lacking in the Hong Kong artistic community: they have felt overshadowed by the super-successful Chinese scene, their studio space is limited and expensive (many have their work made on the mainland), and they don&apos;t have anything like the high status of artists in China. Hong Kong artists often have parallel careers as designers and architects and this is not trusted in the west. But the concept of art is shifting, says Nittve \u2013 &quot;video art/cinema is definitely crossover art, on the outskirts of fine art practice, and has been the most creative area in recent years&quot;. Stanley Wong, a successful designer and ad man, is also a practising artist, having shown at the Venice Biennale. &quot;What these artists have lacked is an arena in Hong Kong, a platform that gives them kudos. Most western cities have these places,&quot; Nittve says. Influential players from the art world, including businessman and design enthusiast Victor Lo, gallerist and academic Johnson Chang, and Claire Hsu, founder of Asia Art Archive, which documents Chinese contemporary art practice, were asked to join the M+ advisory board. &quot;They put together a paper that sets the agenda for M+,&quot; says Nittve. &quot;It&apos;s seldom you see a new museum project anywhere in the world that is so well-considered and thought-out.&quot; With the recent appointment of Michael Lynch, chief executive of the South Bank Centre from 2002 to 2009, as chief executive, the West Kowloon Cultural District authority seems likely to achieve its aim of giving Hong Kong the cultural legs it lacks. Lynch says he can see the 40-hectare site from his bath. &quot;I&apos;ve always thought it was a visionary project, but the scale! It&apos;s like building the South Bank from scratch instead of letting it grow over 70 years. I can see how important the cultural centre will be, it&apos;ll change the way this place works. On the contemporary art side, we&apos;re looking straight up the Pearl river delta and that is where the whole world will be looking too.&quot; From Nittve&apos;s window, one can see the construction of the new high-speed railway connecting Hong Kong to the mainland. It will stop 200 metres from M + and drop off 60\u00a0million passengers a year. &quot;At certain points in time, there&apos;s a need for a museum that can reflect the present,&quot; says Nittve. &quot;WKCD will be a manifestation of a shift in the world cultural order.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "The art market", "Art", "World news", "Art and design", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-30T23:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/01/taiwan-protests-venice-film-festival", "sentences": ["In 2010, the Shanghai film festival was forced to cancel plans for a Taipei Film Week after the Taiwanese organisers showed concern that films be described as from &quot;Taiwan, China&quot; \u2013 in effect, implying Taiwan is part of China, rather than an independent entity."], "title": "Taiwan protests Venice film festival's 'China' label", "article": "     A diplomatic row has broken out after the Venice film festival listed the originating country of the Wei Te-Sheng-directed film Seediq Bale as &quot;China and Taiwan&quot;.

It wasn&apos;t easy, and it always hurts, but it seemed much more straightforward.&quot; Fifteen days ago, on 19 July, Payne won the 10km open-water race at the world championships, and a gold medal for Britain that was eventually matched by her room-mate in Shanghai, Rebecca Adlington, who triumphed in the 800m freestyle. Adlington&apos;s victory was riveting but Payne established herself as an emerging star of British swimming by winning an event that can be as brutal as it is raw, as dangerous as it is surreal. Payne coolly details some of her more challenging races over the years, laughing dryly at the memory of stinging sea-creatures, floating animal corpses, menacing shadows lurking in the dark waters below as well as the heavy blows and bloodied noses she has absorbed as a routine part of her lonely trade as a long-distance swimmer. More hysterical observers have compared the gruelling 10km to a form of &quot;underwater boxing&quot; \u2013 for roundhouse swings and busted lips occur often as a packed bunch of swimmers fight their way towards the supposed sanctuary of clear water. Bruising physical contact is usually inadvertent \u2013 but open-water swimmers are sometimes accused of deliberately trying to hold each other back either through an intentional swipe or grasp of an ankle. Yet, apart from the seething competition, less human shapes exude a grisly fascination for followers of this strange event, where it is often hard to pick out which capped head belongs to which pain-riddled swimmer as they plough through choppy seas or murky rivers. &quot;There have been some good stories along the way,&quot; the 23 year-old Payne says. &quot;My first world championships were in Melbourne in 2007 \u2013 and it was only my second open-water swim. We&apos;d been out there the previous December and there was nothing suspicious in the water. But a few months later we returned and on the afternoon before the race it was pretty freaky. We looked down into the sea and there were these huge jellyfish.&quot; On closer inspection it turned out that each jellyfish was around the size of a large dinner plate. &quot;They were that big,&quot; Payne says laconically, before admitting that she suffered a mild panic attack. &quot;It was not good for a while but I had that epiphany. I told myself that if I pulled out, someone stronger would take my place. So I decided there and then to do it. It made me realise that, with the 10k, you are going to be tested. Questions will be asked as to how strong you are and how much you want it. I swam the next day \u2013 but so did everyone else. I was leading for a long way but inexperience kicked in. There were feeding stations and I took on some food at the wrong time. I learned from that.&quot; A year later, in Hong Kong, Payne was spooked to be swimming on the wrong side of the shark nets. &quot;I thought we&apos;d be swimming on the safe side, but they said they&apos;d only seen one shark in 10 years. I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;ve got a phobia of sharks, but I guess it&apos;s more the unknown that freaks you out.&quot; Payne was tested again that year, just before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when she swam in a race down the Xin Jinhe river in Shantou, China. &quot;There were dead animals in the river. They were mostly dogs but some were horses. We swam in the middle and they were along the edge. It&apos;s a funny story now, but open-water swimming is like that and you have to deal with it.&quot; A few months later Payne led the Olympics for 9,950m \u2013 before being overtaken in the last 50m by a Russian rival, Larisa Ilchenko. Payne was still justifiably proud of her silver medal. But in a less significant race the following summer she felt less gratified when plunging into the Hudson in New York. The dirty water was so churned up by passing tourist boats that she could barely see anything \u2013 which explained why she was hit so often in the face by rivals. She finally crawled over the finish line, with a bleeding nose and scant vision, as darkness descended. Last year Payne arrived in Quebec as the world champion, after she had won the 2009 race in Rome. &quot;Quebec was my biggest disappointment,&quot; she says. &quot;The lake was freezing and I much prefer warm water. As athletes our tools are our hands. And as soon as I lose the feeling in my hands my stroke is not as good and I don&apos;t reach as far because I can&apos;t feel the water. That&apos;s what happened in Quebec. I couldn&apos;t capture the water.&quot; Shanghai, in contrast, offered water that, at 29 degrees, was only two degrees below a temperature considered unsafe for swimming. &quot;I&apos;d still take that over cold water every time. But if Quebec is at one extreme and Shanghai at the other, then the water temperature in the Serpentine at 2012 is smack bang in the middle. The Serpentine is going to be perfect.&quot; Olympic organisers are already conditioning the Serpentine swans to feed in a stretch of water far from the open-water swimmers \u2013 and so Payne is likely to be spared an encounter with an irritable swan to place alongside her outlandish catalogue of open-water companions. She is also thrilled to have become the first name on an expected list of 550 British Olympic competitors next year. &quot;I don&apos;t think there can be a greater honour than representing your country at your home Olympics. It&apos;s fantastic just to do that \u2013 but to be the first to qualify makes it all the sweeter.&quot; Payne explains that the lure of Olympic qualification was always her primary objective in Shanghai: &quot;I was motivated by my disappointment in Quebec but the main thing was definitely securing that Olympic place. I like taking the lead early and swimming in a straight line, with the pace being dictated by me. Melissa Gorman [the Australian] hung with me for a while in the third lap. &quot;We were level when we rounded the buoy but she had a bad turn and fell behind. But there was a big gap between the leading three and the rest. It was something like 13 seconds, which is very unusual. So the last 1,000m was actually a relief because I thought there is no way 10 girls are going to pass me. I knew that I had qualified for the Olympics and that spurred me on to win it.&quot; Payne won in two hours, one minute and 58.1 seconds \u2013 and the race was sufficiently demanding that, despite being ranked at seven in the world in the 1500m, she failed to qualify for that final in the pool. &quot;I don&apos;t want to give any excuses, but fatigue was a factor. It takes a lot out of you \u2013 swimming two hours in the heat of midday \u2013 but next time we need to make the recovery process much better. We&apos;re learning every time and I&apos;ll be motivated by my not-so-brilliant 1500m when I start training again.&quot; She is so versatile that, in the British Gas national swimming trials this year, Payne finished third in the 200m freestyle \u2013 proving she is a sprinter as well as a marathon swimmer. Payne was part of the relay team in Shanghai and while the 1500m is not an Olympic discipline, she has the additional options of the 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle in 2012. &quot;I haven&apos;t decided what I might try for in the pool,&quot; Payne says, &quot;but the 800m most closely mirrors what I do in the open water. So that could be a brilliant Olympic dress rehearsal before the 10k. But out here [in Shanghai] I was thrilled for Becky when she won the 800m. It&apos;s been brilliant sharing with her. We get on really well and we&apos;re just as messy as each other. Everybody who comes into our room says: &apos;Oh, my goodness, how do you survive in this mess?&apos; But we like it that way.&quot; Payne, like Adlington, is a relentless cheery voice on Twitter and there was no disguising her elation on the day she won in Shanghai as she tweeted: &quot;OH MY GOODNESS!!! World champion and I qualified for the 2012 Olympics and my sister is in labour right now!! Best day ever! Aaaahhhhhhhhh.&quot; &quot;My family had quite a time,&quot; she says now, &quot;and I think me and my sister gave my mother a few more grey hairs. My sister went into labour just before my race but she waited for me to win before she told my parents. The first I heard about it was when I got a text from my mum. I called [sister Janine] and we spoke because the baby wasn&apos;t born for another six or seven hours. I&apos;m so much a family girl that I was more excited about that than becoming world champion again. &quot;It&apos;s all I&apos;ve been thinking about the last couple of weeks, my sister having a lovely little baby girl, and when I get home I&apos;m going to spend a night there.

Newspapers were told to avoid all mention of the crash &quot;except positive news or information released by the authorities&quot;, but some papers risked censure to run stark stories about the 23 July accident in which 40 people were killed and scores were injured.      The Economic Observer, a respected business weekly, ran a hard-hitting eight-page special on the crash, pictured here, featuring a bleak photograph of the wrecked bullet train overlaid with a blood-red logo of the railway ministry. &quot;No miracles in Wenzhou&quot;, it said. On the bottom of the page was an editorial written in the form of a letter to Xiang Weiyi, a two-year-old girl discovered alive in the train wreckage 21 hours after the accident that killed her parents, after the search effort had officially been called off. It began:   &quot;Yiyi, when you&apos;ve grown up and started to understand this world, how should we explain to you everything that happened... When you&apos;re grown, will we and this country we live in be able to honestly tell you about all the love and suffering, anger and doubts around us? How do we tell you that, even as they&apos;d declared there were no more signs of life in the wreckage and had started cleaning up the site, you were still there struggling in the crushed darkness.  Do we tell you that, with the truth still far off in the distance, they buried the engine; that before any conclusions had been reached, the line that had given birth to this tragedy was declared open...&quot;   It concluded:  &quot;Yiyi, if we&apos;re going to promise you and other regular children like you a future, the journey must start from the wreckage of the train collision. That is the best way to remember your parents, and all the others who perished there.&quot;  The Beijing News chose to tell the story through code. It ran a front-page article about the breakage at a Beijing museum of a piece of pottery from the Song dynasty.  Hardly earth-shattering stuff, until you start noticing the parallels between this innocuous event and the crash in Wenzhou. The bowl broke into six pieces \u2013 six train carriages were derailed in Wenzhou \u2013 and the accident happened because data was wrongly entered. The museum was &quot;very distressed&quot;. The news was announced days late and the museum denies a cover-up. The report ran above a photograph headlined &quot;China&apos;s Speed&quot;, which shows Chinese swimmer Sun Yuan breaking the world record at the World Championships in Shanghai, but which can also be read as a comment on the high-speed rail obsession at government level. Even the Communist Party&apos;s official organ, the People&apos;s Daily, said China did not need GDP growth smeared with blood. The ban on negative coverage came after premier Wen Jiabao visited Wenzhou to pledge transparency and openness, promising to punish those responsible. There were similar outpourings of anger after the poisoning of infant milk formula in 2008, but this time the outrage is being vented on the popular Weibo microblog service, where the rail crash was the top trending story. &quot;If the media trend is to comment only on the kindness of Wenzhou people, on the bravery of soldiers rescuing people and how hardworking the rail ministry is, then it is a faceless thing, an absolute shame,&quot; one comment said.

The country has added millions of surveillance cameras over the last five years, part of a broader increase in domestic security spending. In May, Shanghai announced that a team of 4,000 monitor its surveillance feeds to ensure round-the-clock coverage. The south-western municipality of Chongqing has announced plans to add 200,000 cameras by 2014 because &quot;310,000 digital eyes are not enough&quot;. Urumqi, which saw vicious ethnic violence in 2009, installed 17,000 high-definition, riot-proof cameras last year to ensure &quot;seamless&quot; surveillance. Fast-developing Inner Mongolia plans to have 400,000 units by 2012. In the city of Changsha, the Furong district alone reportedly has 40,000 \u2013 one for every 10 inhabitants. There are cameras on streets and in stores, in university classrooms and outside the doors of dissidents. In March, Beijing roused disquiet in the arts world when it mooted plans to spend 5.57m yuan on cameras to monitor performances in venues such as cinemas and theatres. China is hardly unique: Britain has arguably led the world in the use of surveillance cameras. But China has embraced them with particular enthusiasm. IMS Research, an electronics-focused consultancy, has predicted annual growth of more than 20% in China between last year and 2014, and less then 10% elsewhere. Bo Zhang, senior research analyst at IMS, believes that more than 10m cameras were installed in China in 2010. The company estimates that spending reached $680m last year, with the total market - including related systems - hitting a value of $1.7bn. Much of that is in the private sector, but Beijing&apos;s initiative - targeting theft and food poisoning, say police - shows how officials are increasingly mandating companies to install cameras and link up private networks with official ones. Authorities are also investing heavily in new public projects. While some areas have gone much further than others, the national Safe City security plan aims to cover urban China with large networks. Internal security spending has soared to almost 625bn yuan this year, more than the country&apos;s official military budget. Monitoring measures range from reinvigorating the neighbourhood committees that watch the comings and goings of residents to tightening internet controls. China&apos;s domestic security chief has also called for the creation of an advanced database covering every citizen to improve &quot;social management&quot;. Linked to individuals&apos; identity cards, it would include details such as tax records and educational history. Nicholas Bequelin, Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;Whereas surveillance cameras are problematic even in democratic societies, there are important counterweights, such as independent courts, privacy statutes, rules about how long the information can be kept and through what legal procedures it can be accessed, as well as independent media and NGO watchdogs. &quot;None of these safeguards exist in China, raising the very real prospect of an Orwellian society - one in which citizens are monitored in permanence, including in their private life.&quot; Although much of the imagery may not be watched in real time, it can be stored for later retrieval. Officials are also seeking ways to automate the analysis of data. Using higher quality cameras paves the way for increasingly sophisticated analysis and linking of the information. Xue Junling, a project manager with Shenzhen Xinghuo Electronic Engineering, says facial recognition was already being used at key points such as big sports stadiums and border checkpoints, although some experts dispute its effectiveness. Many see nothing wrong with the rapid expansion in surveillance cameras, particularly given official claims for their success in cutting crime. Shanghai police said video monitoring helped them to catch 6,000 suspects last year. &quot;If the purpose is for the public security of society, personal rights have to give way to public rights,&quot; said Prof Fu Dingsheng, of the East China University of Political Science and Law, although he added that better safeguards were needed to ensure systems were not abused. Others say the expansion of monitoring is intended not just to cut crime but to systematically reduce the space for dissent. &quot;When dissidents are released from prison or labour camp they often find the surveillance cameras are pointing directing into their homes. That&apos;s something I have heard of a lot in the last couple of years,&quot; said Wang Songlian, of the Chinese Human Rights Defenders Network. The artist Ai Weiwei, who was detained for two months this year, produced a marble sculpture titled Surveillance Camera, mimicking the machines posted outside his studio. The Shanghai rights lawyer Li Tiantian revealed that security officials sought to use footage to increase her isolation during a three-month detention. &quot;They even forced my boyfriend and his brothers and sisters to watch a video that showed me walking into a hotel with other men,&quot; she wrote on Twitter. Wang said state security used cameras to track individuals at sensitive times, but they probably also relied on them for deterrence. &quot;I think the effect is more to intimidate activists - so they feel everything they do is under watch - rather than to gather evidence,&quot; she said.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Surveillance"], "publicationDate": "2011-08-02T12:18:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/aug/02/china-teach-english-drive-stalls", "sentences": ["Another major player is the Shanghai-based Rise group."], "title": "China's drive to teach English stalls in the west", "article": "Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu province, held its first international marathon last month. While this relatively remote city in north-west China has been attempting to raise its profile through the athletics event, thousands, if not millions, of students in the region are running their own personal marathons as they race to learn English. Gansu is one of China&apos;s poorest provinces and is struggling to emulate the economic growth and prosperity of the country&apos;s east coast regions. The population of Lanzhou has risen from 2 million in 2000 to over 3 million today. According to the environmental consultancy the Blacksmith Institute it ranks among the world&apos;s 30 most polluted cities. In a bid to stem migration away from blighted cities such as Lanzhou and Xining, the capital of neighbouring Qinghai province, to the jobs and prosperity of the eastern cities, the central government in Beijing has been investing in infrastructure and jobs. These western cities are now doing everything they can to be part of China&apos;s next success story. A knowledge of English is seen as an essential skill to transform their populations into a high-value workforce. While a national campaign for education renewal, including wholesale reform of English language teaching, started at the beginning of the last decade, its effects were only felt in Gansu and Qinghai in 2005. According to Professor Wu Heping of Northwest Normal University, the leading teacher training institution in this part of China, this process &quot;has been driven by a common awareness of the limitations of English language teaching in the school system, rather than by systematic research&quot;. The goal set by policymakers has been to produce cohorts of school leavers with enough command of English to be able to &quot;communicate with foreigners&quot;. Pursuit of this target has seen the introduction of new textbooks and a push to start teaching the language earlier, with most children introduced to English from around age nine, though that can be as early as six in some urban centres. In western provinces such as Gansu, this strategy has led to a crisis in the supply and quality of teachers. Early attempts at recruiting unqualified or partly qualified teachers to fill the initial teacher shortage have led to new problems. This first generation of teachers is now blocking opportunities for better-trained young graduates who cannot find jobs in state schools. Another concern voiced by English language education professionals is that the reform process will remain doomed to failure without an equivalent change to the examination system. The main target for change is the all-important Gao Kao college entry exam, which was taken by around 9 million school leavers across the country this year and includes an English language test. Calls for reform are going unheeded and teachers in Gansu faced a major reversal when the provincial authorities this year suspended the listening component of the Gao Kao in the province, claiming that it was too complex and expensive to administer. The result, according to education experts, is that students and parents in Gansu remain desperate to get good grades in the Gao Kao. The state is investing heavily in teacher education and improved facilities at school, but candidates are failing both to achieve the grades they need to progress into higher education and to meet the levels of communicative capacity demanded by employers. Still, the failure of the state school system in Gansu is creating opportunities for an emerging private English language teaching sector. At the top end of the market, and charging fees of up to $300 a term, are major school operators such as New Oriental, currently China&apos;s largest provider of private educational services. Only recently established in Lanzhou, New Oriental&apos;s success has been phenomenal. In the buildup to its opening in 2008 it ran its publicity campaign under the slogan &quot;Sorry we&apos;re late&quot;. Two months later, New Oriental changed the slogan to &quot;Sorry we&apos;re full&quot;. The head of the school has since gone on to lead marketing for the whole group. Another major player is the Shanghai-based Rise group. In addition to its school in Lanzhou, this joint venture with US publisher Houghton Mifflin now has 60 centres in other cities. Further down the league, there are hundreds of smaller schools trying to establish niches by offering IT-based learning, smaller groups or native speaker teachers \u2013 many of whom come from the Philippines or Malaysia. Outside major cities are schools such as that run by Wan Li Hu in Liu Jia Xia, which is about a 90-minute drive from Lanzhou. Wan started out as a factory worker, whose university studies, as a mature student, were curtailed by an eye injury. He went on to teach himself English after being &quot;charmed&quot; by the language. He and his wife opened their school in 1992, and now employ five part-time teachers, some of whom are students at a local university. They offer classes at the weekend to 300 students in rooms rented from a local middle school. He charges $75 per term, with\u00a0students attending up to five hours a week. Wan says that his courses help students improve study skills so that they get better scores overall at state schools. &quot;What the students do is more or less the same as what they do in the public schools, but our teachers are better,&quot; he said. Will these classes help students win the learning English marathon? The owners of private schools claim that their courses will lead to significant increases in Gao Kao scores. But this effort is unlikely to create a new generation of Chinese students who will be able to compete for jobs that demand international communication skills. Results so far instil little optimism. According to Professor Wu, although the grades of students entering Northwestern Normal University are getting higher each year, the ability of students to speak, understand and write is actually declining. The sprint to pass exams such as the Gao Kao leaves students a long way short of completing the marathon distance required to reach communicative competence.

In a report commissioned by the Conservatives, Vorderman proposes adopting the model of English language and literature to split maths into twin GCSEs, so that some candidates can achieve a higher standard of maths in an area which includes topics such as personal finance, rather than receiving a &quot;trickled down&quot; version of the subject for more advanced students. Vorderman said: &quot;In my view, it is pointless for most 14-year-olds starting their GCSE courses to be force-fed mathematical topics which they will never use, when what they desperately need is to become more comfortable with numbers including percentages and fractions used in the world of finance.&quot; The report notes that while young people&apos;s employment prospects are highly dependent on their level of maths knowledge, nearly half of all students fail to get a C grade or higher at GCSE maths, effectively failing the subject. Only 15% take maths in some form beyond GCSE. The report says: &quot;Unless major alterations in our mathematics education are made and quickly, we are risking our future economic prosperity.&quot; Roger Porkess, a former maths teacher and education specialist who is lead author of the report, said: &quot;Future generations may well see this report as a turning point, the moment when it ceased to be acceptable for the education system to turn out large numbers of young people who are too frightened of maths to be able to use it at work and in everyday life.&quot; Vorderman&apos;s team recommends that all students should study maths until they are 18. This would not mean a compulsory A-level but a range of options for different needs and abilities. The report says maths should no longer be confined to a daily lesson but encouraged in other areas of pupils&apos; daily routine so that like English it is practised throughout the school day. The report warns that many primary school teachers are not adequately grounded in the subject to teach maths. Almost all recently qualified primary school teachers gave up maths themselves at age 16 after taking GCSE. Around a quarter of children in secondary schools are not taught by specialist maths teachers. It says that a child&apos;s mathematical destiny is fixed at 11. Nine-tenths of those who fail to achieve the Sat target at 11 will go on to get below a C grade at GCSE. By contrast, 94% of those who surpass the Sat target will get a good GCSE pass. The report says almost all secondary schools ignore the results of the Sat and immediately retest children, even though around two school terms have been spent preparing for the Sat. The independent report owas commissioned by David Cameron and Michael Gove, now the education secretary, in 2009 and carried out by a task force assembled and led by Vorderman. Gove said: &quot;As Carol and her team point out so powerfully, we are falling behind our competitors when it comes to mathematics education. British 15-year-olds&apos; mathematics skills are now more than two whole academic years behind 15-year-olds in Shanghai and the last decade has seen us plummet down the international league tables in both maths and science. &quot;This comprehensive report, looking at all the important areas, will be of great help as the government continues its drive to equip our children with the skills that they need to compete with their global contemporaries and thrive in the 21st century.&quot; In a speech to the Royal Society in June, Gove said he believed the &quot;vast majority&quot; of pupils should study maths to the age of 18. He said this should be a &quot;new goal for the education system&quot;. The education secretary suggested that calculus and statistics should play a part in the secondary curriculum. He said: &quot;There are a vast array of issues that people are confronted with in daily life \u2013 from health scares to claims about the effect of drugs to financial news \u2013 which require statistical understanding. But studies have repeatedly shown how poor our collective understanding of such issues is.&quot; Commenting on the report, Professor Dame Julia Higgins, chair of the independent Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education, said: &quot;Carol&apos;s work taps into one of the biggest concerns of not only the mathematics community but also of higher education and business, that too few people study mathematics up to the age of 18. &quot;We need a broad set of mathematics qualifications that are designed to meet everyone&apos;s needs \u2013 A-level mathematics alone can&apos;t provide this. We hope that the government will act on this recommendation, as it is a key step to ensuring that future generations are suitably prepared for the challenges of a highly competitive and technologically dependent world. &quot;At present, some students aren&apos;t even studying mathematics up to 16 \u2013 early entry to GCSE mathematics is increasing dramatically and, with league tables in mind, some schools interpret achieving a grade C at the age of 14 as permission to drop the subject and focus their attention elsewhere. &quot;The government needs to act now to clarify this situation and send the message that mathematics isn&apos;t something you can just &apos;get out of the way&apos; if you want to compete in the modern world.&quot;", "tags": ["Mathematics", "Education", "GCSEs", "Schools", "UK news", "Politics", "Exams"], "publicationDate": "2011-08-07T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/08/muifa-storm-typhoon-reaches-china", "sentences": ["The government has also mobilised troops from elsewhere.&quot; A day earlier, Muifa had moved along China&apos;s eastern coast as a typhoon and downed power lines, billboards and trees in Shanghai and brought heavy rain to coastal Shandong province."], "title": "Chinese chemical plant under threat as Muifa reaches China", "article": "Chinese troops have been dispatched to save a chemical plant from towering waves after a 200-metre breach in a protective wall opened up before a tropical storm. The dyke around the Jinzhou industrial complex in the port city of Dalian was only half-completed as tropical storm Muifa approached on Monday, state media reported. According to the Xinhua news agency, 20-metre-high waves breached the coastal defences of the Fujia petrochemical facility, prompting local residents to flee and the government to call on the military to provide emergency engineering work to fill the gap. Behind a growing hole in the protective wall is a storage area containing around 20 metal tanks holding oil-based chemicals at the Fujia industrial chemical plant, said the website of the People&apos;s Daily newspaper. &quot;If the breach cannot be blocked up, toxic chemical products may spill, and that would be extremely dangerous,&quot; the news website reported from Dalian. It said a thousand emergency workers had been sent to the area. Chinese television news showed trucks and earthmovers lined up to block the breach with rocks and sand. Broadcasters said the threat was &quot;under control&quot; but nearby residents had been moved as a precaution. The chemical company and local government did not respond to requests for details, but paramilitary police units confirmed that they had been called into the operation. &quot;Detachments have been sent throughout the day to build the dyke,&quot; said Yu You, spokesman for the headquarters of the Dalian Border Guard. &quot;It is hard to say how many are there now. The government has also mobilised troops from elsewhere.&quot; A day earlier, Muifa had moved along China&apos;s eastern coast as a typhoon and downed power lines, billboards and trees in Shanghai and brought heavy rain to coastal Shandong province. Last week Muifa killed four people in the Philippines without making landfall and caused injuries and power outages when it passed the Japanese island of Okinawa on Friday. Although it has been downgraded from a typhoon to a tropical storm, China&apos;s State Oceanic Administration has issued an orange alert \u2013 the second-strongest warning for high waves. Muifa is predicted to skirt the Shandong peninsula and land somewhere between China&apos;s Liaoning province and North Korea on Monday. In the border city of Dandong, Liaoning has designated 756 shelters capable of accommodating a million people. Neighbouring Shandong province has ordered tens of thousands of fishing boats to return to port. Due to such precautions, fatalities so far have been low. Those affected say the disruption has been worthwhile. &quot;We are not willing to risk our lives just to return to work,&quot; said Ping Wang, who has delayed a trip back to Dalian from Beijing. &quot;We have heard this is no small storm.&quot;", "tags": ["Natural disasters and extreme weather", "China", "North Korea", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-08-08T11:48:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/08/china-scolds-west-debt-crisis", "sentences": ["The Shanghai Composite Index saw its biggest single-day loss since November, falling 3.8% to 2,526.8 points, the lowest close since July 2010."], "title": "China scolds the west over debt crisis and eurozone woes", "article": "Chinese state media has rammed home its economic warnings to the west, scolding Europe and the United States for spending beyond their means, and for Washington&apos;s political battle over the debt ceiling. &quot;If the US, Europe and other advanced economies fail to shoulder their responsibility and continue their incessant messing around over selfish interests, this will seriously impede stable development of the global economy,&quot; the People&apos;s Daily, the official Communist party newspaper, warned in a commentary. Officials have not formally remarked on Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s decision to downgrade the US sovereign credit rating, but state media has run a series of scathing pieces. &quot;Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States, as the world&apos;s sole superpower, has relied on its powerful military to meddle everywhere in international affairs \u2026 paying no heed to whether the economy can support this,&quot; said a separate article by state news agency Xinhua. China, the world&apos;s second largest economy, enjoyed 9.5% growth in the second quarter. It is the largest foreign holder of US government debt, with at least $1.1tn in US Treasuries in its whopping $3.2tn-worth of foreign reserves. But while it is never loath to point to its successes and Washington&apos;s failings \u2013 in particular, to suggest that democratic politics hinders effective leadership \u2013 there is little told-you-so satisfaction at the turmoil of recent days. &quot;The biggest victims may not be the United States itself, but other countries that have depended on external demand to amass national wealth \u2026 [including] Asian nations that depend on exporting goods,&quot; wrote economist Sun Lijian, in a Sunday commentary for the People&apos;s Daily. Stocks in Hong Kong and on the mainland dived on Monday, with analysts blaming international reaction to the downgrade. The Shanghai Composite Index saw its biggest single-day loss since November, falling 3.8% to 2,526.8 points, the lowest close since July 2010. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng was down more than 4% at one point, although it rebounded to end down 2.2% at 20,490.6 points. The downgrading &quot;will certainly have an adverse impact on China&quot;, said Yuan Peng of the government thinktank the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations. &quot;It suggests our holdings of US assets aren&apos;t as safe as they were, and the [Chinese] government also needs to explain itself to the people \u2026 Nowadays, the Chinese government also faces pressure from the media and public opinion.&quot; Aside from the potential for losses on the reserves, their scale betrays officials&apos; failure to shift the economy towards domestic consumption, as they have repeatedly pledged. China notched up a record $273bn trade surplus with the US last year. The economy remains investment- and export-driven, leaving it vulnerable to external shocks. But if one long-standing concern has been a double-dip recession, Beijing&apos;s other great anxiety has been controlling politically risky inflation. While a massive stimulus package helped China ride out the storm last time \u2013 aiding the global recovery \u2013 concerns about rising prices will make officials wary of loosening monetary policy. Either way, they will worry about potential social unrest. &quot;I don&apos;t think they are looking at all this in a self-satisfied way \u2026 Leaders are keenly aware China is still very dependent on the global economy,&quot; said Patrick Chovanec, of Tsinghua University&apos;s School of Economics and Management. Export-focused small and medium enterprises already have financing pressures due to tightened monetary policy, warned Li Xiangyang, director of the Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. A repeat of 2008&apos;s fall in global demand would hit them hard. Chovanec said that shifting to domestic consumption, making growth more sustainable and less easily affected by external instability, would require painful adjustments on the supply side as well as increased demand. In the short term, he believes officials will face a &quot;strong temptation&quot; to engage in further stimulus, directing banks to lend \u2013 despite the threat of bad debt, inflation and higher property prices, which the government has been fighting to rein in. Duncan Innes-Ker, of the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, said exports were not the only concern for officials, who are watching Europe anxiously: &quot;They have a lot invested in the idea of the eurozone and having an alternative to the US dollar market,&quot; he said. Beijing has been keen to diversify its reserves, but has struggled to find suitable options. Even so, amid the gloom, the world is looking east for relief. ANZ economist Liu Ligang told Reuters last week that China could account for over a third of global economic growth this year \u2013 reinforcing its ascendance as the 2008 crisis did. &quot;The overall situation is healthy, compared to Japan and the west. Even if the international environment is worsening, the Chinese government is able to react \u2026 [It] will not be dragged into the crisis by the west,&quot; insisted Li of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. *Additional research by Han Cheng", "tags": ["Global economy", "Economics", "China", "Business", "Financial crisis", "Global recession", "Banking", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-08-08T14:47:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/10/china-aircraft-carrier-launch", "sentences": ["&quot;[The trial&apos;s] symbolic significance outweighs its practical significance,&quot; Ni Lexiong, an expert on Chinese maritime policy at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said."], "title": "China's first aircraft carrier launches with pride amid regional tensions", "article": "China&apos;s first aircraft carrier has embarked on sea trials, in a potent demonstration of the growing naval power that is creating pride at home \u2013 and concern elsewhere in the region. While China says it will only ever use naval power for defensive purposes, others say it is increasingly aggressive in pursuing its claims. Hours after the trials began, Taiwan pointedly unveiled its most advanced missile, hailing it as &quot;an aircraft carrier killer&quot;. The refitting of the former Soviet vessel is part of China&apos;s broader naval modernisation programme \u2013 which includes heavy spending on submarines and the development of an anti-ship missile system \u2013 and comes amid growing competition with the US and India, and a string of maritime disputes with closer neighbours. &quot;This is showing to the whole world that China&apos;s maritime mobility is expanding drastically. This is showing that China is in the process of acquiring capability to control the South China Sea as well as the East China Sea,&quot; Yoshihiko Yamada, a professor at Japan&apos;s Tokai University, told Reuters. In the past year China has had seen a series of territorial spats with Japan over islets in the East China Sea; and with the Philippines, Vietnam and others over the South China Sea, the location of essential shipping lanes and important natural resources including oil and gas. Those disputes are complicated by underlying competition with the US and India. &quot;By itself, the ship does not erode the credibility of America&apos;s military presence in the region nor greatly increase China&apos;s power projection capabilities. Nevertheless, the vessel is a potent symbol of China&apos;s aspirations to become a global maritime power and is yet another indication that the military balance of power is gradually shifting in China&apos;s favour,&quot; said Dr Ian Storey, of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. Last week, Japan&apos;s annual defence report said the Chinese navy were likely to increase activities around Japan and warned that China had acted &quot;in a way seen as coercive&quot; in conflicts. Beijing responded by accusing Tokyo of irresponsible exaggeration. The test is a small step in the long journey towards building a viable carrier group, but it is already stoking unease in India, and prompting fears of an arms race between Asia&apos;s two emerging powers. The Indian Ocean is fast becoming a zone of contested influence between Beijing and Delhi. Indian strategists have been particularly worried by a string of ports constructed with Chinese assistance in Burma, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. &quot;The carrier will add a new dimension to the burgeoning Chinese navy which could provide a major challenge to India in its backyard, the Indian Ocean,&quot; the Times of India commented on Wednesday. Despite a \u00a310bn modernisation programme, much of the Indian armed forces&apos; on equipment is outdated, and efforts to build or buy aircraft carriers have been hampered by political wrangling and red tape. The Indian navy has a small 50-year old 28,000-tonne carrier, which it bought from the UK in 1987, but it aims to have at least two aircraft carrier battle groups in operation by 2015. The ongoing refit of the 44,570-tonne Admiral Gorshkov, purchased from Russia in 2005, and the construction in India of a new 40,000-tonne carrier are expected to be completed in the coming three to four years.&quot;We are definitely looking at deploying two aircraft carriers by the middle of this decade,&apos;&apos; assistant chief of naval staff (foreign cooperation and intelligence) Rear Admiral Anil Chawla said earlier this year. Defence analyst Ajaj Shukla said that India retains the lead in naval aviation, but that there was a clear fear of &quot;the projection of Chinese power into the northern Indian Ocean in a new way&quot;. &quot;The Chinese are at an earlier stage but once they set their minds to operating a naval air arm they will catch up pretty fast so it is being carefully watched,&quot; he said. The People&apos;s Liberation Army Navy has also expanded its reach substantially in recent years \u2013 notably participating in international efforts to tackle Somalian pirates and more recently using a warship to support the evacuation of 35,000 Chinese citizens from Libya. &quot;[The trial&apos;s] symbolic significance outweighs its practical significance,&quot; Ni Lexiong, an expert on Chinese maritime policy at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said. &quot;We&apos;re already a maritime power, and so we need an appropriate force, whether that&apos;s aircraft carriers or battleships, just like the United States or the British empire did.&quot; China has spent almost a decade refitting the vessel, which was towed from the Ukraine in 1998 \u2013 without engines, weapons systems or other such equipment \u2013 although the defence ministry did not formally acknowledge the project until a month ago. The 300m-long vessel sounded its horn three times as it left its shipyard in Dalian, in north-east Liaoning province, amid thick fog, according to the state news agency. The trial is expected to last a few days and Xinhua said tests and refurbishment would continue when the ship returned. China has said it will use the carrier for research and training. It is believed to be building two carriers itself and experts think it wants up to four in all. In an interview published in the China Economic Weekly, Chinese navy Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo said that China planned to build a &quot;very strong battle group&quot; but warned it would be a long and difficult task. &quot;The construction and functional demands of an aircraft carrier are extremely complex,&quot; he said. Ashley Townshend at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney told Reuters that China would require three carriers for a viable strike group, as well as support ships and aircraft, and predicted it would take around a decade to develop. &quot;Many countries have, or are, investing in anti-ship missiles and attack submarines which make large, poorly defended warships such as the Varyag highly vulnerable,&quot; pointed out Storey. &quot;US military officers are very dismissive of the Varyag&apos;s operational capabilities, but are much more concerned about the development of China&apos;s own anti-ship ballistic missiles, which are designed to target US aircraft carriers.&quot; China&apos;s official military budget has more than doubled since 2006, from 298bn yuan to 601bn yuan this year, although it is still dwarfed by that of the US.

Backstory Like many national ballet companies, the National Ballet of China grew from foreign imports taking root in native soil. It was founded on the last day of 1959 as the Experimental Ballet Company of the Beijing Dance School, a school which had itself been founded only in 1954. Two principal figures influenced both school and company. One was the &quot;mother of Chinese ballet&quot; Dai Ailian, founder of the Beijing Dance School and one of the ballet company directors. The other was Pyotr Gusev, a former director of the Kirov (now Mariinsky) Ballet; he instituted the Russian training system as the company&apos;s technical foundation. Initially, the repertory was built on the Russian model (Swan Lake was their inaugural production). When relations between China and the USSR broke down in 1960, Gusev (like many other Soviet artists) returned to Russia; but a number of Russia-trained dancers also returned to China, fortifying the influence of the Soviet ballet style. In 1964, British ballerina Beryl Grey was the first westerner to work with the company, staging Les Sylphides. But increasingly, Chinese social and national themes came to the fore, most famously in the agitprop Red Detachment of Women (1964), which was made at the suggestion of the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai.            After 1966, political involvement in the ballet became far more direct. Jiang Qing \u2013 wife of Chairman Mao and one of the Gang of Four who spearheaded the decade-long Cultural Revolution which attempted to purge Chinese culture of bourgeois tendencies and &quot;rightist&quot; thinking \u2013 took direct control of the company, sidelining Dai Ailian. The repertory dwindled to just two sanctioned ballets \u2013 The Red Detachment of Women and The White-Haired Girl \u2013 and the company travelled in a punishing schedule around the country, often on foot and carrying their own baggage. Following the arrest of Madame Mao 10 years later, the company began to reform and grow as China began to open its cultural and economic doors. Ailian returned as director (1976\u201380) and then continued as artistic adviser, and the company began to invite overseas guests and to tour abroad. They accelerated in this direction under Zhao Ruheng, a former company dancer who, as artistic director from 1994 to 2009, negotiated huge transitions from state-socialist ideologies to free market ones. Under her enterprising leadership the company has a number of modern ballets, and toured internationally, staking its claim on the international stage. Since 2009 the company has been led by another former company dancer, Feng Ying. Watching the National Ballet of China For most of its history, the repertory fell into two distinct categories, neatly summed up by Madame Zhao as &quot;the red and the white&quot;. The white ballets were traditional classics such as Swan Lake and Giselle, and the red were the revolutionary Chinese ballets epitomised by The Red Detachment of Women but including many other patriotic ballets over the years, such as Yellow River (2000). But as China grew on the international stage, so did its ballet company, which considerably broadened its range to include more modern ballets from around the world \u2013 by George Balanchine, William Forsythe, Roland Petit and others \u2013 and in 2008 even collaborated on Bahok, a contemporary dance piece by British choreographer Akram Khan. A new strand of Chinese ballet has also emerged in the last decade, recently with The Peony Pavilion (2008) but most famously with Raise the Red Lantern (2001). Unlike Red Detachment, the new ballet was a heritage project rather than a revolutionary one, mythologising the past rather than the future: its setting is feudal China, its heroine an imperial concubine. The new ballet, too, drew on a mix of ballet with more traditional Chinese arts and costumes, from folk dance and Chinese opera. It was a big international hit \u2013 though celebrated more abroad than at home, where it was sometimes criticised as retrogressive. Who&apos;s who The current artistic director is Feng Ying, with Wang Quanxing as deputy. Wang Caijun is the r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur. The company has its own orchestra, directed and conducted by Zhang Yi. Fact When Madame Mao controlled the company she prohibited foreign ballet terms: the attitude became &quot;the stance of the heron&quot;, the arabesque became &quot;spreading your wings in the welcome breeze&quot;. She also banned certain steps \u2013 the pas de basque and the entrechat \u2013 on the grounds that they were &quot;anti-revolutionary&quot;. In their own words &quot;Our country is now rising in the world, and our ballet company would like to go with it.&quot;Zhao Ruheng, interview with Alison Dakota Gee, New York Times, 1998 &quot;We&apos;ll still follow our existing policy of &apos;walking on three legs&apos; \u2026 The first leg is the repertoire of the familiar 19th-century classics [\u2026] The second leg is the creation of Chinese ballets which can reflect our own individual Chinese culture and sensibility [\u2026] The third leg is the repertory of more contemporary 20th-century classics.&quot;Feng Ying, interview with Kevin Ng, ballet.co.uk, 2009 &quot;The history of ballet in China is not long, but it has gone through a lot because China is not like other countries. Its history has made us who we are. We did not replicate the west. Chinese ballet tells its own stories.&quot;Zhao Ruheng, interview with Connie Young, CBS News, 2011            In other words &quot;The National Ballet of China has historically been split between two traditions: the classics imported from Soviet Russia and the ideological fairytales enforced by Madame Mao. Between Swan Lake and The Red Detachment of Women there&apos;s been little middle ground. But the company is now forging its own identity and Raise the Red Lantern heads its new repertoire.&quot;Judith Mackrell, Guardian, 2003 &quot;Pushing against all preconceptions, the company&apos;s artistic director, Zhao Ruheng, is intent on rewriting \u2013 or should that be &apos;re-righting&apos;? \u2013 history.&quot;Allen Robertson, Los Angeles Times, 2005 &quot;I make no bones about my admiration for the National Ballet, and my belief that great things in classical ballet have already been achieved, and that greater innovations and artistry will come from China.&quot;Clement Crisp, Financial Times, 2007 Do say &quot;The dancers have an exceptional poise and clarity, if dramatically a little reticent.&quot; \u2013 You&apos;ll be in line with general critical consensus. Don&apos;t say &quot;Shouldn&apos;t they do more Chinese stuff?&quot; \u2013 Heritage ballets such as Raise the Red Lantern and The Peony Pavilion sell well to western audiences, but at least grant them the leeway to stage other ballets, old and new. After all, Swan Lake is as much part of the company history as Red Lantern. See also The other main Chinese ballet company is the Shanghai Ballet.

The leading Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, who was himself held for 81 days, tweeted this week: &quot;If you don&apos;t speak for Wang Lihong, and don&apos;t speak for Ran Yunfei [a detained blogger released the next day], you are not only a person who will not stand up for fairness and justice; you do not have self-respect.&quot; The charges relate to a demonstration outside a court in Fuzhou, southern China, last year to support three bloggers accused of defamation after helping a woman who wanted officials to reinvestigate her daughter&apos;s death. Activists from around the country travelled to the hearing after reading about the case online. Supporters believe the authorities may have been particularly concerned because it showed how online dissent could lead to on-the-ground action. Wang, who is 56, is accused of organising protesters, her son said. Han Yicun, one of her lawyers, said the judge obstructed the defence by interrupting both him and Wang repeatedly.

Guilty verdicts are a near certainty in such cases, although occasionally courts have quietly released defendants on bail.

Spokesman Tan Xiaofeng said experts will examine whether sensors are halting trains unnecessarily because they are faulty or too sensitive \u2013 for example being set off when a door is ajar or a passenger smokes in a toilet. &quot;When problems occur, we don&apos;t wish to hide them,&quot; he said. &quot;We put life before everything else.&quot; He said the line had suffered &quot;frequent quality problems&quot; due to components from American, European and domestic suppliers. Earlier this week, the company announced a temporary halt to production of the trains. Zhao Jian of Beijing Jiaotong University, a prominent critic of the expansion programme, said the recall and the cutting of train speeds would help rebuild confidence. &quot;I think the public will be less worried, at least less worried than if the speed was not slowed down,&quot; he said. &quot;In my eyes, this is the state council correcting the &quot;great leap&quot; by the last leadership of the ministry of railways \u2026 This is definitely a major step&quot;. But he said there were a series of problems to be exposed, such as &quot;debt, technical safety and the fact that high-speed rail will not ease China&apos;s transportation difficulties and isn&apos;t suitable for China&apos;s economy&quot;. Zhao said he believed the concerns about high-speed rail would ensure drastic reforms, with authorities likely to merge the ministry of railways into a transport super-ministry \u2013 as they tried to do several years ago, only to be thwarted by the rail ministry. Ren Xianfang, senior China economist for IHS Global Insight, said the Wenzhou disaster had convinced officials to &quot;rectify the excesses&quot; of its system. Ren likened the impact of the crash to the way that Fukushima had turned the Japanese public against nuclear power, adding: &quot;It is quite clear now that stepping on the brake is the only viable policy option.&quot; The days after the crash saw an extraordinary spate of bold reporting from Chinese media, who challenged the official response before they were reined in. China has the world&apos;s largest high-speed train network, rolled out at a frenetic pace. But critics argued even before the crash that the focus should be on expanding freight and lower-cost services that ordinary citizens could afford, rather than on prestigious high-tech projects. Safety concerns were also raised. Sun Zhang, a professor at the railway and urban mass transit research institute of Tongji University, told China Daily that he supported the idea of cutting train speeds, saying China should take time to test the system and gain experience. He said it took Japan almost half a century to increase the speed of its Shinkansen bullet train from 210 kilometres an hour [130mph] to 300kph. &quot;So it&apos;s impressive, and at the same time a bit worrisome, that China managed to achieve speeds of 350 kilometres an hour in just seven years,&quot; he added. Officials initially blamed the July crash on faulty signals equipment, but a senior investigator told the Beijing Times on Friday that the crash also exposed management failings and could have been avoided. &quot;There were serious flaws in the system design that led to an equipment failure,&quot; said Luo Lin, the minister of China&apos;s state administration of work safety. &quot;At the same time, this exposed problems in emergency response and safety management after the failure occurred. &quot;This was a major accident involving culpability that could have been totally avoided,&quot; he said.

Sorry, UK viewers \u2013 if you&apos;re waiting for the show to air on BBC1, do come back here after Thursday&apos;s broadcast.  Read Dan Martin&apos;s episode five blog The middlemen Not to be insensitive, earlier this week, as I was starting to wonder whether the UK was going to face a state of martial law, I began to find Torchwood more identifiable. Which was at least some relief as society collapsed all around. A science-fiction programme hinging on how fragile the bonds we pass off as civilisation really are. With all of this going on, the Torchwood schedulers were on hand with what we all need most in a time of crisis \u2013 Ghostbusters. Yes, Ernie Hudson, AKA Winston Zeddemore, popped up as shadowy big PhiCorp cheese Stuart Owens. And in what was admittedly the least convincing fake kidnap scenario ever, Torchwood sensibly allowed a few light-hearted capers to shine through the unrelenting grimness. This is where Russell T Davies&apos;s political sledgehammer falls next. Owens is a middleman, just like Evil Colin from the Overflow Camp. And as RTD has said, at length in the past, it is buck-passing middlemen who will be there signing off the end of days, rather than angry teenagers. But you need a few light-hearted capers in an episode about concentration camps. If the true nature of the modules had been introduced rather suddenly and in a heavy-handed manner, the writers (also sensibly) didn&apos;t hang around debating the moral nature of it; it&apos;s perfectly obvious that concentration camps are bad. All it needed was Gwen&apos;s righteous dressing down to Leila from Hollyoaks, who has now re-trained as a Doctor who turns a blind eye to state genocide. Instead, it&apos;s an Escape from Alcatraz-style action set-piece, Rex (who now fully identifies with Torchwood) and Esther avenging Doctor Vera while battling our new favourite psychopath Colin. In Wales, Gwen and bumbling Rhys battle bureaucracy to rescue her Dad, before Gwen gets her action hero moment, conveniently finding a vault of explosives and a motorbike to escape on after blowing the place up. It almost looks like fun. Still, it looks like, after the weeks (and weeks) of setting this whole thing up, Miracle Day is turning in episodes with identities of their own. Even if that does mean that this week, there&apos;s no space in the story for Jilly Kitzinger. Good girl gone bad It&apos;s Esther who really comes into her own this week. After inadvertently getting her sister&apos;s kids taken into care the other week, she&apos;s now gone through a Torchwood rite of passage in killing someone. And in a world without death, that doesn&apos;t even work properly, as Evil Colin enacts a horror movie cliche, grabbing her ankle and extending what are actually some pretty shocking and graphic scenes of violence against women. Still, her final, broken scene with Rex in the car, where unlike the rest of the team she would very clearly be doing absolutely anything else, was really very moving. Transatlantic tension You know what, it&apos;s actually starting to feel rather normal, this show being set in both California and Wales. It needed to eventually.

The debate, however, focuses narrowly on securing the resilience of financial markets as we know them. The broader aspects of resilience are being ignored, that of the role of financial markets in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the global economy in the light of natural resource and climate challenges and the destabilising effects of endemic inequality and poverty. &quot;Finance is a means to an end, not an end in itself&quot;, argues Nobel economist Joe Stiglitz. &quot;It is supposed to serve the interests of the rest of society, not the other way around.&quot; Yet our economy is unsustainable because our financial markets allocate capital to businesses that are profoundly unsustainable. Their narrow financial focus blended with a myopic short-termism delivers toxic investor behaviour that is preventing our transition to the green economy needed to survive and prosper in the 21st century. Today&apos;s financial crisis and accompanying economic recession is the stimulus we need to realign financial markets, rapidly and at scale, to the needs of a sustainable economy. Global financial assets were $150tn in 2010, topping pre-recession levels for the first time. Allocating these assets represents our investment in tomorrow&apos;s economy, our collective source of livelihood. Over $150bn was invested in 2008 in clean technology projects and companies, a four-fold increase since 2004. While this is encouraging, these numbers bear little relation to the trillions of annual investment needed in green infrastructure. &quot;Responsible&quot; investing has been shown to be both practical and often profitable. Furthermore, initiatives such as United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI) and the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investing (UNPRI) highlight the &quot;sign up&quot; to the cause of asset managers worth tens of trillions of dollars. But the sad truth is that financial markets remain disengaged. Survey after survey of fund managers and analysts confirms the marginal status of most aspects of the sustainability agenda. Advocates of sustainable investing are themselves increasingly expressing doubts over its impact on the rump of investment behaviour, all the more so in the face of what many see as a return to &quot;business as usual&quot; following the financial crisis. As one leading sustainability investor argued, &quot;given the scale and pace of change that is desperately needed, we have to conclude that our current approach will not do enough&quot;. There is no magic answer to achieving the much-needed realignment, but there are some well-defined policy pathways that offer considerable potential. Overcoming short-termism is a pre-condition for progress, as sustainability will count for more when investors consider the long-term performance of prospective investments. Andrew Haldane at the Bank of England has offered compelling evidence that investors are increasingly turning away from profitable investment opportunities because of their distorting appetite for short-term profit-taking. Fund managers are perversely incentivised towards short-termism, and this has not got any better as a result of painful lessons from the financial crisis, a point confirmed in a recent study published by leading executive remuneration experts, Mercer Consulting. Persuasion is of course a route to be taken, one fund manager and one pension-fund trustee at a time. But such gradual, voluntary approaches will not overcome these problematic biases any time soon. Regulatory and fiscal interventions have to be considered. One such proposal has been for a financial transaction tax that reduces the profitability of short-term trading activities. The so-called &quot;Robin Hood tax&quot; advocated for a while by France&apos;s President Sarkozy, might have served this purpose, but it was bartered away, at least for now, during the push-and-shove of G20 and European politics. Other policy interventions being tested that might serve to reduce short-termism include bans on naked shorting, penalising taxes on non-resident currency trading, and greater disclosure, for example of how climate change is being factored into investment strategies. Trustees of our pension funds and other financial assets have a &quot;fiduciary responsibility&quot; to us, the intended beneficiaries. Designed to protect the financial security of private citizens, these responsibilities are in need of a serious overhaul as a growing body of analysis highlights their underperformance by traditional financial performance measures, resulting from competency gaps, perverse incentives, asymmetrical information, unintended consequences of accounting regulations and practices, perceived risk and litigation-driven conservatism, conflicts of interest, and the behavioural effects of the herd mentality. Here there are options for greater regulatory interventions in asset allocation by institutional investors to take greater account of sustainability factors in investment decisions. South Africa, for example, has been the second country (after the UK) to advance a code for responsible investing, seeking on a voluntary basis to influence the conduct of investors with a strong sustainability focus. China&apos;s Shanghai stock exchange has recently followed other major stock exchanges in launching a sustainability index intended to influence the decisions guiding Chinese and international investors with both a strong &quot;tracker&quot; approach and an interest in sustainability as a lead indicator of long-term financial performance. State funds are a relatively small but rapidly growing segment of the financial markets, including not only high-profile sovereign wealth funds (which alone have total assets approaching $3tn, a sum expected to reach $7tn by 2012), but China&apos;s policy banks, the various trade, investment and development promotion investment vehicles scattered all over the world, and a new generation of funds such as the UK&apos;s planned green bank. State-owned or controlled investment vehicles have the potential, given the mandate and competencies, to make a huge difference to the approach of the financial markets to sustainability issues. In rare instances, sustainability is an explicit element of a state fund&apos;s mandate, such as in the case of the Norwegian fund. More commonly it is the funds&apos; &quot;long term&quot; interests that offers most potential for enhanced alignment to sustainability outcomes. Chinese public and private investors, frankly, are most likely to lead in the coming years in investing in Africa&apos;s green economy. Current financial market reform efforts provide a unique opportunity to advance the insertion of sustainability as a fundamental performance condition. Fiscal interventions, changes in fiduciary responsibility and leveraging the growing power of state-owned funds are but three of the possible policy pathways for doing this in practice. Arguments that it&apos;s too soon (our priority must be to prevent meltdown) or that it&apos;s too tough, (the difficulties in influencing a sector that can relocate profits with astonishing ease) have only superficial merit. Systemic reforms in the financial markets are undoubtedly needed to unleash their power in favour of a sustainable economy, and such changes will be all the harder once the current reforms have run out of steam and the sector is no longer in the public eye. Now is exactly the right time to mobilise public debate about the historical role of the financial markets, and to advance practical measures for this role to succeed in practice.

Hey, the kids love football and they love urban culture \u2013 let&apos;s jam the two together, add a licensed soundtrack and jive all the way to the bank. And that&apos;s kind of what EA did for a couple of iterations.  When Fifa Street appeared back in 2005, it was part of EA&apos;s ill-judged BIG label, in which development teams were expected to bring street chic to the sports genre. By the end of the series, Fifa Street had become a bizarre fantasy of millionaire footballers repeating mystical tricks on fairyland parking lot pitches. It had become totally divorced from reality. It was an interactive Nike advert. But, as announced at EA&apos;s GamesCom press conference, Fifa Street is back. And it could well be the surprise success story of this year&apos;s event. In some ways, the foundations remain unchanged. This is a stylised simulation of urban football, in which the emphasis is placed on attacker vs defender face-offs and cool tricks. Players can take part in anything from 1 vs 1 to 6 vs 6 matches, as well as Futsal, Fifa&apos;s official five-a-side competition. There are also novelty modes like Last Man Standing (if you score, one of your players leaves the pitch, the first team with no players wins), while participants can create custom matches in which they modify the size of the goals, or get points for pulling off skill moves.  Ah yes, skill moves are the basis of the experience. The basic controls are typical Fifa \u2013 there&apos;s a short pass, a shoot button, a lobbed pass and a &quot;manual pass&quot; \u2013 a tactical attacking punt that replaces the traditional through-ball (considered too incisive for the small court game). But on top of this, players with the ball can press the left trigger to stop the team member with the ball; now, the left analogue stick can be used to move the ball around in a series of close-quarters flicks and feints. Defenders always face attackers, so you have these little one-on-one moments \u2013 the guy with the ball is playing with it, waiting for the defender to commit; the defender has to stand his ground and see which way the ball will go. Now, the guy with the ball can hit right trigger, point the analogue stick in the desired direction and make a break for it. Time it right and point toward the defender and you perform a satisfying nutmeg.  But there is also an array of more than 50 skill moves, accessible via the right stick. Faves such as the flip flap, rainbow flick and heel chop are all accessible, providing an armoury of possible offensive options. In a sense pitch encounters become like very fast RPG turn-based battles, each player routing through their collection of special moves. To add further depth, the left shoulder tab provides access to a series of modifying flair moves, that add extra bite to passing and shooting attempts. The right tab makes the player kick the ball up into the air, opening up a series of keep-uppy manouveres.  It sounds fiddly and inconsequential, but it&apos;s really good fun. Matches become very close and very considered battles of special move prowess as attackers probe and push for gaps, and defenders seek to anticipate passing moves. There&apos;s a nice staccato pace, the ball flows easily between players until a tackling showdown presents itself \u2013 then it&apos;s all ball tricks, taps and shimmys. It should feel over-structured and fussy, but every confrontation is a satisfying battle.  Part of the reason it works \u2013 a very large part, I suspect \u2013 is that the DNA of the main Fifa series runs through the title. Development has been at EA Vancouver, using the Fifa 12 engine. The animation, then, is lovely; it&apos;s detailed, and the intricate moves look smooth and detailed.  The project is also headed up by Gary Paterson, one of the team responsible for Fifa&apos;s renaissance. His demo of the game is enthusiastic and knowledgeable. He is quick to recognise the weaknesses of previous Fifa Street titles. &quot;Fifa Street 3 was a fantasy game,&quot; he explains as he shows me the game. &quot;We feel that street football in itself is very exciting, very stylish, it&apos;s got crazy moves \u2013 there&apos;s no need to exaggerate that. This is authentic street football. It&apos;s all about beating the defender, humiliating the defender. In our research we saw cases where street footballers would have an open goal, but they wouldn&apos;t score, they&apos;d wait for the defender to get back, then they&apos;d beat the defender and score. It&apos;s all about that one vs one.&quot; Paterson also reckons the game catches the differing cultures of street football around the world. Fifa Street features 35 environments, taking in everything from playgrounds to underpasses, from London courts to Shanghai rooftops. In the Dutch game, the emphasis is on the numeg \u2013 or panna \u2013 the fleet-footed humiliation of your opponent; in the UK sections, there&apos;s much more wall play and it&apos;s more physical (though out-and-out fouls are tough to commit here). The ball physics differ depending on the surface, so grass is more sympathetic than concrete. And the rules change too: if you opt for Futsal, there are no walls to rebound the ball off of \u2013 instead, you get kick ins and corners.  This being Fifa, there are licensed teams \u2013 somehow, players from all the major European leagues, as well as the MLS, are present, though Paterson won&apos;t say how, and to what extent. There is also a suite of online and &quot;connected&quot; features, similar to Fifa&apos;s online modes and EA Sports Football Club options, though the details will come later. So yes, Fifa Street. After a couple of matches I was beginning to glimpse the complexities of the control system, the way stepovers, slights and nutmegs can combine with shielding moves to create very tense, very satisfying little encounters. I guess the question is whether there&apos;s a market for it now. Apparently, Futsal is the fastest growing indoor sport in the world, but with the main Fifa title so dominant, Fifa Street will need to perform a few impressive marketing moves to prove that it has a place in the EA Sports line-up. Yet already, it&apos;s a really fascinating prospect, guided by an experienced development team.", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "PS3", "PC", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2011-08-18T10:49:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/18/global-recession-warning-stock-markets", "sentences": ["In Asia, Japan&apos;s Nikkei closed down 1.25% while Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng tumbled 1.2% and the Shanghai Composite ended the day 1.6% lower."], "title": "Global recession warning rattles stock markets", "article": "Global stock markets have resumed their recent slide, weighed down by fears that the world is sliding into a double-dip recession.

Morgan Stanley warned that the global economy was teetering on the brink of a recession, and slashed its growth forecasts. Citing &quot;recent policy errors&quot; and the prospect of further austerity measures in 2012, it said the US and the eurozone were &quot;hovering dangerously close to a recession over the next 6-12 months&quot;. &quot;While we had been calling for a &apos;BBB&apos; recovery in developed markets all along, the path now looks even more Bumpy, Below-par and Brittle than previously thought,&quot; analysts Joachim Fels and Manoj Pradhan said in a note, adding that emerging markets were not immune either. The US investment bank cut its global growth forecast to 3.9% from 4.2% this year, and to 3.8% from 4.5% next year. Growth in developed market economies is now seen averaging at just 1.5% this year and next (down from previous estimates of 1.9% and 2.4%). A recession is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of contraction. &quot;Still, recession is not our base case because: the corporate sector looks healthy; household real incomes will be supported by lower headline inflation; and we expect more action from the Fed and the ECB, including rate cuts and more non-standard easing,&quot; the Morgan Stanley analysts said. Fears that the UK economy could slide back into recession intensified after news that retail sales grew by just 0.2% last month, and by 0.1% in the last three months. The latest UK labour market data also painted a worsening picture, with unemployment rising sharply, especially among women and young people. The grim global outlook and turmoil in financial markets prompted the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee to discuss a fresh round of quantitative easing at its meeting a fortnight ago, and its two hawkish members abandoned their calls for higher interest rates. At Franco-German crisis talks in Paris on Tuesday, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy urged closer economic co-ordination and called for a Europe-wide tax on financial transactions to prevent the disintegration of the single currency.

The FTSE index in London closed down 239 points at 5092, a fall of 4.5% on the day, after dire manufacturing figures from the US prompted a sell-off on Wall Street which spread across the Atlantic. All 100 stocks on the FTSE finished in negative territory, with banking and mining stocks among the biggest fallers. Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland both fell more than 11% on concerns that European banks may need more capital. Germany&apos;s Dax fell 6.3% and France&apos;s Cac lost 5.7%, while markets in highly indebted Spain, Italy and Portugal dropped by 5.8%, 6.1% and 4.8% respectively. In Asia, Japan&apos;s Nikkei closed down 1.25% while Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng tumbled 1.2% and the Shanghai Composite ended the day 1.6% lower. At one point, the Dow Jones industrial average in New York plunged more than 500 points. It later closed down 419 points at 10991, a fall of 3.7%. The yield on UK 10-year government bonds, known as gilts, tumbled to 2.31% \u2013 the lowest since 1897 \u2013 and gold jumped 2.1% to hit a fresh record high of $1,825.99 an ounce as investors fought shy of equities. Expectations that the world economy will need less oil pushed Brent crude down towards $108 a barrel, after reaching a two-week high on Wednesday. The euro fell 1% against the Swiss franc, regarded as a safe haven. Dominic Rossi, global chief investment officer, equities, at Fidelity International, said volatility would continue. &quot;I&apos;m not expecting equity markets to go back to the highs we saw earlier this year soon, and frankly wouldn&apos;t be surprised if over the course of the next few months we see some further pressure, with the lows of a couple of weeks ago being re-tested.&quot; He added: &quot;There is going to be a greater demand for income from equities than there has been over the last 15 or 20 years.&quot; Concerned that the eurozone debt crisis could be spreading to the US banking sector, regulators in New York have stepped up their scrutiny of the US arms of Europe&apos;s largest banks. The news was compounded by a cocktail of bad economic data from the US. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve factory index, which measures manufacturing activity in the surrounding region, fell to its lowest level since March 2009. Further pressure came from unexpectedly bad new unemployment claims in the US last week, while inflation was higher than anticipated in July. Morgan Stanley warned that the global economy was teetering on the brink of a recession, and slashed its growth forecasts. Citing &quot;recent policy errors&quot; and the prospect of further austerity measures in 2012, it said the US and the eurozone were &quot;hovering dangerously close to a recession over the next six to 12 months&quot;. &quot;While we had been calling for a &apos;BBB&apos; recovery in developed markets all along, the path now looks even more Bumpy, Below-par and Brittle than previously thought,&quot; analysts Joachim Fels and Manoj Pradhan said in a note, adding that emerging markets were not immune either. The US investment bank cut its global growth forecast to 3.9% from 4.2% this year, and to 3.8% from 4.5% next year. Growth in developed market economies is now seen averaging at just 1.5% this year and next (down from previous estimates of 1.9% and 2.4%). A recession is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of economic contraction. &quot;Still, recession is not our base case because the corporate sector looks healthy; household real incomes will be supported by lower headline inflation; and we expect more action from the Fed and the ECB, including rate cuts and more non-standard easing,&quot; the Morgan Stanley analysts said. Fears that the UK economy could slide back into recession intensified after news that retail sales grew by just 0.2% last month, and by 0.1% in the last three months. The latest UK labour market data also painted a worsening picture, with unemployment rising sharply, especially among women and young people. The grim global outlook and turmoil in financial markets prompted the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee to discuss a fresh round of quantitative easing at its meeting a fortnight ago, and its two most hawkish members abandoned their calls for higher interest rates to curb inflation. At Franco-German crisis talks in Paris on Tuesday, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy urged closer economic co-ordination and called for a Europe-wide tax on financial transactions to prevent the disintegration of the single currency.

A day of rumours and extreme nervousness saw shares in Britain&apos;s biggest companies lose all the gains in the market seen since the FTSE 100 index bottomed out on 11 August. Despite an afternoon rally, prompted by speculation that the US Federal Reserve was about to hold an emergency meeting to tackle the growing sense of market panic, the FTSE closed 51.47 points down at 5040.76, a decline of 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average also lost confidence later in the day as no announcement from the Fed was forthcoming and closed down 172.93 at 10,817.65, a fall of 1.6%. Earlier, London shares had collapsed after Thursday&apos;s heavy selling on Wall Street prompted steep falls on Asian bourses. Fears that the global economy was heading for a double-dip recession, and signs that Europe&apos;s bailout of Greece could collapse, saw the FTSE lose more than 3% of its value at one stage, sending it well below the 5000 mark. The steadier start to trading on Wall Street helped calm nerves in the City at the end of another frenetic week that saw markets once again focus on their two major concerns: growth and the fragility of Europe&apos;s single currency. &quot;This week has seen a continuation of the trend of weaker than expected data and political reaction to the European problems which pretty much amounts to &apos;let&apos;s have a get-together a couple of times a year&apos;,&quot; said Gary Jenkins, an analyst at Evolution Securities. The jittery atmosphere sent investors heading once again to the safe havens of the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen and gold. Bullion rose as high as $1,881 an ounce, with some dealers expecting it to test the $2,000 an ounce level over the coming weeks. On the foreign exchanges, the dollar dropped to just under \u00a576 against the Japanese currency and was also down against the Swiss franc and the pound. The dollar&apos;s fall helped underpin oil prices, with a barrel of Brent crude trading almost $2 higher at just under $109 a barrel. Switzerland&apos;s two biggest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have denied that they made use of the Federal Reserve&apos;s swap facility via the Swiss National Bank, insisting they have no liquidity problems. There had been speculation that a Swiss bank had accessed the US liquidity facility via a $200m repurchase transaction with the SNB last week. Evangelos Venizelos, Greece&apos;s finance minister, said his country&apos;s \u20ac109bn bail-out was not in doubt, despite the fissures within Europe being laid bare by the demands of five countries for collateral in exchange for paying into a rescue fund for the weaker countries in the monetary union. Venizelos also said the recession in his financially troubled country could be deeper than originally predicted for this year, with output potentially shrinking by more than 4.5%. His comments came a day after the Netherlands, Slovenia, Austria and Slovakia said on Thursday they wanted hundreds of millions of euros in collateral, in the same vein as Finland, which struck a deal with the Greek government earlier in the week to receive cash as security for its part of the bailout. Brussels sought to ease fears by stressing that Olli Rehn, Europe&apos;s economic and monetary affairs commissioner, was looking at a plan for common European bonds, seen as a step towards closer financial integration among the 17 single-currency nations. European banking shares fell to near two-and-a-half-year lows, dragged down by rumours about banks&apos; potential losses on bonds issued by heavily indebted governments. Earlier, Asian shares took a beating, with Japan&apos;s Nikkei 225 index dropping 2.5% to 8719.24 and Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng down 3.1% to 19,399.92. Concerns that weak growth in Europe and the US would hit China&apos;s exports affected sentiment in Shanghai, where the stock market&apos;s composite index ended 1% lower at 2534.6 after dipping almost 2% earlier in the day. Some strategists said it was a good time to pick up stocks cheaply. Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Arden Partners, said: &quot;If you want to buy when there&apos;s blood on the streets, and on the screens, then today is a good day to pick up good quality, high-yielding general retail defensives like Marks &amp; Spencer and WH Smith, as well as undervalued global retailers like Inchcape and Kingfisher.

But that is one of the privileges of joining the US National Park Service&apos;s international volunteers in parks scheme. You pay for flights and food; they sponsor your visa and house you. Imagine spending the summer as a backcountry guide in the Grand Canyon or, as I did, working on the edge of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii. I had been on a ranger-guided walk in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming years earlier. I was so terrified of bears that I refused to walk without a guide, and at the start I was less interested in what she was saying than in whether she had some bear repellent spray. Yet I found myself becoming more and more interested in her commentary. It was like nature with subtitles: suddenly, it all started to make more sense. I realised that this ranger&apos;s job was to hike around this beautiful place and show it off to visitors. A few years later, aged 23, I found myself with six months between finishing law school in London and starting as a trainee solicitor. I knew I wanted to work in one of North America&apos;s national parks and found plenty of volunteer opportunities, but most required US citizenship. Eventually I found the US Department of the Interior International Volunteers in Parks Program (nps.gov/getinvolved/volunteer.htm), which allows individuals from all over the world to take up volunteer opportunities. In a grey January, an email from Hawaii arrived headed &quot;Aloha&quot;, telling me that I&apos;d been accepted. I found living on the edge of an active volcano surprisingly relaxed, as well as exciting. My daily commute involved a stroll through tranquil rainforest, past the misty caldera with its mighty steam column connecting the unstable earth with the Pacific skies. At night, the fierce orange glow of lava illuminated the sky and the ground around it. Mornings began with an &quot;eruption update&quot; and, for me, a crash course in biology, geology and &quot;interpretation&quot;. Then I was given the revered volunteer ranger uniform and let loose. On the first morning I found myself in front of a group of visitors. Suddenly, I was the &quot;authority&quot;, delivering a geology talk on the volcanic past and present of the islands, with a smattering of winning ranger-style wit. Although as a volunteer I was making the park come alive for visitors, it was the people of the park who made Hawaii come alive for me. These warm and generous people have a respect for their land and a genuine pleasure in sharing it. I joined a halau hula dance school, for two months of trying to keep up with the graceful dancers. At the Merrie Monarch festival, the Olympics of hula, I spent a mesmerising evening watching traditional dancers from all over the Pacific. I also got to grips with Hawaiian paddling, winning a prize in the Hilo regatta. All this as well as getting to go on countless hikes across lush rainforest, deserted plains of solid lava rock, huge volcanic craters and the ocean coast, scattered with silent crescents of sand and palm trees. As a parks service VIP you can stand in the middle of a volcanic crater, look up at the rainforest clinging to the sides and the myriad steam puffs escaping from the ground you&apos;re standing on and shout: &quot;This is my office.&quot;\u2022 The International Volunteers in Parks Program, run by the National Park Service&apos;s Office of International Affairs (nps.gov/oia), pays for your visa and helps you through the application process. Some parks provide accommodation Phoebe Kirk Parrot breeding, Catalonia, Spain     One of the hyacinth macaws Hal Hodson helped feed on his volunteering holiday. Photograph: Hal Hodson    After six months of study in London, I wanted to get away for a bit, and I needed it to be cheap. A slightly odd idea popped into my head one evening. My dad is an artist and often does large-scale paintings of tropical birds, including parrots. I&apos;d always wanted to find out more about them. I found Darryl Unsworth through the Parrot Society UK. Darryl got in touch saying that if I didn&apos;t mind helping out with the birds, I was welcome to visit him at his farm in Catalonia, northern Spain. Darryl is a British expat who breeds parrots, selling the birds to a vet in Madrid, one he trusts to find responsible breeders or pet owners. He pointed me to his profile on Help Exchange, HelpX.net, a website listing worldwide opportunities for volunteers, who work in return for room and board. This website is a brilliant starting point for travellers looking for a cheap way to see the world, while being helpful and learning a thing or two. There are thousands of projects in its library. Unlike Wwoof (Willing Workers on Organic Farms, wwoof.org.uk), there is work of all kinds. You could find yourself teaching children in Ghana, working on a ranch in Argentina, or helping one man set up an organic garden on Samoa. Most of the projects take volunteers for free \u2013 you just need to get there. I arrived in the middle of an emergency \u2013 a storm had knocked the electricity out, and the generator was nearly out of petrol, but Darryl needed power for the baby parrots&apos; incubators. After visiting several garages we found some and dashed back. &quot;Looks like the temperature&apos;s barely dropped below 36.5C, so the eggs and babies are OK. We got back just in time,&quot; he whispered, before showing me around. Darryl has about 30 breeding pairs: African greys, tiny, hooting parakeets, scarlet and green macaws, and hyacinth macaws, as big as human babies. A black eye looked out of a yellow monocle, staring me down as one of the metre-long birds dangled from its aviary. &quot;They can break coconuts with their beaks and they&apos;ll take your finger off, so be careful,&quot; Darryl warned. I chopped bananas into thirds then used the stem-ends to pass the fruit in to the birds without risking my fingers. Some HelpX hosts lay down strict rules on the amount of work expected for room and board. The standard is about five hours a day, after which you are free to roam, read and swim. Darryl preferred to set out projects which he wanted my help with during my stay. Clearing the barn was one of the hardest tasks. The floor was carpeted with seed shucks and the air heavy with pet shop smell. In each corner there were piles of earth under piles of stuff. Darryl said mice dig the earth out to nest under the floor, where they are followed by big snakes. I dragged a feed box out from a damp nook, half hoping for, half dreading a snake encounter. By the time we were done, there were two truckloads of junk, old seed and earth. But a clean barn felt good. Most of the time, I fed the parrots and helped with DIY. At no point did I feel exploited: Darryl was fun and full of stories. After work we made dinner \u2013 always simple, but delicious \u2013 tortilla, fried potatoes and a bottle of wine. When I wasn&apos;t working, I read, and wandered the mountains. The farm is remote, but Darryl was happy to give me a lift to the bus station. One afternoon, I took a bus to Unesco-listed Tarragona. There were crumbling walls and arches beside the buzzing market and, as I crested a hill, I caught sight of the Mediterranean. After a long sweaty walk there was sand between my toes and I jumped into the salty sea then floated on my back, bobbing on wavelets. It felt like a real reward.helpx.netHal Hodson Student tour, Nanjing, Shanghai and Beijing     Ballroom dancing in China. Photograph: Siraj Datoo    The scent of incense followed us as we walked around the Jing&apos;an temple. Pilgrims were kneeling in prayer before the many statues. We thought the most astounding feature of this temple was its location, amid skyscrapers on one of Shanghai&apos;s busy roads. That was until we saw the monk, burger in one hand, mobile phone in the other. But this was exactly the type of enlightenment the Study China programme hoped to achieve. Now in its fifth year, it is managed by the University of Manchester on behalf of the government, although any student can apply. This year, it ran 17-day courses in Nanjing over Easter and in Shanghai and Beijing in the summer. The aim is to encourage UK students to visit China and equip themselves with skills to live in an increasingly globalised world. Any full-time UK undergraduate who holds an EU or EEA passport (or has indefinite leave to remain in the UK), can apply. You fill in a form explaining why you are suitable. As a student of French with international studies, I knew I would get a lot out of it, and felt lucky to be one of the 250-odd selected from more than 1,000 applicants. I had to pay for flights, insurance and food; the programme covered accommodation, a 30-hour language course, a Chinese sim card, a metro card and a host of trips. You pay entrance fees for places you visit yourself, but it works out as a very reasonable way to travel. The first week in Shanghai was similar to freshers&apos; week, with 120 of us forming new friendships. Visiting a new city with people you barely know adds to the experience and relationships quickly developed. I doubt I will soon forget the people I was with when we saw the glorious Bund skyline by night. Or the night that we visited a jazz bar to find that one of the guitarists was a forensic inspector by day. Or the day a few of us visited Nanjing, in 40C heat. My most lasting memory will be the spontaneous dancing. In the most unexpected outdoors areas in Beijing or in the most westernised parts of Shanghai, groups of men and women ballroom dance to Chinese pop. We were often asked to be their partners.\u2022 The next Study China programme (studychina.org.uk) is at Easter 2012, but applications are being accepted nowSiraj Datoo, third-year student at Warwick University and editor of the Student Journals (thestudentjournals.co.uk)", "tags": ["Gap year travel", "Working holidays", "Ethical holidays", "Catalonia holidays", "Spain holidays", "Europe holidays", "Travel", "Backpacking holidays", "Volunteering", "Voluntary sector", "Society", "Charities"], "publicationDate": "2011-08-19T21:44:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/19/catherine-hakim-interview", "sentences": ["&quot;The paper I&apos;m particularly interested in\u00a0was a study limited to women, in Shanghai \u2013 that said there were much higher returns, double the level in North America, to looking attractive, and the second thing was that attractiveness was definitely related to expenditure on clothing and cosmetics.&quot; I ask whether it&apos;s her view that China takes a more honest approach to attractiveness and its place in the economy."], "title": "Catherine Hakim: charm school marm | interview", "article": "Catherine Hakim is a sociologist at the London School of Economics, who has written a book called Honey Money. &quot;The world smiles at good-looking people, and they smile back&quot;, is its subtitle, and it goes on to posit this theory: that we have erotic capital, and this divides into six categories: beauty; sexual attractiveness; social skills like grace, charm and discreet flirtation; liveliness, which is a mixture of physical fitness, social energy and good humour; social presentation, including dress, jewellery and other adornments; and finally, sexuality itself, competence, energy, imagination. We meet in Covent Garden, over fancy tapas. She arrives and says, &quot;I must go and brush my hair,&quot; which she really needn&apos;t have done, because I don&apos;t buy her theory. I don&apos;t care what someone&apos;s hair looks like, I find hair neither impedes nor accelerates a discussion about ideas. I did not say so, thank God, even in jest, otherwise our encounter could have been even worse than it was. Erotic capital, according to the book, can be used by women and men, but as a result of the &quot;male sex deficit&quot; \u2013 men want sex much more than women, a &quot;new social fact that social scientists have mostly sidestepped&quot; \u2013 women have more scope to exploit it. &quot;In sexualised, individualised modern societies,&quot; she writes, &quot;erotic capital is becoming more important and more valorised, for men and women. However, women have a longer tradition of developing and exploiting it.&quot; And yet, for all our noble history of accessorising and being lively, we have never as a sex been encouraged to exploit it, because of the &quot;patriarchy&quot;. &quot;Patriarchal ideologies have systematically trivialised women&apos;s erotic capital to discourage women from capitalising on it \u2013 at men&apos;s expense.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;unfortunately, radical feminists today reinforce patriarchal &apos;moral&apos; objections to the deployment of erotic capital.&quot; And &quot;one reason why erotic capital has been overlooked is that the elite cannot monopolise it, so it is in their interest to belittle it and sideline it.&quot; Hakim is keen to stress that her thesis is &quot;evidence based&quot; and nothing to do with prejudice or ideology, and finishes her introduction with this rallying cry: &quot;why not champion femininity rather than abolish it? Why does no one encourage women to exploit men whenever they can?&quot; Anyway, she&apos;s back. Her hair looks great. She sits down. The tables are quite close together, and we start talking about this sex deficit. She has presented a wealth of studies that show men want to get laid more within their relationship, that celibacy is far more common among women, that masturbation and use of erotic material are far more common among men, that men are more unfaithful and more frustrated, report more sexual desire, across a whole range of countries. The only thing I think might complicate her conclusion \u2013 that men are randier than women, and why won&apos;t we all just accept it \u2013 is that this area is culturally quite freighted. There are certain expectations, going back centuries, of male sexuality being rampant and ungovernable, and equal and opposite expectations of female sexuality. This might \u2013 call me crazy \u2013 impact upon the way that men and women report, express and prosecute their sexual desire. There are lesser issues on the same spectrum, like, for instance, that women are under-represented in the making of pornography, so might be under-represented in the consumption of it, without this necessarily leading to the conclusion that we&apos;re not interested in sex (in the book, she dismisses the idea of one&apos;s response to porn being determined by whether your sex is represented as the spectator or the object as &quot;nonsensical&quot;). My alternative view is supported by Hakim&apos;s finding that &quot;in the absence of distorting social constraints, there appear to be no sex differences in sexual interest among younger people, up to around the age of 30.&quot; Her conclusion \u2013 that women lose interest after they&apos;ve had kids, because their attention has switched to child-rearing \u2013 could conceivably be countered by the idea that the women under 30 in these sex surveys, being younger, might have evolved further from the social constraints that might colour the answers of older women. It&apos;s just a thought. The majority of the studies come from the early 90s; she mentions &quot;smaller, repeat studies&quot; in Britain that occurred this century, but the only reference is &quot;reported in medical journals&quot;. The Finnish and Australian studies were conducted this century, but most of the time, where there is a 21st century reference, on closer inspection it turns out to be about some other element of sex, only tangentially related to the male sex deficit (pricing in prostitution; the thoughts of a blogger who likes to shag a lot, whose inclusion marks a new weird point in the art of indexing; some figures on sexless marriages, which could just as easily demonstrate both parties would like to have sex, just not with each other). In short, a large part of her supporting evidence is 20 years old and since, by her own admission, different ages give different readings, it strikes me that this picture of the horny male and the frigid, babysitting female might not be the end of the story. So I ask her, very mildly I swear, whether or not she thinks that women might, when they talk about their sexuality, still be labouring under a bit of cultural baggage. Immediately, she starts barking at me; she tells me I&apos;m using value-laden language, and that I&apos;ve got to get over the idea that people can&apos;t change. &quot;Look at Muslims! They turn against their cultural expectations within one generation of arriving here!&quot; The people on the next table to us get up and move. I would argue that it&apos;s a lot easier to get over cultural expectation when you have the warm bath of a different culture, that you live in, ready to step into. But I don&apos;t say any of that because I&apos;m worried that one or both of the people who have just moved might be Muslims, and there&apos;s always a\u00a0chance she might start barking again. So instead, I just accept the sex deficit as fact. Let&apos;s talk about something else. She writes: &quot;In societies and periods when women have limited access to economic, social and human capital, [erotic capital] is crucial for them \u2013 which may be why women have traditionally worked harder at it.&quot; Possibly, then, as women&apos;s capital in those other areas increases, their reliance on erotic capital should fall? She rolls her eyes, as if she cannot believe she&apos;s suffering the indignity of such a foolish conversation. &quot;Should!&quot; she exclaims. I&apos;m being an Anglo-Saxon puritan. She really doesn&apos;t have my number at all, but no matter. She&apos;s not here to interview me. I didn&apos;t mean &quot;should&quot; as in &quot;ought to, for some moral, puritanical reason&quot;. I meant &quot;one might reasonably assume\u2026 like, if cloud cover correlates with rainfall, when clouds dissipate, rainfall should decrease.&quot; But never mind! Our food is going cold. I feel a bit sick, to be honest. The waitress looks to me to be too scared to come and take it away I accept, or at least I stop arguing, that whatever a woman&apos;s economic agency and position in society, she should still make a big fandango about her sexual playfulness and exquisite taste in shoes. Let&apos;s talk a bit about those six elements of erotic capital. I ask whether or not all of them are indivisible from sex on some level. People like flirtatiousness because it conveys some possibility, it&apos;s not just a coquettish, Renaissance thing that you do, for politeness, like holding open a door. She fixes me with an angry eye: &quot;Now we finally come down to it. I&apos;m surprised it&apos;s taken so long.&quot; She sounds a little bit like Darth Vader. &quot;You understand erotic capital as sexual capital. I&apos;m saying &apos;no&apos;. I say &apos;no&apos;, several times in the book. Facial beauty is not about sexuality. Sex appeal, yes, is about sexuality. Sexual competence, yes, is about sexuality. But physical liveliness, being able to tell jokes, that is not about sexuality. Dress sense, ability to present yourself, these are not about sexuality.&quot; &quot;But surely you know from your life that these things that make you attracted to someone, sexually, are exactly the things you describe? You\u00a0know, liveliness is part of it.&quot; &quot;In a work setting, and in a whole lot of other social settings, someone who is lively is attractive without necessarily being sexually attractive. Someone who dances well is attractive to look at, even if you don&apos;t particularly want to have sex with them. I&apos;m saying that there are six elements of which only one is purely sexual, and the second one, sex appeal, is only partly to do with sex. Four of them have nothing to do with sexual attraction. There are several theorists whom I note and mention who think the only thing that matters is sexual capital, the only thing that matters is sexual attractiveness. They happen to be gay. In the gay community, this is absolutely the case. The gay community is not interested in talk, not interested in getting to know you. It&apos;s interested in sex in a much more straightforward and simple way.&quot; Well, of course a homophobic rant is always an\u00a0unexpected treat on a Monday lunchtime. &quot;Hang on a sec, gay people don&apos;t choose partners on the basis of their personality?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m simply reporting what I have read and been told by people who know more about this, and have written more about it than I have. And\u00a0I&apos;m simply saying that sociality features less\u00a0strongly in the gay community.&quot; &quot;You just said the gay community is not interested in talk. I think that needs a little more flesh on its bones.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m not going to go into the gay community. You want to trip me up. You are trying to trip me up all the time.&quot; Well, this distracted me, otherwise I would have had a number of follow-up questions, like, for instance, in what regard is sex appeal only &quot;partly&quot; to do with sex? And if none of the others\u00a0have anything to do with sex, in what regard are they erotic? How does it differ from just having a personality? We move on to China: she seems to view their appraisal of erotic capital quite positively. &quot;The paper I&apos;m particularly interested in\u00a0was a study limited to women, in Shanghai \u2013 that said there were much higher returns, double the level in North America, to looking attractive, and the second thing was that attractiveness was definitely related to expenditure on clothing and cosmetics.&quot; I ask whether it&apos;s her view that China takes a more honest approach to attractiveness and its place in the economy. &quot;You keep using these value-laden words, I don&apos;t understand the language you use. Perhaps you&apos;d like to rephrase your question in a\u00a0non-value-laden way.&quot; &quot;OK, you did say earlier that you thought China was normal and North America was abnormal. That you thought the American response to erotic capital had been perverted by puritanism. So perhaps you could expand a bit upon that?&quot; &quot;I think it&apos;s true generally of Anglo-Saxon puritan cultures, and that includes Britain \u2013 and the rest of the world values erotic capital and therefore you might say it was normal rather than abnormal. Abnormality is the Anglo-Saxon response. The research evidence is from Britain and America so it&apos;s difficult to generalise from.&quot; &quot;So tell me a bit about how the puritan hegemony came about in Anglo-Saxon cultures?&quot; &quot;Well, I think it has a lot to do with Christianity.&quot; &quot;You don&apos;t think Islam has had just as much an effect on prudishness?&quot; She starts to speak very slowly. I believe she&apos;s attempting to convey that I am the stupidest person she&apos;s ever met. &quot;No. Because Islam is not common in puritan cultures. In fact, they are abominated by Christianity for the last 2,000 years.&quot; &quot;Yes. I understand that. I am asking, if Christianity managed to imbue Anglo-Saxon cultures with this prudishness, why did the moral\u00a0strictures of any other religious system not\u00a0imbue their cultures?&quot; More sighing. &quot;Puritanism doesn&apos;t arise in others. It&apos;s a Christian sect. It&apos;s a Christian development.&quot; &quot;Well, a huge amount of sexual restrictiveness arises in other religions. But you don&apos;t think that has had any impact on their surrounding cultures?&quot; &quot;I haven&apos;t written a book about sexual activity and sexual cultures outside the western world.&quot; &quot;But it strikes me that you&apos;re basically saying America and Britain and anybody else with an Anglo-Saxon belief structure, their course has been perverted, so they&apos;ve arrived at a position that is wrong. And that is the result of Christianity. I&apos;m interested, if that is what you mean, in why Christianity should be the only religion to pervert the course of culture, when all religions, well, most religions, have militant, sexually illiberal factions.&quot; &quot;That I don&apos;t know. Ask people who are specialists in religion. I&apos;m not a specialist in religion.&quot; &quot;You can&apos;t use Christianity as your rationale, and then refuse to engage in why it would exert so singular an influence.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m not using it as a rationale, I&apos;m saying, fact: it is a fact that the countries where Christianity holds sway have had a down on sexuality, pleasure, and things to do with the body. It&apos;s there in the literature. People who know more about this than I do have said so.&quot; &quot;Do you think the reason we don&apos;t allow women to capitalise on their erotic resources is\u00a0because we disapprove of sex?&quot; &quot;Sorry. Who is disapproving of sex?&quot; &quot;Anglo-Saxon cultures.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think I say that anywhere.&quot; &quot;You just did.&quot; (Actually, she also says it in her book: &quot;The\u00a0Puritan ethic did a lot more than promote capitalism. It seems to have ruined sex for a lot\u00a0of\u00a0people in the western world&quot;. Evidence base? That I&apos;d like to see.) &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve read anywhere that people disapprove of sex. There is a generally negative attitude in the Puritan Christian culture toward pleasure, sexuality, aesthetic enjoyment, things that are not purely of the mind.&quot; Yet again, we are not getting anywhere. She disowns her views then restates them with abandon. She gets incredibly cross. I am slightly too old to\u00a0capitulate just because someone is unpleasant to me. This you might call my unerotic capital. We have a number of other skirmishes, about Berlusconi, Jordan, David Beckham, Christine Lagarde, Rebekah Brooks and children. In her book, she lays into a number of feminists, saving her peculiar dismissiveness for &quot;Anglo-Saxon feminism&quot;. &quot;French and German feminists reject Anglo-Saxon victim feminism in all its guises,&quot; she writes. I ask, in the spirit of genuine interest, who she means by French and German feminists, since it would seem to be pertinent whether she&apos;s talking about Elisabeth Badinter or Virginie Despentes, Catherine Millet or Julia Kristeva. She reacts with disgust to the question \u2013 &quot;you keep asking me for names. I&apos;m not going to give you names!&quot; \u2013 as if I&apos;m asking for tittle-tattle. In the book, it turns out she is referring to Badinter, so it&apos;s weird that she won&apos;t discuss her, and to Luce Irigaray (who is actually Belgian, but let&apos;s not be pedantic), or at least this statement of hers: &quot;What we need for our future civilisation, for human maturity, is a sexed culture.&quot; No serious reader of Irigaray would take this to mean she supported &quot;erotic capital&quot;. Irigaray described her own career thus: a first phase, in which &quot;I\u00a0showed how a single subject, traditionally the masculine subject, had constructed the world according to a single perspective&quot;; a second phase, in which she defined &quot;those mediations that could permit the existence of a feminine subjectivity \u2013 that is to say, another subject.&quot; And the third she sees as &quot;trying to define a new model of possible relations between man and woman, without submission of either one to the other.&quot; Broadly, then, and at a much more theoretical level, Irigaray fashioned the point that Hakim earlier described as &quot;nonsensical&quot; in relation to porn: that the two sexes could not be judged and discussed and measured within parameters that had been framed by only one of those sexes. I mean, look, it&apos;s quite an intricate point of academic feminism; you don&apos;t have to agree or disagree with it. But it has sod all to do with Hakim&apos;s &quot;social science&quot;, and the idea that it constitutes a &quot;rejection of Anglo-Saxon victim feminism&quot; is a basic misunderstanding. Elsewhere, the comparisons are sloppy: &quot;Some of the most taboo-breaking and positive books about female sexuality were written by French women: The Story Of O, The Diary Of Ana\u00efs Nin\u2026 These texts form a sharp contrast with equivalent moralising novels by Englishmen, such as Moll Flanders and Vanity Fair.&quot; Except that the first was published, by a woman, in 1954, and the second was published, by a woman, in 1966. Whereas those &quot;equivalent&quot;, moralising novels were published by men, respectively, in 1722 and 1847. Sharp contrast? You might just as well find a sharp contrast between the sexual standards in Shakespeare and the Venerable Bede. After the interview, Hakim rang the editor, posing two questions: was it my idea to interview her, or the desk&apos;s? And was I in the middle of a marital breakdown? Clearly, she&apos;d cooked up a dark motive, whereby my husband was ditching me for someone with superior erotic capital, and\u00a0I&apos;d tracked her down with the direct purpose of disagreeing with her. This tickled me; if I were a spurned ex seeking revenge, I would definitely not do it via a social scientist. And if I were to do\u00a0it via a social scientist, I&apos;d choose one with a\u00a0bit more going on. \u2022 Honey Money, by Catherine Hakim, is published by Allen Lane at \u00a320.

My son looked abroad and hasn't looked back", "article": "Missed your university place; afraid you won&apos;t get through clearing? My 18-year-old son, Bruno, last August faced a similar problem \u2013 and came up with what at first appeared to be an outlandish last resort: to study in China. A-level students who fail to get a place this year face higher tuition fees if they delay entry until 2012. Many, like Bruno, may be tempted to head overseas. When he did not get the grades needed for a place at Warwick, and found that most clearing places wanted overseas students only, he turned to the internet. The good news? Nottingham university was offering engineering degrees. The catch? The first two years would be at their campus in Ningbo, China. A further complication was that no student loans were available for overseas study, meaning we had to find a steep \u00a38,000 for a year&apos;s tuition fees, plus a reassuringly low \u00a31,300 for accommodation. Within weeks I had tearfully waved Bruno goodbye. How do we feel a year later? Back then, more than \u00a39,000 seemed a fortune for a year&apos;s study, but had Bruno gone to Warwick (where fees have risen from \u00a33,290 to \u00a39,000 for 2012), rent alone would have cost around \u00a35,655 (based on 39 weeks, though landlords commonly charge throughout holidays). Today, the Chinese option no longer seems expensive, as shown by Bruno&apos;s end-of-year bank balance. Monthly rent is around \u00a3108 for an ensuite room \u2013 available all year \u2013 and Bruno has proved that you can live on around \u00a310 a day, taking his total monthly expenditure, including rent, to approximately \u00a3400. Sourcing a cheaper degree overseas looks increasingly attractive and Nottingham&apos;s international office says its campuses in China and Malaysia are attracting growing interest. Director Vincenzo Raimo says: &quot;We are seeing a good increase in inquiries and I expect this to increase further.&quot; Many other overseas universities report increased applications from British students for English-taught courses, most of which are now cheaper than their UK equivalents. The University of Groningen in Holland, where fees are around \u00a31,600 a year, has received more than 100 applications from British students for this year&apos;s courses and Maastricht university reports double the applications compared with last year. Travel costs are one of the extras we have incurred. Return flights to China are around \u00a3500; I&apos;ve made two trips in nine months, while Bruno returned once for a month in January. Phone bills were initially hefty but we now use Skype for free and Bruno&apos;s Chinese mobile costs very little thanks to a number containing several 4s \u2013 which no superstitious local would want. Another financial bonus was that a trip to A&amp;E for a broken hand, the result of a boisterous night out, cost \u00a38 including X-rays and cast. One significant extra is insurance at \u00a3250 annually, though unfathomable Mandarin (repeated requests for a translation have been ignored) makes claiming impossible. How to get by in a different culture where language is frequently a barrier is a constant challenge but Bruno&apos;s zest for meeting new people, brave attempts to learn Mandarin and sheer enjoyment of his Chinese adventure have carried him through the past year and will hopefully see us all through the next. And Bruno says ... &quot;It&apos;s been the best year of my life. There are about 200 international students here and I&apos;ve made friends not only with Chinese people but with kids from all around the world. I didn&apos;t know what to expect when I came here to uni \u2013 obviously I&apos;ve got nothing to compare it with \u2013 but overall it&apos;s been really interesting seeing so many new things and experiencing a different culture, although coping with studying here is sometimes tricky due to communication problems. &quot;Everything here seems cheaper, but I still spend a lot on everyday stuff. Living at home you don&apos;t realise how much you need, and things such as the internet and toiletries are more expensive. Travel is cheap \u2013 a bus trip to Shanghai is about \u00a310 \u2013 and you can stay in a hostel for \u00a36 a night, which we often do at weekends. The markets there are great and clothes are cheap. &quot;I&apos;ve missed England, especially my friends and sister, and you do feel more homesick when it&apos;s hard to communicate. I try to keep busy by studying Mandarin outside my course. I play in the football team and it&apos;s easy for foreigners to get work. I&apos;ve done some modelling, which can earn you \u00a3100 for a few hours, and teach English in a kindergarten. It&apos;s great fun and you get \u00a316 an hour \u2013 which goes a long way here. &quot;I&apos;m about to travel with my Chinese friends to see one of their home towns, Xiamen, which I&apos;m really excited about.

If you are even slightly concerned about the environment, prepare to be depressed. If you are Jeremy Clarkson, start rubbing your hands with glee now. First, the number of cars on the planet has just passed the billion mark. Second, almost half of the new growth is in China. Third, Toyota managed to sell only one Prius in China last year. That&apos;s right. The world&apos;s most commercially successful hybrid car has found only one buyer in the fastest growing market. SUV sales, by contrast, are surging. No wonder we are choking. Despite all the promises of green growth and reduced emissions, traditional car sales are accelerating, while efforts to shift towards &quot;greener&quot; hybrid and electric vehicles are stuck in neutral, particularly in the place where it matters most. According to the trade journal, Ward&apos;s, a record 35m new vehicles were sold worldwide last year. That is 95,500 extra cars being added to the global traffic jam every day.  Most of the new demand came from developing nations, particularly China. But the country&apos;s efforts to promote &quot;green&quot; cars has been lagging. This is not just affecting Toyota. It had been hoped that generous government subsidies and policy support would help domestic manufacturers like BYD to leapfrog better established overseas rivals by mass producing electric cars.  But BYD have scaled back their ambitions after failing to find a market due to cost and technical concerns.

It noted too the poor performance of the Prius, which notched up a sole sale in a year when 13.8m new passenger cars were registered in China. Among them were 850,000 SUVs, a rise of 24%. Luxury car sales were also on the up and up, as I noted in an earlier article.  The big brands would like more of the same - and argue there is room for growth. Only one in 16 Chinese people own a car, which is less than half the global average.

From the beginning of August, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Wielezynski, a beekeeper in the M\u00e9doc region of France, spends every weekend tirelessly repeating the same futile gestures. He positions himself in front of his hives armed with a fly swat and tries to crush the enormous bee-eating hornets. These are not just any hornets, but the Asian Vespa velutina. &quot;I know it&apos;s useless, because a dozen more will arrive as soon as my back is turned, but I have to do something,&quot; said Wielezynski, president of the Gironde and Aquitaine beekeepers&apos; association. &quot;I love my bees and I can&apos;t just stand by and see them being eaten up without doing anything about it.&quot; The attacks are quite impressive. Groups of five or 10 hornets hover in front of a hive waiting for the return of the forager bees. &quot;It&apos;s like a barbarian invasion, they destroy everything in their path,&quot; said Richard Legrand, vice-president of the beekeepers association in Dordogne, one of the worst-hit departments in France. Once the Vespa velutina has got hold of its prey, it attaches itself to a branch and begins its sinister dismantling of the bee. First the head falls to the ground, then the wings and the legs. The hornet keeps only the protein-rich thorax, which it carries back to its nest for the hungry larvae. From September, when there are fewer bees guarding the hives, the hornets even enter them and eat the brood. In any case, by then the bees are too frightened to go out. It&apos;s a vicious circle, according to Wielezynski. &quot;If they don&apos;t go out there&apos;s less food and water in the hive, so the queen stops laying eggs and the bee population grows weaker and older. Then it&apos;s far more likely to die before the onset of winter.&quot; The Asian hornets \u2013 distinguished by their yellow feet \u2013 first appeared in Tonneins in the Lot-et-Garonne department of south-west France in 2004. They probably started with a few queens hibernating in some Chinese pottery imported by a local bonsai producer. &quot;We&apos;re almost certain that they are from China, probably a province near Shanghai,&quot; said Claire Villemant, entomologist at the Natural History Museum and co-ordinator of a research project financed by the European Apiculture Programme. The results of the research published by the museum last June show how the insect has spread from three nests recorded in 2004 in a single department to nearly 2,000 in 2010 across 39 departments. Two nests have recently been reported in Spain for the first time. &quot;Every year they spread by some 100km, with a very large presence in Aquitaine, where the climate is as good as in their original habitat in China, if not better,&quot; observed Quentin Rome, a researcher at the Natural History Museum. According to the study, the hornet is likely to acclimatise in most European countries, especially along the Atlantic coast and the northern Mediterranean. Eastern Europe and Turkey may also be overrun in the future. Yet the Asian hornet has not been classified as a pest. It causes considerable damage to amateur beekeepers, but the professional ones, who account for 60% of France&apos;s honey production, have been spared overall. There is also the matter of stings. In the M\u00e9doc region last June a 50-year-old woman died from Asian hornet stings. Nevertheless there does not appear to be any specific public health problem and hospitals in Agen, Bergerac and Bordeaux, near the regions with the highest hornet populations, have not observed an increase in cases. &quot;Vespa velutina is not usually aggressive when alone, but is potentially dangerous and may attack if it feels threatened and is with its fellow hornets,&quot; explained Denis Thiery, head of a research programme in Bordeaux&apos;s National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRA). His unit has been working on ways to trap the hornet. To date no entirely reliable technique has been found.&quot;In any case, we&apos;ve got to be realistic,&quot; said Villemant. &quot;That species is now part of our own, so we&apos;re going to have to learn to live with it.&quot; This article originally appeared in Le Monde", "tags": ["Invasive species", "Bees", "France"], "publicationDate": "2011-08-23T13:02:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/24/china-cars-green-vehicles", "sentences": ["In a report earlier this week, IHS Automotive, a Shanghai-based consultancy, said the takeup for such vehicles was far behind the government&apos;s time-frame."], "title": "China's love affair with the car shuns green vehicles", "article": "Beijing used to be famous for the millions of bicycles thronging its streets. But it is the success of the motor car there and in other Chinese mega-cities that has now tipped the number of cars in the world over the 1bn mark. According to a report by the trade journal Ward&apos;s, 35m new cars and lorries were sold worldwide last year \u2013 the second-biggest increase ever recorded. That is 95,500 extra vehicles being added to the global traffic jam every day. Almost half of the new growth is in China, which recently overtook the US as the world&apos;s biggest car market thanks to the sales of 13.8m new passenger vehicles. Despite the surge in sales, car ownership in China is still only half the global average. But hopes that the country will also become a pioneer in the shift towards &quot;clean car&quot; technology have suffered a setback as the Chinese show little sign of interest in electric and hybrid vehicles despite ambitious government plans. Last year, Toyota managed to sell only one Prius \u2013 the world&apos;s most commercially successful hybrid car \u2013 in the fastest-growing market. Sports utility vehicle sales, by contrast, are surging. This is not just affecting Toyota. It had been hoped that government subsidies and policy support would help China&apos;s manufacturers, such as BYD, to leapfrog better established overseas rivals by mass-producing electric cars. But BYD has scaled back its ambitions after failing to find a market because of costs, safety concerns and underdeveloped battery technology. Reflecting the lack of progress, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao recently published an article in a Communist party journal calling for a rethink of China&apos;s &quot;road map&quot; towards alternative powertrain vehicles \u2013 those that do not rely only on a conventional internal combustion engine. In a report earlier this week, IHS Automotive, a Shanghai-based consultancy, said the takeup for such vehicles was far behind the government&apos;s time-frame. It noted, too, the lack of interest in the Prius, which has witnessed sales in China fall from about 200 in 2009 to just one in 2010. It is not known who made that solitary purchase \u2013 industry analysts said it was unlikely to be an individual as there is little technical support for the model. &quot;It may be a domestic rival that bought the hybrid to strip it down and see how it works,&quot; said one industry observer who did not want to be named. Among registrations of new passenger cars were 850,000 SUVs \u2013 a rise of 24% \u2013 including 425 Hummers. Since then car sales have flattened but the luxury sector is still surging. Thanks largely to its business in China, Mercedes announced earlier this year the highest monthly worldwide car sales in the company&apos;s 110-year history. BMW, Audi and Rolls-Royce are also recording strong sales which have pushed China to the forefront of their global strategies. This runs directly opposite to the government&apos;s stated goal of creating a more equal, environmentally friendly nation, suggesting a change of strategy may be needed. The state is unlikely to completely abandon its promotion of &quot;clean&quot; car technology, but it may have to revise its plans. The government&apos;s current aim is to put 1m &quot;new energy&quot; vehicles on the roads by 2015 \u2013 electrics and plug-in hybrids \u2013 but this now looks overambitious. Despite subsidies of 60,000 yuan (\u00a35,700) for pure electric vehicles and 50,000 yuan (\u00a34,700) for plug-in hybrids in five pilot cities, there have been few buyers because regular cars are still cheaper and more reliable. According to IHS Automotive, electric vehicles sales are unlikely to reach a tenth of the state&apos;s target over the next five years. Rather than jump directly to electric cars, it now expects bureaucrats to pay more attention to hybrid cars and fuel-efficient conventional vehicles. Although &quot;in the long term pure [electric vehicles] may still become mainstream, it is welcome to see the government slowly but surely recognising that its targets are inflated,&quot; IHS noted. Many are still betting on the Chinese market. GreenTech Automotive of the US recently announced a venture with Shengyang ZhongRui to create a plant in Inner Mongolia with capacity to build 300,000 electric and hybrid cars a year. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of cars and motorcycles in China increased twentyfold. In the next 20 years it is forecast to more than double again, which means there will be more cars in China in 2030 than there were in the entire world in 2000. The big brands argue that there is room for growth. Only one in 16 Chinese people owns a car, which is less than half the global average. If the country were to match the three-in-four ownership levels of the US, that would mean an extra 900m vehicles.

Thousands of performers have put on hundreds of shows, awards have been presented and at least a bazillion flyers distributed, and the city is surveying the wreckage and hoping that next year doesn&apos;t come around too soon. The consensus seems to be that 2011 was the year no one quite found that festival-defining needle in the haystack (personally, I blame the rain). Our comedy critic Brian Logan noted that plenty of comics appeared more politically engaged than before \u2013 one reason being the riots, of course \u2013 but equally that it was raucous, unashamedly silly comedy that won out, not least when Adam Riches took the Edinburgh comedy awards on Saturday. Lyn Gardner, meanwhile, was simultaneously depressed by theatre shows&apos; use of newfangled gadgetry (&quot;the low point,&quot; she wrote, &quot;was standing lost in Edinburgh staring at a mobile phone in Blast Theory&apos;s A Machine to See With&quot;) and encouraged by the crop of fine young companies (notably Curious Directive, Junction 25, Bootworks and the Wrong Crowd) who&apos;d managed to weather the financial pressure afflicting theatre companies everywhere and put on great work on the Fringe. The book festival has only just finished, but seems to have delivered some genuine gems to remember \u2013 from AS Byatt confessing she&apos;s a secret Terry Pratchett addict to Tobias Wolff admitting that he still feels like he&apos;s faking it. If you want a quick flavour of how this year&apos;s bookfest has shaped up, I heartily recommend tuning in to our special festival podcasts, which contain such delights as Ian Rankin on great Scottish writing and a journey into gothic Edinburgh. Myself, I agree that this was a festival of mixed messages: the international festival managed to deliver both triumphs (Tim Supple&apos;s One Thousand and One Nights and the National Ballet of China&apos;s The Revenge of Prince Zi Dan, a brilliantly mad Shanghai Peking Opera version of Hamlet) and turkeys (a one-man King Lear that was roughly as awful as it sounds; an over-slick, uninspiring version of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle). Of the Fringe shows I took part in, Dance Marathon made me think afresh about the pleasures and perils of dancing without quite carrying me to new places; Translunar Paradise, a puppet-based show by the young, LeCoq-trained company Theatre Ad Infinitum, was beautiful without ever being transformational. Even those reliably controversial Belgian provocateurs Ontroerend Goed seemed to have misjudged the mood of the audience. In one of those curious Fringe coincidences, my two standout shows of the festival were Welsh through and through: National Theatre Wales and Told By an Idiot&apos;s superbly acted and supremely directed Dark Philosophers, which reached Edinburgh on tour, and one of the last shows I saw, Llwyth (Tribe) co-produced by Sherman Cymru and the Welsh-language Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru \u2013 a company whose work I suspect we&apos;ll be hearing much more of under its new artistic director Arwel Gruffydd. But I should also reserve a final word for New Yorkers (and old festival favourites) the Team, whose Mission Drift \u2013 a cowboy-inspired musical about capitalism \u2013 was, somehow, both brilliantly bonkers and profoundly haunting. (Plus they won Dance Marathon on the night I attended, which surely deserves some kind of acknowledgment.) I&apos;m sure you have hundreds more highlights; we&apos;re collecting them over here.

So a new global survey suggests the glass is two-thirds full. Sixty nine percent of citizens in 51 nations around the world are concerned about climate change, and that two-to-one majority is essentially unchanged over the last four years. But there&apos;s less cheer in the details of the survey, conducted by Nielsen and available here (first link, free registration required). The global climate negotiations, still the only real game in town, are dominated by the US and China. The Nielsen survey finds that less than half of Americans (48%) are concerned about global warming, compared to 51% in 2009 and 62% in 2007. With 14 point fall in 4 years, one can see why Republican climate sceptics feel comfortable rejecting the idea that every nation on earth (including their own) has accepted: that human activities are causing climate change and that the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions is pressing. More surprisingly perhaps, opinion in China is also on the slide. Concern fell from 77% in 2009 to 64% in 2011, putting it back nearer to 2007&apos;s figure of 60%.      People pose for photos on a hazy day in Shanghai where severe air pollution is a problem. Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters    The Guardian&apos;s Asia environment correspondent, Jonathan Watts, tells me from Beijing that public awareness of environmental issues was rising until 2009, albeit from a very low base. &quot;Local issues such as pollution were foremost, but in 2008 and 2009 climate change rose up the political and media agenda ahead of the Copenhagen summit&quot; attended by 120 world leaders, he says. But it has since slipped and Watts says Chinese journalists are finding it harder to interest their editors in the climate change issue.  But turning to two other big beasts at the climate talks, the opposite trend is seen. In India, concern about global warming is at 86%, up from 80% in 2007, and concern in Europe has risen from 58% to 68% since 2009. The most concerned region of the world is Latin America (90%), followed by the combined Middle East-Africa region used by Nielsen, where concern has gone up 11% to 80% in two years. I think the Latin American case is instructive. &quot;Latin America has experienced a number of distressing and impactful environmental events over the last several years, and the region&apos;s consumers are increasingly attributing these events to broad climate change,&quot; says Arturo Garc\u00eda, president at Nielsen Latin America. &quot;People are expressing clear concern about unusual weather patterns including increased rainfall, hurricanes, and floods in some parts of Latin America, and severe droughts in others.&quot;  Where extreme weather has the worst impacts, concern is rising, it seems, which is hardly surprising. Take a look at the full list of countries in the graph above. At the highly concerned end are Thailand, Mexico and Indonesia, all places with relatively limited capacity to cope with climate change and in regions expected to be hard hit. You should note that this survey was conducted online and only included countries with at least 60% internet access, ruling out all of the poorest and hardest hit nations, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa. At the opposite end, the least concerned, we have wealthy Norway, Australia and the UK, all places that are not yet really feeling the bite of climate change and anxious that their rich lifestyles might be affected by climate action. The economic recession has already harmed western wealth and the spectre that haunts the green movement has returned, that green policies are luxuries only affordable in good times. The UK Treasury certainly clings to this view, despite the intolerable pressure humanity is now putting on the planet&apos;s finite resources and the opportunity green growth presents. Maxwell Boykoff, senior visiting research associate from Oxford University&apos;s Environmental Change Institute says of the survey: &quot;Focus on immediate worries such as job security, local school quality, crime and economic well-being have all diminished media attention for climate stories in the past two years. In the face of other pressing concerns, a public &apos;caring capacity&apos; for climate change has been tested. Without continued attention paid to global warming/climate change in the media, such concerns may have faded from the collective public conscience.&quot; Of the 20% of global citizens unconcerned about global warming, about half think there are &quot;more urgent and serious matters in the world today&quot;. Of the same 20%, two-fifths think humans aren&apos;t causing climate change at all. The good news there is that climate scepticism remains a fringe view, at less than 10% of global citizens.  The bad news is that in many of the nations with the biggest carbon footprints - US, UK and Australia (per capita) and China (total emissions) - plenty of people seem to think that climate change is a problem that can dealt with another day.", "tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Green politics", "Global climate talks", "Global development", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2011-08-30T13:18:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/aug/30/wikileaks-reveals-us-hopes-for-environmental-activism-china", "sentences": ["I have waded more than half way through the 3,000-odd documents from the Beijing embassy and consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chengdu that were released by Wikileaks last week."], "title": "Wikileaks reveals US hopes for environmental activism in China | Jonathan Watts", "article": "I have waded more than half way through the 3,000-odd documents from the Beijing embassy and consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chengdu that were released by Wikileaks last week. As I have reported in recent days, the 2006-2008 cables contains some intriguing nuggets about China&apos;s environment, including strong US concerns about nuclear safety, tiger conservation and, pollution.  Here I want to flag up another topic - civil society - and how it is reported to Washington. In 2007, US diplomats reported on the protests against the paraxylene (PX) chemical plant in Xiamen, Fujian province. They were heartened by the display of people power, which forced the local government to move a 10.8 bn yuan (\u00a39.9bn) factory that would have almost doubled the city&apos;s GDP. A cable from the Guangzhou consulate on 7th May said this event showed a rising civic consciousness and a more responsive government:   This case highlights the growing public awareness of environmental issues in China and the willingness of citizens to voice their complaints. In this case, the threat of public protests, and the resulting media attention, proved more effective than a petition to the central government. Though the future of the project is unclear, it appears that the Xiamen government - which prides itself on its environmental activism - is sensitive to the charge that it has ignored environmental protection for the sake of economic growth. (Full cable)  Less than a year later, however, the same consulate was decidedly less upbeat after another demonstration against a chemical plant in Fujian. This one in Dongshan ended with baton-wielding police, censorship and a harsher response from the authorities:  ...the government&apos;s use of traditional tactics - including media blackouts and the deployment of baton-wielding police -- suggests growing official inflexibility, especially after the government&apos;s public defeat in Xiamen. (Full cable)    This shows how difficult it can be to track the direction of a government that steps forward one day on environment activism and then back the next. That confusing dance was evident recently in the very different official responses to the middle-class demonstration in urban Dalian and protests by farmers in Yunnan, as I noted last month.  There are many other intriguing topics in the cables. Environmentally-minded Wikigeeks may also be interested in the railway to Tibet and its possible link to mining , on algae outbreaks  and the effort to clear them, on the Nansha Petrochemical plant, the links between water and ethnicity and US approval of fired environment minister Xie Zhenhua&apos;s appointment as vice minister in the National Reform and Development Commission. It is interesting too to compare the approach of diplomats and journalists. In many cases, consulates were following up on stories that had previously broken in the media. On other occasions, they went into more scientific depth than is usually possible in a news story. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the relatively low security classification of the cables, there is little evidence of a network of high-level contacts (though, I share concerns that Wikileaks has not done enough to protect the identities of a few sources who might be at risk). The analysis of emerging trends suggests that US diplomats - at least at the level of these nonclassified cables - often struggle as much as reporters to get reliable information or to understand which way the policy wind is blowing.  One striking feature was the disproportionate number of environment-related cables came from the Guangzhou consulate. where someone appeared to have taken the initiative on wildlife conservation, civil society and pollution issues. By contrast, it was striking how little environment news was passed on by other US diplomatic posts, particularly given that this was a period when China became the world&apos;s biggest emitter, biggest source of pollution into the Pacific and a driver for resource extraction around the globe. Perhaps this reflects the personalities of the diplomats. Alternatively this apparent discrepency might be explained by cables I have yet to see. I am travelling now, but will trawl further through the Wikileaks pages when I return. Though several years old, many topics remain relevent and these diplomatic documents are a useful insight into US diplomatic perceptions of what is happening in China.

But the story it tells is far less innovative than the design. In the museum&apos;s narrative, China&apos;s modern period of history opens with the opium war, the original sin of western imperialism in East Asia that forced China to open itself to a century of humiliation, conquest and exploitation until Chairman Mao came to sweep all that away. It&apos;s titled &quot;The Road to Rejuvenation&quot;, but it could just as easily be called &quot;1842 and all that&quot;. This version of the past says more about contemporary Chinese politics, still drawing on China&apos;s history as a victim of western imperialism, than it does about the reality of the clash between the 19th century&apos;s greatest land and naval empires. Even in a 21st-century museum, the stain of a history more than 150 years old is central. Yet not all the simplified views are on the Chinese side. One of the most persistent excuses for the British invasion of China, when it is discussed at all, was that it opened up a closed, xenophobic empire to the outside world. Actually this was never true. The China of the Qing dynasty was at the heart of an international system looking west and east, expanding its territory by conquest and by treaty in central Asia, and building contacts with Korea, south-east Asia and even Japan (never quite as closed as its shogun rulers would have liked to believe). China also took part in an intellectual and commercial network that went beyond Asia, as the influx of blue-and-white pottery in English country houses in the 18th century easily demonstrates. And long before the British arrived, China was even ruled by outsiders, the nomadic Manchus who had galloped in from the north-east. By the time of the opium war, they had spent nearly two centuries combining traditional Manchu culture at court with the Chinese traditions of governance across the empire. Julia Lovell&apos;s new history of the opium war is a welcome piece of myth-busting. It uses a wealth of Chinese and British sources to tell, in her words, a &quot;tragicomedy&quot; that is &quot;far more chaotically interesting&quot; than the ideological positions on both sides might suggest. The tragedy part is as simple as it was in 1839. British opium from East India was brought into China in huge amounts from the early 19th century. In the 1830s, concern about the drug&apos;s effects on the population and economy led the Qing dynasty to ban it, and they ordered a senior official, Lin Zexu, to blockade British opium ships in Canton harbour until they agreed to hand over their cargo. In Britain, this was seen as an insult to the Crown (much of the opium was produced by the East India Company), and a fleet under Admiral Charles Elliot was sent out to teach the Chinese a lesson. British military technology soon smashed through Chinese defences, and after three years of coastal fighting, the war ended with the Nanjing treaty of 1842 which handed over Hong Kong island and opened up the interior to trade and Christian missionaries. For the next century, China would be subject to further invasions and humiliations, which ended only with the termination of special western rights in China in 1943 under Chiang Kai-shek (not under Mao in 1949, as the Chinese Communist party tends to suggest). The comedy part lies in the characters whom Lovell paints with affection and a dry wit. Lin, the upright official tasked with destroying the opium he had seized, had &quot;self-belief&quot; and a &quot;passion for freight management&quot;. Lord Palmerston, who sent the fleet, is described as &quot;Free Trader, libertine, arch-villain of Chinese historiography&quot;. The gulf in diplomatic niceties between the two sides was shown particularly starkly in the run-up to the signing of the treaty, when one high official insisted that he must first feed sugar-plums directly into the mouth of the British negotiator Sir Henry Pottinger, who showed, in the words of a witness, &quot;determined resignation after he found remonstrances were of no avail&quot;. The book also paints the many shades of grey: for instance, voices such as William Gladstone, who declared &quot;a war more unjust in its origin, a war more calculated \u2026 to cover this country in permanent disgrace, I do not know, and I have not read of.&quot; And the Chinese officials, from Lin to the high Manchu official Qishan, come over not as arrogant xenophobes but as worried, sincere men faced with their civilisation in existential crisis. The opium war did help to bring about the collapse of the last Chinese dynasty, a fact worth remembering in 2011, exactly a century since the revolution that deposed the last emperor. But their significance was to hasten violent changes already under way. The expansion of China&apos;s territory and population, without any increase in the size of the bureaucracy (shades of current debates about austerity versus spending in the west), meant that government functions had become less competent and more corrupt. And while the opium war itself had a direct impact on relatively few Chinese, one of the results of the opening up of China demanded by the 1842 treaty was the Taiping war of 1856-64, when a lunatic inspired by Christian missionary theology managed to spark off one of the bloodiest civil wars in history, which killed some 20 million people. Throughout the 20th century, the opium war has remained a rallying-cry for Chinese nationalists seeking to overcome &quot;national humiliation&quot; and restore China to its rightful place in the world. Lovell&apos;s book is part of a trend in understanding the British empire and China&apos;s role in it. Earlier this year, Robert Bickers&apos;s The Scramble for China gave a compelling account of the aftermath of the opium war, which saw such a heightened presence of British missionaries and adventurers that the Shanghai lifestyle was nicknamed &quot;the Mock Raj&quot;. Niall Ferguson&apos;s recent Civilization revived the argument that there was a distinct western imperial modernity that was more successful than any other system from the 18th century onward, but he framed the book as a comparison with China in the 17th century and in the early 21st, a device that would have seemed unlikely just two decades ago. Lovell&apos;s major contribution is to remind us of the different worldviews involved: not so much a clash of civilisations but two sets of incompatible software, as we read, over and over again, a British politician give one view of events, and a Chinese official define it in completely different terms. The sense of an unfolding tragedy, explicable but inexorable, runs through the book, making it a gripping read as well as an important one. The opium war is capable of creating waves in China even today. One academic, Mao Haijian at Peking University, recently had the temerity to question the official Chinese narrative of the opium war in his book The Collapse of the Empire, rehabilitating the Qing official Qishan, generally regarded as the weak villain of the piece who failed to stand up to the British, and criticising Lin, traditionally regarded as the upright hero of the story. His book was subjected to a storm of criticism, but the debate did not result in the purging of the dissident scholar, as it would have done in an earlier era. The signs of a livelier debate among Chinese academics make the account of the war in the new national museum even more disappointing. Britain may have forgotten the history of its Chinese empire, but the Communist party also continues to be highly selective in what it chooses to remember. The conquest of China by Mao in 1949 was not an endpoint to the story started in 1842, but brought its own horrors of history with it: the Great Leap Forward and the famine that killed millions of people (described in Frank Dik\u00f6tter&apos;s recent Samuel Johnson-prizewinning book), the cultural revolution (officially repudiated and hardly mentioned in the new museum), and the killings of non-violent students and workers just a few hundred metres from the site of the museum in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. This book serves a crucial purpose in reminding Britain of a shameful episode in its past that still shapes relations with China today. But official China could also learn from it that reconciliation with the past comes by understanding its complexities, rather than turning it into a simple morality tale.

Dan Martin&apos;s episode eight blog The Gathering We approach Miracle Day&apos;s final furlong two months after the events of the Colasanto residence (although we don&apos;t get told this until halfway through), with the Torchwood team scattered across the world, divided as the storylines begin to merge together. That&apos;s fairly typical of a team that&apos;s been so hapless this year. Deported back to Wales once again, Gwen Cooper, the world&apos;s least fuel-conscientious secret agent, is now looting pharmacies for her neighbourhood&apos;s medication, like Robin Hood via Tank Girl via Harriet Harman. Actually, this stuff works pretty well. The pre-credits bit with the old man bemoaning his poor Category One friend who only had a bad back recalls some of the funny, quirky Welshness from the old days. The inevitable conclusion to this arc, as she faces up to finally losing her dad is actually genuinely heartbreaking. Back in the US, Rex at least seems happy, relieved to be working with some professionals again as the audience. Now he&apos;s not being constantly chided with passive aggressive flirting by Jack, he&apos;s developed a new bromance with the chain-smoking Q from Star Trek (it can&apos;t kill you any more, did anyone mention that?), and Q from Star Trek seems perfectly happy to let Rex chase up any red herring he pleases. The improbable resolution to all this looks like something to do with a pulp fiction novelist from the 1930s and the wiping away of the records of the three families. The CIA sure looks a fun place to work under the Miracle. Meanwhile, Oswald Danes, the most wanted man on the planet, has boarded a flight to Cardiff undetected, posed as a pizza delivery man to infiltrate the Cooper household, gurned his way into an uneasy position of trust and is now himself a de facto part of the Torchwood team. What&apos;s the betting that next week&apos;s final awful moral challenge will emerge when it turns out to be Oswald saving the day? Whatever. We&apos;re off to Shanghai for the finale. Shall we kill Hitler or something? Anything? Aliens. Finally aliens Of course it falls to Jilly Kitzenger to finally show us some aliens. Displaying a heroic lack of self-awareness or regard for her own safety, she accepts a job from the families and waits in China for two months for one meeting with a child-man apparently seconded from work experience at Apple who directs her to the Blessing, a gnarly red tree-barky thing bisecting the planet from Shanghai to Beunos Aires. Obviously. Samesex watch The Scotland sequence with Esther briefly made me wonder whether Jack was about to revert to fancying the female form, until Torchwood&apos;s inbuilt plot swerve which resulted in Rex and Esther being set up to get together in the finale. Meanwhile, Evil Charlotte is revealed as a lesbian. Evil Lesbians! Is there no gay man&apos;s fantasy that Miracle Day will not plunder? Transatlantic tension Back in Wales, with all the might of the CIA and Torchwood&apos;s scavenged alien tech, it&apos;s stoic, bumbling Rhys who has the presence of mind to work out the thing about Shanghai and Buenos Aires being on opposite sides of the planet.

China is one of the fastest growing markets for tablets and is home to more than 900 million mobile phone subscribers. Analysts said the tie-up could be Dell&apos;s way to revive its flagging tablet business. Baidu has already announced that it is developing versions of Google&apos;s Android mobile operating system which it has tailored to its own use. Android can be altered to remove Google&apos;s search and apps as the default \u2013 which Baidu, as the largest search engine in China and a bitter rival of Google, would seek to do.  But analysts were not hopeful about Dell&apos;s prospects. &quot;I suspect this is just Dell, who has a lot of problems on the mobile and tablet front, grasping at straws to get any kind of publicity that it can to make its product more attractive,&quot; said Michael Clendenin, managing director of technology consultancy RedTech Advisors. &quot;Ultimately in China, I still think it is Apple&apos;s game, still for the iPad and iPhone.&quot;  Dell declined to give a timeline for the launch of the devices, but local Chinese media on Tuesday quoted sources saying that it may be as early as November.  &quot;We have a partnership with Baidu and you know we have the Streak 5 tablet, so the partnership will be in that space,&quot; a Dell spokeswoman told Reuters on Tuesday, adding that both companies were also cooperating on the mobile handset front.  Dell&apos;s Streak 5 is a 5in Android-based smartphone-like tablet (or tablet-like smartphone) which was discontinued in the US last month. The Dell tie-up underscores Baidu&apos;s efforts to widen its product offerings and leverage its near-80% share of the country&apos;s search market, the world&apos;s largest.  Baidu launched a new mobile application platform last week and offered a glimpse of its upcoming mobile operating system which it hopes will serve a growing number of users accessing the internet from smartphones and tablet computers.  Baidu said it already had partnerships with Dell and other device makers and declined to comment on the new tie-up. Dell said the partnership with Baidu involved the company&apos;s new mobile platform.  A Dell-Baidu tieup would be the latest in a series of developments re-shaping the mobile devices market.  Last month, Google said it would acquire Motorola Mobility Holdings for $12.5bn (\u00a37.7bn), in a move that could put Google into a lower-margin manufacturing business and pit it against as many as 38 other handset companies that use Google&apos;s Android software. Google has not said whether it will divest the manufacturing element of Motorola Mobility: it has indicated that its main aim is to gain patents owned by Motorola to fight lawsuits against Android coming from Apple and Microsoft. &quot;Dell has got nothing to lose, they don&apos;t have a big mobile presence, so by partnering Baidu, they will probably get some momentum for their mobile products,&quot; said Sandy Shen, a Shanghai-based research director with Gartner.  Dell has chosen China to launch new products before. In 2009, Dell announced it will enter the smartphone market starting in China before moving into Brazil.  Dell said in June it had chosen to launch its new 10in Android tablet in China this summer, passing up on a US and European launch, in a sign of the market&apos;s growing importance to the company.  Dell&apos;s China sales grew 22% in the first quarter while its retail presence in China exceeds 10,000 sales points. The Far East is Dell&apos;s strongest growth market, reflecting general trends in the personal computer market where North America and Europe have seen slowdowns in sales of Windows PCs, a key market for Dell. Tablet sales are still seeing strong growth in those areas, but principally for Apple&apos;s iPad. The deal is unlikely to have an impact on Apple&apos;s quest for the hearts and minds of smartphone customers, analysts said. Technology heavyweights have failed so far to take a significant bite out of the iPad&apos;s success. Hewlett-Packard Co said it would kill its TouchPad after just seven weeks on shelves, joining Dell&apos;s Streak 5 in the tablet graveyard.

The full research has not been published yet, but the answers revealed so far are quite enlightening. Surprisingly, perhaps, our magnates, entrepreneurs and SMEs are not clamouring for extra, jet set airport capacity, whether at Heathrow or some bomb-haunted &quot;Boris Island&quot; in the estuary. What they truly crave is the dull, difficult stuff that Londoners in general long for too. The survey of hundreds of London-based companies found large percentages putting improving public transport links, reducing road works disruption and cutting strikes on the Underground high on their priorities lists. They want less crime too. Who doesn&apos;t? More contentiously they think Londoners &quot;are unfairly subsidizing other parts of the UK&quot; through tax redistribution. Most tellingly, a massive 89% of London executives believe that &quot;London is too expensive a place to live if you earn an average salary.&quot;  Our mayoral candidates will surely take note of these findings, not least because there&apos;s yet to be a London mayor who didn&apos;t want London business on his side. Grand ambitions for mega-growth would look flimsy otherwise, and how very handy private sector pressure comes in when schmoozing the government for public cash. Tory incumbent Boris Johnson publicly lectured our parsimonious government on the need for investment funds, saying that no booming London meant no national recovery. He warns constantly of &quot;emerging global super-cities like Shanghai threatening to bulldoze all before them.&quot;  Was &quot;Red&quot; Ken Livingstone so different? No. One of the first things he did after first claiming the keys to City Hall in 2000 was make friends in the City and lobby group London First. Such backing helped him to crowbar mountains of money out of the Treasury. He won plaudits from everyone from KPMG to the editor of the FT for knowing what world-spanning free enterprise requires. Does all this prove that a glorious, metropolitan convergence of interests exists between the interests of labour and capital? Should London be theorised as a paradigm for Blairism in one city? Not so fast. But the views expressed by business do rather confirm that healthy market mechanisms in big urban locations depend heavily on sound urban policy.  In some ways, London is delivering: our public transport has its flaws, but at least it&apos;s plentiful and hasn&apos;t suffered too badly from spending cuts. By contrast, that cost-of-living concern underlines the depth of London&apos;s housing crisis, which government policy looks unlikely to help end. London employers, concentrated in the centre, don&apos;t want existing or potential low and middle-income staff priced out to distant, cheaper suburbs or not even giving up on living and working in London at all. Can business be recruited to the cause of fixing such profound problems? Mike Tuffrey, the Liberal Democrat AM who (sorry, Brian) I had hoped would be the Lib Dem candidate, had some thoughts on this when I interviewed him back in May&quot;   I think it&apos;s time for big business to live up to its responsibilities and to become a partner in the growth and development of our city. They&apos;ve been the missing player in the debates we&apos;ve been having over the last ten or fifteen years. Take the City. Londoners and the whole country are paying a huge price for the mis-regulation of the financial services sector, but the answer to that isn&apos;t to just bash it. We have a world class industry here. But instead of them coming up with esoteric financial instrument or the cleverest way of minimising their taxes, why aren&apos;t the best brains in the City pumping money into social housing?  Perhaps the next question for London business is not &quot;What can London do for you?&quot; but &quot;What can you do for London?&quot; I wonder what its reply would be.", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "Ken Livingstone", "Politics", "London", "London politics", "Business", "London mayoral election 2012", "Mayoral elections"], "publicationDate": "2011-09-08T17:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/sep/09/free-school-opponents-defending-failure-says-cameron", "sentences": ["If they&apos;re seeing excellence as standard in cities like Shanghai, why can&apos;t we see that in cities like London?"], "title": "Free school opponents 'defending failure', says David Cameron", "article": "Opponents of free schools are defending an educational establishment that has let down pupils and accepts failure as a fact of life, David Cameron has said.

Yes, this would be a tough measure \u2013 but we urgently need to restore order and respect in the classroom, and I don&apos;t want ideas like this to be off the table.&quot; Cameron was speaking at the end of a week in which 24 free schools, created under legislation enacted in the coalition&apos;s first few months, opened. The schools, free from local authority control, have greater freedoms than the academies established by Tony Blair. The prime minister was scathing about critics of free schools who say they will divert resources from existing schools. &quot;Those opposing free schools are simply defending the establishment \u2013 an establishment that has failed pupils and infuriated parents for too long,&quot; he said. &quot;Those who support free schools are on the side of parents, charities and committed teachers who are trying to make things better on the side of the choice, freedom and competition that will really drive up standards.&quot; Cameron was highly critical of an education establishment that he said had tolerated failure. &quot;For a long time in this country, there has been a scandalous acceptance of under-performing schools,&quot; he added. &quot;It&apos;s the attitude that says some schools \u2013 especially in the poorest areas \u2013 will always be bad. &quot;That meekly accepts educational failure as a fact of life. Well, I&apos;m sorry \u2013 that&apos;s patronising nonsense.&quot; The prime minister said the government would drive up standards by: \u2022 Ending &quot;wrong-headed methods&quot; that have failed pupils and making sure every teacher has the resources to deliver synthetic phonics teaching. &quot;That&apos;s the method that&apos;s proven to work \u2013 and that&apos;s how we can eliminate illiteracy in our country,&quot; he said. \u2022 Raising the bar on GCSE results. By the end of the current parliament, a school where less than 50% of pupils are achieving five good GCSEs will be deemed to be underperforming. The last government set this at 30%. \u2022 A greater focus on rigorous subjects tested in a rigorous way. &quot;Our curriculum review will mean we are really demanding in what we expect our children to learn,&quot; he said. \u2022 A focus on tackling &quot;coasting schools&quot;. The prime minister said two schools in deprived parts of London \u2013 Burlington Danes Academy in Hammersmith, and Walworth Academy in Southwark \u2013 had achieved impressive results at GCSE. But in Oxfordshire and Surrey, relatively affluent counties represented by the prime minister and the education secretary, Michael Gove, only 16 state secondary schools did better than the two London schools. &quot;&quot;Why is there this difference?&quot; Cameron said. &quot;Why are these schools coasting along?&quot; The prime minister said that, by the end of next year, the government would have transformed about 150 failing secondary schools and 200 failing primaries into academies. &quot;Britain is a modern, developed country. If they&apos;re seeing excellence as standard in cities like Shanghai, why can&apos;t we see that in cities like London? &quot;We&apos;ve got the resources, we&apos;ve got the fantastic teachers, we know what works. Now we just have to have the will \u2013 the energy \u2013 to make this happen and, believe me, we have it.&quot; Christine Blower, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the largest teachers&apos; union, said: &quot;The prime minister&apos;s vision of an education system which delivers the best for everyone is one with which we agree. &quot;The union simply does not accept that the fragmentation of our education system is the right answer. The free schools and academy programme are a divisive and unnecessary experiment with this. &quot;To ensure that every young person has the very best chance to both reach their full academic potential and to be a &apos;good citizen&apos;, we need well-ordered schools within a coherent education service supported by youth provision, and a range of local support services.

Dan Martin&apos;s episode nine blog The Blood Line After 10 often-painful weeks, Miracle Day wheezes to a close. And you know what? It was actually pretty enjoyable. Let yourself go with the nonsense and at its finale this series showed the best of itself, with explosions, bloodshed and forced philosophical standoffs at every turn. This being an Russell T Davies show, his tropes were everywhere. The baddies (are these still the families?) turned out to be evil capitalists trying to control the economy, in an admittedly long-winded way.

Well, quite. At the same time, the emotional story with Gwen&apos;s Dad was resolved with actually quite a bit of class. Children of Earth, a series after which everybody very much wanted to see Torchwood come back, ended with a resolution that could have very easily wrapped the series up. Miracle Day, after which a good number of people on here have been predicting will see the death of Torchwood, ends with all kinds of cliffhangers. This seems stranger still, seeing as how Russell T Davies has been saying out loud that he isn&apos;t sure if he&apos;s going to do any more Torchwood.

And at Poor Unfortunate Esther&apos;s funeral, Rex is shot by Evil Lesbian Charlotte at the end, is revealed, presumably thanks to getting a transfusion of Jack&apos;s blood, is revealed as immortal himself.

The faux-ruined walls and clashing colours personify the aspirations of the nouveaux riches, a shallow world of image and artifice. In a rare moment of design slapstick, Michael Douglas (as Gordon Gecko) puts his drink on the coffee table and it falls through \u2013 he thinks there&apos;s glass there. You can hear the modernists tutting. With its deceptive surfaces and furniture that doesn&apos;t do what it&apos;s supposed to, postmodernism is not just the backdrop to but a metaphor for unbridled capitalism, where a plump balance sheet conceals all manner of sins and where marble-effect plastic laminate hides chipboard. But was postmodernism really so bad? Already we&apos;re in cliche territory. If there were a critic&apos;s rulebook, it would stipulate the need to begin any piece on postmodernism with a pop culture reference and a tone of moral ambivalence. That mandatory disapproval is based not so much on the carnival of bad taste that romped through the 1970s and 80s, but on the fact that this bad taste was only skin deep. For, according to the standard reading, postmodernism was fickle and ironic, obsessed with style for its own sake. Where modernism was about high-minded notions such as essence and truth to materials, perhaps even a social agenda, postmodernism was about surfaces and signs. As Fredric Jameson put it in his brilliant Postmodernism: Or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, &quot;it is like the transition from precious metals to the credit card&quot;. With a major retrospective of postmodernism opening at the V&amp;A Museum later this month, the question is whether we have anything new to say about this phenomenon. Will the show reinforce old cliches, or will it manage to capture some of postmodernism&apos;s complexity? One of the awkward things about the postmodernists was that few of their leading lights actually wanted to be one. Ettore Sottsass, arguably the godfather of postmodernist design, felt that it was an American architectural movement. And in some ways he was right. In architecture, the agenda was set across the Atlantic, by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown&apos;s embracing of Las Vegas neon, by the historicist references of Michael Graves, the vertiginous corporate lobbies of John Portman and the assemblage style of Frank Gehry&apos;s house. But in design, the main impetus came from Europe. There were exceptions, such as the American Peter Shire, whose Bel Air chair does a fair impression of a cornice abusing a beach ball. But when Sottsass founded the Memphis group in Milan in 1981, along with Michele De Lucchi and Marco Zanini and others, he unleashed postmodernist design&apos;s boldest force.     Power of PoMo ... Michael Graves's the Swan and Dolphin Resort at Disney World, Florida. Photograph: Victoria Slater-Madert    Memphis was garish and irreverent, trawling history for allusions and splattering them with previously unthinkable patterns. It was a self-conscious riposte to modernism&apos;s steel-tube sobriety. Martine Bedine&apos;s Super lamp was like a child&apos;s toy, part ferris wheel, part puppy on a leash. Sottsass&apos;s Casablanca sideboard has something Aztec about it, and that kind of arbitrary reference was pure postmodernism \u2013 it might be neo-Mesopotamian, like Sottsass&apos;s 1972 Lapislazzuli teapot, or neo-art deco primitivism like the 1982 Murmansk fruit bowl.     Plundering the past ... Ettore Sottsass's Aztec-referencing Casablanca sideboard (1981). Photograph: Photo Studio/V&A    But what Memphis is chiefly remembered for is the plastic laminate that gave these pieces their dizzying visual effect. Thanks to this emphasis on shock-and-awe surfaces, it has become common to suggest that Memphis products were designed merely to look good in photographs \u2013 that it was mediatised furniture for an image economy. Jameson made the same point about postmodern architecture. This may be true, although in Memphis&apos; case I&apos;m not sure it was as conscious as that. Certainly, news of Memphis travelled fast \u2013 influencing some of the worst design of recent times \u2013 but Memphis itself was never a commercial success. The only people who seemed to do well out of it were Abet Laminati, the Italian laminates company that produced the riotous veneers Sottsass and co made all the rage. The problem with the conventional reading of Memphis as ironic, mediatised furniture was that Sottsass, at least, was not that cynical. A romantic, he believed that domestic objects could take on an almost sacred quality. A truer postmodernist was his compatriot Alessandro Mendini, who had established the Studio Alchimia group even before Memphis. Sharing none of Sottsass&apos;s optimism, Mendini was much more the ironist and iconoclast, seizing the opportunity to break all of design&apos;s rules \u2013 such as originality. His Proust armchair, a baroque confection daubed in pointillist brushstrokes, crosses furniture with an impressionist painting. He once described it to me as &quot;hermaphrodite design&quot; \u2013 nothing is his except the act of creating a hybrid. It was literate, sophisticated and meant as a joke. Just as architectural postmodernism descended into the pejorative &quot;PoMo&quot;, with pastiches such as Philip Johnson&apos;s AT&amp;T building (which crossed a skyscraper with a Chippendale cabinet), so postmodernist design fell into gimmicky merchandising. Mendini was a key culprit, with his toy-like Anna G corkscrew for Alessi, shaped like a woman in a dress. Even more literal was Michael Graves&apos;s kettle, also for Alessi, with its whistling plastic bird perched on the spout. Abandoning the old form-and-function dogma, design embraced its new nature as kitsch \u2013 kitsch that still sells rather well today, we might add.     Kitchen kitsch ... Michael Graves's postmodernist kettle for Alessi (1983). Photograph: Mike Kitcatt/V&A    From here, the link to pop and street culture is an easy one, and the V&amp;A retrospective promises to regale us with instances of where postmodernist design culture simply became popular culture. Hip-hop sampling, Peter Saville&apos;s New Order record covers, Grace Jones&apos;s eclectic styling and the Levi&apos;s ad in which Nick Kamen strips off in a launderette are all claimed as a groundswell of the postmodern ethos. There&apos;s a good theoretical basis for a lot of that, but it threatens to confuse postmodernism with 1980s popular culture generally \u2013 and resuscitating Neneh Cherry as a postmodern icon feels like the 80s revival run amok. In fact, revivalism seems to be one of the permanent legacies of postmodernism. Retro has become a perpetual condition. You can see it in ultra-conservative magazine design and referential fashion statements. If chameleon style-shifters such as Madonna and Grace Jones are postmodernists, then so is Lady Gaga. What is Apple if not neo-modernism, a revival of the minimalism preached by Dieter Rams and the Ulm design school in the 1960s? And the image economy (if that really is a Memphis legacy) is now so advanced that designers publish computer-generated images of work that is not only skin-deep, but doesn&apos;t even exist. In architecture, meanwhile, PoMo didn&apos;t die so much as find itself exported to the new bastions of turbo-capitalism: mirrored glass (and the lack of financial transparency that goes with it) abounds in Moscow, while the towers with the funny crowns migrated to Dubai and Shanghai.

Details have leaked slowly because detainees were ordered not to discuss their experiences with journalists, members of NGOs or diplomats, and many are fearful because of threats to their families. The accounts have increased concerns among human rights groups about plans to authorise police to hold suspects in secret locations for up to six months without informing their families. Critics say the changes to residential surveillance laws, which would apply in state security, terrorism and major corruption cases, would legitimise forced disappearances. Scores of people were seized in the clampdown. While some were held only briefly, and several activists and dissidents were formally detained or sent to re-education through labour, others were held for weeks or months at unknown locations in breach of the current law, say experts. Most signed guarantees they would not write political material online or speak to foreigners. &quot;People are genuinely scared and that&apos;s why they are not talking,&quot; said Wang Songlian of the Chinese Human Rights Defenders network. &quot;I think all of the people who disappeared for a period of time have experienced some form of torture or mistreatment. &quot;Even when the [rights] community was being targeted before, people were always quite defiant. This time it is like a bag with a hole punctured: the air has gone out of it.&quot; Relatives have also been silent. But a handful of those held have now disclosed details and the Guardian has spoken to sources with knowledge of others&apos; lengthy detentions. Friends say many of those detained lost significant amounts of weight and show clear signs of trauma, including disturbed sleep and memory loss. Many were hooded before they were driven away and several were badly beaten in the first day or two. In most cases they were watched around the clock by two officers at a time and deprived of sleep. CHRD, which spoke to the Guangzhou-based rights lawyer Tang Jingling when he was released after more than five months of residential surveillance, said he was questioned non-stop for more than a week by three teams of interrogators, without sleep or rest. He was allowed to sleep for short periods after suffering from trembling, numbness in his hands and chest pains. Another lawyer, Liu Shihui, said on Twitter that he was interrogated for five days without sleep, until he collapsed. Detainees were also forced to sit in stress positions for hours at a time. Although it is common practice in Chinese prisons to make people sit still for long periods, it was much more intensely enforced with these prisoners, so even slumping or closing their eyes could prompt a rebuke or threat. Some were handcuffed for long periods. In other cases, air conditioning was run at full blast until rooms were unbearably cold; one of those thought to have been involved, the lawyer Tang Jitian, has since been diagnosed with tuberculosis, say friends. They are particularly concerned because he has shunned contact with them. CHRD said another lawyer, Jin Guanghong, was held for days in a psychiatric institution where he was beaten, tied to a bed, given injections of unknown substances and forced to take medicine. He could not recall the full details. Many found the psychological pressure hardest. They were not allowed to speak or read except in interrogations and guards were permitted to talk to them only when giving orders. &quot;I tried very hard to adjust my mind from going crazy. There were seven to eight times that I almost broke down. Well, no windows is just a minor problem,&quot; wrote Shanghai lawyer Li Tiantian in a tweet after her release from three months of detention. In an article last week, the artist Ai Weiwei, the best known of the detainees, wrote of solitary confinement: &quot;You truly believe they can do anything to you ... You become like mad.&quot; In some cases, officers threatened detainees with the example of Gao Zhisheng,- a lawyer who has been missing for more than two and a half years and who gave a graphic account of torture when he resurfaced briefly last year. Detainees also told friends of &quot;brainwashing&quot; as officers lambasted them repeatedly for incorrect attitudes and disloyalty to China. The crackdown appeared to be prompted by anonymous online calls for an Arab-inspired &quot;jasmine revolution&quot;, posted on an overseas website. But while most detainees were quizzed about the appeal, several saw it as the trigger rather than the cause of the crackdown. They were repeatedly interrogated about precise details of contact with other rights activists, trips abroad and meetings with foreigners. Other questions appeared designed to break them down, they felt \u2013 for example, asking Li Tiantian about her sex life. Detainees were also ordered to write and read aloud confessions. Some suspect the resulting videos could be used in future trials, helping to intimidate them into compliance, while others saw it as a way to humiliate activists and sow distrust among them. &quot;I realise that I face some danger from revealing the truth,&quot; Liu Shihui wrote in a tweet. In a blog post \u2013 since deleted \u2013 Li Tiantian wrote: &quot;I&apos;ll bet that there will be others in the future who, like me, will become increasingly mute, and I now know why many online friends from before have vanished from the internet.&quot; Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch said the disappearances, and proposed changes to the residential surveillance laws, meant &quot;secret detentions would become the norm for handling dissidents, rights activists and critics. They also tell us that such detentions will be unchallengeable, greatly increase the likelihood of torture and ill-treatment and will be used for political motives far beyond legitimate concerns about national security but rather to protect the party&quot;.

Global trends demonstrate the increased &quot;marketisation&quot; of universities. This means, in some cases, that higher education institutions are seen as for-profit businesses, run on business logic. A milder form of marketisation is the introduction of tuition fees in countries traditionally known for their open access to education (United Kingdom, and for some specific student categories: The Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden to mention a few). I am sure that the desire of people working for this transformation is to improve the flaws of the current ways in which HE is structured, to make it more efficient, more responsive to the needs of the society, or simply, more modern. I discussed elsewhere the potential benefits of this era of transformation, for example through the expansion of open access practices. This moment of change is therefore to be embraced for all the opportunities it latently may hold. At the same time, the transformation we are currently experiencing in the academia may also be perceived as confusing, perplexing even, perhaps because we lack the definition of what we should aim for. The question &quot;what is a good university?&quot; is a legitimate one in this context, and one that many tried their hand at answering. Among those who may claim to hold the key to the puzzle are those measuring the success of universities in the global arena through the creation of indexes and rankings. There are several such measures circulating today, each with a specific methodology and therefore with (slightly) different results. I will not endeavor here to discuss comparatively the merits or the pitfalls of each of them. The most famous ones are the Times Higher Education Rankings, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Rankings, or the QS World University Rankings which can be found on this network, (while the Europeans are trying to push for their own index, U-Multirank). What these different measures share is an explosive potential that is activated every time a new ranking is made public, making them repeatedly the target of criticism. But what is the purpose of these global rankings? Do they give us a standard of a &quot;good university&quot; that all should attempt to follow? According to the recent report Global University Rankings and their Impact made for the European University Association, the major benefits of the idea of measuring and comparing academic quality globally are that they foster accountability and that they scan the field for more information. At the same time, the report criticises the oversimplification of university quality and performance. In other words, the picture of the &quot;best&quot; university in the world that emerges from these rankings is not giving us a multifaceted and complex view. I agree with this criticism and feel that here lies the most significant part of the problem. These rankings, as popular and spread as they may be, give to the societies and to universities themselves a distorted view. This slanted depiction may be the result of the specific measurement methodologies employed, in particular the preference in most cases for research productivity over teaching and learning achievements. The &quot;best&quot; universities then are those who produce the largest number of articles in the most prestigious publications, those who allow most freedom for research, those who offer the best facilities and most modern technologies to push forward our common knowledge. This leaves aside though the other, equally significant, aspect of higher education, namely didactics. Universities must produce new knowledge, I completely agree, but they also must transmit knowledge and encourage the most suitable students to become part of this discovery process in their turn. University rankings tend to reveal a bias in favor of research over teaching, and the definition of the good university is therefore least said incomplete. Moreover, the claim that many such ranking organisations are making is that they help students make better choices, serving as orientation guides in an increasingly complex world of opportunities. But if the rankings as a general rule are leaning towards the research power of universities, what is the direct use of this classification for an undergraduate student. For this person, a measure of university performance that would emphasise the quality of teaching would be far more rewarding. If now tuition-sensitive students are buyers on the global market of higher education, a very useful element in the rankings would be price, spelling out which one is the best and most expensive university in the world, or which other is the best quality for the money. If universities are sellers of certified knowledge then the university rankings may very well be a good guide for the prospective student who is out shopping. However, it is not where we should look for the definition of &quot;a good university&quot;.

Now they have added another one 77 years later as the world again struggles to avoid financial chaos. There is something about a Great Depression that cheers up Lancashire. That and the chance to play their home games on an outground at Aigburth. Lancashire are the side that followers of other counties can never quite remember. The only international in the ranks of the Red Rose as they defeated Somerset by eight wickets with five overs to spare was Glen Chapple, who won a solitary ODI cap against Ireland five years ago. Chapple was 37 and playing with a strained hamstring that would have sidelined lesser men. The rest of Lancashire&apos;s have short, traditional English names: Smith, Brown, Croft, Hogg. They are players who have never known stardom and perhaps never will. They seem almost interchangeable. But tonight they are identified by an achievement that few expected \u2013 some famous Lancastrians of another era included. In 1934, Lancashire&apos;s cotton industry was showing signs of decline and the Manchester Guardian was financially stricken. Sir Neville Cardus wrote early that season: &quot;None of us cares twopence about the Championship, certainly not this year, when it is obvious Lancashire cannot possibly win it!&quot; Cardus, to his delight, was proved wrong as Lancashire took the title against Surrey at The Oval. Expectations were not much higher this year in an era of instant communications that is ideally suited to the gradual climax of the final day of a championship season. But under Moores&apos;s guidance, Lancashire have become efficient, orderly and have achieved every inch of their potential. For the second successive season, the championship climax was a thrilling one, the story unfolding over hours: on TV and radio commentary, on Twitter, and on this very blog. Would Cardus have taken to blogging? Surely he would have enjoyed the freedom to switch from cricket to music in mid-sentence. Sky TV were stuck with Warwickshire, stymied at the last by stout, day-long blocking by Hampshire on a docile Rose Bowl pitch. How we yearned for them to switch to Taunton, but they dared not follow the news, fearing a lack of camera angles and commentators, coverage unfit for the HD age. LD would have sufficed. BBC Radio were at Taunton, where Vic Marks&apos;s dulcet tones calmed Lancashire&apos;s nerves. On Twitter we awaited a tweet from Kevin Pietersen that never came, heralding Peter Moores as the finest coach in the county game, a coach who had kept his dignity when Pietersen rubbished his reputation and cost him his England job and whose success would now be warmly received. On this blog, comments came from Shanghai, Ottawa and other far-flung places. One Lancashire fan admitted to being on his &quot;fourth vodka and tonic&quot; in no time at all, another railed at a 5pm meeting that meant he would miss the final moment. In more ways than ever, people caught that moment. The county championship is not quite dead yet.  5.34pm: Stay here for David Hopps&apos;s verdict on the final day of the championship. He&apos;ll be filing shortly.  5.13pm: And they&apos;ve done it!!! Lancashire win the County Championship for the first time in 77 years.   5.02pm: Metters has just taken two wickets in two balls, bowling Sean Ervine and then having Michael Bates plumb lbw first ball, writes Paul Weaver. But it&apos;s all too late I&apos;m afraid, for Bears supporters. Hampshire&apos;s lead has just gone to 158 and the captains will be shaking hands soon. In fact there they go. It&apos;s five o&apos;clock and it&apos;s all over, with 11 overs remaining. Well played McKenzie. He&apos;s unbeaten on 115. Hampshire are down and Warwickshire aren&apos;t champions, so it&apos;s hankies all round.  Meanwhile at Taunton ... Lancashire require just 3 runs to win the championship for the first time in 77 years.  5.01pm: The match is over at the Rose Bowl between Hampshire and Warwickshire, so at Taunton Lancashire just need to knock of the 30 or so runs required to win the championship.  4.45pm: For those who haven&apos;t delved below the line, Andy Wilson is giving frequent updates from Lancashire&apos;s title charge at Taunton in the comments section below.  3.54pm: I feel sorry for Warwickshire because the pitch here has just died on them, writes Paul Weaver. But they&apos;ve also got it wrong tactically, I&apos;m afraid. They have taken the new ball and put three men round the boundary with only three other men in catching positions. One ball from Rankin has just flown between second slip and gully. I know runs are a factor but it&apos;s new ball or bust for Warwickshire and wickets are the key. If the new ball doesn&apos;t do it for them the game&apos;s up. Hampshire are 268 for five, 99 ahead.  2.59pm: Someone on the blog rejigged Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s famous phrase the other day, so apologies for the repetition, writes Andy Wilson from behind the press box sofa at Taunton. But cricket, eh? Bloody hell. Somerset, bless their cotton socks, have resisted with magnificent stubbornness here today, extending their overnight 105 for five to a total of 311. To say that Lancashire nerves were fraying would be the understatement of the season. But their innings was finally brought to an improbable conclusion when Gary Keedy ran out the last man Gemaal Hussain with a direct hit from backward point. The wicket fell at 2.39pm. If it had been 2.40pm, the players would have taken an early tea, and no overs would have been removed from the day&apos;s allocation. As it is, there have been 10 minutes between innings, and they&apos;re out again now for 21 minutes until tea, then another hour afterwards before the minimum of 16 overs have to be bowled in the last hour. So the minimum of 28 overs remaining in the day&apos;s allocation is an irrelevance. Lancashire will have more than that to make the 211 they need. Say four before tea, another 14 in the next hour, and that 16 in the last hour. So that would be 34 overs to make 211. Not a formality. Somerset have started with four fielders on the boundary, and made a fielding change after the first ball. It is a good job that we have two such experienced and no-nonsense umpires as Peter Willey and George Sharp here to ensure fair play. Somerset really don&apos;t like Lancashire, after what happened last year, and a few players are already facing disciplinary trouble after previous incidents in this feisty contest. Cricket, bloody hell. By the way a quick word for Peter Trego and Murali Kartik. But only a quick one. Lancs are 5-0 off Steve Kirby&apos;s first over, which took five minutes.  2.58pm: Middlesex are confirmed as Division Two champions despite a nervy chase of 124 at Grace Road, writes Richard Gibson. There was a distinct touch of the Worcestershires about their pursuit but they overcame a deterioration of 57-0 to 90-5 thanks to little cameos from John Simpson and Gareth Berg, the latter finishing the match with 6, 4, 6. Meanwhile, back at Chester-le-Street, the Durham players are sharing a beer. They are toasting a third-placed finish and a share of \u00a387,000 between the first-team squad. I wonder if any of them have considered doubling their money? Because if Lancashire were to lose at Taunton - let&apos;s face it, stranger things have happened - that player pool would swell to \u00a3175,000 by virtue of them finishing second.  2.19pm: Warwickshire have broken through at last, with Woakes getting Carberry lbw for 111, writes Paul Weaver. It was a marginal decision. The ball may have struck the batsman just outside the line but Warwickshire have had no luck all day and they will feel that they deserved a break. Hampshire are 214 for four, 45 ahead. Clarke has been bowling without a slip, which is a little too defensive. Warwickshire are worried about the runs but wickets must be their priority now.  1.38pm: Despite not losing a wicket in the opening hour of the final day, Worcestershire were defeated by 151 runs a quarter of an hour after lunch, Scott Borthwick wrapping things up with the final three wickets, writes Richard Gibson. It meant the slump specialists had lost eight for 85 today, following seven for 33 on the second evening. Meanwhile, news from Twenty20 champions and Championship wooden-spooners Leicestershire. They have engaged spinners Jigar Naik and Claude Henderson on new two-year contracts. Chief executive Mike Siddall said: &quot;Claude and Jigar are an integral part of the club&apos;s bowling attack and their form over the past few seasons has been excellent. Claude&apos;s four overs for only 11 runs in the Friends Life t20 final strangled the life out of Somerset and Jigar&apos;s consistency in the four-day game has been excellent this season.&quot; The pair were comfortably the county&apos;s leading two wicket-takers in first-class cricket this summer (Naik 48, Henderson 40 before today) and both averaged over 20 with the bat.  12.46pm: It&apos;s lunch here and Warwickshire are starting to look very anxious, writes Paul Weaver. Hampshire are 178 for three, nine runs ahead, having not lost a wicket all morning. Warwickshire have tried all their five bowlers but it didn&apos;t work. Carberry and McKenzie added 80 runs in the first hour, off 17 overs. In the second hour they had added 55.There have been little edges here and there but nothing has gone to hand. Just before lunch Metters and the rest of the Warwickshire fielders made a strong appeal for a catch behind. But replays suggested that Carberry&apos;s bat had hit the ground and not the ball. Very tense here, though the few Hampshire supporters look totally relaxed. Their relegation fate was sealed yesterday.  12.21pm: Worcestershire&apos;s fondness for the dramatic collapse saw them lose four wickets for 26 runs (the first three for none) at Chester-le-Street to completely undermine a positive first hour, writes Richard Gibson. Moeen Ali and Alexei Kervezee nicked off in the same Mitchell Claydon over and Ian Blackwell accounted for James Cameron with one that rushed on to climax the seven-ball slump. Gareth Andrew, visibly troubled by his sore knee, countered with two fours and a six in one over from Blackwell but the left-arm spinner laughed last and pretty loud when Andrew had his off-stump flattened attempting a reverse sweep. With quarter-of-an-hour remaining before lunch, Worcestershire are 177 for six.  11.22am: Worcestershire went out for a team dinner last night to celebrate their against-the-odds survival in Division One, writes Richard Gibson. Today&apos;s objective for them is to stave off an 11th defeat of the season and an ignominious statistic - they have already equalled their record number of losses in a season since the County Championship was split in two (they also endured 10 in the relegation campaign of 2009). The Pears have already created one piece of history as no side has previously survived the drop with as many as 10 defeats. In fact, both Surrey and Warwickshire have gone down in the past five seasons having lost only five times apiece. Credit to Daryl Mitchell&apos;s team though because they have exploited the 2010 change to the points-scoring system. Ultimately it has been the four sets of 16 points for a win (it was previously 14) that has kept them up. They began the final morning requiring a further 300 runs to beat Durham, who are guaranteed a third-placed finish and a \u00a3105,000 bounty regardless of the result here. The in-form James Cameron and Moeen Ali have both found the ropes with cover drives so far. Although Cameron, who hit 98 in the 10-wicket win over Lancashire recently and 74 in the first innings here, survived a supremely confident lbw shout from Graham Onions on 28. His cut for four off Callum Thorp in the next over, however, took Worcestershire into three figures for the loss of two wickets.  11.05am: The Warwickshire boys looked very relaxed this morning, writes Paul Weaver at the Rose Bowl. They must all be bloody good actors, that&apos;s all I can say. They are on the verge of a significant achievement here. The championship, if they win it, will have been a terrific team performance. They will feel properly relaxed when they get rid of Neil McKenzie and Michael Carberry. The bottom end of the Hampshire line-up looks a little callow and shouldn&apos;t hold up the Warwickshire bowlers for too long. Warwickshire have opened up with a Chris at both ends, the swing of Woakes from the pavilion end and the spin of Metters from the other. Hampshire are 71 for three.  10.35am: Morning all, writes Andy Wilson. Glen Chapple has just led his Lancashire team on to the field to a warm ovation from what feels like a Lancastrian majority on a glorious autumn morning. There was one chant of &quot;Come on Warwick&quot;, which may reflect lingering bad feeling that has already been mentioned in the quick-off-the-mark comments below, but I would prefer to put down to a good sense of humour. Chapple has opened the attack, his hamstring continuing to defy medical science, as Lancashire press for a victory that would be their 10th of the season, which would be a record for a team not winning the Championship in the two-division era. They can do nothing else now but enjoy the last day of an admirable and memorable summer.  9.23am: To remind everyone how things stand, here&apos;s yesterday&apos;s end-of-the-day Division One round-up from Andy Wilson:  Only one issue remains unresolved in the First Division. But it is the big one. And it&apos;s pretty simple. If Warwickshire beat Hampshire, they are champions, which would be a seriously impressive achievement for a county who struggled against relegation last season, and weren&apos;t expected to challenge this year - especially as they had eight points deducted for preparing a poor pitch for their home game against Worcestershire way back when. If Hampshire can bat for most of the day - they&apos;re already three wickets down following on, and still 126 behind - they will leave the door ajar for Lancashire, who are also in a strong position against Somerset. Assuming Warwicks and Lancs both win, then Durham will be third and Somerset will take the last slice of LV prize money in fourth. Hampshire and Yorkshire have already been relegated, meaning that Worcestershire have defied most pre-season predictions, and heavy losses in their first six matches, to survive. It&apos;s been a good year for the Bears and the Pears.   Morning all. Andy Wilson is at Somerset v Lancashire, Richard Gibson is at Durham v Worcestershire and Paul Weaver is at Hampshire v Warickshire.

This senior economist and government adviser is trying to clean up his polluted country one data set at a time and, in the process, wean political leaders off their obsession with GDP growth. It is an uphill task. Eight years ago, Niu tried and failed to introduce a &quot;green GDP&quot;, which would have factored environmental costs into measurements of China&apos;s economic progress. That proposal was killed off by provincial leaders who feared their GDP achievements \u2013 and promotion prospects \u2013 would be undermined by a full accounting of the damage being done to the environment. Undaunted, Niu has returned to the fray with a new &quot;GDP quality index&quot; that measures the economy not just by size, but by sustainability, social equality and ecological impact. Launched this summer, the index is currently more of an academic exercise than an indication of government priorities. But it has provoked a fierce debate because of the influential position of Niu, who is adviser to the state council (China&apos;s cabinet), chief scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the Chinese Ecological Economics Society. Several senior cadres are upset that their provinces&apos; economic performances look far less impressive when the extra factors are taken into account, though others benefit. Ranked by quality rather than quantity of GDP, Guangdong falls from first to third place, while Zhejiang goes up from fourth to first place. &quot;The GDP quality index is coming under political pressure, not from the central government but from the local level,&quot; Niu told the Guardian at his office in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. &quot;I have had a lot of phone calls in recent days from the offices of provincial governors asking why they ranked so low.&quot; Niu&apos;s formulation combines five elements: Economic quality, which considers the amount of resources and energy needed to generate each 10,000 yuan of GDP; social quality, which includes differences of incomes between rich and poor that might led to destructive riots; environmental quality, which assesses the amount of waste and carbon generated per 10,000 yuan of economic activity; quality of life, which figures in life expectancy and other human development indicators; and management quality, which measures the proportion of tax revenue used for public security, the durability of infrastructure and the proportion of public officials in the overall population. It may sound complex, but compared to the ill-fated green GDP, he says the quality index is simpler to understand and calculate because it is based on existing government statistics. Green GDP, by contrast, required officials to compile extra data. This allowed officials to give the excuse that it was too complicated at the end of trials in several provinces. It is believed that green GDP statistics continue to be compiled by the government, but they are kept secret due to political sensitivities. &quot;In 2006, we wanted to publish green GDP but we had no success,&quot; says Niu, who was also the government&apos;s chief adviser on that plan. &quot;Politics pressure was one reason; local government officials felt green GDP damaged their promotion prospects. The other was that it was overcomplicated and the public did not understand it. We have simplified the theory.&quot; The GDP quality index is one of many proposals worldwide to use economic theory to reverse environmental degradation and encourage sustainable values. Very few governments have adopted such measurements but they are likely to be given a push as next year&apos;s Rio+20 United Nations summit. Last year, India said it would become the first country in the world to commit to publish accounts of its &quot;natural wealth&quot;. Niu acknowledges that his approach needs to be enhanced. One shortcoming is that it overemphasises production rather than consumption, which means cities such as Beijing and Shanghai get a better ranking than industrial regions such as Inner Mongolia even though urban residents are the ultimate consumers of resources and cause of waste. This will be given more weight in the future, says the statistical reformer, who plans to release a quality index every year as a stimulus for change and education. On the walls of Niu&apos;s office are photographs of him with the president, Hu Jintao, the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, and other senior communist officials. The government has yet to adopt his new index, but its incorporation of social and environmental costs seems tailor-made for a national leadership that claims to champion &quot;harmony&quot;, &quot;scientific development,&quot; and &quot;ecological civilisation.&quot; The reality so far in China, however, is very different. Niu says the Chinese people will be the ultimate judge of his index. &quot;They want to know the truth. Is our GDP genuine or is it something else. We have provided an answer,&quot; he says. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t worship GDP and we shouldn&apos;t abandon GDP. Our aim to have a GDP that consumes fewer natural resources, is less harmful to the environment and has a low social management cost. We want rational, genuine GDP.&quot; And if unhappy provincial governors try once again to kill his effort to change the focus of the economy? &quot;I cannot let that worry me. I am a researcher. We only use government statistics and then apply our theory. I don&apos;t decide which provinces come top.

The four held a meeting to discuss the state of the game after a long and dispiriting US Open tournament this month, and a jaded view of the ATP Tour&apos;s schedule emerged. Murray and his peers are not mere shop stewards, but wealth creators for the sport. Theirs are the names that pull in the spectators and broadcasters&apos; dollars, and the threat to withdraw their labour would strike fear into\u00a0promoters. It is, moreover, understandable. A condition of entry to the ATP\u00a0Tour is that all players must participate in the four grand slam tournaments, eight Masters events, four of the 11 ATP500 tour and the World Tennis finals at the O2 in December. Those 17 commitments mean about 20 weeks a year of competition playing time, with many more weeks of travelling, preparation and training. Nadal, for instance, has played 72 matches in the eight months of this season alone, equating to 1,784 games in competitions. But even for all that exertion \u2013 the four have won 150 career titles and generated $145m total prize money between them \u2013 sponsorship income brings in multiples of that sum. &quot;We&apos;ll sit down, talk about it with the Association of Tennis Professionals and International Tennis Federation, see if they will come to a compromise and if not, we&apos;ll go from there,&quot; Murray told the BBC, ahead of a meeting with tour players at the Masters tournament in Shanghai next month. When asked if that might include strike action, the world No4 responded: &quot;Yes, I think so. It&apos;s a possibility. I know from speaking to some players they&apos;re not afraid of doing that. Let&apos;s hope it doesn&apos;t come to that but I&apos;m sure the players will consider it. &quot;If we come up with a list of things we want changed \u2013 and everyone is in agreement, but they don&apos;t happen \u2013 then we need to have some say in what goes on in our sport At the moment, we don&apos;t.&quot; Tennis players do, however, have a bigger say in what goes on than in any other major sport than golf. They hold a 50% share of the ATP, with the other 50% held by the promoters. Nadal and Federer are, respectively, the vice-president and president of the player council, the 12-man board that feeds their views to the ATP&apos;s board. &quot;The players should and do have a major say in how the game is run, which is one of the key reasons the ATP Tour was formed as an equal partnership between players and tournaments,&quot; said the ruling body in a statement. &quot;The calendar has long been a topic of conversation and just last year we announced that we would be lengthening our off-season by two weeks beginning in 2012, meaning players will have seven weeks in between ATP World Tour seasons.&quot; The difficulty for the ATP is that it must balance the concerns of the big-name players with the financial requirements of their counterparts across the net. At the Shanghai Masters the winner will earn US$620,000. First-round losers will pick up only US$11,500 each. The last major alteration to the schedule came in 2009 when five-set finals were consigned to history, entry lists to the Masters events were reduced and byes were extended to the top-eight seeds. It meant a new cycle of broadcast contracts, typically of three years&apos; duration, began at that point, reducing the flexibility for change to the tournament schedule. The next cycle begins in 2012 but there is an argument that several of the 2009 changes have reduced the return the spectators receive from their sport. Tennis faces a dilemma similar to many sports. There are a small number of sporting and financial powers whose participation drives the revenues of the entire game. But, as one insider said: &quot;Each player will have different priorities. The world No80 is not likely to want to cut back on the number of tournaments. They want to play as much as they can.&quot;", "tags": ["Tennis", "Andy Murray", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-09-20T16:23:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/20/andy-murray-tennis-strike-threat", "sentences": ["Before discussing their options at a meeting in Shanghai next month, Murray and his fellow pros would do well to consider the players&apos; strike that hit America&apos;s National Football League in 1987."], "title": "How serious is Andy Murray's tennis strike threat?", "article": "Andy Murray did not become famous for his easy charm. So if his fellow tennis professionals decide to go on strike, as this week he indicated that they might, it would be sensible to find another public face to explain their dissatisfaction with the hectic calendar. (Murray&apos;s face already seems permanently dissatisfied.) Even so, it is not too early for the Association of Tennis Professionals to begin worrying. When sports stars threaten to withdraw their labour, they frequently go through with it. Footballers from Spain&apos;s top two divisions returned to work last month, having demanded \u2013 and got \u2013 assurances that their pay will be protected from the financial problems affecting many Spanish clubs. An Italian football strike was settled just a fortnight ago. In the US, sports strikes are almost routine. Baseball players downed bats and balls in 1972, 1981 and 1994-5; American footballers refused to do whatever it is they do in 1982 and 1987; top-level basketball ceased altogether in 1995 and 1998-9, though the second spell was technically a &quot;lockout&quot; enforced by franchise-owners. There&apos;s another NBA lockout in place now, threatening the start of the new season. Here, Premier League footballers have been known to impose periods of one-man industrial action on their clubs, but they have never gone on strike collectively \u2013 despite threatening to in 2001. The Scottish Football association had to postpone several matches last season, but that was down to a strike by its embattled referees. This is not to say that striking sportsmen and women always win. Before discussing their options at a meeting in Shanghai next month, Murray and his fellow pros would do well to consider the players&apos; strike that hit America&apos;s National Football League in 1987. During that dispute, absent players were replaced by stand-ins. Official matches went ahead, and were even televised, between groups of rickety old pros and beefy amateurs. Some fans were appalled, but others made the most of the occasion by christening the teams the &quot;Chicago Spare Bears&quot; the &quot;New Orleans Saint Elsewheres&quot; or the &quot;San Francisco Phoney-Niners&quot;.

From the frosted plains of the Arctic ice pack to the cool blue caverns of the mountain glaciers, the dripping away of frozen water is the most crystal clear of all the Earth&apos;s warning signals. It relies on neither the painstaking compiling of temperature records back through history nor the devilish complexity of predicting the future with supercomputers. Ice on Earth is simply and unambiguously disappearing. Last week saw the annual summer minimum of the Arctic ice cap, which has now shrunk to the lowest level satellites have ever recorded. The ice at the roof of the human world is faring little better: mountain glaciers are diminishing at accelerating and historic rates. The lower glaciers are doomed. Kilimanjaro may be bare within a decade, with the Pyrenees set to be ice-free by mid-century and three-quarters of the glaciers in the Alps gone by the same date. As you climb higher, and temperatures drop, global warming will take longer to erode the ice into extinction. But at the &quot;third pole&quot;, in the Himalayas, the ice is melting as evidenced by dozens of swelling milky\u00a0blue lakes that threaten to burst down on to villages when their ice dams melt. The threat posed is far greater than even this terrifying prospect: a quarter of the world&apos;s people rely on Himalayan meltwater, which helps feed the great rivers that plunge down into Asia. The Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Brahmaputra, Ganges and Indus nourish billions and will eventually lose their spring surges. Melting ice is the cause of another of the greatest long-term threats posed by climate change: rising sea level. The deep freezes of Greenland and west Antarctica store enough water to raise the oceans by 20 feet. That would flood many of the world&apos;s greatest cities from New York to Shanghai, but remains for now a distant prospect. Perhaps it is because ice is at the cold heart of all our deepest global warming fears that climate change sceptics wield their picks so heavily on it. The error by the publicists and cartographers of the Times Atlas, who stated that Greenland&apos;s ice cover had shrunk by 15% since 1999, prompted a renewed sounding of sirens by climate sceptics who saw another example of rampant alarmism by warming fanatics. In fact, it was climate scientists themselves who sounded the alarm, prompting the Atlas publishers to promise a new map would be inserted. This was not the first time ice\u00a0had been under the lens of those holding the fringe view that global warming is a fantasy. In the run-up to the Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009, a three-year-old mistake surfaced among 3,000 pages of report by the UN&apos;s climate science advisers.

On Thursday night, Americans were spoilt for choice when two reality TV shows that were breathtakingly similar happened to overlap for one hour. Both took place at least partly in Florida. Both were filmed in front of an audience who not only apparently had nothing better to do with their time but at times seemed, frankly, deranged (those two elements may be related). Both featured delusional sad cases who will do anything to achieve their ambitions while plumbing hitherto unknown depths and dragging the whole of society with them. Both were supervised by a group of soi-disant professionals who work for an evil mastermind. I speak, of course, of the first series of the American version of The X Factor and the latest Republican debate. The X Factor, as British people know and Americans have learned after having been assaulted by it for the first time last week, is the latest contribution to culture by Simon Cowell and his ever-mutating face. Clearly he&apos;s using the same moisturiser as Shane Warne. Last week&apos;s GOP debate was co-sponsored by Rupert Murdoch&apos;s Fox News and chaired by Fox anchors Bret Baier, Chris Wallace and Megyn Kelly. Kelly had a flutter of fame a few weeks ago when she slammed on air a radio host who had criticised her for taking maternity leave. The liberal press, amazed at a Fox News presenter&apos;s spirited pro-government benefits stance, applauded her. Until, that is, Jon Stewart pointed out that before Kelly had her baby she had railed frequently against &quot;government entitlements&quot;. So, given that Kelly is apparently two different people, we can see her as the GOP&apos;s debate version of the seemingly interchangeable US X Factor judges Cheryl Cole and Nicole Scherzinger. Cowell is to TV scheduling and the music industry what Murdoch is to journalism and politics, so to have these two events on at the same time surely puts paid to the common allegation that America lacks irony. Just as Cowell has degraded the concept of &quot;musical talent&quot; to &quot;making a brief impact by belting out a stale golden oldie, being added to Cowell&apos;s stable of &apos;talent&apos; and enabling him to buy another Bentley with extra stretch&quot;, so Murdoch and Fox News have debased political discourse and the Republican party to &quot;making a brief impact by belting out a claim with more shock value than truth, being added to the Fox News stable of pundits and helping Murdoch buy another news source&quot;. In both events, personal narrative and possibly scripted one-liners are far more important than actual skills. Also in both, casual humiliation of the public is par for the course. In the US version of The X Factor, a homeless man named Dexter was initially destroyed by Cowell before the producers then told his sad history, at which point he was suddenly granted permission to stay by the munificent judges. Mocking a homeless man on live TV? That&apos;s the name of the game. But knocking him back after the viewers had been shown his backstory? That would be cruel. At the GOP debate, a gay soldier was loudly booed by people in the audience. This was neither noted nor condemned by any of the candidates at the time. Dexter should thank his lucky stars at least he, unlike the soldier, was allowed to defend himself, eh? In both instances, one saw precisely what the public really is in the eyes of Cowell and the Republican party: easy roadkill on the path to power. And in both instances, one caught a glimpse of a dark future, one in which the radio stations are filled with Cowell-powered hits and the White House occupied by Murdoch-approved politicians. Sound familiar, Britain? Sean Penn to the rescue Breaking news from CNN: &quot;Sean Penn played role in Iran hikers&apos; release.&quot; That rising sensation in your gullet is a total lack of surprise. What else would one expect of a man who famously dashed to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, only for his efforts to founder because his boat was laden down by what has been described as &quot;his entourage&quot; which allegedly included &quot;his personal photographer&quot;. Recently, Penn was found helping the victims of Haiti and reprimanding celebrities who joined him there who were using Twitter to &quot;self-promote&quot;. To prove how abhorrent he finds self-promoting celebrities taking advantage of natural disasters, Penn then gave a 12-page interview to Vanity Fair: &quot;[Haiti has] returned to me something I lost \u2013 my humility,&quot; he revealed, humbly, while posing for a photo in Haiti with Lieutenant General Ken Keen. Has anyone spotted Penn&apos;s humility? If so, please send to Sean Penn c/o Film Actors Guild as Penn is, indeed, claiming credit for the release of Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer from their two-year imprisonment in Iran. &quot;A spokesman for Penn confirmed the report but declined to give details,&quot; according to CNN. Despite this blushing modesty on Penn&apos;s part, the story seems to be that Penn allegedly had a word with his old mucker Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Ch\u00e1vez then got on the blower to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. One of the many, many odd things about this story is that Ahmadinejad promised the imminent release of the hikers two weeks ago but was slapped down by an Iranian court that said he lacked the authority. But then, of course, he didn&apos;t have the star of I Am Sam behind him then. To be fair to Penn, he did accomplish the extraordinary feat of being seen as &quot;the difficult one&quot; in a marriage to Madonna. Ponder on that. It is almost more impressive than his ability to take himself seriously despite Shanghai Surprise. So if he misplaces his humility when flinging himself in front of the cameras set up at various base camps around the world, one can forgive him.", "tags": ["The X Factor USA", "Republicans", "US politics", "Simon Cowell", "Rupert Murdoch"], "publicationDate": "2011-09-27T19:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/oct/01/terra-novva-steven-spielberg", "sentences": ["in 2149 the rebreathers that people use to fend off air-pollution look like something you might find smog-wary citizens in Shanghai using already: all believable, gritty details."], "title": "Terra Nova: nine things you need to know", "article": "Sci-fi is a notoriously tricky beast to get right.

They&apos;ve borrowed a lot of sci-fi and glossed over the science bits Want a quick sell? It&apos;s &quot;Avatar meets Jurassic Park&quot;. That&apos;s more than enough to orient us. Steal a few bits here and there and it looks like you&apos;re trying to rip something off. Do a wholesale landgrab and you can end up with something that almost feels new. We don&apos;t need to know the &quot;how&quot; here, just the what: if the one-way portal exploiting a &quot;fracture in time&quot; looks exactly the same as a Stargate it just makes it a bit easier to understand how we come to be watching Shelley Conn and Jason Mara jumping 85m years back into the past with their family.

The Shannon family dynamic is strong, but as soon as we&apos;re zipped 85m years in the past, it&apos;s clear who the real star of this show is going to be: Avatar&apos;s Stephen Lang.

The backdrop is a whole continent As anyone who&apos;s watched Sky Sports News HD will tell you, high-definition is not always the most forgiving of technological innovations. Cardboard sets look like cardboard sets. Wigs look like wigs. Then again, a real-life tropical rainforest looks amazing. With its Hawaiian base, Lost was one of the first shows to really exploit this, maximising the number of scenes that involved the cast being chased by monsters through the jungle, or getting emotional by the ocean. Terra Nova has wisely plumped for a lush Australian backdrop \u2013 an instant upgrade. They&apos;ve let Shelley Conn keep her accent     Shelley Conn as Elizabeth Shannon    It&apos;s a small point, but an important one: there&apos;s nothing worse than being thrown out by a Brit actor&apos;s wonky American twang when you&apos;re trying to concentrate. Joseph Fiennes&apos;s wandering accent wasn&apos;t the only inconsistent element in FlashForward, but it certainly didn&apos;t help.

Another driver does a double-take. The dual carriageway ends abruptly in a narrow dirt track twisting downwards through heaps of rubble. The city is eating hungrily into the hillsides, swallowing up maize fields and rice terraces in loops of tarmac and towers of concrete and glass. But the pace of change is so rapid, the transition so sharp, that its citizens are increasingly bewildered by their surroundings. Some, like the migrant workers building the roads, are new to city life. Others no longer recognise their hometown as it sprawls across the land. This is the year China finally became an urban nation. In April the census revealed that 49.7% of its 1.34bn population was living in cities, compared with around a fifth as economic reforms got off the ground in 1982. By now, China&apos;s urbanites outnumber their country cousins. &quot;The process they have been going through over three decades took four or five decades in Japan and [South] Korea and 100 years in the west,&quot; says Edward Leman, whose Chreod consultancy has advised numerous Chinese cities on development. It is not only the extraordinary speed that is &quot;unprecedented and unparalleled&quot;, says Prof Paul James of the Global Cities Institute at RMIT University in Melbourne. &quot;It represents the most managed process of urbanisation in human history. The state is involved in every way. It manages the building of new cities. It regulates the housing of internally displaced people. It responds actively and sometimes oppressively to new waves of squatters.&quot; The new five-year plan pushes urbanisation even further, as the government seeks to raise living standards and promote development in the poorer central and western regions. A hard landing for the economy could slow this process \u2013 local government debt is a particular worry \u2013 but will not stop it. By 2025, one study suggests, 350 million more people will have moved to cities; more than the population of the US. Five years later the urban population will top 1 billion. There will be 221 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants; Europe currently has 35. The number of new skyscrapers could equate to 10 New York cities. The impact will be felt worldwide: in prices for commodities such as steel and copper, and in greenhouse gas emissions. Li Keqiang \u2013 the vice-premier expected to become prime minister in 2012 \u2013 has argued that urbanisation should be the &quot;strategic focus&quot; of expanding domestic demand. China needs to restructure its economy, moving away from exports and investment towards domestic consumption. In the short-term urbanisation creates demand for infrastructure and property; in the longer run, urbanites consume vastly more than rural dwellers. Han Jun, deputy director with the state council&apos;s development research centre \u2013 a top government thinktank \u2013 has predicted that the process will boost domestic demand by 30trn yuan (\u00a33trn) by 2030. Cities such as Guiyang are at the heart of the government&apos;s strategy. It is the capital of south-western Guizhou, China&apos;s poorest province, where just 34% of the population is urban. It already has 3 million inhabitants and is challenging terrain for expansion: &quot;This is Guizhou \u2013 you open the door, you have to climb a mountain,&quot; says one resident. But its boundaries are expanding north, south, east and west. There are cranes everywhere and scores of developments thrusting into the skyline, their names \u2013 Dreamland, Sky Acropolis \u2013 as lofty as their dimensions. Further out, at Xinzaipo, a water buffalo is snuffling along a path and a cockerel crows in the distance. But a new road curves through the little valley and a vast printing plant is rising above the rice fields. Two medicine factories will claim an adjacent patch. When they drive three railway lines through another, the farmers will move to new homes down the road, returning to tend what land remains. Li Chengqiang has watched the city crawl closer and closer to his farm. Now it has begun to absorb it. &quot;The land is the most fundamental basis of our family. Even though the country advocates industrial development, people still have to eat. [Besides], the crops planted by ourselves taste better,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s noisier now. When we were little, we didn&apos;t have to close our door at night to sleep. There are different kinds of people around all the time these days.&quot; Yet he welcomes the transition. &quot;The housing has changed, the roads have changed, we can eat well,&quot; Li says. Despite his emotional attachment to the land, his main income now comes from selling cement. Xinzaipo is unusual. None of the farmers have lost all their land, and Li and his friends seem \u2013 so far, at least \u2013 sanguine about the changes. But land seizures by local authorities are one of the main causes of the tens of thousands of protests that break out in China each year; earlier this month hundreds of villagers in southern Guangdong besieged government buildings and attacked police over confiscated farmland. Standard Chartered analysts have suggested 2.5 million to 3 million farmers a year lose land to development, rarely with sufficient compensation. &quot;Of course urbanisation is good for China \u2013 but not this kind of urbanisation,&quot; warns Prof Tao Ran, a land issues expert at Renmin University. Corrupt officials are often blamed for taking bribes from developers. But Tao says the problem was more basic. Land is collectively owned and farmers have no right to sell the patches they lease. Land sales have become one of the main sources of income for local governments, generating as much as a third to a half of revenues in some areas. But the tax system is skewed so that local revenues benefit from industrial development far more than residential. Tao says that there is already overcapacity in manufacturing, yet around 50% of new urban areas become industrial parks, while only 20% or 30% are residential, compared with 50% to 70% residential in other countries. In many cases the industry moving westwards is also energy intensive and heavily polluting, adding to the heavy environmental toll of urbanisation. The solution, Tao argues, is to allow farmers&apos; collectives to sell the land or build houses upon it themselves, introducing a land sales tax and a property tax to make up the shortfall in government revenues. But he predicts: &quot;You will see this model continue until it collapses \u2026 there is no real reform to make these grand objectives happen.&quot; Tao is also sceptical about the government&apos;s promotion of distributed urbanisation, with smaller cities spread throughout the country, arguing that in reality migrants will continue to be attracted to\u00a0megacities. Many others support Beijing&apos;s strategy, but question its implementation. &quot;Some of the plans look good on paper, but in reality the rush to build is creating cities that will have to be completely rethought in 20 years&apos; time as expectations, aspirations and sustainability imperatives change,&quot; warns James of the Global Cities Institute. China risks wiping out older cultures and building dreary cities, he says; it is covering landscapes in one generation, but with consequences for the foreseeable future. Others worry about the safety standards of so much rushed construction. Last Tuesday 270 people were injured in a crash on a Shanghai subway line built barely a year ago. The same day Chinese media reported that a 8bn yuan (\u00a3800m) highway in Gansu had closed for repairs less than 80 days after opening. Beijing may drive urbanisation, but it does not control it. The results are often messy, chaotic and unanticipated. &quot;A lot of things are being built because they are flavour of the month. It&apos;s good for the party secretary or mayor to be able to say: &apos;I built this ring road and in the process GDP went up,&apos; because it cost a lot,&quot; says Leman. &quot;It&apos;s the nature of urban management in China that you go into a city and there are eight-lane roads that end in a field.&quot; Additional research by Han Cheng \u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2011.

Or you can look at the children in Qixin village. Zhao Ai is nine, but is so short he appears three years younger. He eats nothing between leaving home at 6.30am \u2013 for a two-hour trek down the mountain to Ruiyuan primary school \u2013 and returning at 5pm. Last year, Shanghai took the top spot in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)&apos;s international rankings for reading, maths and science in state schools. Meanwhile, at Zhao&apos;s primary, the big educational challenge is &quot;no food&quot;, says headteacher Xu Zuhua. Malnutrition stunts her pupils&apos; growth and hampers their concentration. There is no better illustration of the growing gulf between cities and the countryside as China transforms itself from a rural to an urban nation. Between 1990 and 2009, China slashed its numbers of rural poor from 85 million to 35.97 million, thanks in large part to the wages sent home by migrant workers. The government hopes further urbanisation will lift children like Zhao out of poverty. Yet many fear that two Chinas are emerging, with the countryside falling ever further behind. &quot;Even though we are developing, it feels like urban areas are running while we are strolling,&quot; says Zhou Liude, who oversees Ruiyuan and nearby schools. For every one yuan of a rural resident&apos;s income, a city-dweller enjoys 3.23 yuan in disposable income \u2013 and that may significantly understate the gap. Include the extra services and benefits enjoyed by urbanites, such as subsidised housing, and &quot;many observers believe that the ratio would easily be in the range of four to five and is arguably among the highest in the world,&quot; says professor Kam Wing Chan, an expert on migrants at the University of Washington. &quot;China&apos;s incomes are increasingly polarised. This large income gap is definitely a contributor in the background to the more frequent and violent protests and unrest in the last few months.&quot; Even farmers who reach the cities as migrant workers are in effect second-class citizens, because China&apos;s hukou \u2013 household registration \u2013 system classifies people as urban or rural and allocates rights to services accordingly. One Chinese academic has described the result as &quot;counterfeit urbanisation&quot;: cities full of people who cannot enjoy much of city life. The government has sought to invest in rural areas, and the benefits of growth are spreading. In the towns around Qixin you see stores with gleaming yellow motorbikes and adverts for 3G and coffee. But these remain unimaginable luxuries for families like Zhao&apos;s, who survive on basic farming and wages sent home by relatives working in cities. Their poverty is disguised by development: the further away from the road people live, the poorer they are \u2013 and the worse their children&apos;s grades \u2013 says Ruiyuan&apos;s headteacher. Education has always been the great hope for China&apos;s poor. Villagers built Ruiyuan themselves to improve their children&apos;s opportunities. But rural scholars lag their peers from the start. Zhao Ai&apos;s father died in a mudslide; his mother is a migrant labourer hundreds of miles away. He is one of China&apos;s 50 million &quot;left behind&quot; children, raised by grandparents because the hukou system makes family migration difficult. They have inferior educational results and more behavioural problems than the average child. Relatives can be unable or unwilling to care for them properly; sometimes, they are carers for sick and ageing grandparents. With few adults around, they must help with household chores and farming before they can turn to homework. Zhao Ai is lucky; his family make up in warmth what they lack in income. But he is an anxious child, noticeably quieter than his boisterous schoolmates. He struggles on the steep climb back home, a punishing scramble through woods and fields, on an empty stomach. Education officials want to build a boarding school and have even found a company willing to donate 400,000 yuan (about \u00a340,000) \u2013 but would need three times that to pipe water to the site. So for the foreseeable future, Zhao Ai and his friends are stuck with their long journeys and school days in an ageing, cracking building with no running water or heating. Finding suitable staff is hard because few young graduates want to live somewhere so remote. English is compulsory, but Ruiyuan has nobody capable of teaching it. Experts say the disparity between rural and urban educational standards is one reason why the proportion of rural students in universities \u2013 particularly the top ones \u2013 is falling rapidly. According to Chinese media, pupils from the countryside made up 62% of those sitting national college entrance exams last year, but only 17% of those entering the elite Tsinghua University. In recent years, Chinese leaders have sought to give rural areas more help. Official statistics suggest the income gap may have closed slightly within the last year, though experts suspect this reflects sampling changes. Li Keqiang, who is expected to become premier next year, has suggested urbanisation could &quot;pull up&quot; the countryside as a smaller number of farmers consolidate land, leading to increased productivity \u2013 though much farmland is being lost to development. Yet the best prospect for most farmers remains a move to the cities. Wang Fang and her husband, Chen Shuangfu, arrived in the provincial capital, Guiyang, 10 years ago, with just 10 yuan in their pockets. Their hard, unappealing work \u2013 collecting and sorting rubbish for recycling \u2013 earns them as much as 20,000 yuan a year, compared with their 1,000 yuan income back home. But their rural hukou means they are not entitled to many services \u2013 and, since the hukou is inherited, neither are their sons. Schools do not receive extra funding for migrant pupils; many claim they are full, or charge hefty illicit fees. The couple have spent 50,000 yuan since their sons reached school age in &quot;donations&quot; to get them into a public school and illicit extra fees. &quot;I can&apos;t read or write; I can&apos;t even speak standard Mandarin well. We don&apos;t want our children to be like us,&quot; says Chen. Migrant workers build China&apos;s cities, clean their homes and clear their rubbish \u2013 but other residents &quot;call us beggars and use dirty words,&quot; added Wang. That might not have mattered so much to an earlier generation of workers, who planned to return to their villages in retirement. But many younger migrants have little experience of farming, and believe their futures lie in towns. &quot;[Urbanisation] is better than an economy without growth. But when you grow, you also have to provide services to [migrants] and not only use them as cheap labour \u2026 You need children to move with their parents to cities and you need services for the left-behind elderly,&quot; warns Tao Ran, an expert on rural affairs at Renmin University. There are promising pilot projects that attempt to tackle the urban-rural gulf: improving education for poorer children; increasing integration. Cities such as Chongqing and Guangdong have been experimenting with limited hukou reform. But such programmes are often tightly restricted and cover workers who have moved from country to town within a province. In many cases migrants have been wary of switching registration, fearing the compensation for lost land and home is insufficient to establish them in the city. Chan, of the University of Washington, said reforms needed to go deeper and to involve Beijing. &quot;Hukou reform has to be gradual, but it has to tackle the core of the issue,&quot; he says. &quot;The core issue, for example, in Guangdong, is to gradually accept migrant workers from outside the province \u2013 the majority of the migrant workers \u2013 as equals.&quot; Wholesale hukou reform is an alarming prospect for officials, raising the spectre of an expensive and uncontrollable surge to the cities. But the alternative is an unbridgeable gap between town and country \u2013 with children such as Zhao Ai stranded in poverty as his urban peers romp ahead.

The table was heated; a luxury that suited our mode of repose. Conversation typically ranged between which half-cocked Britpop band had been lurking in our local or who&apos;d won most games of pool. On this occasion, a more important matter was at hand: the table bore the programme for the 1995 BFI London film festival. It&apos;s not clear where we got it. It could have been a record shop counter or a Soho cafe. What mattered was how neatly this event celebrated student life. It slipped easily into a schedule of late lectures and misspent afternoons. It coaxed us with the promise of world cinema and cheap matinee tickets. It gratified our growing conceit that London contained every possible strand of cultural activity. Some hours later, our choices were made: Shanghai Triad, The Doom Generation and Devil in a Blue Dress. All three were enjoyable, but it was Gregg Araki&apos;s that had the greatest impact. It wasn&apos;t the greatest story, but what a difference it made seeing an indie film at the Odeon West End. Like hearing dub music on a proper soundsystem, seeing the shock-cut road movie on the big screen mesmerised us in a way that a ropey VHS would never have managed. Unable to erase scenes like the cowgirl getting it on to Aphex Twin from our heads, we spilled out on to Leicester Square and back to reality. Unsurprisingly, I returned the following year. This time I came to realise the benefits of full-price admission. Acting on a tip from a friend in Paris, we cycled down to the NFT to see Des Nouvelles du Bon Dieu \u2013 a French comedy whose existential plot sat well with our student concerns. By the closing titles, many questions had arisen. Handy then that the writer and director sauntered up in front of the screen and started swapping theories with the audience. The opportunity to enjoy the company of a film&apos;s creators is one of the festival&apos;s finest features. Since finishing my degree, I&apos;ve spent most of the last 15 years in London. The festival has written its way into every chapter of this story \u2013 along the way, I&apos;ve enjoyed introducing all sorts of folks to its charms. A Lynch-virgin school friend had his mind blown by Lost Highway. A colleague and I got our first taste of Experimenta via some lively Brakhage shorts and a Tesla-based soup called Spectres of the Spectrum. A seven-year relationship clocked its passing with trips to the festival. It started with a trip to see Waking Life. There amid Linklater&apos;s rotoscopic tapestry, a shared love of film blossomed and a ruinous tradition commenced. My ex joined the BFI to gain access to priority booking. Each year, we attempted to see more films than the last. We ended up reaching a heady crescendo involving several hundred pounds worth of festival tickets. The same year, a late-night misadventure on the stairs of Tottenham Court Road tube left me with a sprained ankle. Hobbling my way back and forth between the NFT and the Odeon West End, I realised we might have gone too far. In hindsight, the festival&apos;s greatest virtue is its diversity. Gala screenings provide a chance to get ahead on forthcoming blockbusters. Treasures from the archives allowed me to catch some classic Hitchcock and hear Lewis Gilbert talk about Alfie. Despite sections dedicated to every major outlet of European cinema, I&apos;ve frequently been tempted to travel further afield. Movies fill the schedule from all over the world and favourites have taken me around Finland, Colombia, Algeria and Bhutan. At the same time, I&apos;ve been able to stay in touch with the latest American independent offerings. From Hal Hartley&apos;s repeated attempts to regain form to a moving portrayal of the singer Roky Erickson&apos;s battles with schizophrenia, the LFF seems to cover every facet of alternative film-making. Music documentaries seem to be a frequent fixture for me. There&apos;s something about seeing (and hearing) these films in a real cinema that no amount of home AV fiddling can match. Great times were had reliving past decades through Festival Express and Wattstax. A gala opening of a Ray Charles biopic saw people grooving in their seats. A film on the photographs of Milt Hinton provided a privileged peek behind the scenes during the heyday of jazz. Above all, I can&apos;t help but be amazed by the amount of energy Sandra Hebron finds each year. As festival director she seems to single-handedly select, review, and conduct interviews with the people behind most of the titles in the schedule. It doesn&apos;t always look a pleasure. After slogging through a couple of hours of The Dancer Upstairs, an audience with grumpy John Malkovich didn&apos;t help. But Hebron&apos;s lively chat with Javier Bardem more than compensated.

I&apos;m proud of my team, I&apos;m proud of our members, I&apos;m proud to lead this party \u2013 but most of all, I&apos;m proud of you. People have very clear instructions for this government: &quot;Lead us out of this economic mess.&quot; &quot;Do it in a way that&apos;s fair and right.&quot; &quot;And as you do it, make sure you build something worthwhile for us and our children.&quot; Clear instructions. Clear objectives. And from me: a clear understanding that in these difficult times, it is leadership we need. To get our economy moving. To get our society working, and in a year \u2013 the Olympics year \u2013 when the world will be watching us, to show everyone what Great Britain really means. But first I want to say something to you in this hall. Thank you. Despite the predictions we won elections all over the country this May, so let&apos;s hear it for those great campaigns you fought and the great results you achieved. And thank you for something else. In the AV referendum, you did Britain a service and kicked that useless voting system off the political agenda for decades to come. And next year let&apos;s make sure we back Boris, beat Ken and keep London Conservative. You&apos;re not just winners \u2013 you&apos;re doers. This summer, as before, Conservatives went to Rwanda to build classrooms, teach children and help grow businesses. Social action: that is the spirit of the modern Conservative party. This is a party \u2013 ours is a country \u2013 that never walks on by. Earlier this year some people said to me: &quot;Libya&apos;s not our concern&quot;, &quot;don&apos;t start what you can&apos;t finish&quot;, and even \u2013 &quot;Arabs don&apos;t do democracy.&quot; But if we had stood aside this spring, people in Benghazi would have been massacred. And don&apos;t let anyone say this wasn&apos;t in our national interest. Remember what Gaddafi did. He&apos;s the man who gave Semtex to the IRA, who was behind the shooting of a police officer in a London square, who was responsible for the bombing of a plane in the skies over Lockerbie. Let&apos;s be proud of the part we played in giving the Libyan people the chance to take back their country. In Afghanistan today, there are men and women fighting for Britain as bravely as any in our history. They come from across our country: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland. They now have the equipment they need. And we&apos;re on target to bring them home by the end of 2014. Theirs has been a campaign of incredible courage and sacrifice, and I know everyone in this hall will want to send a message to everyone who serves and who have served. Those in uniform in our armed forces and in our police. And those not in uniform, keeping us safe from terrorism on our streets. We&apos;re proud of you. We salute you. Thank you. But leadership in the world is about moral strength as much as military might. A few months ago I was in Nigeria, on a trade mission. While I was there, I visited a vaccination clinic. It was very hot, pretty basic and the lights kept going off. But to the rows of women, cuddling their babies, this place was a godsend. One of the nurses told me that if it wasn&apos;t for British aid, many of those beautiful babies would be dead. In four years&apos; time, this country will have helped vaccinate more of the world&apos;s poorest children than there are people in the whole of England. Of course, we&apos;ll make sure your money goes to the people who need it most, and we&apos;ll do it in a way that&apos;s transparent and accountable. But I really believe, despite all our difficulties, that this is the right thing to do. That it&apos;s a mark of our country, and our people, that we never turn our backs on the world&apos;s poorest, and everyone in Britain can be incredibly proud of it. Leadership in fighting poverty. Leadership in fighting tyranny. But when it came to that decision to help the Libyan people, there was something dispiriting about the debate here at home. It wasn&apos;t that some people thought we shouldn&apos;t do what we did \u2013 of course it&apos;s everyone&apos;s right to disagree. It was that too many thought Britain actually couldn&apos;t do something like that any more. And you hear that kind of pessimism about our economic future, our social problems, our political system. That our best days are behind us. That we&apos;re on a path of certain decline. Well I&apos;m here to tell you that it isn&apos;t true. Of course, if we sit around and hope for the best, the rest will leave us behind. If we fool ourselves that we can grow our economy, mend our society, give our children the future we want them to have. If we fool ourselves that we can do these things without effort, without correcting past mistakes, without confronting vested interests and failed ideas, then no, we&apos;re not going to get anywhere. But if we put in the effort, correct those mistakes, confront those vested interests and take on the failed ideas of the past, then I know we can turn this ship around. Nobody wants false optimism. And I will never pretend there are short cuts to success. But success will come: with the right ideas, the right approach, the right leadership. Leadership from government: to set out the direction we must take, and the choices we must make. But leadership also from you. Because the things that will really deliver success are not politicians or government. It&apos;s the people of Britain, and the spirit of Britain. Some say that to succeed in this world, we need to become more like India, or China, or Brazil. I say: we need to become more like us. The real us. Hard-working, pioneering, independent, creative, adaptable, optimistic, can-do. That&apos;s the spirit that has made this United Kingdom what it is: a small country that does great things; one of the most incredible success stories in the history of the world. And it&apos;s a spirit that&apos;s alive and well today. I see it in Tania Sidney-Roberts, the head teacher I met in Norwich who started a free school from scratch, now four times over-subscribed. Her ambition? To set up another school and do it all over again. That&apos;s leadership. I see it in the group of GPs in Bexley who have taken more control of their budgets, and got their patients \u2013 some of the poorest in the country \u2013 free care on Harley Street. Their ambition? To cut waiting times, cut costs and improve care \u2013 all in one go. That&apos;s leadership. And we all saw it this summer. Dan Thompson watched the riots unfold on television. But he didn&apos;t sit there and say &apos;the council will clean it up.&apos; He got on the internet. He sent out a call. And with others, he started a social movement. People picked up their brooms and reclaimed their streets. So the argument I want to make today is simple: leadership works. I know how tough things are. I don&apos;t for one minute underestimate how worried people feel, whether about making ends meet, or the state of the world economy. But the truth is, right now we need to be energised, not paralysed by gloom and fear. Half the world is booming \u2013 let&apos;s go and sell to them. So many of our communities are thriving \u2013 let&apos;s make the rest like them. There&apos;s so much that&apos;s great about our country. We don&apos;t have to accept that success in this century automatically belongs to someone else. We just have to remember the origin of our achievements: the people of Britain, taking a lead. That&apos;s why so much of my leadership is about unleashing your leadership. Giving everyone who wants to seize it the opportunity, the support and above all the freedom to get things done. Giving everyone who wants to believe it the confidence that working hard and taking responsibility will be rewarded not punished. So let&apos;s reject the pessimism. Let&apos;s bring on the can-do optimism. Let&apos;s summon the energy and the appetite to fight for a better future for our country, Great Britain. Of course that starts with our economy. As we meet here in Manchester, the threat to the world economy \u2013 and to Britain \u2013 is as serious today as it was in 2008 when world recession loomed. The eurozone is in crisis, the French and German economies have slowed to a standstill; even mighty America is being questioned about her debts. It is an anxious time. Prices and bills keep going up \u2013 petrol, the weekly shop, electricity. On the news it&apos;s job losses, cutbacks, closures. You think about tuition fees, and house prices, the cost of a deposit, and wonder how our children will cope. Of course, government can help \u2013 and this one is. We have cut petrol duty, kept the winter fuel allowance and kept cold weather payments. We froze council tax this year, and as George announced in that great speech on Monday, we&apos;re going to freeze it again next year too. But we need to tell the truth about the overall economic situation. People understand that when the economy goes into recession, times get tough. But normally, after a while, things pick up. Strong growth returns. People get back into work. This time, it&apos;s not like that. And people want to know why the good times are so long coming. The answer is straightforward, but uncomfortable. This was no normal recession; we&apos;re in a debt crisis. It was caused by too much borrowing, by individuals, businesses, banks, and most of all, governments. When you&apos;re in a debt crisis, some of the normal things that government can do, to deal with a normal recession, like borrowing to cut taxes or increase spending \u2013 these things won&apos;t work because they lead to more debt, which would make the crisis worse. Why? Because it risks higher interest rates, less confidence and the threat of even higher taxes in future. The only way out of a debt crisis is to deal with your debts. That&apos;s why households are paying down their credit card and store card bills. It means banks getting their books in order. And it means governments \u2013 all over the world \u2013 cutting spending and living within their means. This coalition government, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg and I \u2013 we&apos;ve led the way here in Britain. Our plan is right. And our plan will work. I know you can&apos;t see it or feel it yet. But think of it like this. The new economy we&apos;re building: it&apos;s like building a house. The most important part is the part you can&apos;t see \u2013 the foundations that make it stable. Slowly, but surely, we&apos;re laying the foundations for a better future. But this is the crucial point: it will only work if we stick with it. And there&apos;s something else we&apos;ve got to stick to. Because we&apos;re not in the euro, we can lay these foundations ourselves: on our own terms; in our own way. So let me say this: as long as I&apos;m Prime Minister, we will never join the euro. And I won&apos;t let us be sucked into endless bail-outs of countries that are in the euro either. Yes, we&apos;re leading members of the IMF and have our responsibilities there. But when it comes to any euro bailout mechanism, my approach is simple: Labour got us into it and I&apos;ve made sure we&apos;re getting out of it. Of course, our deficit reduction programme is just one big bailout of the last Labour government. This past year we&apos;ve been subjected to a sort of national apology tour by Labour. Sorry for sucking up to Gaddafi. For not regulating the banks properly. For crushing civil liberties. For failing to go green. For not building enough homes. For the infighting that made them the most dysfunctional government ever. But you know what? Nothing \u2013 not a peep \u2013 on the thing they really need to say sorry for. Wasting billions and billions of your money. No apology for that. You know what the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls claimed last week? That Labour didn&apos;t spend more money than they had &quot;available&quot;. Hello? Ed \u2013 you spent \u00a3428 billion more than you had &quot;available&quot;. There is only one conclusion you can rationally draw. We must never let these Labour politicians anywhere near our economy again. As before, it falls to us to clear up after the Labour party. I have insisted that we do it in a way that is fair. You can&apos;t cut a deficit the size of ours without everyone making a sacrifice. But those with the most money are bearing the biggest burden. We&apos;ve imposed a permanent levy on the banks, getting them to pay more every year than Labour did in one year. We&apos;ve raised taxes on people who make their money overseas but live here. At the same time we&apos;ve given real help to the poorest and most vulnerable. We&apos;re taking over a million of the lowest-paid people out of tax altogether. And after the scandal of the 75p pension rise under Labour, we&apos;re linking pensions to earnings so elderly people will be \u00a310,000 better off in their retirement. Yes, this is a one-nation deficit reduction plan \u2013 from a one-nation party. And here&apos;s something else that we \u2013 yes we \u2013 have done. The NHS is the most precious institution in our country \u2013 to my family, to your family. At the last election, it was Labour policy to cut the NHS. It was Liberal Democrat policy to cut the NHS. It was our policy \u2013 Conservative policy \u2013 to protect the NHS and spend more on it this year, next year and the year after that because we are the party of the NHS, and as long as I&apos;m here we always will be. But real fairness isn&apos;t just about what the state spends. It&apos;s about the link between what you put in and what you get out. As we debate what people get from the state, let&apos;s remember how we generate taxes. So to the unions planning to strike over public sector pensions I say this. You have every right to protest. But our population is ageing. Our public sector pensions system is unaffordable. The only way to give public sector workers a decent, sustainable pensions system, and do right by the taxpayer, is to ask public servants to work a little longer and contribute a little more. That is fair. What is not fair, what is not right, is going on strikes that will hurt the very people who help pay for your pensions. Dealing with our debts is line one, clause one of our plan for growth. But it is just the start. We need jobs \u2013 and we won&apos;t get jobs by growing government, we need to grow our businesses. So here&apos;s our growth plan: doing everything we can to help businesses start, grow, thrive, succeed. Where that means backing off, cutting regulation \u2013 back off, cut regulation. Where that means intervention, investment \u2013 intervene, invest. Whatever it takes to help our businesses take on the world \u2013 we&apos;ll do it. The global economy has transformed in recent years. It used to take companies decades to become global giants: now it can take a couple of years. When you step off the plane in Delhi or Shanghai or Lagos, you can feel the energy, the hunger, the drive to succeed. We need that here. Frankly, there&apos;s too much &apos;can&apos;t do&apos; sogginess around. We need to be a sharp, focused, can-do country. But as we go for growth, the last thing I want is to pump the old economy back up, with a banking sector out of control, manufacturing squeezed, and prosperity confined to a few parts of the country and a select few industries. Our plan is to build something new and to build something better. We can do it. Look what&apos;s happening in East London. Europe&apos;s financial capital is now matched by Europe&apos;s technology capital in Tech City. Facebook, Intel, Google, Cisco \u2013 even Silicon Valley Bank \u2013 seeing our potential and investing here. Look what&apos;s happening across our country. The wings of the world&apos;s biggest jumbo jet \u2013 built in Wales. The world&apos;s most famous digger \u2013 the JCB \u2013 made in Staffordshire. Do you watch Formula One? Well whether it&apos;s the German Michael Schumacher, the Australian Mark Webber or the Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, they all have one thing in common \u2013 they drive cars built right here in Britain. This is the new economy we&apos;re building: leading in advanced manufacturing, technology, life sciences, green engineering. Inventing, creating, exporting. Of course, it&apos;s easy to talk about these things: harder to deliver it. For a start, you won&apos;t deliver it just by dividing industries into saints and sinners. That&apos;s not just an insult to the financial and insurance companies, accountancy firms and professional services that make us billions of pounds and create millions of jobs \u2013 it&apos;s much too simplistic. As I&apos;ve always argued, we need businesses to be more socially responsible. But to get proper growth, to rebalance our economy, we&apos;ve got to put some important new pieces into place. Taking action now to get credit flowing to the small businesses that are the engine of the economy. And ringfencing the banks so they fulfil their role of lending safely to the real economy. Setting up technology and innovation centres where scientists and academics can work with entrepreneurs to turn brilliant inventions into successful products. Reforming taxation to encourage enterprise and investment in high growth firms. And sometimes that means taking controversial decisions; challenging vested interests. When firms need to adapt quickly to win orders and contracts, we can&apos;t go on with rigid, outdated employment regulations. The critics may say: what about workers&apos; rights? But the most important worker&apos;s right of all is having a job in the first place. When in modern business you&apos;re either quick or you&apos;re dead, it&apos;s hopeless that our transport infrastructure lags so far behind Europe&apos;s. That&apos;s why we need to build high speed rail and why we&apos;ll get the best superfast broadband network in Europe too. When a balanced economy needs workers with skills, we need to end the old snobbery about vocational education and training. We&apos;ve provided funding for 250,000 extra apprenticeships \u2013 but not enough big companies are delivering. So here&apos;s a direct appeal: If you want skilled employees, we&apos;ll provide the funding, we&apos;ll cut the red tape. But you&apos;ve got to show more leadership and give us the apprenticeships we need. Unlocking growth and rebalancing our economy also requires change in Brussels. The EU is the biggest single market in the world \u2013 but it&apos;s not working properly. Almost every day, I see pointless new regulation coming our way. A couple of weeks ago I was up in the flat, going through some work before the start of the day and I saw this EU directive. Do you know what it was about? Whether people with diabetes should be allowed to drive. What&apos;s that got to do with the single market? Do you suppose anyone in China is thinking: I know how we&apos;ll grow our economy \u2013 let&apos;s get those diabetics off our roads. Europe has to wake up \u2013 and the EU growth plan we&apos;ve published, backed by eight countries, which I want us to push at every meeting, every council, every summit, is the alarm call that Brussels needs. There&apos;s one more thing. Our businesses need the space to grow \u2013 literally. That&apos;s one of the reasons we&apos;re reforming our planning system. It&apos;s hard to blame local people for opposing developments when they get none of the benefits. We&apos;re changing that. If a new manufacturing plant is built in your area \u2013 your community keeps the business rates. If new homes get built \u2013 you keep the council tax. This is a localist plan from a localist party. Now I know people are worried about what this means for conservation. Let me tell you: I love our countryside and there&apos;s nothing I would do to put it at risk. But let&apos;s get the balance right. The proportion of land in England that is currently built up is 9%. Yes, 9%. There are businesses out there desperate to expand, to hire thousands of people \u2013 but they&apos;re stuck in the mud of our planning system. Of course we&apos;re open to constructive ideas about how to get this right. But to those who just oppose everything we&apos;re doing, my message is this: Take your arguments down to the job centre. We&apos;ve got to get Britain back to work. The new economy we&apos;re building must work for everyone. You know the real tragedy of New Labour&apos;s economy? Not just that it was unsustainable, unbalanced, overwhelmed with debt. But that it left so many behind. Labour talked opportunity but ripped the ladders of opportunity away. We had an education system that left hundreds of thousands unprepared for work. A welfare system that trapped millions in dependency. An immigration system that brought in migrant workers to do the jobs that those on welfare were being paid not to do. We had a housing system that failed to meet demand, so prices shot up and fuelled an unsustainable boom. And we had a government that creamed the taxes off the boom to splurge back into benefits \u2013 redoubling the failure all over again. Labour: who tell us they care so much about fairness, about justice, who say they want to hit the rich and help the poor \u2013 it was Labour gave us the casino economy and the welfare society. So who&apos;s going to lift the poorest up? Who&apos;s going to get our young people back to work? Who&apos;s going to create a more equal society? No, not you, the self-righteous Labour party. It will be us, the Conservatives who finally build an economy that works for everyone and gives hope to everyone in our country. That starts with a good education \u2013 for everyone. It sounds so simple: proper teaching, good discipline, rigorous exams. But it&apos;s hard. It&apos;s hard because our education system has been infected by an ideology that instead of insisting on every child&apos;s success has too often made excuses for failure. They said: &quot;poor kids can&apos;t learn.&quot; &quot;Black boys can&apos;t do well.&quot; &quot;In this community we really mustn&apos;t expect too much \u2013 don&apos;t you understand?&quot; Oh yes, I do understand. Believe me I do understand and I am disgusted by the idea that we should aim for any less for a child from a poor background than a rich one. I have contempt for the notion that we should accept narrower horizons for a black child than a white one. Yes it&apos;s the age-old irony of the liberal left: they practise oppression and call it equality. So we are fighting back. And something massive is happening. There is now irrefutable proof that the right schools, with the right freedoms and the right leadership, can transform the education of the most deprived children. You heard yesterday from that inspirational student from Burlington Danes Academy in Hammersmith. Inner city school. Deprived area. Nearly half the pupils on free school meals. But this year, three-quarters got five good GCSEs including English and maths. That&apos;s way better than what the majority of the state schools in Sussex, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire got last year \u2013 some of the most affluent counties in the country. Why? Because the headteacher, her staff, the parents \u2013 rose up and said: &quot;We are as good as anyone. Our children can achieve anything.&quot; Leadership works. So we&apos;re backing more head teachers to turn schools into academies. And we want more parents, teachers, charities, businesses, entrepreneurs, to come in to our education system and set up Academies and Free Schools. Change really is underway. For the first time in a long time, the numbers studying those core and vital subjects history, geography, languages are going up. Pupils&apos; exams will be marked on their punctuation and grammar. And teachers are going to be able to search pupils&apos; bags for anything banned in school \u2013 mobile phones, alcohol, weapons, anything. It&apos;s a long, hard road back to rigour, but we&apos;re well and truly on our way. And here&apos;s something else we&apos;re going to do. In Britain today, we have schools that are intolerant of failure, where 90% of pupils get five good GCSEs. Yes: private schools. You&apos;ve heard me talk about social responsibility so let me say this. I want to see private schools start academies, and sponsor academies in the state system. Wellington College does it, Dulwich does it \u2013 others can too. The apartheid between our private and state schools is one of the biggest wasted opportunities in our country today. So let it be this party that helps tear it down. Rigour back in learning. Standards back in schools. Teachers back in control. Yes \u2013 the Conservatives are back in government. An economy that works for everyone means sorting out welfare and immigration too. Welfare began as a lifeline. For too many it&apos;s become a way of life. Generation after generation in the cycle of dependency \u2013 and we are determined to break it. Part of our answer is controlling immigration. So we&apos;ve put a cap on the numbers of non-EU immigrants allowed to come into our country to work. We mustn&apos;t lock out talent - I want the best and brightest entrepreneurs, scientists and students from around the world to get the red carpet treatment. But the bogus colleges, the fake marriages, the people arriving for a month and staying for years, the criminals who use the Human Rights Act to try and stay in the country \u2013 we are clamping down on all of them. We&apos;ve got to get some sense back into our labour market and get British people back into work. For years you&apos;ve been conned by governments. To keep the unemployment figures down, they&apos;ve parked as many people as possible on the sick. Two and a half million, to be exact. Not officially unemployed, but claiming welfare, no questions asked. Now we&apos;re asking those questions. It turns out that of the 1.3 million people who have put in a claim for the new sickness benefit in recent years. One million are either able to work, or stopped their claim before their medical assessment had been completed. Under Labour they got something for nothing. With us they&apos;ll only get something, if they give something. If they are prepared to work, we&apos;re going to help them \u2013 and I mean really help them. If you&apos;ve been out of work and on benefits for five years, a quick session down the job centre and a new CV just isn&apos;t going to cut it. You need to get your self-esteem and confidence back; you need training and skills; intensive personal support. Previous governments were never willing to make a proper commitment to this, but we have \u2013 investing now, so we don&apos;t pay later. We&apos;re going to spend up to \u00a314,000 on some people just to get them trained and back into work. Yes, I know that&apos;s a lot of money \u2013 but it&apos;s worth it. Let it be us, let it be this government that finally builds an economy where no one is left behind. And for most people that includes a home of their own: not just any old home but a decent one: light and spacious, a place with a proper front door and room for the kids to play in. But the percentage of British people who own their home is going down. Unless they get help from their parents, do you know the average age of a first-time buyer in our country today? Thirty seven. You hear people say: &quot;Why can&apos;t people just rent like in Europe?&quot; or &quot;There&apos;s nothing we can do because we don&apos;t have the money.&quot; I disagree. The failure of the housing market is bound up in the debt crisis. Because lenders won&apos;t lend, builders won&apos;t build and buyers can&apos;t buy. We&apos;re sorting this out, bringing back the Right to Buy and using the money to build new homes. Macmillan made us the party of the property-owning democracy. Margaret Thatcher gave people the Right to Buy. Now let us, in this generation, inspire a new Tory housing revolution. While I&apos;m on the subject of those great Conservative figures, let me say this. I&apos;m incredibly fortunate to have such strong support from our previous leaders. Michael Howard. Iain Duncan Smith. William Hague. Sir John Major. And of course, Lady Thatcher. You know what? We don&apos;t boo our leaders. We&apos;re proud of our past and what those people did for our country. A few months ago, we were shocked by the scenes on our streets in London and other parts of the country. But perhaps the most shocking thing is that people weren&apos;t that surprised. There was no great call for a public enquiry to find out what had gone wrong. Instead the sound you could hear was the angry, insistent, overwhelming cry of a country shouting to its leaders: We know. We know why this happened. We know what&apos;s gone wrong. We know that if the system keeps fudging the difference between right and wrong, we&apos;ll never improve behaviour. We know that as long as the police go round with one hand tied behind their back, we&apos;ll never make our streets truly safe. And more than anything we know that if parents don&apos;t meet their responsibilities, kids will get out of control. Yes, people said: we know what&apos;s gone wrong: and we want you to put it right. One thing people want is speedy justice. After the riots those responsible were put straight in the courts and tough sentences were quickly handed out. And I&apos;ve made it clear to the police, to the prosecution services, to the Ministry of Justice, to the Attorney-General, if we could do that then, let&apos;s make sure we do it all the time. But the problems go deeper. That&apos;s why my driving mission in politics is to build a Big Society, a stronger society. It starts with families. I want to make this the most family-friendly government the country has ever seen. More childcare. More health visitors. More relationship support. More help with parenting. And for the 120,000 families that are most troubled \u2013 and causing the most trouble \u2013 a commitment to turn their lives around by the end of this Parliament. Today I can announce this: a new focus on the 65,000 children in care. Do you know how many children there are in care under the age of one? 3,660. And how many children under the age of one were adopted in our country last year? Sixty. This may not seem like the biggest issue facing our country, but it is the biggest issue for these children. How can we have let this happen: we&apos;ve got people flying all over the world to adopt babies, while the care system at home agonises about placing black children with white families. With the right values and the right effort, let&apos;s end this scandal and help these, the most vulnerable children of all. But for me, leadership on families also means speaking out on marriage. Marriage is not just a piece of paper. It pulls couples together through the ebb and flow of life. It gives children stability. And it says powerful things about what we should value. So yes, we will recognise marriage in the tax system. But we&apos;re also doing something else. I once stood before a Conservative conference and said it shouldn&apos;t matter whether commitment was between a man and a woman, a woman and a woman, or a man and another man. You applauded me for that. Five years on, we&apos;re consulting on legalising gay marriage. And to anyone who has reservations, I say: Yes, it&apos;s about equality, but it&apos;s also about something else: commitment. Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I don&apos;t support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I&apos;m a Conservative. We value community spirit and social action too. We see it everyday in our own lives, it&apos;s one of the great things about Britain, and do you know what? Over the last five years of the Labour government, the number of people volunteering went down. Last year, the decline was halted. And now the proportion of people saying they feel they belong strongly to their neighbourhood is the highest for a decade. If you&apos;re cynical, go to Wythenshawe, a few miles from here. It used to be ravaged by crime and drugs and graffiti. But local people opened a community hall and a gym. They got the kids off the streets. They cleaned up graffiti and kicked out the drug dealers. Of course, government can&apos;t legislate for this. But we can support the leadership that makes it happen. That&apos;s why we&apos;re giving neighbourhoods new powers to take over the running of parks, playgrounds and pubs. It&apos;s why we&apos;re making it easier for people to give their time and money to good causes. It&apos;s why we want elected mayors in our great cities, and it&apos;s why right now we&apos;re drawing up plans to really open up public services and give more power to people. But one of the biggest things holding people back is the shadow of health and safety. I was told recently about a school that wanted to buy a set of highlighter pens. But with the pens came a warning. Not so fast \u2013 make sure you comply with the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002. Including plenty of fresh air and hand and eye protection. Try highlighting in all that. This isn&apos;t how a great nation was built. Britannia didn&apos;t rule the waves with arm-bands on. So the vetting and barring scheme \u2013 we&apos;re scaling it back. CRB checks \u2013 we&apos;re cutting them back. At long last common sense is coming back to our country. Building stronger communities is why we&apos;ve introduced National Citizen Service. You saw it for yourself at the start of this afternoon&apos;s session. One of the people who took part this year, Owen Carter, wrote to me and said: &quot;[This] has changed my perspective of life \u2013 you can do anything if you work hard and have a supportive team around you. You can do anything.&quot; That&apos;s the spirit I&apos;m talking about. That&apos;s why we&apos;re tripling the scale of National Citizen Service. That&apos;s how we&apos;ll build our Big Society. That is leadership. Next year, we welcome the world for the Olympics \u2013 and of course the Queen&apos;s Diamond Jubilee. These two events say a lot about Britain. Tradition. Modernity. All in one. And today, we can choose to be a country that&apos;s back on its feet and striding forward. Paying down our debt and earning a living. Getting people off welfare and into work. Breaking new ground in education, with excellence for everyone not a privileged few. We can be a country where people look back on their life and say: I&apos;ve worked hard, I&apos;ve raised a family, I&apos;m part of a community and all along it was worth my while. We&apos;re too far away from that today but we can get there. It&apos;s not complicated, but not easy either \u2013 because nothing worthwhile is easily won. But you know, we&apos;ve been told we were finished before. They said when we lost an Empire that we couldn&apos;t find a role. But we found a role, took on communism and helped bring down the Berlin Wall. They called our economy the sick man of Europe. But we came back and turned this country into a beacon of enterprise. No, Britain never had the biggest population, the largest land mass, the richest resources, but we had the spirit. Remember: it&apos;s not the size of the dog in the fight \u2013 it&apos;s the size of the fight in the dog. Overcoming challenge, confounding the sceptics, reinventing ourselves, this is what we do. It&apos;s called leadership. Let&apos;s turn this time of challenge into a time of opportunity. Not sitting around, watching things happen and wondering why. But standing up, making things happen and asking why not. We have the people, we have the ideas, and now we have a government that&apos;s freeing those people, backing those ideas. So let&apos;s see an optimistic future. Let&apos;s show the world some fight. Let&apos;s pull together, work together. And together lead Britain to better days.", "tags": ["David Cameron", "Politics", "Conservative conference 2011", "Conservative conference", "Economic policy", "Recession", "Economics", "Business", "Libya", "Foreign policy", "Euro", "Conservatives", "Eurozone crisis", "Euro", "Health", "NHS", "Tax and spending", "LGBT rights", "Sexuality"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-05T16:22:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/05/david-camneron-speech-gravity-times", "sentences": ["There were countless contradictions like that: one minute Cameron was opposing those who say we need to become more like India and China, the next he was admiring the energy one feels in Delhi and Shanghai, adding: &quot;We need that here.&quot; He also assigned Britain a lead role in the death of communism that asked the facts to carry more than they could bear."], "title": "David Cameron's speech fails to match the gravity of the times", "article": "Outside the conference hall in Manchester, the skies were grey and threatening. Inside, the virtual skies, projected on a screen behind David Cameron, were blue and sunny. Outside, the world economy appeared more fragile than ever, with British growth figures revised down again to a measly 0.1%. Inside, the prime minister delivered a speech that flitted lightly from diabetic motorists to school punctuation via highlighter pens, all threaded together by upbeat talk of &quot;can-do optimism&quot; and the British bulldog spirit. As such, it was an address that would have looked decent enough in excerpted clips on the TV news \u2013 but which utterly failed to match the gravity of the times. It&apos;s not that Cameron should have offered an hour-long dirge of economic gloom, in the manner of Vince Cable, or even that he should have aped Ed Miliband&apos;s invocation of a &quot;quiet crisis&quot;. As Ronald Reagan understood, optimistic politicians \u2013 especially incumbents \u2013 are the ones that prosper. The problem is rather that happy talk makes no sense unless it is anchored to a plan of action. When Churchill sought to fill Britons with the belief that they would ultimately prevail against Nazism, he did not offer exhortation alone, but a military strategy. Cameron offered no plan at all to get Britain working again. At the centre of his speech was a growth-shaped hole. &quot;So here&apos;s our growth plan,&quot; he said, introducing the short paragraph dedicated to the subject. What followed was thin verging on translucent: &quot;Doing everything we can to help businesses start, grow, thrive, succeed. Where that means backing off, cutting regulation \u2013 back off, cut regulation. Where that means intervention, investment \u2013 intervene, invest. Whatever it takes to help our businesses take on the world \u2013 we&apos;ll do it.&quot; Imagine a problem in your own life, at work or in your family. And imagine proposing as the solution nothing more specific than: &quot;Whatever has to be done, we&apos;ll do.&quot; This was not a mere problem of rhetoric, but of policy. What has become undeniable this week is that neither the chancellor nor anyone else in the government has a strategy for growth. The pre-speech flap over credit card debt \u2013 with aides briefing that the PM would issue a politically insensitive, economically illiterate and growth-killing instruction that people hurry up and pay off their credit card bills \u2013 was indicative of that. But so was Cameron&apos;s actually delivered text, with its focus on European directives, health and safety rules and red tape \u2013 as if these were the roots of our current woes. As a result, the prime minister had no large argument to make, serving up instead a laundry list of points: a bit on education, a bit on foreign policy and a good dose of Labour bashing. In that last category came not only the now familiar accusation that the last government hosed money up the wall, but also that it was guilty of &quot;oppression&quot;, holding back black children through what George W Bush once called &quot;the soft bigotry of low expectations&quot;. But the speech also suggested that the Tories do not believe the Labour threat has entirely vanished. Much as the Conservatives derided Ed Miliband&apos;s performance last week, they clearly felt the need to respond. They did so by stealing some of the Labour leader&apos;s key lines, whether on the something-for-something society or the need to confront &quot;vested interests&quot;. Labour spokesmen were quick to seize on that as evidence that Miliband had redrawn the political battle lines and done so to their advantage. After all, will Cameron really challenge the vested interests in, say, the City? Still, he came up with several neat lines, the best of which was surely his cri de coeur on health and safety: &quot;Britannia didn&apos;t rule the waves with her armbands on.&quot; He also succeeded in winning applause for his important and admirable declaration that &quot;I don&apos;t support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I&apos;m a Conservative.&quot; That was revealing, and not only of the oceanic distance that now separates British conservatives from their counterparts in the US, where such a statement is unimaginable from someone in Cameron&apos;s position. One of the sub-themes of the prime minister&apos;s address was his keenness to re-establish his modernising, Cameroonian credentials. He did that by claiming that &quot;We are the party of the NHS&quot;, leading the battle against poverty. He also invoked the name of his spiritual hero Harold Macmillan and anointed his Tories a &quot;one nation party&quot;. Only a churl would have pointed out that 8,000 nurses are losing their jobs and that the NHS is about to undergo a top-down reorganisation many, if not most, in the health service oppose \u2013 or that central to the original Cameron project was a commitment to the environment, barely mentioned in Manchester and all but shredded by George Osborne on Monday. There were countless contradictions like that: one minute Cameron was opposing those who say we need to become more like India and China, the next he was admiring the energy one feels in Delhi and Shanghai, adding: &quot;We need that here.&quot; He also assigned Britain a lead role in the death of communism that asked the facts to carry more than they could bear. Still, the second you had noticed such a problem, this butterfly speech had flitted off somewhere else. He was helped, of course, by his presentational skills, still present here despite a sore throat and what seemed to be a spot of the perennial conference lurgy. Even when he trod on some of his own applause lines, he remains by far the best performer of the party leaders \u2013 and that gift can carry you a long way. A recent survey by Populus found 55% agreed with the statement that David Cameron &quot;probably has a vision for the country \u2026 but I don&apos;t know what it is&quot;. That is a tribute to the PR skills of the man \u2013 and sums up the effect of this performance rather well.", "tags": ["David Cameron", "Conservative conference 2011", "Conservative conference", "Politics", "Conservatives", "UK news", "Economic policy"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-05T19:59:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/05/australia-strategic-relations-china", "sentences": ["Nobody who has visited Shanghai could be unimpressed."], "title": "Australia: a friend to two giants | Malcolm Turnbull", "article": "The rise of China is a massive realignment of economic and, in due course, political and strategic power at a speed and on a scale the world has not seen before. According to the International Monetary Fund&apos;s forecasts it will overtake the United States as the world&apos;s largest economy in 2016. Others argue it has already done so. There are a few nations with a sense of cultural continuity and exceptionalism that rival China&apos;s, but none rival its scale. China sees itself as a 3,000-year culture, for almost all modern history the world&apos;s largest and strongest country. Resource security (energy, minerals and food) is a growing preoccupation of Beijing. Its rush to acquire access to natural resources, including in Australia, is entirely understandable. And the financial crisis offers great opportunities for a cash-rich China to acquire as many premium resource assets as it can, so that it emerges with a global portfolio of sufficient scale and diversity to secure long-term, low-cost access to all the resources it needs. So China represents a challenge to the US that is utterly unique. Americans, have assumed that they will always be the strongest, richest and cleverest nation on earth. Tom Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum&apos;s book, That Used to Be Us, is eloquent testimony to a growing sense of inadequacy. This sense of being outclassed by China is not limited to Americans. Nobody who has visited Shanghai could be unimpressed. To many in the west, as worrying as the shift of manufacturing and economic output to Asia are the transfers of political, institutional and military influence that will surely follow. And international institutions are changing to reflect that \u2013 the G20 is one example. Shifts in economic weight and military potential are a legitimate cause for anxiety, as the world&apos;s grim 20th-century history reminds us. Previous threats to more than a century of American economic primacy were not credible: the USSR of the late 50s and the Japan of the late 80s, the two alleged challengers, had economies only 40% as large. So the stakes are high, and this time the challenger is real. And there is also strategic anxiety in the US over China, reflecting a concern that China has a very different understanding of the way in which world affairs should be ordered than the west. While ever alert, we should not be alarmed, says Henry Kissinger, who argues that China&apos;s well-developed and historic sense of its central place will make it a less outwardly assertive leading power than the US. China&apos;s growth has indeed not been matched by any expansionist tendencies beyond reuniting Taiwan. The central role of trade in China&apos;s prosperity also argues for its rise to remain peaceful. At 55% of its GDP in 2010, it has more to lose than most from any conflict that disrupts global economic flows. The best and most realistic strategic outcome for east Asia must be one in which the powers are in balance, with each side effectively able to deny the domination of the other. With its energy and resource security depending on long global sea lanes, it is hardly surprising that China would seek to enhance its naval capacity, so suggestions that China&apos;s recent launch of one aircraft carrier and plans to build another are signs of a new belligerence are wide of the mark. It makes no sense for the US or its allies to base long-term strategic policy on the proposition that they are on an inevitable collision course with a militarily aggressive China. I disagree with the underlying premise of a 2009 Australian white paper that we should base our defence planning on the contingency of a naval war with China in the South China Sea. Prejudice is not a substitute for coolly rational analysis. China needs to be more transparent about its goals in the region and build confidence with its neighbours so that misunderstandings can be avoided. We in Australia have to adopt a clear-eyed appraisal of the strategic balance in east Asia. America is our closest ally. However, as China rises to become the world&apos;s largest economy and in time a military rival to the US we are presented with a nation whose institutions and culture are very different to ours. Yet China is our largest trading partner and in large measure responsible for our current and prospective prosperity. We have every reason, and indeed every prospect, of remaining close and becoming closer friends of both these giants.", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Australia news", "US foreign policy", "US domestic policy", "US news", "Financial crisis", "Global recession", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-05T21:30:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/09/murray-japan-open-titles-andy-jamie", "sentences": ["Andy Murray enjoyed a remarkable Sunday in Tokyo, adding victory in the doubles to the Japan Open singles championship he picked up by defeating Rafael Nadal earlier in the day, the latter allowing him to maintain his end\u2011of\u2011season goal of moving up a place in the rankings to overtake Roger Federer at No3 if he successfully defends the Shanghai Masters title next week.", "For me it was impossible today because his return was very impressive.&quot; Murray&apos;s 20th career title significantly improves his chances of overhauling Federer but he may have to defeat Nadal again next week in Shanghai, where they are again seeded No1 and No2.", "&quot;I need to carry on that form in Shanghai."], "title": "Murray secures Japan Open singles and doubles titles", "article": "Andy Murray enjoyed a remarkable Sunday in Tokyo, adding victory in the doubles to the Japan Open singles championship he picked up by defeating Rafael Nadal earlier in the day, the latter allowing him to maintain his end\u2011of\u2011season goal of moving up a place in the rankings to overtake Roger Federer at No3 if he successfully defends the Shanghai Masters title next week. The Scot&apos;s recent run of impressive form had not extended to dominance over Spain&apos;s world No2, who had accounted for two of Murray&apos;s three defeats over the\u00a0past four months and had won their last five matches. The early signs suggested that Nadal would stretch his winning streak when Murray dropped his first service game after a groundstroke error, but despite the\u00a0British No1 continuing to serve tentatively throughout the set, the top seed failed to break him again before closing out the opener 6\u20133. The break after the first set and some tinkering with the strapping on an ankle seemed have a restorative effect on Murray&apos;s serve and he capitalised on his confident approach, sticking to a baseline attack and skillfully moving Nadal round the court. He broke the Spaniard&apos;s serve in the fourth game, converting his third break point when the No1 seed steered a\u00a0return wide, and wrapped up the second set 6-2 by fighting back from love\u201140 with three successive aces before breaking Nadal again. The third set, a whitewash won to love, was, said Murray, one of the best he had played against Nadal in their 18 meetings. It was particularly gratifying given that the Spaniard had been the man to knock Murray out of the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open at the semi-final stage. &quot;I played some great tennis, particularly in the third set,&quot; said Murray. &quot;There was a lot of close games towards the end of the first set and beginning of the second and I managed to get the momentum and didn&apos;t give him many chances after that. For sure, in the third set it was some of the best tennis I&apos;ve played against him. I was very consistent, didn&apos;t make too many mistakes and kept a cool head in the important moments.&quot; The victory was Murray&apos;s fourth World Tour title of 2011, matching Robin Soderling&apos;s total to tie for second place for the season behind Novak Djokovic, who leads the field with 10. Nadal, who was looking for a first trophy since winning a sixth French Open in June, said Murray&apos;s attitude and execution in the final two sets had made the match irretrievable. &quot;He played unbelievable,&quot; the Spaniard said. &quot;He didn&apos;t make any mistakes in the third set and played very aggressive. When you are playing someone at that level, the only way is to try and get more free points on serve.

I need to keep up the wins and hopefully I&apos;ll get to No3. It&apos;s not the ultimate goal but it&apos;s the target I set for the last few tournaments this year.&quot; Murray had little time to celebrate immediately after receiving the trophy, but he was not detained too long by the doubles final.

When his father lost the farm in a financial crash, Norman&apos;s final year was paid for by his housemaster, who then recommended him for employment to his cousin, Bernard Westall, managing director of what was then Thomas De La Rue. Two years later, in 1939, Westall picked Norman to run a clandestine operation in Shanghai, in part an international city but under Japanese control. The invading Japanese had still to consolidate their hold on China and Norman&apos;s task was to print and distribute banknotes for Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Nationalist Chinese government under their noses. He established a plant in the French Concession disguised as a playing-card factory and shop, with accommodation for Chinese workers so no one need leave. Watermarked paper was brought in under plain topsheets, and printing plates smuggled in overcoat pockets. The notes were shipped out by dustcart. When the Japanese finally opened a consignment of paper and demanded its destruction, Norman offered the company&apos;s own incinerator and managed to salvage half the paper delivering the finished banknotes in his own car, a large American Studebaker. On the German invasion of France, the factory was closed and equipment smuggled to Rangoon, Burma. Norman was instructed to return via Los Angeles to a job in Argentina. But after a few months he resigned to join the RAF, training as a pilot in the US. He was posted to 295 Squadron which towed gliders, first with old Whitley bombers and then with the newer Halifax. The squadron flew low-level flights taking agents and equipment into occupied France and Sicily, and supported the D-day landings. Norman won a DFC when his aircraft was attacked by a group of Junkers 88s over the Bay of Biscay. He shot one down and escaped with the help of cloud cover. While stationed in Dorset, he met and married Peggy Harrington, whom he had first encountered directing his aircraft as a coastal wireless operator. He ended the war as a wing commander, with a bar to his DFC won while based in India. Rejoining De La Rue, Norman was rapidly promoted, becoming a director in 1951 and managing director two years later. From 1964 to 1987 he was chairman. The company steadily expanded, becoming effectively a mini-conglomerate. In 1958 it entered a joint venture with American Cynamid, to produce Formica, manufacturing the plastic which became ubiquitous in kitchens and establishing a network of overseas factories. In 1959 it created Security Express to transport valuables. Banknote factories were set up abroad and transatlantic expansion included the appointment of the company as a security printer to the New York Stock Exchange and the purchase of a US payment card company. In 1960, De La Rue Instruments was formed to specialise in bank automation and was responsible for the world&apos;s first cash machine, at Barclays in Enfield high street, north London. In 1961 Norman took satisfaction in the acquisition of De La Rue&apos;s great rival, Waterlow &amp; Sons, and then lobbied successfully against an attempt by the Rank Organisation to take over his own company in 1968. The Monopolies Commission ruled that it would be against the public interest, but Norman was warmed by the decision taken by his management team to resign en masse if the takeover happened. In the aftermath, the company concentrated on its core activities. It sold its playing-card business to John Waddington, and the conglomerate was unwound. Formica was sold. But the subsequent purchase of the Crosfields Electronics banknote handling systems company was not a success and it was sold soon after Norman&apos;s retirement when the company was again refocused. A short, energetic man, Norman was closely involved with the customers of the banknote businesses, as more countries reached independence. A typical African visit would involve heads of state and finance ministers and, as his interest in conservation grew, ministers of environment and tourism. As a young man in South America, he had lectured government officials on the evils of Nazism and in older age he was publicly critical of projects in countries such as Thailand which he believed damaged the environment. When rebuked by the Foreign Office, he replied in kind. Norman was active in the Confederation of British Industry. As CBI president from 1968 until 1970, he backed entry into Europe but was involved unhappily in tripartite talks negotiating at times on his own with Harold Wilson and Jack Jones, as the Labour government struggled with trade-union legislation to combat a rush of unofficial strikes. Publicly he attacked government proposals for an industrial relations bill as &quot;abdication from responsibility for industrial relations&quot;. In private, he complained that the tripartite talks had been not about where they wanted to get, but simply about where they were. He was an enthusiastic gardener and countryman and his interest in conservation burgeoned when Sir Peter Scott invited him on to the board of the World Wildlife Fund UK. Norman succeeded Scott as a popular chairman of trustees from 1977 to 1984 and from 1987 until 1990. He worked with the director he appointed, George Medley, to transform it into a business-like operation and declared bluntly that &quot;environmentalism is not altruism&quot;. Directorships included Kleinwort Benson and SKF and in later years he indulged an interest in horses which had begun on his family farm, with the ownership of racehorses. Peggy died in 1982.

It has a scent and it is imperfect. If you get too close to the moving image, it&apos;s like impressionist art. And if you stand back, it can be utterly photorealistic. You can watch the grain, which I like to think of as the visible, erratic molecules of a new creative language. After all, this &quot;stuff&quot; of dreams is mankind&apos;s most original medium, and dates back to 1895. Today, its years are numbered, but I will remain loyal to this analogue artform until the last lab closes. Keanu Reeves Actor The biggest difference I have found when working photochemically versus digitally on motion pictures is the length of time the takes can last. Broadly, a 1,000ft roll of 35mm film lasts around nine-and-a-half minutes before running out, while a digital tape or recording card or hard drive can last from 40 minutes to over an hour and a half. This translates to a very different rhythm on the floor; the pressure to &quot;cut&quot; to save film is alleviated. Archiving digital images is a technological dilemma. The idea of that discovered shoebox of pictures, or wedding album, will not exist digitally in your camera or on your computer or in a &quot;cloud&quot;: you should print them. I often feel a photochemical image contains the mass of the subject and dimension; a digital image often feels as if it is mass-less. This could be nostalgia or simply how I learned to see. Others will not have this learning: they will probably never experience a photochemical image. Is this loss a tragedy, a revolution, an evolution? What have we lost, and what have we gained? I will miss walking on to a photochemical film set. It has a magic to me. When the director says: &quot;Action&quot;, and the film is rolling, it feels like something is at stake. It feels important and intense. In a way, death is present in the rolling of that film \u2013 we live, right now \u2013 and the director says: &quot;Cut&quot;. And that moment in time is captured on film, really. Dick Pope Cinematographer  Film? 1974, 27 years old, first break as a cameraman, major TV documentary, stone age tribe, expedition, only three of us, director, camera, sound, no assistants, incredibly remote, hauling 500kg of gear across world, air, road, sea, river, hike deep into rainforest, scorching heat, intense humidity. Sixteen-millimetre, 200x400ft rolls, stored in coolest place, every foot used, no waste, Eclair camera, three magazines. Arms in black changing bag, open can, lift out, peel off tape, load mag, close lid, pull out arm, unzip bag, finish lacing, snap mag on camera, lift on to shoulder, turn over, shoot! Is it there, did we get it? Will it be any good? No way of knowing, just wait, see and shoot. Three months of tribal ways, incredible life-changing experience, finish, farewells, canoes back down river, return home, 80,000ft to lab, develop and print, wait, terrible uncertainty, what if? At last: rushes, into cutting room, everybody there, stomach in mouth, print loaded on Steenbeck, blacked-out room, run it, and bang, there they are, those faraway people and places, it has come out, it is there, it&apos;s wonderful, everybody happy, waves of relief, complete and utter magic, it&apos;s film. Outside in the street private tears of relief and joy, that&apos;s it, I&apos;m away, I&apos;m a cameraman. Later in the darkroom&apos;s red glow, printing my stills, black-and-white portraits of the tribe conjure up and materialise in the tray, this wondrous photochemical reaction of liquid solution, emulsion, celluloid, silver grains, gelatin and again the very same magic. It&apos;s film. From documentaries to movies, from a crew of three to what feels like 300, and until very recently only on film and mostly 35mm. Sometimes, when I want to work with a lighter, smaller, lower profile or seek that grittier, uniquely textured image, I choose 16mm. When I photographed Mike Leigh&apos;s 2004 film Vera Drake, nobody ever flagged up or gave a damn that it had originated on the cheaper, smaller &quot;shoestring&quot; 16mm format, because it created exactly the right cinematic look for the film. In the end all that matters is the world created up there on the screen. This was reinforced to me with the success of The Hurt Locker in 2008 and Black Swan in 2010, both shot on 16mm, both winning countless awards, including cinematography. 16mm is very much alive and well, and it&apos;s crucial it remains so, yet its future is seriously under threat. Before too long, I fear it will be film itself that&apos;s cast out, and in the stampede towards the blinding, flashing light of the digital age, the fabulous physical and spiritual magic of it will be trampled underfoot for ever. Dick Pope is Mike Leigh&apos;s longtime director of photography. He was nominated for an Oscar for his work on Neil Burger&apos;s The Illusionist in 2007. Mitch Epstein Photographer &quot;What do you mean, &apos;By the hand?&apos;&quot; a friend asked when I told her that recently I had been making black-and-white optical prints, for which the hand was crucial. The printer&apos;s hands, I explained, not technological wizardry, manipulate light and shadow; and the hand has human limits. Each print varies slightly. The limits and idiosyncrasies of optical printing were a welcome change from the maddeningly infinite possibilities and perfectionism of digital printing. My first pictures were made with Kodachrome slide film in the early 1970s, and were fully resolved as projected images on a white wall in a darkened room. They remain my most direct experience of photography. I later turned to colour negative film, for its greater tonal latitude and the ability to make prints directly from the negative. While I continue to shoot negative film to this day, for nearly a decade I have been scanning my negatives and modulating them in Photoshop before outputting them on traditional chromogenic colour paper. It&apos;s a hybrid process. My greatest fear is that as a discarded medium and corporate outcast, analogue will no longer be essential to visual education. Many young people will not know the difference between hand and button, they will only know the button; and their use of technology will be constricted by their ignorance of hand work. They will not perceive the qualities of optical photography because their eyes will only know digital imagery. When I last visited Berlin, I got lost on the way to a friend&apos;s house. While staring at my iPhone map I heard a voice call: &quot;Mitch, Mitch!&quot; and looked up to find him waving at me from his car as he waited for the light to change. I climbed into the car. A GPS receiver has more than once helped me out of a jam, but it is hard to describe how lovely it felt to pull my eyes off my screen and let a friend guide me. Mitch Epstein won this year&apos;s Prix Pictet photography award for his series American Power. Jean-Luc Godard Director The so-called &quot;digital&quot; is not a mere technical medium, but a medium of thought. And when modern democracies turn technical thought into a separate domain, those modern democracies incline towards totalitarianism. Heather Stewart Programme director, BFI In black-and-white film, if we look at the texture and detail achievable in the velvety blacks, we can see how meaning and emotional effect are intertwined: the frightening magic of the moonlit river journey in The Night of the Hunter (1955); the ambiguity and hysteria of The Innocents (1961), underlined by Freddie Francis&apos; brilliant cinematography; the glistening streets of Vienna in The Third Man (1949) \u2013 Harry Lime may have caused children to die, but how can we resist Orson Welles when he steps out from the shadows? Film, when used like this, achieves the &quot;aesthetic bliss&quot; sought by Vladimir Nabokov in fiction; a tingling contentedness, something to inspire others. Film is an organic material: different stocks or colour processes, each with their own special characteristics, can be transformed into a work of art. Film is imperfect, not evenly sensitive, with a curve that responds beautifully to light. Film has density and weight, something missing from digital images. The ontological being of film itself \u2013 the sprockets, the afterimage created in our mind&apos;s eye, the celluloid \u2013 can all be the subject matter of film-making. The soft-edged wipes of Le Crime de Monsieur Lange (1936), the motion blur of the spinning newspaper in His Girl Friday (1940), the bleached-out tableaux of Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988), the gaudy lack of realism engendered by Technicolor in any of the great musicals: our eyes and brains appreciate these pleasures particular to film. Shooting digitally, David Fincher and Jeff Cronenweth in The Social Network (2010) created a claustrophobic world of low-lit interiors and shallow depth of focus, expressive of characters at ease with computers, not people. In Alexander Sokurov&apos;s masterpiece, Russian Ark (2002), digital allowed him the artistic freedom to shoot his feature in a single shot. In Collateral (2004), Michael Mann and Dion Beebe created a digital world: modern, urban, blue-lit, nightmarish. Compelling works of art can be digital. But the qualities are not those of film. Digital can be fatiguing to watch (sometimes nauseating), as dead as mutton when not in the hands of a skilled director of photography. Technological change brings gains and losses. I look forward to those who can transform digits into works of art, and to those who still use film in all its richness. Martin Scorsese Director Those incredible recreations of [Manhattan street] Mulberry Bend in [DW Griffith&apos;s] The Musketeers of Pig Alley, and of turn-of-the-century San Francisco in [Erich von Stroheim&apos;s] Greed, as delicately textured and rendered as the first photographs. The glistening close-up that introduces Anna May Wong in Shanghai Express: the richest and most brilliant blacks and whites, greys and silvers \u2013 even the air feels alive.

The cinema began with a passionate, physical relationship between celluloid and the artists and craftsmen and technicians who handled it, manipulated it, and came to know it the way a lover comes to know every inch of the body of the beloved. No matter where the cinema goes, we cannot afford to lose sight of its beginnings.

A study by the Department for Education suggests an English pupil who achieved eight Cs at GCSE would have to score 3As and 5Bs to match the attainment of their peers in Shanghai. The analysis indicates that English pupils are also at least a year behind the reading standard of their counterparts in South Korea and Finland. Fifteen-year-olds in England are also at least six months behind those in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and New Zealand. Commenting on the findings, the schools minister, Nick Gibb, said: &quot;The gulf between our 15-year-olds&apos; reading abilities and those from other countries is stark \u2013 a gap that starts to open in the very first few years of a child&apos;s education. The government&apos;s focus on raising standards of reading in the early years of primary school is key to closing that gap.&quot; From next summer, six-year-olds in England will be given a new reading test, checking their ability to read using phonics, a technique based on sounding out letters and groups of letters. There will also be a new spelling and punctuation test for 11-year-olds, to be introduced in 2013. From next September, pupils taking English language GCSEs will lose marks for poor grammar and spelling. An endowment fund set up by the government will on Wednesday announce a \u00a350,000 grant to run five summer camps for about 1,000 pupils from disadvantaged homes. The camps will offer classes in literacy and maths as well as music and sport. The government&apos;s findings are drawn from an analysis of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development&apos;s research. The OECD&apos;s Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) involved numeracy, literacy and science tests of about 470,000 15-year-olds around the world in 2009. The latest Pisa study found that the UK performed around the average among OECD countries for reading and maths, and above average for science. The highest performing region across all the tests was Shanghai, with a mean score of 556. The second highest scoring was Korea with 539, and Finland was third, with 536. The OECD, a thinktank, says the Chinese education system is focused on passing exams. Students work long days and at weekends to carry out additional exam preparation, while private tutorials are considered a household necessity. The OECD says: &quot;There is a general belief that [the] emphasis on examinations jeopardises the genuine development of young people and is detrimental ... but few effective solutions have emerged to reduce or minimise examination pressures.&quot; In contrast, children in Finland receive fewer hours of instruction than students in any other OECD country. The Finnish system is based on recruiting talented graduates as teachers and then giving them freedom to decide how they will teach. There is also a political consensus governing education: Finland has an entirely comprehensive system with no private schools and no selection below the age of 16. Finnish classrooms take a child-centred approach. The OECD says: &quot;Students [in Finland] are expected to take an active role in designing their own learning activities. &quot;Students are expected to work collaboratively in teams on projects, and there is a substantial focus on projects that cut across traditional subject or disciplinary lines. By the time students enrol in upper secondary school, they are expected to be able to take sufficient charge of their own learning to be able to design their own individual programme. &quot;Upper secondary schools are now mostly based on individual study plans.&quot;", "tags": ["Education", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-11T23:54:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/oct/12/top-10-edinburgh-boutique-hotels", "sentences": ["The nightclub in the basement is called Shanghai \u2026 you get the drift."], "title": "10 of the best boutique hotels in Edinburgh", "article": "The Witchery  James Thomson is Scottish restaurateur-hotelier royalty.

The interiors, however, are in sharp contrast to the historic facade. Black is the predominant colour. The carpet is black and white striped, the original shutters are painted black, chairs in the restaurant and bar are black velvet. There are 28 rooms and suites with Philippe Starck bathrooms and decorated out with imported antique Chinese furniture \u2013 in black.

Born in a Glasgow tenement, Bill cut his professional teeth in various architectural practices, in the Scottish new towns of Cumbernauld and East Kilbride, ending his public sector service as chief architect and planning officer of the Basingstoke Development Group. Then one morning he rang the bell at the London offices of Colin Buchanan and Partners and asked for a job.

What made him so special were his qualities of integrity, wisdom lightly worn, a\u00a0Glasgow gallows humour and a\u00a0singular ability to marshal the many elements of a complex urban study into a coherent and inspiring project, presented without fear or favour.

Last Thursday a two-year-old girl was run over twice, about 100 metres from her home in a hardware market district of Foshan, a prosperous city in southern China. As she lay on the ground, writhing in pain, before being hit by the second vehicle, 18 people, on their bicycles, in cars or on foot, passed by but chose to ignore her. Among them a young woman with her own child. Finally, a 58-year-old female rubbish collector came to the girl&apos;s rescue, but it was too late. By the time she was brought to the hospital, the girl Yueyue, (whose name translates as Little Joy), was brain dead. She was declared dead early on Friday morning. She was a good girl, full of life, her mother said a few days ago in an interview. She said she had just brought Yueyue back from her kindergarten. She popped out to collect the dry clothes and returned to find Yueyue gone \u2013 probably trying to look for her elder brother. It might have been a different story if one of the 18 people had lent Yueyue a hand. None even bothered to call for emergency services. Later, when interviewed by a journalist, one of the passersby, a middle-aged man riding a scooter, said with an uncomfortable smile on his face: &quot;That wasn&apos;t my child. Why should I bother?&quot; Before giving himself up to the police, the driver of the second vehicle, a van, told the media why he had run away. &quot;If she is dead, I may pay only about 20,000 yuan (\u00a32,000). But if she is injured, it may cost me hundreds of thousands of yuan.&quot; What&apos;s wrong with these people? How could they be so cold-hearted? The horrific scene was caught by a surveillance camera and has been watched by millions of viewers since it was posted on Youku, China&apos;s equivalent of YouTube. This is only the latest incident where tragedy has struck as a result of the callous inactivity of onlookers. Last month an 88-year-old man fell over face down at the entrance of a vegetable market near his home. For almost 90 minutes, he was ignored by people in the busy market. After his daughter found him and called an ambulance, the old man died &quot;because of a respiratory tract clogged by a nosebleed&quot;. If anyone had turned him over, he might have survived. Both cases, the death of Yueyue in particular, have provoked much public outrage and a nationwide discussion about morality in today&apos;s China. From Shanghai, someone with the cybername 60sunsetred wrote: &quot;The Chinese people have arrived at their most morality-free moment!&quot; There was plenty of condemnation of the cold-heartedness of the passersby. But, astonishingly, a large percentage of posters said they understood why the onlookers did not lend a helping hand. Some admitted they would do the same \u2013 for fear of getting into trouble and fear of facing another &quot;Nanjing judge&quot;. Let me explain the story of the muddle-headed Nanjing judge. In 2006, in the capital of Jiangsu province, a young man named Peng Yu helped an old woman who had fallen on the street and took her to a hospital and waited to see if the old woman was all right. Later, however, the woman and her family accused Peng of causing her fall. A judge decided in favour of the woman, based on the assumption that &quot;Peng must be at fault. Otherwise why would he want to help?&quot;, saying that Peng acted against &quot;common sense&quot;. The outcry from the public in support of Peng forced the court to adjust its verdict and resulted in Peng paying 10% of the costs instead of the total. Since that incident Peng has become a national cautionary tale: the Good Samaritan being framed by the beneficiary of their compassion. It&apos;s true that in China you can get into trouble when you try to help. Weeks ago I spotted an accident on the fourth ring road in Beijing as I returned home one night. A man was hit by a &quot;black car&quot;, an &quot;illegal taxi&quot;, and his face was all bloody. Watched over by a crowd, the injured man behaved aggressively towards the driver. I got off my scooter. As I tried to pull the two men apart, I was struck myself. When I asked if anyone had reported this to the police, the driver said no. I couldn&apos;t believe that people just stared as if enjoying a free show, without doing anything. I called the helpline and the policemen turned up soon after. The fundamental problem, in my view, lies in one word that describes a state of mind: shaoguanxianshi, meaning don&apos;t get involved if it&apos;s not your business. In our culture, there&apos;s a lack of willingness to show compassion to strangers. We are brought up to show kindness to people in our network of guanxi, family and friends and business associates, but not particularly to strangers, especially if such kindness may potentially damage your interest. Fei Xiaotong, China&apos;s first sociologist, described Chinese people&apos;s moral and ethical characteristics in his book, From the Soil, in the middle of the last century. He pointed out that selfishness is the most serious shortcoming of the Chinese. &quot;When we think of selfishness, we think of the proverb &apos;Each person should sweep the snow from his own doorsteps and should not fret about the frost on his neighbour&apos;s roof,&apos;&quot; wrote Fei. He offered the example of how the Chinese of that period threw rubbish out of their windows without the slightest public concern. Things are much the same today. Under Mao, citizens were forced to behave themselves in both public and private spheres. Every March, people were obliged to go into the street to do good deeds: cleaning buses, fixing bicycles and offering haircuts. Now relaxed social control and commercialisation over the past three decades have led people to behave more selfishly again. People are enjoying, and sometimes abusing, the vast personal freedoms that didn&apos;t exist before. To start with, it is now safe to be &quot;naughty&quot;. Back in the early 1980s, when I worked at a rocket factory in Nanjing, one of my colleagues, a married man, was caught having an affair with an unmarried woman. He was given a three-year sentence in a labour camp and the girl was disgraced. In today&apos;s society, having extramarital affairs or keeping an ernai \u2013 second wife or concubine \u2013 is as common as &quot;cow hair&quot;, as the Chinese would say. For a novel I am writing on prostitution, I have interviewed many prostitutes and ernai. Many see their profession as a way to gather wealth quickly, feeling few moral qualms. China&apos;s moral crisis doesn&apos;t just manifest itself in personal life but also in business practice and many other areas. The high-profile &quot;poisoned milk powder&quot; case and the scandal of using &quot;gutter oil&quot; as cooking oil have shocked and disgusted people around the world. Last year an article, &quot;Why have Chinese lost their sense of morality?&quot;, in which the author tried to find an explanation, was widely read. He reasoned that China has introduced the concept of a market economy from the west but failed to import the corresponding ethics, while the traditional moral principles of China no longer fit the market economy model. There&apos;s a lot of sense in that. I believe that the lack of a value system is also deepening the moral crisis. Before Mao, the indifference towards others once so accurately described by Fei existed but was mitigated by a traditional moral and religious system. That system was then almost destroyed by the communists, especially during the 10 mad years of the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976. Nowadays communism, the ideology that dominated Chinese people&apos;s lives like a religion, has also more or less collapsed. As a result, there&apos;s a spiritual vacuum that cannot be filled by the mere opportunity of money-making. To drag China out of its moral crisis will be a long battle. The pressing question is how to make people act in cases of emergency and the solution is law. After the &quot;Nanjing case&quot;, there have been discussions about introducing a law that imposes a &quot;duty of rescue&quot; as exists in many European countries. I am all for it, because that&apos;s probably the only way to propel action for a people who do not see a moral obligation in rescuing others. The Yueyue incident revealed an ugly side of China. I hope the entire nation will take the opportunity to take a hard look at ourselves and ask ourselves what&apos;s wrong with society. There&apos;s at least hope in the action of the rubbish collector who rushed to Yueyue&apos;s side without hesitation. China&apos;s economy is galloping like a horse without a rein and its position in the world is rising. We Chinese have every reason to feel proud about what we&apos;ve achieved. Now we demand respect. But how can we possibly win respect and play the role of a world leader if this is a nation with 1.4 billion cold hearts?", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Ethics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-22T21:07:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/25/china-one-child-policy-benefits-rules", "sentences": ["The rich in Shanghai and Beijing can easily afford the penalties for a second or third child.", "As China becomes richer and better educated, women in rich cities like Shanghai and Beijing are opting for few children just like their counterparts in wealthy nations."], "title": "China's one-child policy means many benefits for parents \u2013 if they follow the rules", "article": "Li Tianhao has just given birth to a baby boy blessed with his mother&apos;s nose, his father&apos;s mouth and an impressive ability to sleep through even the loudest disturbance.

Yet he will probably grow up alone. Although Henan last year became the first province in China to register its 100 millionth resident \u2013 giving it a population bigger than any country in Europe \u2013 it also claims some of the greatest successes in taming demographic growth through its family planning policies. This has not happened by accident. Henan is one of the most environmentally stressed areas of China with a quarter of the water and a fifth of the land per capita compared to the already low national average. Senior family planners say this justifies rigid restrictions. &quot;The large number of people has put very big pressure on all resources, especially water,&quot; said Liu Shaojie vice director of the Population Commission in Henan. &quot;Over 30 years of effort, we have put in place a systematic procedure for controlling the population. That has eased the impact on the environment. We are doing glorious work.&quot; Many environmentalists agree that population control is essential if humanity is to move on to a more sustainable track, but how can this be done? China has gone further than any nation in trying to answer this question over the past 30 years. But both the means and the ends remain the subject of fierce controversy. When the one-child policy started in the 1970s, Liu says, women in Henan gave birth to an average of 5.8 children in their lifetimes. Their counterparts today have less than 1.7. The change, he said, means 30 million fewer births \u2013 equivalent to preventing one every 30 seconds for three decades. And that is just in Henan. Across all of China, the government claims there would be more than 300 million more children without the family planning policy. This policy was initiated primarily for economic and education reasons, but it is increasingly cited as an environmental blessing. According to Liu, the population controls have kept sulphur dioxide emissions down by 17.6% and the main source of water pollution by 30.8%. Without it, he says, the average person in Henan would have a third less land and a quarter less forest. It has also, he claims, prevented between 137m and 200m tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Such extrapolations are questionable. The current measures were not put in place to save the global environment, but to redress one of the biggest errors made by Mao Zedong. The founder of the People&apos;s Republic was advised in the 1950s that China&apos;s population was growing dangerously fast, but he urged women to have more babies because, as he put it, they were like aircraft carriers launching fighter planes. Today, Chinese officials and scholars privately describe this as Mao&apos;s greatest mistake. If he had put in place a two-child policy in the fifties, today&apos;s one-child policy would not be necessary. The description of the system as a &quot;one-child policy&quot; is misleading. Most married women in China have the chance to bear two offspring, but the entitlement to breed beyond a solitary child is determined by a complex set of rules that vary from province to province and are often applied differently from village to village. Broadly speaking, urban couples are allowed one child, rural families can try for a second if the first is a girl and women from ethnic minorities are permitted to give birth two or three times in their lifetime. But there are close to a dozen exceptions, including if a baby has disabilities or if the mother and father are both single children. Communist cadres and government officials can be fired for procreational transgressions because they are supposed to set an example. By contrast, Tibetans have the fewest restrictions. Money is another key factor. The rich in Shanghai and Beijing can easily afford the penalties for a second or third child. The poor in Gansu and Yunnan, by contrast are at risk of having their meagre property confiscated if they fail to remain within birthing quotas. For family planners like Liu, these injustices and disturbances are seen not as failures, but as aberrations that call for policy tweaks. Countless adjustments over the past 30 years have created a mind-bogglingly complex system that touches on everything from contraception and sterilisation to pensions and tax incentives. In Henan alone, Liu says the family planning policy employs 17,000 administrators and 22,000 nursing and technical staff. In addition, support organisations claim a combined membership of 9,600,000 volunteers, who engage in work as diverse as spreading propaganda to monitoring menstruation cycles- something that is still common in villages though rare in cities. The state has gone to remarkable lengths to try to fill the gaps left by the missing children. Rule-abiding parents can get a monthly stipend, extra pension benefits when they are older, preferential hospital treatment, first choice for government jobs, extra land allowances and, in some case, free homes and a tonne of free water a month. Their children are even given bonus points in middle school entrance exams. The system is incredibly expensive. The provincial government sets aside 40 yuan per person for the policy, which adds up to 4bn yuan (\u00a3400m) or about four percent of its budget, but this is just a small fraction of the total amount paid by central and village authorities. Enforcement requires a huge and powerful bureaucracy. &quot;Henan has much to teach the world in family planning, but it is a hard lesson to learn. Officials from Africa and India come to study what we are doing in China, but I&apos;m not sure that they can apply it the same way,&quot; said Liu. &quot;That&apos;s because they don&apos;t have a Communist party so it is difficult for them to take such strong steps.&quot; In theory, the only penalties are hefty fines - in Henan&apos;s case, three times the annual net income of the couple who have violated the rules. But the system still relies on a high degree of intrusiveness and communal pressure to achieve targets. Others argue that the impact of family planning is overblown and simply accelerated what would have happened anyway as a result of improvements in infant mortality, greater participation by women in the workforce and greater availability of contraception. As China becomes richer and better educated, women in rich cities like Shanghai and Beijing are opting for few children just like their counterparts in wealthy nations. And with the nation&apos;s population is forecast to peak around 2030 many say the family planning policy had outlived its usefulness. &quot;Everybody agrees change is necessary. But the debate is about how to start and when&quot;, said Zheng Zhenzhen, a population specialist at the Chinese Academy of Social Science. &quot;We debate the relationship between the size of the population and resource consumption. But it is not a fixed formula. It depends on how you utilise your resource. We waste and pollute. I think those problems \u2013 behaviour \u2013 are more important than the size of the population.&quot; In Henan, however, the message that you can consume more if you breed less appears to be more persuasive than threats and penalties. At the Hui hospital, the new father Li Yongli says he would rather have a first car than a second child. The shift towards fewer legs and more wheels in his family is part of a carefully worked out plan. The final goal is to ensure a better life and education for his son, who was of course, born exactly to schedule. &quot;It&apos;s all part of the program,&quot; said the beaming father. \u2022 Additional reporting by Cecily Huang", "tags": ["Land rights", "China", "Population", "Travel and transport", "Global development", "Environment", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-25T11:36:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/25/china-family-planning-policy-heavy-handed", "sentences": ["Liang Zhongtang, of the Shanghai Academy of Social Science, was one of its earliest and most influential advocates, but he now thinks it is ineffectual and wrong."], "title": "China's family planning policy enforced with heavy-handed tactics", "article": "Family planning in Xiaotun village is deemed a success. Its population of 1,871 people increased by only 10 last year, or less than 0.5%. The progress towards stabilisation is marked in red pen on a white board at the Xiaotun village family planning centre. It notes that 401 of the 1,871 residents are married women of child-bearing age. Of them, 156 have one child and 228 have two or more. A further column shows the measures that have been taken to prevent further births. A total of 228 are in this category. Only four are using contraception. The other 224 have been sterilised, a remarkably high proportion. Hu Ruiling, director in charge of women, acknowledged a considerable degree of intrusiveness. &quot;We check every women in the village each month,&quot; she says. &quot;If we find someone is pregnant with a second child, we suggest abortion.&quot; But reports from other provinces reveal the sinister methods used by officials to reach their family planning targets. This month, a woman in Lijin, Shandong, died during a forced abortion on her seven-month foetus. It would have been Ma Jihong&apos;s third child. Relatives told the Guardian that 10 men turned up at Ma&apos;s home, forced her to go to the hospital and pressed her fingerprint to an authorisation form for the abortion. The operation went horribly wrong, but the relatives were not told for hours that she had died. &quot;Her eyes were black and her nose was bloodied,&quot; said the relative. &quot;We know we lost the mother. We have no idea what happened to the child.&quot; Li Heping, a lawyer who has represented victims of similar cases, said this is certainly not the first death. &quot;It&apos;s wrong to use violence to enforce the policy. It goes against human nature and tradition. But it happens everywhere in China.&quot; Instead of punishing murderously zealous local officials, the authorities have tried to silence the lawyers, activists and individuals who try to complain. In one of the most egregious of modern China&apos;s injustices, the blind civil rights activist and lawyer Chen Guangcheng was imprisoned for three years after he tried to alert the health ministry to the abductions and forced abortions carried out by family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong province. He has been released but remains under extra-legal house detention. Lawyers and journalists who try to visit have been beaten up by thugs employed by the government. The heavy-handed tactics and coercion by officials have turned one-time champions against the policy. Liang Zhongtang, of the Shanghai Academy of Social Science, was one of its earliest and most influential advocates, but he now thinks it is ineffectual and wrong. Many rural people have ignored the rules. And Thailand, by contrast, has achieved a sharper drop in its fertility rate over the same period without such tough measures. More important, though, are his ethical concerns. &quot;I realised that what we did was not right. It infringes people&apos;s rights. Births are a matter than should be decided by individuals and families, not the government. We should halt the policy immediately.&quot; \u2022 Additional reporting by Cecily Huang", "tags": ["Abortion", "China", "Population", "Family", "Environment", "World news", "Contraception and family planning"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-25T11:51:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/26/china-social-media-censorship", "sentences": ["The document said three people, including a website editor, had been punished for spreading rumours, with one Shanghai resident held by local police for 15 days."], "title": "China to step up social media censorship", "article": "China has vowed to intensify controls on social media and instant messaging tools, in the highest-level official response to the extraordinary surge in microblogging in the country. The communique from the Communist party central committee follows growing boldness among users, who have discussed sensitive topics, highlighted scandals and attacked official abuses or inefficiency. This summer&apos;s high-speed rail crash in Wenzhou led to an outpouring of fury on microblogs about the handling of the disaster. That spilled over into mainstream media. China already has the most extensive and sophisticated internet control system in the world. But censors have struggled to keep up with the flow of information on popular microblogs. The number of registered users on domestic services reached 195 million by the end of June, triple the figure of six months earlier, according to the China Internet Network Information Centre. &quot;This [communique] is what we have been waiting for; there have been signs for weeks now,&quot; said David Bandurski, of Hong Kong University&apos;s China Media Project. &quot;It is important, but it does not tell us exactly what&apos;s going to happen. It sends the signal: &apos;Everyone watch out&apos;. &quot;Usually [these kind of directives] are followed by some more concrete actions, but it&apos;s often very difficult to draw a line between a government policy flare like this and a particular action because control is a constant in China.&quot; Communiques are a way for senior leaders to stress their priorities. &quot;Strengthen guidance and administration of social internet services and instant communications tools, and regulate the orderly dissemination of information,&quot; said the document, carried in the official People&apos;s Daily newspaper and by the state news agency Xinhua. &quot;Apply the law to sternly punish the dissemination of harmful information.&quot; Microbloggers reacted with predictable disdain. One, using the name Luse Zhuren, wrote: &quot;Good culture will all disappear if opinion keeps being guided.&quot; Another, Wu Sanfan, warned: &quot;I faintly feel that weibo (microblogging services), this big tea house where ordinary people speak with freedom, will hang a wooden board up saying &apos;No talk about the country&apos;s politics&apos;.&quot; Content is already blocked or deleted from services. But censors have found it hard to match the speed at which news can spread on microblogs or the way that users evade controls, such as by using euphemisms or homophones to refer to sensitive issues. Analysts believe that officials will not shut down social media sites because they are simply too popular, and closing them would create a backlash. Chinese authorities have sought to use social media proactively, launching their own accounts. Instead, they are likely to step up pressure on the operators, who have large in-house teams of staff to monitor, block and remove sensitive content. &quot;The more important risk we see for Sina Weibo and other [microblogs] is that they self-regulate out of business [interests] \u2026 and that they self-neuter and that makes the platform so boring no one wants to use it,&quot; said Michael Clendenin, managing director of RedTech Advisors, a research company. Separately, Xinhua reported on Tuesday that authorities were stepping up efforts to prevent the spread of rumours online and punish those who share them. It cited a statement from the State Internet Information Office. The document said three people, including a website editor, had been punished for spreading rumours, with one Shanghai resident held by local police for 15 days.

Kevin Courtney, the NUT&apos;s deputy general secretary, says today&apos;s lobby will give the government an opportunity to &quot;see sense&quot;:  &quot;I see some real fear in the eyes of officials when we have our meetings about pensions. They know that the unions are voicing the views of teachers.  Teachers don&apos;t believe that they can take a full class of 30 14-year-olds or seven-year-olds at the age of 68. They are really angry.

More education news from the Guardian \u2022 A Guardian editorial today comments on the effect of government budget cuts on student numbers and school resources, and points out that the days of &quot;education, education, education,&quot; seem a very long time ago:  &quot;David Cameron never promised to exempt education from the pain, as he did with health, and so there will of course be a squeeze. It will not, however, be equally shared but concentrated on the first and final stages.  Forget all the research evidence and the political cant about the &quot;crucial early years&quot;: infants&apos; services are in for a hammering. Forget, too, the planned increase in the participation age from 16 to 18, since it seems to have slipped the minds of ministers when they imposed deep cuts on this group. If all youths really are to be kept learning for longer, it will have to be learning on the cheap.&quot;  \u2022 Alastair Stewart, on the other hand, is chuffed to bits with the 12% drop in university applications reported by Ucas this week. Instead of seeing university as an automatic next step after school, young people &quot;are now embarking upon a more astute examination of their objectives - you don&apos;t just sign up to nearly \u00a330,000 of debt on a whim&quot;. He tells us what his own children have decided to do with their lives:  &quot;For my eldest son, who studied English at Oxford, reflection came late and he is now a content police officer. My daughter turned down a place to read music at Bristol and switched to education and English at Winchester University. She is now a content teacher.

Barton writes:  &quot;It&apos;s important to know that our partner school is an &apos;experimental school&apos;. This means it is one of a small number of schools in Shanghai deliberately designed for innovation. One of the most striking - and flattering - features for me, four years on from the initial visit, was to see how ideas from our school in Suffolk have been embedded at the school in Shanghai.  Some of these are relatively cosmetic - the school environment has been transformed from a brutalist, concrete mix of classrooms and corridors to a place containing plants and with walls covered with the kind of images of student achievement that we have at the heart of our ethos. Their dining room has been completely refurbished to create a better version of ours - music playing, TV screens showing motivational videos, a stage for live performance.  More significant is the way the school has embraced the leadership culture that is central to our values. Shanghai students now participate in extra-curricular clubs and activities and are developing the kinds of skills in leading their peers and younger students that we take for granted.&quot;  \u2022 Growing numbers of university students are staying on after their bachelors&apos; degrees to complete postgraduate masters and doctorate courses, according to an LSE study quoted in the Telegraph.

Why should anyone care that Andrew &quot;Chubby&quot; Chandler of International Sports Management has been dumped for Conor Ridge of the Dublin-based company Horizon Sports? The two men at the centre of golf&apos;s most talked about tug-of-war may have different profiles, personalities and business methods, but even they would agree that McIlroy will make a ton of money whoever is running his business affairs. The reason for that is McIlroy himself. In this post-Tiger Woods era, the search continues for the next dominant golfer. But there is no need to look any further for golf&apos;s next marketing star. The 22-year-old from Holywood, Northern Ireland has it all \u2013 youth, charisma, a famous girlfriend (the world&apos;s No1 tennis player, Caroline Wozniacki) and an international fan base. He also has that elusive first major, the US Open he won at Congressional in the summer. The manner of McIlroy&apos;s eight-shot victory had many installing him as the &quot;new&quot; Woods and some overly excited souls, Padraig Harrington being the most prominent, suggesting the Northern Irishman and not the American would one day surpass Jack Nicklaus&apos;s record of 18 majors. To his credit, McIlroy seemed almost embarrassed at the hyperbole. &quot;Oh, Paddy,&apos;&apos; he sighed when confronted with Harrington&apos;s prediction. Six months on, such modesty looks well-founded. It seems a curious thing to say about a golfer who has racked up four top-10 finishes in his past five appearances and who heads the leaderboard at the $2m Shanghai Masters. When many of the best players in the world assemble in China this week for the HSBC Championship, the final world golf championship of the year, he will be among the favourites. He is that good a player. But since that glorious week in Washington DC, the least newsworthy thing about McIlroy has been the quality of his golf. He has made headlines, but for many different reasons, not all of them good. After arriving at Royal St George&apos;s as the favourite to win the Open, he departed the Kent coast on the closing day as a figure of ridicule, complaining about the weather of all things. A couple of weeks later, he made a fool of himself at the Irish Open, becoming embroiled in a Twitter fight with the American commentator Jay Townsend, who had the temerity to criticise McIlroy&apos;s caddie, JP Fitzgerald. &quot;You&apos;re a commentator and a failed golfer, your opinion means nothing,&apos;&apos; he tweeted. As he had at Royal St George&apos;s, McIlroy arrived at the PGA Championship in Atlanta as favourite. Again he came up well short, this time after injuring his wrist on the opening day while playing a shot with his ball nestled in a tree root \u2013 a decision that led to some tetchy exchanges with the media. &quot;He&apos;s my caddie, not my father,&apos;&apos; he snapped at one reporter who wondered if Fitzgerald might have talked him out of playing the shot. A good question and a great comeback. McIlroy is one of more quotable characters on the circuit and the last thing he needs to do is button his lip. God knows, professional golf needs as much colour and spice as it can get. However, there is a fine line between being a good quote and being perceived by the wider golfing public as an arrogant young pup. Over the past four or five months, his public persona has veered dangerously towards the latter. Again, there is nothing necessarily wrong in over-stepping these boundaries of decorum. There have been plenty\u00a0of great golfers who have cared little about what other people, especially the media, have thought about\u00a0them. Nick Faldo is the most obvious example and it did not do him any\u00a0harm. Yet times have changed in 20 years since the Englishman was in his prime. In an age when every last word is scrutinised, the financial rewards are greatest for those who can combine supreme athletic talent with a marketable (and likeable) public persona. Phil Mickelson is perhaps the best illustration of this modern commercial reality. If, as has been claimed, McIlroy switched agent because he was concerned about the way his &quot;brand&quot; was being developed, we can be assured that\u00a0he cares greatly about the way he is now perceived; that , that he knows he now stands at a crossroads and that things have to change. Yet it is one thing recognising a developing problem and quite another to make it go away. An agent will be able to help with all kinds of things. But, in the end, McIlroy&apos;s career and his brand are in his own hands. It is his choice.", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-29T21:55:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/30/g20-and-the-new-economic-players", "sentences": ["In a major report earlier this year, The World in 2050, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted that, judged by purchasing power parity \u2013 which allows for the fact that a dollar goes much further in Shanghai than in New York \u2013 China was already the world&apos;s second-largest economy."], "title": "How the Eurocrisis laid bare world's new economic order", "article": "The French Riviera in November conjures up images of ageing playboys eking out the last rays of autumn sunshine on the Croisette over a pastis. So it may be fitting that Nicolas Sarkozy has chosen Cannes as the venue for this week&apos;s G20 summit, where the fading power of Europe&apos;s old world economies will be thrown into sharp relief by the nouveau riche arrivistes from China, India and Brazil. Sarkozy&apos;s humiliating call to Beijing last week, asking if the Chinese would care to invest in the European financial stability facility, the huge euro bailout fund, was portrayed within China as grovelling. Guido Mantegna, Brazil&apos;s finance minister, rapidly issued a statement saying his country had no intention of taking part. Silvio Berlusconi was also forced to bear his share of the humiliation, writing a letter to his eurozone neighbours promising to buck up his economic act, in return for a share of the aid package. For Europeans, last week&apos;s events were a stark reminder that through a combination of their own economic mismanagement and the irresistible rise of a new generation of financial powers, the old continent&apos;s pre-eminence is a thing of the past. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, says: &quot;Clearly, the fact that Europe needs this money is a further demonstration of how its economic health has deteriorated, at least in the short term.&quot; Charles Dumas, of Lombard Street Research, says: &quot;The optimistic view for growth in Europe is 0%; the pessimistic scenario is depression.&quot; That message will be rammed home to Angela Merkel and her colleagues as the Europeans rub shoulders with India, China and the other G20 nations in the south of France. Before the world financial crisis, these setpiece and usually self-congratulatory summits were still held among the G8 countries \u2013 the traditional lineup of the US, Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Canada and Italy, plus Russia, added to the list in 1997 to cement the fact that the post-communist empire had come in from the cold. But even before mis-sold mortgages and reckless bankers triggered arguably the worst global financial crisis in living memory, it had become clear that this group was no longer a fair representation of the world economy. Goldman Sachs economist Jim O&apos;Neill coined the phrase &quot;Brics&quot; in 2001, to describe Brazil, Russia, India and China, a disparate group of nations that he predicted would soon wield greater power on the world economic stage. In the ensuing decade, more economies have joined the list of promising upstarts, including African states such as Nigeria and Egypt, and Asian big beasts such as Indonesia. The credit crunch, which could weigh on economic growth in Europe and the US for several years, will only accelerate the great catch-up. In a major report earlier this year, The World in 2050, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted that, judged by purchasing power parity \u2013 which allows for the fact that a dollar goes much further in Shanghai than in New York \u2013 China was already the world&apos;s second-largest economy. By 2050, it reckons that the US will have slipped to number three, with India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia all in the top 10. Economists call this &quot;convergence&quot;. Technological advances may arise first in Silicon Valley or the German Mittelstand, but in a globalised economy, they can rapidly be appropriated by firms and families thousands of miles away, helping to drive up economic growth. Nothing about convergence is automatic: politics matters too. China&apos;s rise from closed communist state to workshop of the 21st-century world accelerated after it joined the World Trade Organisation in December 2001. With easier access to the west&apos;s consumer markets, China ruthlessly pursued an export-led growth model, racking up vast trade surpluses with the US and Europe, and spending much of the money on buying dollars, and other foreign currency denominated assets, to keep the yuan cheap, and its goods competitive. The 10% a year growth rates it has posted are a result of deliberate policy as well as its sheer size. Many China-watchers are concerned that the country could be destined for an economic &quot;hard landing&quot; over the next 12 months, as rapid increases in property prices swing into reverse. But Gerard Lyons, chief economist of Standard Chartered, who travels to China frequently, insists any downturn will only be a temporary setback. He believes the world economy is in the middle of its third powerful &quot;super-cycle&quot;. The first was at the end of the 19th century, when Britain emerged as a mighty economic power; the second in the postwar years, when Japan rose to prominence, worrying the new hegemonic power, the US; and the third today, as China, India and several other developing economies take their place as major powers . Lest the exhausted Europeans gathering in Cannes feel too overshadowed, though, there are two caveats to the triumph of the east. in this global game of economic top trumpsThe first is that while the massive populations of China, India and Indonesia will help to catapult them into the big league over the coming years, it will be much longer before living standards catch up. The average income in China is just 15% of the US level today, and even by 2050 it is still expected to be more than 50% lower than America&apos;s. Headline numbers don&apos;t capture inequality either: comparatively rich countries measured by GDP alone can still contain pitifully poor populations, if a kleptocratic elite is appropriating the spoils, or an ineffectual bureaucracy fails to create the social safety nets the public need. Finally, the world&apos;s leaders should console themselves with the fact that if they get things right, we should all be winners. Richard Snook, of PwC, says: &quot;It&apos;s fair to say that over the next five or six years things are going to be pretty difficult. But over the next 40 years, we are expecting the standard of living to improve a lot.&quot; But he insists the convergence of China and the rest should be good news, because it creates large and growing markets which the old powers should be able to take advantage of. &quot;This is not a &apos;decline of the west&apos; story: we&apos;re still expecting the European and the US economies to expand by two and a half or three times by 2050,&quot; he says. Lyons agrees. &quot;I don&apos;t think the west should be pessimistic,&quot; he says. &quot;We need to be realistic about the near-term: the debt and the need to deleverage point to a difficult couple of years. But the west still has the ability to do well.&quot; Free trade&apos;s champion, Business, page 48", "tags": ["G20", "Eurozone crisis", "Europe", "World news", "European banks", "Business", "France", "China", "India", "Brazil"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-29T23:18:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/30/britain-talent-deficit-asia-education", "sentences": ["China-Shanghai by miles, with Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan clustered behind.", "Shanghai, Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong all over again, with only gallant little Finland, in third place, to disrupt this tale of eastern promise.", "Japan joins Finland in the top five, but China-Shanghai is far and away top, with the UK at 16th and America in 21st spot."], "title": "Britain's got a talent deficit | Peter Preston", "article": "What do you think of when China is beseeched to bail out the eurozone \u2013 and America, and pretty well any western country fallen on grotesquely indebted times?

This is our future, our Anglo-American future, our European future \u2013 and we&apos;re blowing it. We trot out the old Blair mantra from memory. Education, education, education. We demand that entrepreneurs start new businesses to ease the crushing weight of unemployment. But when it comes to turning out entrepreneurs and technical wizards, the job creators of tomorrow, we are way off the pace. A facile parody of Chinese achievement sees workers toiling for 12 or 14 hours a day for pitiful reward. A more accurate version would see us being outgunned, year after year, in quality and in numbers. Tom Friedman of the New York Times broods over this in his latest book (That Used to Be Us, co-authored with Michael Mandelbaum) and finds naught for either Washington or Westminster comfort. Are the samples representative? Yes they are. Does Finland do so well because it&apos;s a small, homogenous nation that puts teacher standards and teacher pay high on its agenda? Yes again. So perhaps we can&apos;t expect the US or the UK, with its wide spread of immigrants, languages and backgrounds, to do anything close to as well \u2026 Except that Canada \u2013 huge, very mixed, multilingual Canada \u2013 is in Pisa&apos;s top 10 under all three categories. There are no excuses. Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Switzerland are consistently above OECD average. The powerhouses of Obama and Cameron are severely underpowered. Not everything is identical. American primary education is good enough; the problems set in at high school. British primary schooling, in contrast, turns out thousands upon thousands without elementary reading or numerical skills, kids condemned to failure at an obscenely early age. Part of our difficulty lies in bringing deprived inner-city schools up to snuff, of course; but the difficulty beyond that \u2013 the one that ought to be haunting us just as much \u2013 is that the schools we deem adequate, OK to middling, are falling far, far off the world pace as well. Don&apos;t forget the riots, the poverty traps, society&apos;s chronic instabilities, to be sure. But look outwards, towards competitor countries where high levels of education and application keep growth rolling along. Of course all the familiar principles of fairness and equal opportunity still matter. But if Singapore can turn out 10,000 brilliant computer programmers and we can only manage 1,000, then equality won&apos;t give us the critical mass of talent we need. OK isn&apos;t OK any longer. Revoltingly fat pay packets for OK business managers from Baltimore to Bradford aren&apos;t OK either. China isn&apos;t bailing out the euro or the dollar by chance this time round.

He died in a plane crash in 1966 aged 56, but had already laid the foundations for a research programme that is now beginning to bear fruit.

It always makes me imagine some soccer-loving Laplanders, or footy obsessed desert dwellers glued to their transistor radios listening to the same match as me. That somehow the world is briefly united by a 3-1 scoreline from the Etihad stadium. This weekend, however, I was listening to BBC World Service when it linked up with 5 Live. It wasn&apos;t as exciting as I&apos;d hoped \u2013 even though the moment of union did coincide with a goal \u2013 but then I suppose listening to the World Service from north London loses some of the frisson you might get in more far-flung destinations. In fact, if you&apos;re not listening to the World Service outside of the UK is there any point in tuning into it at all? Pretty soon the BBC may be trying to persuade us that there is. Currently it exists thanks to grant aid from the Foreign Office, but in 2014 that is set to change, leaving the World Service funded entirely by the licence fee. So what does it offer home-based listeners? I spent a week tuning in to find out. The World Service is about as old-fashioned as you&apos;d expect a radio station with a title including the word &quot;service&quot; to be. In brief, it makes Radio 4 sound as gaudy and brash as TalkSport. But there are plenty of bonuses to this old-fashioned, decaffeinated approach \u2013 the biggest being the news, which is treated with the reverence that elsewhere it is so often denied. Despite sounding slightly as though it is being read by a 1930s butler, World Service news manages to light upon international events that I suspect go ignored elsewhere. Saturday afternoon&apos;s World Briefing, for example, included items on riots at a Metallica concert in India, the Kyrgyzstan elections and why Russia is not putting the clocks back this winter. (Among other reasons, Dmitry Medvedev was concerned about the nation&apos;s cows.) Despite its global agenda the World Service often feels like a local radio station \u2013 albeit a rather exotic one, with its pseudo-dramatic roll call of international cities &quot;Melbourne \u2026 Shanghai \u2026 New York&quot; which sounds uncannily like the Alan Partridge jingle that boasted that his audience reached &quot;Wivenhoe \u2026 Flitwick \u2026 Tiptree\u2026&quot; Opinions on the discussion programme World Have Your Say on Monday, which asked if the UK should cut aid to anti-gay nations, also sounded sadly familiar \u2013 the only difference being the homophobia was being broadcast from Lagos instead of Essex. While the menu of world affairs is expansive, the World Service is predominantly a station that broadcasts around the planet through the lens of British culture. Many non-news and sport programmes would sit comfortably in the Radio 4 schedule. Some, such as the woefully titled Stephanomics, already do, while others strangely don&apos;t. Among them last week&apos;s The Documentary \u2013 The British Establishment: Who For? was a fantastic listen. US journalist Michael Goldfarb left no doubt that the ruling elite is far from a myth \u2013 68% of the coalition cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge universities compared with 16% in Tony Blair&apos;s first term \u2013 it was a surprise to learn what a relatively recent notion &quot;the establishment&quot; is. It wasn&apos;t until the 1950s that people began to see the matrix of well-connected people who dominated power. There&apos;s lots of philosophical debate and esoteric pondering on the World Service. Last week&apos;s Heart and Soul attempted to define the word evil; The Forum contemplated death and how best to prepare for it and Discovery: Tribes of Science asked a group of volcanologists how they cope with the &quot;terrible beauty&quot; of their chosen profession, introducing us to a professor who &quot;once studied the mathematics of droplets in agricultural sprays before being seduced by molten ash clouds&quot;. I doubt you&apos;d find much space for volcanology or agricultural sprays anywhere else but the World Service, which is part of its charm. Also brilliant \u2013 and superbly condensed into 10 minutes \u2013 is Witness, which recalls historical events as told by the people who were there and spans incidents as diverse as the Mau Mau uprising and the publication of The Joy of Sex. Again. Where else would the BBC put this stuff? The World Service is an interesting, and sometimes strange, listen. I loved it and will definitely return. But what do you think,?

Last week the prominent agent Andrew &quot;Chubby&quot; Chandler was reeling after losing his &quot;star&quot; client Rory McIlroy. This week he is back on the horse and in Shanghai, breakfasting with the cream of young Chinese golfers and trying to add Asia&apos;s next golfing superstar to his roster. In the eyes of many 20-year-old Noh Seung-yul, currently ranked 93rd in the world, poses one of the biggest threats to McIlroy&apos;s hopes of dominating professional golf for the next decade. But from where Chandler is sitting the talented but virtually unknown (outside of the cognoscenti and of course his golf-mad homeland) Korean is the embodiment of a modern golfing truism. &quot;Asia is where it is to be in this game, it is where it is all happening. We in golf need to recognise that and embrace it,&quot; he says. Casting around the Sheshan International golf club, venue for the HSBC Champions tournament which starts on Thursday, it seems Chandler need have no worries. The heavy hitters of the professional game \u2013 agents, players, sponsors \u2013 are here in force and have been for some time. Lee Westwood, McIlroy and Ian Poulter arrived in China three weeks ago to take part in a week-long, cross-country exhibition match (eight courses, seven cities, a total of 18 holes) for which they each picked up a fee believed be at least $500,000 (\u00a3312,000). They have been here in Shanghai since \u2013 long enough for Westwood to pick up a few phrases of Mandarin, for McIlroy to collect the $2m winner&apos;s cheque (the biggest in the sport) at the Shanghai Masters on Sunday and for Poulter to become evangelical about Asia&apos;s status as golf&apos;s emerging powerhouse. &quot;In a purely golfing sense they have some amazing talent. I played with Noh last week and he is a seriously, seriously awesome player. A tall, slim kid who hits it 330 yards off the tee \u2013 watch out when he gains a bit more experience playing against the world&apos;s best players,&quot; the Englishman says. If current trends are anything to go by, Noh will get all the experience he needs and he won&apos;t have to travel too far either. This week the caravan has stopped in Shanghai. Next week it will arrive in Singapore. Between now and the end of the European Tour season in December there will be five more events in Asia. &quot;I used to say in five years&apos; time there will be more European Tour events in Asia than there will be on continental Europe,&quot; says Chandler. &quot;I now think that will happen in three years. The shift is happening that quickly.&quot; That shift isn&apos;t just reflected in the scheduling of the European and US PGA Tour (which last week staged an event in Malaysia) it is also reflected in the priorities of the biggest names in the sport. While most of the world&apos;s top players are in Shanghai this week, Tiger Woods has slipped into Singapore, where he is reportedly doing some corporate work on behalf of a Las Vegas-based casino company. Like everyone else in the sport, the former world No1 is gravitating to where the money is to be found. Chandler explains how the economics work. &quot;What we have now is a bunch of golfers who are willing and able to travel to Asia. You have companies here that are booming, an economy that is growing between seven and 10% a year, you have a growing middle class and a growing interest in golf. Put all of those things together and you can see why we are seeing more and more tournaments in this part of the world,&quot; he says. Contrast all of that with what is happening in Europe, both in the broader economic sense and in the world of professional golf. &quot;How can a company that is, say, English possibly justify putting up two or three million pounds to stage a golf tournament when they are laying people off? They can&apos;t,&quot; says Chandler. The upshot will be fewer events in Europe \u2013 an inevitability that is met with differing emotions on the range in Shanghai. Poulter is one of those who believes golfers should embrace their world as it is and not as they would like it to be. &quot;It would be good if, say, there were a couple more tournaments in England but that&apos;s not going to happen right now, is it. So let&apos;s get on with it.&quot; The Englishman&apos;s insouciance is not universally shared, at least not by Thomas Bjorn, one of continental Europe&apos;s best ever players. &quot;From a personal point of view I&apos;m always happy to come to Asia. The courses are good, we are treated very well and the prize money is good,&quot; says the Dane. &quot;But I&apos;m worried about the effect all of this will have on the game in Europe.

The new Tiger Woods? After a week in which a million words have been spilled on the subject of his decision to switch business representation, even McIlroy may be inclined to agree. &quot;I am shocked by how much interest there has been,&quot; he says of the interest provoked by his switch from the high-profile, high-volume agency run by Andrew &quot;Chubby&quot; Chandler to the low-key Dublin-based Horizon agency run by Conor Ridge. &quot;These things happen all the time.

It&apos;s not as if you have to deal with it all the time but, when you make decisions like I have, people are going to want to know why. In a way it&apos;s a nice position to be in but in another you could do without it. That&apos;s just the way it goes.&quot; It has been just over two weeks since the 22-year-old, on arriving at New York&apos;s JFK airport from the Bahamas with his now former agent, tapped Chandler on the shoulder and asked if they could speak privately for a few minutes. The two had been together, mentor and pupil, for 10 years, a relationship that started when McIlroy was a talented kid. It ended abruptly as he stood on the verge of becoming the most marketable, and most bankable, figure in the sport. &quot;It was a very difficult conversation, the most difficult of my life,&quot; he says. &quot;Chubby has been there for me since day one. I felt like he was the best person and ISM were fantastic for me. But sometimes to progress you need to have a different view and a fresh view on things. And this was something I felt like I needed. It was a purely business decision and nothing personal. I&apos;ve got all the time in the world for Chubby and for everyone involved at ISM. It was very difficult for me but it was a decision I feel I needed to make.&quot; There has been all kinds of speculation about McIlroy&apos;s motivation, some of it unjustly focusing on his girlfriend, the world&apos;s No1 women&apos;s tennis player, Caroline Wozniacki, who has been cast in some circles as a Yoko Ono figure. Contrary to this misogynistic perspective, the Dane did not break up the band. McIlroy says he had been thinking of making a change for some time, long before he met Wozniacki. &quot;It&apos;s not a decision that I&apos;ve made overnight. I&apos;ve thought long and hard about this and I&apos;ve spoken to the people who are close to me, obviously my mum and dad, and they&apos;re 100% behind any decision that I make. I just feel like it&apos;s a good move for me.&quot; McIlroy is less forthcoming about exactly what he discussed with his parents. Likewise the specifics of his concerns over the way his career was being managed remain off-limits.

You name it, Graeme McDowell was feeling it as he caught a flight to China after the worst weekend of his professional career at Valderrama. The Northern Irishman arrived at the famed Spanish golf course last Thursday to defend the Andaluc\u00eda Masters, a title he won in 2010, and departed it on Sunday 54th of the 54 players who completed 72 holes. Two rounds in the 80s \u2013 81 and 82 for those who are counting \u2013 left him comfortably adrift of the man in 53rd place and uncomfortably confronted with a bout of necessary self-examination. A first-class seat on a 747 is fine but it doesn&apos;t salve the pain of 10th-rate golf. &quot;I threw the towel in a little bit over the last 27 holes,&quot; he concedes of his Spanish demise. &quot;I started trying to hit some stupid shots from the trees, had a bit of an attitude \u2013 get me to China quickly so I can start at level par again.&quot; It takes a big man to admit he gave up, and an even bigger man to reverse course. Par was duly restored when McDowell stepped up to hit his opening shot of the HSBC Champions tournament in Shanghai on Thursday and when he finished his round he was three shots to the good. Keegan Bradley, the surprise winner of this year&apos;s PGA Championship, signed for a hugely impressive 65, seven under par, to lead after the first day around a soggy Sheshan International golf course but in the circumstances the Northern Irishman&apos;s 69 might rank as an even better effort. After all, here is McDowell&apos;s brutal analysis of how he played the notoriously difficult Valderrama course. &quot;I knew that I couldn&apos;t aim at the right side of the golf course because I couldn&apos;t rely on my draw and I couldn&apos;t aim at the left side of the course because I didn&apos;t have a fade. I didn&apos;t have a reliable shot in the bag. Oh yes, and I couldn&apos;t make a putt either.&quot; The difference from then to now? Willpower and grit surely played a role, but so too did Pete Cowen, the black-clad swing guru who has worked with McDowell for many years until the pair parted ways just over a month ago. McDowell was looking for something new. Not any more, he isn&apos;t. On Monday, the two men had a chat at the players&apos; hotel and on Tuesday they met on the practice range to tackle the problems they identified. Together they built a swing that was good enough to win a major championship \u2013 the 2010 US Open at Pebble Beach. How hard could it be to rekindle at least some of that magic? &quot;We spent some good range time together working on my control and on my ball flight, specifically on how I shape the ball. I felt like the last couple of months I have been neutralising my golf swing a little bit, trying to hit perfectly straight shots. But as soon as you get out on the golf course you quickly realise that you don&apos;t often hit straight golf shots \u2013 you are aiming at the right sides of fairways and left sides of greens, trying to hit fades and draws. That&apos;s what I did so well last year,&quot; McDowell says. &quot;The session we had on Tuesday reminded me a lot of the sessions we had last year, when everything was going so well. For the first time this year I really felt like my swing was coming back.&quot; Four rounds here in Shanghai should illuminate the truth of that statement. Certainly, McDowell hit some great shots on Thursday but he also hit a couple of poor ones, including a tee-shot at the par-three 17th hole which ultimately cost him a triple-bogey six. It goes without saying he will need to expunge such destructive inconsistency. He will also need to temper the perfectionism that has crept into his game as a byproduct of his 2010 heroics. It is hard to think of a downside to winning a major championship but the increased expectations it generates might be one. McDowell concedes he has put too much pressure on himself this year. &quot;I have been angrier with myself this year and much more frustrated because I have wanted to do too much. We are all guilty of wanting &apos;it&apos; too much,&quot; he says. &quot;But that is the thing with this game. We often don&apos;t give ourselves the credit we deserve. We are pretty quick to start beating ourselves up. Every professional golfer is the same. That&apos;s the thing with golf \u2013 it&apos;s love and hate. This year has been pretty much a hate relationship.&quot; The Northern Irishman has this week and five more weeks before the season ends to fall back in love. He also has some fresh motivation, having seen his friend Rory McIlroy sign with the same management company, the Dublin-based Horizon Sports. For the last four years, McDowell has been the company&apos;s &quot;No1&quot; client. No more. &quot;I happy to say I&apos;m now No2. I don&apos;t mind at all. I&apos;m happy to have Rory in the camp. Maybe I can slipstream my old friend, as I used to say a couple of years ago \u2013 a bit of friendly rivalry is definitely going to be a good thing.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2011 because the original incorrectly said Bradley Keegan, when it should have said Keegan Bradley.", "tags": ["Graeme McDowell", "Golf", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-03T16:40:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/03/snow-flower-and-the-secret-fan-review", "sentences": ["Lisa See's Chinese-American novel about a laotong relationship, \"sworn sisters\" in 19th-century imperial China, has been given a contemporary spin by the addition of a parallel gal-pal friendship in modern-day Shanghai, played out by the same actors."], "title": "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan \u2013 review", "article": "Here is a very self-conscious attempt to bridge the US-China divide through the medium of glossy, handsomely mounted cinema.

Foreign companies have also complained that they cannot find out exactly how much to pay, or how to pay it, because the scheme has been rushed through. Beijing has said it wants local authorities to implement the scheme by the year&apos;s end, but that firms and individuals will have to make back-payments from mid-October, when the rules went into effect. It appears that companies will have to pay in up to 32% of the salary of a worker based in Beijing, or 37% of a worker in Shanghai. In most but not all cities a cap would apply, so payments will be due on income of up to three times the average monthly wage. In Beijing that would probably mean a maximum employer&apos;s contribution of around 4000 yuan per month - roughly \u00a34,800 a year. Employees will put in 10 to 11% of their salary. It is not clear whether their contributions will be capped. The scheme will affect more than 230,000 foreign workers in China. Beijing has been gradually introducing a social welfare system and says it wants to ensure that foreign employees are also protected. In theory, they will be entitled to a pension, basic medical care, unemployment cover, maternity pay and workplace injury insurance. But a commentary in the state-run Global Times newspaper on Thursday acknowledged concerns that the payments might not benefit foreign workers. It said: &quot;Many worry they won&apos;t receive the benefits, although they and their companies pay for the insurance every month. For instance, a foreigner who loses a job in China instantly loses the right to live here, and it is unclear how he or she is going to benefit from the unemployment insurance and retirement pension.&quot; &quot;Our members have a lot of questions and concerns,&quot; said Dirk Moens, the secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. He said that the principle - including foreigners in the system - was very similar to that of other countries. &quot;The concern of members is: okay, we understand we have to contribute to the system - but how do we benefit from it? If there is a reasonable balance between benefits and contributions, I think people would accept it. If you don&apos;t know, you cannot have confidence,&quot; he said. &quot;We understand the individual can claim back [pension] contributions but not the employers&apos; part [when they leave].&quot; The chamber also believes the back-payments are unfair, because people are paying for benefits they never had a chance to claim. It had suggested that the policy should be voluntary initially, to avoid companies and individuals having to pay twice over. Beijing says that they are happy to reach reciprocal agreements to avoid double payment - as they have done with Germany and South Korea - if other countries approach them. A spokesman for the British embassy in Beijing said: &quot;If in the future UK businesses wanted us to seek such an agreement, then we would give it strong consideration.&quot; The American Chamber of Commerce in China also expressed concern about the apparent impossibility of collecting the benefits, adding: &quot;In addition, the measure would create substantial new financial obligations that could in some cases threaten the competitive standing of our member companies.&quot; Nick Thomas, executive director of the British Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, said &quot;almost no notice was given at all&quot; of the changes. He added: &quot;There&apos;s also the cost implication. It&apos;s something like \u00a36,000 a year and especially for small companies, if you have a lot of expats, it&apos;s a sizable amount.&quot; Xu Yanjun, a senior official at the Ministry of Human Resources, said last week: &quot;Local governments have had some difficulty implementing the measures at an operational level. It will take time.&quot; He acknowledged there was a &quot;disconnect&quot; because visa regulations would not allow people to remain in the country to claim pensions or unemployment benefit and asked people to &quot;trust China&quot;. &quot;Some new problems have come up and we are working hard to address them and need some time to do so,&quot; he added. An editorial carried by state news agency Xinhua suggested many foreign companies who complained were expecting special treatment. &quot;Leaving foreign employees out of the system simply gives their employers an unfair cost advantage in hiring,&quot; it said.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Global economy", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-04T11:23:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/04/paul-casey-injury-comeback-shanghai", "sentences": ["At the halfway point in Shanghai Casey found himself tucked nicely inside the top 10 after a second round of 66, three shots behind the tournament leader, Freddie Jacobson of Sweden."], "title": "Paul Casey hopes to end on a high in China after torment of 'Turf toe'", "article": "The can&apos;t-miss kid is on the comeback trail. Paul Casey, perhaps the most naturally gifted of a golden generation of English golfers that includes Luke Donald and Justin Rose, harbours realistic hopes of winning a major in 2012 but first there is the HSBC Champions tournament. The final World Golf Championship event of the year represents one of Casey&apos;s last opportunities to make something of a year blighted by injury and poor form. While his old pal and amateur team sparring partner Donald has ascended to the top of the world rankings, he has almost faded from view. The forgotten man of European golf isn&apos;t a title to boost anyone&apos;s ego but it is one Casey is prepared to accept. &quot;It&apos;s true, because let&apos;s face it, the year has been disappointing for me,&quot; he said, while pointing out that he has won twice [in Bahrain at the start of the European Tour season and at a minor event in Korea a few weeks ago]. &quot;But all of that pales into comparison when you look at what Luke has done. I&apos;m still around 25th in the world rankings but compared to how some of the other boys have played this year I am way, way down.&quot; But perhaps not for long. At the halfway point in Shanghai Casey found himself tucked nicely inside the top 10 after a second round of 66, three shots behind the tournament leader, Freddie Jacobson of Sweden. A victory may be asking too much of a man still operating at &quot;75 to 80%&quot; of full fitness but the mere fact of Casey being in contention is something of a triumph. &quot;In Bahrain I didn&apos;t even play my best, I just ground it out and beat a bloody good field. I was ecstatic, thinking I can win yet there is still so much room for improvement. And then came the injury and it all went sour,&quot; he said. &quot;At first I thought I had been bitten on the foot by something, then I thought I might have arthritis. Then I thought I might have broken a small bone somewhere. I was even tested for gout.&quot; Eventually, Casey was diagnosed with something called &quot;turf toe&quot;. &quot;It affects NFL players, rugby players. You can get it from some kind of trauma or from repetitive bad movement on the toe,&quot; he said. &quot;I had to Google it to find out what it was.&quot; Turf toe. Silly name, serious consequences \u2013 especially for a professional, who believe it or not, relies a great deal on good footwork. The Englishman&apos;s was restricted, with damaging consequences for his swing and ultimately his performances. &quot;There were times during the summer where I could barely walk round the course never mind play the kind of golf I know I am capable of,&quot; he said. Indeed, such has been his decline over the season he ended up losing his PGA Tour card in the States after finishing outside the top 125 on the money list. This was a blow to the ego, even if it will have little effect on where and when he plays next year. His world ranking will gain him entry into the majors and any event in America he wants to play in, but with a Ryder Cup looming in 2012 he is set to focus a little bit more on European events. Infamously, he was left out of the 2010 Ryder Cup side despite being ranked in the world&apos;s top 10. Worse still, at least in his opinion, was that the news of the team selection and his omission was made public while he and other contenders for places were still playing in a tournament in the US. &quot;I&apos;m not one for talking about the Ryder Cup that far in advance, but making the team is a major goal for me,&quot; he said, adding that he had no problem with being left out at Celtic Manor. &quot;What I did have a problem with was the way the announcement was made, when some of us were still playing. I&apos;m on the [European Tour] players&apos; committee and I am definitely going to bring it up as soon as I can. The system needs to change before this year&apos;s team announcement.&quot; The thoughts of Jacobson, who has based himself in the US since 2004, were also on the Ryder Cup. &quot;I&apos;m starting to get into a lot of the tournaments where I can create points both on the European list and when it comes to world ranking points,&quot; he said after leaving Lee Westwood four back and Rory McIlroy six adrift. &quot;I might get my European Tour card back from the few tournaments that I play this year.

The New Zealander, who was fired by Woods earlier this year and has since joined up with the Australian Adam Scott, made the comment while on stage at a &quot;caddie of the year&quot; awards ceremony in Shanghai. He was being honoured for the &quot;celebration of the year&quot;, an ironic acknowledgement of his emotional reaction in the aftermath of Scott&apos;s victory at the Bridgestone Invitational last summer. The caddie described his new employer&apos;s triumph at the time as the &quot;greatest victory of my career&quot;. Asked on Friday to explain why he had made such an obvious exaggeration given that he had caddied Woods to 13 major championship wins, Williams said: &quot;I wanted to shove it up that black arsehole.&quot; The comment was made in a room packed with many of the world&apos;s leading golfers and tour officials, who are in Shanghai this week for the HSBC Champions event. It caused a sharp intake of breath, according to eyewitnesses. The caddie later apologised on his personal website, saying: &quot;I apologize for comments I made last night at the Annual Caddy Awards dinner in Shanghai. Players and caddies look forward to this evening all year and the spirit is always joking and fun. I now realize how my comments could be construed as racist. However I assure you that was not my intent. I sincerely apologize to Tiger and anyone else I have offended.&quot; The organisers of the awards ceremony, held at the players&apos; hotel, had declared the occasion &quot;private&quot; and &quot;off the record&quot; but when the guests spilled out of the venue they could talk of little else. &quot;I have never seen so many jaws drop in one room at the same time,&quot; said one caddie who was present. &quot;I was standing next to a European Tour official and he said to me &apos;thank God he [Williams] is not on our tour&apos;.&quot; Williams and Woods split acrimoniously in June, with each offering different versions of what happened between them. The caddie claimed he was fired because he had taken temporary work with Scott while awaiting Woods&apos;s return from injury. The golfer, meanwhile, suggested in the time-honoured way of these things that it was simply &quot;time for a change&quot;. They even disagreed over how the sacking was made. By phone, according to the caddie \u2013 face-to-face, said Woods. Williams has earned a reputation for his forthright views, apparently unconcerned about what he says and whom he offends. Two years ago, he used the platform of a charity event in New Zealand to describe Woods&apos;s long-time rival Phil Mickelson as a &quot;prick&quot; \u2013 a comment for which both caddie and his then boss were forced to apologise. The former world No1 resisted calls to fire Williams and described him as a loyal friend. But these latest remarks are of an altogether different order, raising as they do the spectre of race. The topic has dominated English football in recent days, with Chelsea&apos;s John Terry being accused of racially abusing QPR&apos;s Anton Ferdinand \u2013 a charge he categorically denies. Now it is golf&apos;s turn to face a similar examination. Most immediately, there is the question of Williams&apos;s continued employment with Scott, who will presumably come under pressure to take some kind of action. Tournament officials may also come under pressure from the HSBC Bank, which is sponsoring the Champions tournament to the tune of an estimated $10m (\u00a36.2m). Williams&apos;s continued presence at the Sheshan International Golf Club over the weekend may well be judged to be an unacceptable diversion from what is after all a world golf championship, one of the biggest events on the golfing calendar. Over the longer term, the European Tour has the power to take sanctions against any participant in its events, player or caddie, who is adjudged to have damaged the tour&apos;s reputation. Attention will also focus on golf&apos;s apparent inability to crack the racial divide, despite hopes that Woods&apos;s arrival on the professional scene at the end of 1996 would herald the beginning of an era in the game in which minorities would embrace what had until then been a largely white sport. Instead, the the PGA Tour has shown no significant increase in the number of black golfers. Indeed, at times over the past 15 years there have been fewer minority golfers playing at the highest level of the sport than when Woods turned professional.", "tags": ["Tiger Woods", "Golf", "Sport", "Race issues", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-05T00:59:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/05/caddie-williams-racial-slur-tiger-woods", "sentences": ["&quot;That black arsehole,&apos;&apos; was the term used by the New Zealander at an awards ceremony in Shanghai in front of 200 or so players, caddies, sponsors and officials."], "title": "Reaction to caddie Williams's racial slur at Tiger Woods shames golf | Lawrence Donegan", "article": "No comment. No comment. No comment. For a global sport at a global event in the midst of a global controversy, professional golf had depressingly little to say for itself in the immediate aftermath of Steve Williams&apos;s racial slur against his former employer Tiger Woods. &quot;That black arsehole,&apos;&apos; was the term used by the New Zealander at an awards ceremony in Shanghai in front of 200 or so players, caddies, sponsors and officials. No lip reading necessary and little need for interpretation, although \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 Williams retains a small cadre of loyalists who have always claimed to see beyond his boorish public persona and into the soul of a better man. He is blunt, apparently. He is honest, a breath of fresh air in a stuffy world. The apologists were at it again on Saturday, albeit with a little less enthusiasm than has been their wont over the years. Apparently, he did not mean any harm. He is socially gauche, which explains why he &quot;misjudged&quot; the mood of the occasion, believing that his comments at a &quot;caddie of the year&quot; ceremony were somehow in keeping with the &quot;fun&quot; spirit of the occasion. Indeed, there was a suggestion in some circles the real &quot;crime&quot; was that Williams&apos;s comments had become public despite being made in a private &quot;off-the-record&quot; setting. It requires little further thought to establish the folly of such thinking. Does &quot;off-the-record&quot; confer immunity for every Tom, Dick or Harry to say whatever he likes about whom ever he likes in whatever offensive manner he so wishes? Of course not. That Williams was guilty of revealing an ugly truth about himself, unwittingly or otherwise, is beyond doubt. So is the punishment he should have faced. He should have gone. From the Champions event in China. From his lucrative employment with the Australian golfer Adam Scott. From the sport of golf. For good. That none of these things had happened by the evening after the night before speaks eloquently about the cravenness and cowardice of the self-regarding, self-perpetuating, self-enriching administrators who claim to have the best interests of golf at heart. They came to China this week to sell their sport as modern and inclusive. They were tripping over themselves to claim their share of the Asian economic boom. Instead they now find themselves peddling Williams&apos;s brand of vile bigotry \u2013 the inevitable consequence of their refusal to disown themselves from what the caddie had said, far less from the man himself. How does the old adage go? All that it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. In an economy blighted by unemployment there has been at least one bright spot. Professional golf now has legions of press officers. Watching them go about their work on Saturday, trying to becalm the firestorm started by Williams, it was hard not to look on them as lions led by donkeys. A one-line press release was issued by the tournament organisers, the contents unworthy of a wider audience. Move along now, nothing here to see, was the gist of it. The players, too, were left to handle the inevitable questions about a sensitive social issue, a task for which none of them were equipped. Say nothing, as the majority did, and you are damned. Saying something, as a few of them did, and they are doomed to make excuses for the inexcusable. In an ideal world, someone would have had the guts to stand up for decency, to condemn Williams for what he said and call for his ostracism. Alas it did not happen. This is a disappointment but it is not a surprise. Professional golf at the highest level is not a breeding ground for social warriors. It is a comfortable, fabulously wealthy place for the athletes who are focused mostly maintaining this gilded status quo. This is not an excuse but an explanation. One day golf may find its very own Arthur Ashe but in the meantime it is the job of those who run the game \u2013 the European and PGA Tours, the R&amp;A and the United States Golf Association \u2013 to show leadership beyond the boundaries of the fairway ropes. To know the history of modern golf is to know that this leadership has been woefully lacking. Hence we have the continued abomination of the R&amp;A, the so-called &quot;governing body&quot;, continuing to bar women members. Similarly, Augusta National, home of the Masters, has no female members \u2013 and very few black and Jewish ones either. The official reaction \u2013 or rather non-reaction \u2013 to Williams&apos;s comments is straight from this playbook of 19th-century social attitudes. Sexism and racism are the twin pillars of golfing intolerance and should be tackled head-on at every opportunity. Instead we have this unedifying spectacle of abject leadership: look away and say nothing in the hope that it all goes way.

He later issued an apology to Woods and continued to carry Scott&apos;s bag during Saturday&apos;s third round at the Shanghai Masters. It is understood that players, caddies and senior golf figures will ask Scott to consider Williams&apos;s position for this week&apos;s Australian Open in Sydney \u2013 where Woods is also due to play \u2013 and the following week&apos;s Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne. &quot;It&apos;s not an issue for me,&quot; Scott said. &quot;I think everything in that room last night was all in good spirits and a bit of fun and I think it probably got taken out of that room in the wrong context.

The big New Zealander is seldom seen at events like this. It is safe to say he will never be seen at one again. As the best golfers in the world battled for a share of the $7m prize fund at the HSBC Champions event on the outskirts of Shanghai, Williams was battling to save his reputation and career after making a racial slur against his former employer, Tiger Woods. The two men had been together for more than a decade, forming a partnership that won 13 major championships until they split up in June this year. Enmity was apparent at the time as they disagreed over exactly what had come between them. But the depth of it was never fully realised until Williams stepped up to receive an award from BBC presenter Andrew Cotter. The evening was billed as a &quot;fun&quot; occasion for about 200 caddies, officials and players, including the likes of Rory McIlroy, who was in attendance with his girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki, the world&apos;s number one female tennis player. But Williams&apos;s description of Woods as &quot;that black arsehole&quot; during a 10-second interview was clearly no one&apos;s idea of fun. The expression on Cotter&apos;s face \u2013 somewhere between shock and disbelief \u2013 summed up the mood in the room. Afterwards, as the audience spilled out into the hotel bar, the talk was of nothing else. Meanwhile, Williams headed back up to his room, apparently unaware of the offence he had caused and the controversy he had started. He was evidently still unaware he was in trouble when he arose at 6am on Saturday for his usual visit to the gym. Realisation finally came when he arrived at the golf course to discover that his remarks had been widely reported by the British press, despite the stipulation by the awards&apos; organisers that the occasion was &quot;off the record&quot;. His first reaction was to chase down a golf journalist who had been present and ask him if he had &quot;started the ball rolling on this crap&quot;. He had not. Williams had started the ball rolling by using the tainted words, although recognition of this was clearly beyond the gruff New Zealander. This came as little surprise to those who have observed Williams over the years and have come to understand his hard-shell personality. Self-awareness is not his strongest suit. Self-confidence is. In a professional context, the roots of this are easy to trace. Williams, by general consent, is a terrific caddie, perhaps the best. Experienced and opinionated \u2013 attributes that are necessary for someone in his position \u2013 Williams has worked for some great players over the last 30 years. But it was his relationship with Woods that transformed both his life and his public persona. It made him a star, and rich. It is often said, but has never been positively verified, that Williams was New Zealand&apos;s richest sportsman until the rugby star Dan Carter came along. The details of his remuneration package with Woods were never revealed; however, most caddies receive a percentage of their employer&apos;s winnings and 10% of Tiger Woods&apos;s income in the golfer&apos;s prime years amounted to a comfortable seven-figure annual stipend. It has certainly been enough for Williams to enjoy a very comfortable lifestyle. He owns property in the US, where he spends the summer, and in his homeland, and also finances his own motor racing team. Nevertheless, he has a persona that would crush the spirits of all but the most thick-skinned of public figures. By turns, Williams is described as uncouth and boorish, as a bully and a loudmouth. He was spectacularly rude to spectators at tournaments, including once removing a $7,000 camera from a photographer and dropping it in a lake. Most damaging, he was accused of being complicit in Woods&apos;s scandalous private life. The two were close friends for years, with the golfer serving as best man at his wedding. People assume he must have known what the boss was up to \u2013 a charge Williams vehemently denies. It says a lot about the decline in Woods&apos;s reputation that Williams emerged as the more sympathetic figure of the two when the split came earlier this summer. A new partnership with the likeable Australian Adam Scott represented an opportunity to acquaint the world with a more approachable Steve Williams. Alas, it wasn&apos;t to be. After Scott&apos;s win at the Bridgestone Invitational in August, Williams made a laughing stock of himself as he tried to take most of the credit for what was a tremendous effort by his employer. Scott, an easy-going figure with an obvious respect for the caddie&apos;s work, forgave him. And he forgives him now \u2013 or at least he wants to. &quot;It&apos;s not an issue for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I think everything in that room last night was all in good spirits and a bit of fun. I think it probably got taken out of that room in the wrong context.&quot; As an expression of loyalty, Scott&apos;s words can hardly be faulted. As the proper response to the maelstrom now engulfing the sport and Steve Williams it will surely be found wanting.", "tags": ["Tiger Woods", "Sport", "Golf", "Race issues", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-05T22:05:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/06/snow-flower-secret-fan-review", "sentences": ["The film she&apos;s actually produced is a version of Lisa See&apos;s bestselling novel that tells the parallel stories of two women from revolution-torn 19th-century China and two women from booming 21st-century Shanghai, each pair united by the ancient practice of &quot;laotong&quot;, which binds them together as eternal sisters, or as the online acronyms have it, FFL and BFF.", "The film&apos;s Australian connection is an appearance by Hugh Jackman serenading one of the modern girls in a Shanghai nightclub and impregnating her."], "title": "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan \u2013 review", "article": "Defending her husband Rupert from an assailant at the Commons select committee meeting last July, Wendi Murdoch seemed to be auditioning for a martial arts movie. &quot;Crouching Tycoon, Hacking Dragon&quot; perhaps.

The caddie flew to Sydney, where he may well come face to face this week with his former employer and one-time friend. It had been widely speculated that Australia&apos;s Adam Scott, who hired Williams last summer, would ask the caddie to step aside for a few weeks, or at least for as long as it takes the row, one of the most toxic to hit the sport in recent years, to die down. Instead, Scott confirmed that his bagman would be at the Australian Open in Sydney this week and at the Presidents Cup in Melbourne the following week. Woods, whom Williams called a &quot;black arsehole&quot; at an awards ceremony in Shanghai on Friday, is playing in both events. It has been rumoured for weeks that the tournament organisers in Sydney were mischievously planning to pair the two players for the first two rounds at the Lakes course. There is no chance of that happening now \u2013 at least not by design. However Woods and Scott,\u00a0and by extension Williams, could be paired if they shoot matching scores over the first two days of the tournament. There is also a possibility that they will play each other at the Presidents Cup, the biennial match between the United States and an international team. &quot;Could be an interesting dynamic,&quot; Scott said, when asked about the possibility of Williams and Wood spending around four hours in each other&apos;s company on the course. Last Saturday Woods&apos;s agent, Mark Steinberg, described the caddie&apos;s comments as &quot;sad&quot;. The former world No1 will make his own views known on Tuesday morning in Sydney, when he is scheduled to give a press conference. Woods has a long history of shying away from what could be described as &quot;social&quot; issues, preferring to stick to the subject of the game as much as possible. However, the depth of enmity between him and his former caddie has been evident for some time. In the circumstances, he may feel inclined to go beyond a bland statement of regret before signifying a desire to &quot;move on&quot;. Woods&apos;s friend and Presidents Cup captain, Fred Couples, pulled no punches when he was asked about Williams&apos;s remarks. &quot;If that was Joe LaCava [Couples&apos;s long-time caddie, who is now working full-time for Woods] he wouldn&apos;t be caddying for me today,&quot; he told Golf Digest magazine in California, where he is competing in a US PGA Champions Tour event. &quot;If [a caddie] has that kind of anger for a pretty good guy, I don&apos;t want him around me.&quot; Couples was virtually alone in the world of top-class professional golf in suggesting that Williams should face some form of sanction. The US PGA and European Tours have the power to punish any player or caddie deemed to have brought the sport into disrepute, and they frequently use it. In February last year, for instance, the European Tour fined Woods \u00a310,000 for spitting on a green during a tournament in Dubai. The US PGA tour has a policy of never publicising when a player or caddie is punished. However, it is believed that sanctions are imposed with great regularity and range from substantial fines to bans. John Daly, for instance, was suspended from the US PGA Tour for six months in 2008, for a range of offences including public drunkenness and using a beer can to tee up his ball in the pro-am before a tournament in Detroit. Williams conceded in a public apology that his remarks, which were made in front of 200 players, caddies and officials at a &quot;caddie of the year&quot; ceremony, &quot;could be construed as racist&quot; and added: &quot;However, that was not my intent.&quot; Despite this admission, a statement issued jointly by the US PGA and European Tours on Sunday made it clear that Williams will not be punished: &quot;[We feel] strongly there is no place for any form of racism in ours or any other sport. We consider the remarks of Steve Williams, as reported, entirely unacceptable in whatever context. We are aware that he has apologised and we trust we will not hear such remarks again. Based on this, we consider the matter closed.&quot; Scott, speaking after his final round at the HSBC Champions event here, endorsed that statement. When asked if the Tours were &quot;condoning racism&quot; by not taking action against Williams for appearing to bring the sport into disrepute, he said: &quot;Look, I don&apos;t [think] digging for a story out of me on this is a good idea.&quot; The Australian&apos;s desire to move on is understandable \u2013 he is after all caught up a row that is not of his own making \u2013 but his wish for the story to fade away is unlikely to be met in his home country.

Kaymer, a 26-year-old German who was himself briefly No1 earlier this year, produced one of the\u00a0best final rounds of the year, making birdie on nine of the last 12 holes at the Sheshan club for a round\u00a0of 63. That was good enough to overtake the long-time tournament leader, Freddie Jacobson of Sweden, on the back nine. Kaymer finished 20-under par for four rounds. A week after shooting two rounds in the 80s at Valderrama, Spain, Northern Ireland&apos;s Graeme McDowell finished third on 16-under par. The Englishman Paul Casey and South Africa&apos;s Charl Schwartzel, the US Masters champion, finished alongside McIlroy in fourth place. McIlroy&apos;s birdie at the final hole meant that he overtook England&apos;s Lee Westwood in the world rankings, though he remains some way adrift of the current world No1, Luke\u00a0Donald. The US-based Englishman has won four times this year and will be hard\u00a0to shift. Yet McIlroy, who has not finished outside the top 10 in any tournament since the US PGA Championship, is playing to a standard that is worthy of the top spot. On the evidence of Sunday&apos;s play, however, so is Kaymer. The German won last year&apos;s US PGA Championship and followed it with victory in the season-long Race to Dubai. A runner-up finish \u2013 to Donald \u2013 at the Accenture Match Play in Arizona during February gave him the No1 spot. He then embarked on some swing changes which saw his form dip, and by his own admission he struggled to handle the additional demands that come with being the world&apos;s best player. &quot;When I became No1 my life has changed a little bit, not only mine, for the people I work with, my family, and it was a little awkward sometimes because I was just not used to being in the spotlight,&quot; Kaymer said. The upshot was that the expectation that he would remain as world No1 were proved wrong, but Kaymer&apos;s performance here have suggested that his swing changes have taken root. On Sunday , after playing the first six holes to par Kaymer, right, started his charge with a birdie on the 346-yard par-four 7th, where he holed out for birdie from a greenside bunker. He was four behind the leader but it was a deficit that vanished as he reeled off eight birdies in the next 11 holes. His five-shot charge was the largest final-round comeback in the 12-year history of the World Golf Championships and his 63 the lowest final round by a winner. &quot;I just played really good golf and I&apos;m glad that it came together,&quot; he said. &quot;The\u00a0last few weeks I played good golf but it has not happened yet. And this week it was nice that it happened here, the\u00a0World Golf Championship event.&quot; The win lifted Kaymer to No4 in the rankings, which means that European players now occupy the four top spots. It also gave the German an outside chance of overtaking Donald in the Race to Dubai.

The organisation will send a monitoring mission to the city because it is concerned about the impact of Peel Holdings&apos; \u00a35.5bn Liverpool Waters scheme.  Liverpool&apos;s world heritage site takes in the elegant Edwardian three graces \u2013 the Royal Liver, Cunard and Port of Liverpool buildings \u2013 which have defined the skyline for almost a century. Earlier this year, an independent report commissioned by English Heritage warned the waterfront could lose its World Heritage status if the project to regenerate the city&apos;s northern docklands is approved. The three-day mission will arrive on November 14 and report its findings by December 23 at the latest. Heritage campaigner Wayne Colquhoun, who was instrumental in persuading Unesco to send its inspectors, said he hoped they would not repeat &quot;past mistakes&quot;. The inspectors will be Ron van Oers and Patricia Alberth from Unesco and Giancarlo Barbato, an Italian conservation architect from the International Committee on Monuments and Statues. Ron van Oers was a member of a similar mission that visited Liverpool five years ago and decided the World Heritage Site was not compromised by development at the Pier Head. When English Heritage commissioned an independent report it concluded that plans to create a &quot;Shanghai-style&quot; high rise cluster of buildings on the waterfront could jeopardise the world heritage status. But Peel Holdings wants to develop the northern docklands, with skyscrapers, thousands of apartments and a cruise ship terminal. The plans have come under fire from English Heritage. Part of the city&apos;s waterfront was granted world heritage status in 2004. At the time, Unesco said: &quot;Liverpool is an outstanding example of a world mercantile port city, which represents the early development of global trading and cultural connections throughout the British empire.&quot; Peel argues that the Liverpool Waters plan will regenerate former and disused dockland, create thousands of jobs and replicate the drama of Shanghai on Merseyside, even featuring a tall building called the Shanghai Tower. The report warned that the relationship between the site and the river could be &quot;severely compromised&quot;. It says the buildings will have &quot;a significant damaging negative impact on the Liverpool world heritage site and its outstanding universal value&quot;. It concludes: &quot;There is little to be found in the application which instils confidence that the Liverpool Waters scheme will be recognised internationally as innovative or a world leader.&quot; It says the development risks overwhelming the defining characteristics of the area with opposing ones. It warns that the setting of key heritage assets such as the Victoria Clock Tower and the Stanley Dock tobacco warehouse will be damaged by development &quot;that fails to respect fundamental notions of form and function&quot;. Some of the impacts would be of a &quot;major magnitude&quot;. The report also highlights four separate policies with which the planning application fails to comply.

But the first round of big-budget films since the country&apos;s emergence as a 21st-century power have, mostly, taken the narrow view of those four millennia: unfailingly epic and hoarsely patriotic. 2002&apos;s Hero set the mould \u2013 shockingly, as it was directed by the former dissenter Zhang Yimou. Jet Li&apos;s nameless swordsman ultimately decides to abandon the film&apos;s central assassination because he realises that the king of Qin&apos;s dream to unify the whole of China is more important. It&apos;s not hard to detect the Communist party&apos;s beatific smile behind that plotline. As the noughties wore on, the martial arts in Yimou&apos;s films grew ever more formalised and claustrophobic, closer to the Olympics ceremony he would eventually direct. Similar monumentalist blockbusters \u2013 Warlords, Red Cliff, Confucius \u2013 sprang up in formation around his work. If Hong Kong cinema&apos;s stance towards history used to be that of the over-imaginative student, the Chinese industry&apos;s has been pure class swot, with China Film Group (CFG), the state&apos;s largest distributor, rubber-stamping these epics. But there are promising signs that some graduates are beginning to think independently, and opening up new, less trampled avenues of history. Last week&apos;s release Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, based on the novel by Chinese-American writer Lisa See, focuses on laotong, a practice in which two women were bonded as &quot;sworn sisters&quot; for life, and nu shu, the secret language they used to communicate their thoughts. The story of nu shu, and its rediscovery in the 1960s, is fascinating. What&apos;s interesting about Snow Flower, the film, is that it tries to give this piece of heritage a modern bearing. An entirely new present-day story has been added to See&apos;s 19th-century-set tale: Gianna Jun and Li Bingbing, who play Snow Flower and her laotong partner Lily, now double up as their descendants in high-rise Shanghai, who are busy agonising about the meaning of their friendship. Lisa See, who wasn&apos;t involved with the modern part, says the new dimension was &quot;marketing-driven&quot;, to allow it to play to an international audience. She also reckons that director Wayne Wang felt compelled to make a statement with the changes: &quot;He doesn&apos;t like those stereotypes of the subservient, beaten-down Chinese women. The modern Chinese women \u2013 at least not in a city like Shanghai \u2013 isn&apos;t like that at all.&quot; What is Snow Flower trying to say about the relationship between the past and the present? It&apos;s never quite certain, and the film is a bit of an unclassifiable hybrid itself. It&apos;s produced by Wendi Murdoch, wife of Rupert, and Florence Sloan, a Chinese-Malaysian who is also part of the free-floating world of global business. It comes courtesy of IDG China Creative Media, the Chinese film arm of a Boston-based investment fund that increasingly has its eye on the global film game. The screenwriters are American; the two leads Chinese and Korean. The dialogue is part-Mandarin, part Shanghainese and part globish. If you were feeling any more culturally disorientated, Hugh Jackman pops up, too, crooning in Chinese. This is new territory for everyone. Fighting for a clear vantage point on history, its parallels are often clumsy. At one point, the slogan &quot;No binding&quot; appears on the wall at a trendy gallery opening, a facile comment on the foot mutilation in the other storyline. If it defaults to bland humanism, then that&apos;s about as pushy as it&apos;s currently possible to be under China&apos;s censorship regulations. Wang was only asked to tone down a scene in which a teenage Snow Flower and Lily were painting nu shu ideograms on each other&apos;s naked bodies. &quot;Girl-on-girl action&quot;, as See puts it, definitely isn&apos;t on the approved list. Others have gone through more protracted wrangles when treading on historical ground. Ang Lee spent days negotiating a reported 30 minutes of cuts down to seven for his 2007 espionage film Lust, Caution; in the process it became, according to producer, James Schamus, &quot;probably the most written-about piece of culture in decades in the Chinese world&quot;. Most of the coverage thigh-rubbed over the graphic nature of the offending sex scenes, but isn&apos;t it just as likely that the transgressive nature of the plot \u2013 a love affair between an undercover Chinese nationalist and a Japanese collaborator \u2013 was disturbing at some fundamental level for the government? Lee is pioneering because, with Lust, Caution and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, he has been a outsider, from the diaspora, opening up Chinese history and identity to fresh interpretations. Snow Fan and future co-productions have the same potential. As China seeks to promote its culture and outsources the process to people like IDG, Wendi Murdoch and Wayne Wang, it&apos;s inevitable that it will have to be more flexible. The international arthouse picture will continue to pose its well-spoken inquiries about Chinese history, and new, more challenging material will open up for the big crowdpleasers to tackle. It might be a while before CFG put out a Tiananmen or Tibet action epic, but the Communist party aren&apos;t always as dogmatic on historical matters as is sometimes suggested, especially when money is involved. It was they who resurrected study of nu shu when it was on the verge of extinction in the 1980s, though in a purely academic way removed from its original subversive purpose \u2013 &quot;like you might learn to make a basket, as a folk handicraft&quot;, says See. I was reminded of this rigid neutrality when I watched The Founding of a Republic, another CFG-approved epic, recently. For a film there to add a new glaze of embalming fluid to Mao&apos;s reputation, it spent a surprising amount of time on the deposed nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Neutral is a step on, of a kind, from partisan. Governments are always significant movers in the laborious process all modernising nations have to go through \u2013 working out where you stand in relation to the past and creating a story for the nation. Cinema, through Hollywood myth-making, was key for the US, and the same could be true for China. A curiously conservative undercurrent comes through in Snow Flower&apos;s final minutes, as Li Bingbing&apos;s businesswoman uncovers the full story contained in the fan and realises it is the key to salvaging her own friendship. Is Wang, at the same time as upholding female independence, also suggesting that only by honouring the bonds of laotong \u2013 and adhering to old ways \u2013 will life in the present have meaning? This is a breath away from old-school, respectful Chinese Confucianism. I ask Wang, via Lisa See, about this. He confirms that &quot;he wanted to offer that as a lesson, in the sense that people in China should have respect for and learn from the past \u2013 as a criticism that aren&apos;t doing that&quot;. He also says that he feels awkward talking about these ideas, as if the modern indie director and the Chinese traditionalist are at odds. But when your history is this big, it shouldn&apos;t be a surprise when there&apos;s more than one story. \u2022 What global box-office stories should we be writing about?

And in Paris on Wednesday, Novak Djokovic, one of the game&apos;s great jokers, pulled off a passable impression of a fit professional athlete who has terrorised his peers for a year, when he beat Ivan Dodig without discomfort or drama in two routine sets. Later, he shrugged and joked his way through a light inquisition about his suspect right shoulder, dodging the issue of whether or not the BNP Paribas Masters is getting the best of him this week. Does a 6-4, 6-3 win in an hour and a half settle the conundrum of the world No1&apos;s fitness? Not at all. While Djokovic started stiffly, especially on his serve, and was moving freely at the end, Dodig did not stretch him sufficiently to tell us much about the quality of Djokovic&apos;s tennis under sustained pressure. If Djokovic wins in Paris, he will probably start favourite for the World Tour Finals, which start in Greenwich on 20 November, but he is a way short of the trophy yet. He meets Viktor Troicki in the third round on Thursday, and, although his old friend should provide a stiffer examination than Dodig did, Djokovic is still playing cat-and-mouse with the media about his injuries. &quot;I feel good,&quot; he told Sky from courtside. &quot;I didn&apos;t know what to expect. I finished in Basel and wasn&apos;t really confident I would compete this week. I had a couple of days off and then arrived here yesterday, had a short hit. &quot;I know I didn&apos;t play at the top of my game but the pain is not so strong, so I can compete. My dedication to the sport hasn&apos;t changed.&quot; When complimented on picking up a $1.6m (\u00a31m) bonus for fulfilling his obligation to play in the seventh of the eight Masters, Djokovic smiled, nodded and uttered a gnomic &quot;hmm&quot;. Djokovic has clearly thought this through. Had he played in the Shanghai Masters as well as this final Masters tournament of the season, he would have automatically collected $2m. Had he played in only six of them, there would not have been an extra cent. So, when he withdrew from Shanghai and struggled in Basel, the dilemma was obvious. He had to play in Paris, injured or not. Djokovic came to Paris for the money, of that there can be little doubt. After all, if he had been blown away by Dodig he would still pick up his money. Yet last week, he said his priority was Greenwich. It is inconceivable he would risk aggravating problems he has had with his shoulder, at least since August, and latterly his back, unless he had to. So we might safely assume he will retire at the first hint of a recurrence \u2013 which he did in Cincinnati against Andy Murray. All of a sudden, Djokovic looks less like the man who flirted with invincibility for most of the year and more like a cynic prepared to milk a flawed system. Bonus is such a benign term for the free money rewarded to the world&apos;s best players for merely turning up. Some may call it bribery. Certainly it has influenced Djokovic&apos;s strategy towards the end of a long season, one in which the leading players have complained about overload. Parisian fans could not complain, though. Sandwiched between Andy Murray and Roger Federer, Djokovic provided a quality main course at the Bercy, a cavernous venue that feels more suited to housing getaway vans than a major tennis tournament. Dodig has played some good tennis this year \u2013 he took a set off Djokovic in the Australian Open, beat Robin Soderling before losing to Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals of Barcelona, then beat the Spaniard in Montreal \u2013 but he is not known for his consistency. At 26, he has been around long enough to sense a wounded foe, yet he did not have the wit, composure or armoury to pull off an upset. Rarely did he go after Djokovic&apos;s pop-gun second serve early in the first set; only occasionally did he test his running forehand, the shot that has given the Serb&apos;s shoulder most grief in 2011. &quot;I&apos;m here to win,&quot; Federer said after his quick victory over the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. &quot;If you use a tournament as a stepping stone to another tournament, that&apos;s wrong.&quot; Did Djokovic put his foot on a stepping stone?

For the UK and many other nations it is, of course, Remembrance Day, the occasion of silence to commemorate the dead of all wars.

Very soon it will be (in the UK) 11.11am on that date.  Fans of palindromes or numerology (or, if you&apos;re more sceptical, those experiencing apophenia, the phenomenon of seeing non-existent patterns or significance in meaningless data) are understandably excited.  My colleagues, Hannah Waldram and Laura Oliver, have already compiled an exhaustive list of the various non-Remembrance signifiers of the date, from The Date That Most Resembles Corduroy \u2013 I should mention here that I&apos;m wearing some corduroy trousers myself today \u2013 to Nigel Tufnel Day. But in the non-internet world, pretty much the only thing taking place is weddings. Lots of them. This is particularly the case in East Asia, where numerology is more commonly followed. The AFP news agency has put together a rundown of wedding fever across Asia, including 5,000 weddings in Shanghai alone. I didn&apos;t realise this, but apparently in recent years 11 November has been regarded in China as &quot;singles&apos; day&quot; anyway because it is made up entirely of ones, thus making it a good date anyway to shed that status. There have also been a number of mass weddings, including in the Philippines (see photo at the top) and Vietnam.  And if there&apos;s wedding fever going on, Las Vegas will feature. According to the Las Vegas Sun newspaper, the Chapel of the Flowers is running 15 hours of back-to-back weddings in its three chapels from 8am to 11.11pm. Meanwhile the Viva Las Vegas wedding chapel has 200 bookings, four times the norm, according to another report. And while births can&apos;t be similarly planned \u2013 although South Korea officials had to deny that some couples were deliberately planning caesarians for the date \u2013 in some countries it is also seen as a very auspicious birth date. Here&apos;s some new babies born in Jammu, the winter capital of Kashmir:     Photograph: Jaipal Singh/EPA    Even the UK is not immune, with the Press Association reporting a higher number of weddings than would normally be expected. The agency has even better news \u2013 if only is was believable \u2013 from a numerologist. According to Sonia Ducie, from the Connaissance School of Numerology in Hertfordshire, this is not just a good day to get hitched, but a good day to solve the euro crisis:  Eleven is the number for inspiration and passion. It&apos;s an aspirational number which has extremely uplifting energy. 11 November 2011 is a reference point to remind us that we are all one world and we are here to help each other. I think the 11th is a very good day for negotiation and making peace. Great things could happen in Europe, creating more stability.  1pm update Here in the UK we&apos;re now past the momentous 11.11am moment, and it&apos;s time for a brief update on single-digit-date-related events around the world. Most significantly \u2013 OK, the only event of any remote significance so far \u2013 is the decision by Egypt&apos;s antiquities authority to close the pyramid of Cheops &quot;following rumours that groups would try to hold spiritual ceremonies on the site&quot; at 11.11am. Clearly, no such events happened. Other than that, just a couple more wedding-related pics.

It&apos;s taken time to get used to western food, and day-to-day communication is harder; even requesting goods in a convenience store can be a struggle.

The education system &quot;makes my son happy every day&quot;, she said, by encouraging personal development, in contrast to Chinese schools&apos; rigid focus on grades. And the family no longer fret about the safety of their food. Wang&apos;s choice is part of a much broader trend: China&apos;s rich appear to be increasingly keen to go west. Almost half of China&apos;s millionaires are considering moving abroad, according to a survey released recently by Hurun \u2013 best known for publishing a Chinese rich list \u2013 and the Bank of China. The report found that 46% of the 980 people surveyed had thought about emigrating; 14% had done so already or applied to do so. Most wanted a better education for their children. The findings chimed with research by China Merchants Bank and consultants Bain this spring which suggested that more than a quarter of those with more than 100m yuan (about \u00a310m) had moved abroad and almost half were considering it. Many sought immigrant investor status, which grants residence rights to those making large investments. &quot;After establishing a decent economic foundation, of course people tend to move to places where a better quality of life is available,&quot; Wang said. Businessman Eric Wen, whose family are considering a move from Shanghai to the US or Canada, agreed: &quot;The biggest motivation is life quality and education for my children. The environment, especially air quality, is much better in these countries,&quot; he said. But Wang acknowledged there was another motive, too: &quot;My husband was worried that China would suffer political turmoil some day and it is safer here.&quot; That instinct \u2013 and the resentment that rich people can attract \u2013 makes the subject of emigration sensitive for many. Wang asked that her Chinese name, and her new home, should not be disclosed. Rupert Hoogewerf, of Hurun, acknowledged that some were nervous about stability, particularly before the transition of power to a new generation of leaders next year. But he suggested that people seemed to be seeking an &quot;insurance policy&quot;, pointing out that few of the Chinese wealthy wanted to trade in their passports. While some think another nationality may help protect &quot;ill-gotten&quot; wealth, most seek residency rights. &quot;There is concern about social and economic and potentially political unrest \u2013 but the growth far outweighs the potential risk. This is the fastest-growing economy [they could work in] \u2026 and this is the place they know best,&quot; Hoogewerf said. A US-based business development consultant said they were investing initially, with a long-term idea of moving \u2013 &quot;first their children in many cases, then their wives, then themselves&quot;. He said the number of Chinese clients inquiring about emigration had surged. &quot;A year ago I would have these conversations once a month. Now it&apos;s dozens of times.&quot; Although education was the big issue, &quot;they are not sure what&apos;s going to happen with 2012 coming up and the party leadership in question \u2026 It&apos;s the possibility all hell might break loose.&quot; As he pointed out, maintaining a lavish lifestyle can prove unexpectedly costly outside China. But while drivers or maids may be a good deal more expensive than at home, that is not an issue for the super-wealthy. One of his clients recently bought a $6.2m mansion in California for his son to live in, snapping up a yacht at the same time so the young man could make use of the property&apos;s private dock. Such indulgences are poorly received by China&apos;s less privileged citizens. Xia Xueluan, a sociology professor at Peking University, told the People&apos;s Daily website that rich people had benefited from the hard work of many others in China and should not move overseas with their assets. &quot;In comparison to the behaviour of \u2026 patriotic Chinese overseas during the anti-Japanese war, the rich people are carrying money away in the good times, which makes them [morally] small,&quot; he said. Others argued it was pointless to expect better of the wealthy. Fan Zijun, a critic and writer, said that although ideally all citizens should show civic awareness and a sense of responsibility to China, it was &quot;childlike, even naive&quot; to expect them to do so. &quot;If rich people really had such high consciousness and self-discipline, would the wealth gap, social equality and other issues have become the great problem that perplexes us now?&quot; Additional research by Han Cheng ", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "US news", "Migration and development", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-11T19:01:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/11/11-11-11-marriage", "sentences": ["In Shanghai there were almost 5,000 marriage services, while around 300 ethnic Chinese couples gathered for a mass service near Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia."], "title": "11 + 11 + 11 = 2", "article": "For some it marked a peculiarly auspicious time to begin a lifetime of marriage; for others it was simply the perfect excuse to don a wardrobe&apos;s-worth of corduroy. Whatever its significance, for many people worldwide, a date reading 11-11-11 was just too good an opportunity to miss. This was particularly the case in numerology-obsessed east Asia, which witnessed a rash of weddings. In Shanghai there were almost 5,000 marriage services, while around 300 ethnic Chinese couples gathered for a mass service near Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Vietnam&apos;s commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City, meanwhile, saw 80 couples celebrate together. In recent years 11 November has become known around China as &quot;singles&apos; day&quot;, with the numeral one supposedly representing &quot;bare sticks&quot;, a term for the country&apos;s numerous bachelors. The once-a-century occurrence of six ones in one date was thus seen as an ideal occasion to end this status. If that weren&apos;t enough, adding up all the numbers in the full version of the date \u2013 six ones and a two \u2013 made eight, a number traditionally associated with wealth. On the other side of the world the self-proclaimed marriage capital of Las Vegas was not about to be outdone. The Viva Las Vegas wedding chapels reportedly boasted 200 bookings, four times the daily average. Another enterprise, the Chapel of the Flowers, was running 15 hours of back-to-back weddings in its three chapels, ending at 11.11pm. In Britain 53 couples \u2013 51 weddings and two civil partnerships \u2013 tied the knot at the traditional wedding destination of Gretna Green, on the border of England and Scotland. In some countries the date was also considered auspicious for a birth. Health officials in South Korea were obliged to deny reports of a rush for caesarean sections. The reported reason for this was in part to give offspring an auspicious start to their 13-digit national ID number, which begins with the six numbers of the birth date. Elsewhere, the reasons for marking the date became progressively more arcane. The US-based corduroy appreciation club, which venerates every 11 November as the date that best represents their fabric of choice, was understandably excited, encouraging aficionados to don at least three items made from the material for their meetings. Meanwhile, numerologists not based in Asia were enjoying their moment in the sun. Sonia Ducie, from the Connaissance School of Numerology in Royston, Hertfordshire, had earlier described the date as &quot;a very good day for negotiation and making peace&quot;. She had added: &quot;Great things could happen in Europe, creating more stability.&quot; Sure enough, austerity measures moved along in Greece and Italy and stock markets rose.

Audi took third and fourth place, with the top four cars separated by only seven-tenths of a second. Before the session began, race organisers the Automobile Club de l&apos;Ouest announced the full schedule for next season&apos;s FIA World Endurance Championship, which will replace the ILMC in 2012. Peugeot, who won this race last year, had taken the top two spots in all three practice sessions here at the Zhuhai circuit and appeared justly confident of their short-run qualifying pace. All four of the main prototype contenders went out soon after the pit lane opened with St\u00e9phane Sarrazin in the No8 Peugeot quickly setting the pace. Tom Kristensen, in the No2 Audi he shares with Allan McNish, pushed hard but was bumped into third by Davidson, while the No1 Audi of Marcel F\u00e4ssler and Timo Bernhard, with the former taking the wheel for qualifying, held fourth. Choosing to run only one stint of six laps each to preserve tyres for the race, the order remained unchanged until Davidson put in another quick lap towards the end to take pole with a time of 1min 21.760sec, 0.075sec ahead of Sarrazin. Kristensen was just under 0.3sec back, with F\u00e4ssler completing the top four, 0.769sec off the lead. Peugeot held the front row but Audi appeared happy with their pace, expecting to be competitive over long runs. Davidson admitted he had struggled to secure first place on the grid. &quot;It was a great day today qualifying on pole,&quot; he said. &quot;A great challenge from my team-mate. St\u00e9phane did a really awesome job \u2013 pushed me hard \u2013 and I had to really fight to get back ahead of him because he held pole position for a while.&quot; However, as the short qualifying stint suggested, the British driver acknowledged that tyre wear and full-stint pace will be crucial for the race on Sunday. &quot;We&apos;ve seen pretty much all weekend so far we&apos;ve had good pace in first-lap performance,&quot; he said. &quot;And we can see that the competition is slightly closer when it comes to race pace and looking after the tyres and that will be a big thing tomorrow so it should be a good fight.&quot; Kristensen, too, was happy with the performance of the Audi, which has shown quicker race-pace than qualifying all season. &quot;To be two, two-and-a-half tenths off pole suggests we have more potential for the race, because we are always stronger in the race than we are in qualifying,&quot; he said. &quot;Both Allan and I like the car,&quot; he continued. &quot;We have done good race simulations, we look quite good. On Friday [practice] it was cool, overcast and I would say we were quite equal to Peugeot if not better but we start behind them, so we have to get past them first.&quot; That may be crucial. There are good overtaking areas on this short 2.68mile circuit, but drivers will have to watch tyre wear while doing so with several tight turns, where putting the power down on exit too early could prove detrimental for long runs. Cooler temperatures and even the possibility of rain may yet play a part on Sunday. In 2011 only five seconds separated the two rivals after six hours; barring accidents a similar result is easily possible this year. Davidson warned: &quot;Every race we&apos;ve done this year, the battle between Peugeot and Audi has been quite intense and I can&apos;t see any reason that&apos;s not going to continue on into this race tomorrow.&quot; Before the qualifying session began, the ACO announced the full eight-race schedule for the new FIA World Endurance Championship, the first sports car world championship to be held since 1992, which will take over from the ILMC. Beginning at Sebring in the US, the season will retain rounds at Silverstone, Spa and, of course, Le Mans, as well as ensuring the competition becomes truly global with races in Japan, Brazil, Bahrain and China. However, the addition of the new circuits means Road Atlanta in the US will no longer form part of the season.

At 10.30am, uniformed guards stem a swarm of hopefuls trying to enter the main hall where people crane at the boards and scribble in notebooks. Outside, red velvet-lined tables are privy to a mass speed dating event. In the church square, unofficial match\u2013making markets have sprung up, with pieces of paper scrawled with telephone numbers attached to fences. Thousands of singletons gathered at the expo at the weekend, an event so popular that organisers halted online registration after double the expected number signed up. Estimates of those attending ranged from 10,000 to 40,000. Timed to coincide with Singles&apos; Day, an annual commemoration for those looking for love on 11 November (the &quot;ones&quot; in the numerical date represent &quot;bare sticks&quot;, a term for &quot;bachelors&quot;), this year&apos;s date was all the more auspicious because six &quot;ones&quot; in Mandarin sounds like the idiom &quot;one life, one lifetime&quot; or &quot;forever&quot;. In downtown Shanghai, 24.3% of people over the age of 15 are unmarried, a rise of 1.6%, according to the Shanghai municipal statistics bureau. In far-flung areas, the figures are even more startling: just 11.9% of over 15s are unmarried in Chongming county. A lack of young women \u2013 a result of the skewed rate of baby boys born under China&apos;s one-child policy \u2013 means an estimated 30 to 50 million men will be without a wife in 20 years. But Damon Tu, 35, isn&apos;t giving up hope yet. &quot;I feel a lot of pressure because I&apos;m not married, but I&apos;m a traditional guy so I believe one day I&apos;ll find the love of my life,&quot; says the media advertising sales manager from Shanghai. Dressed in skinny jeans and a blazer, Tu browses the booths of about 50 matchmaking companies in the town hall. Red glitter and pink balloons abound. Wet Wet Wet&apos;s Love Is All Around blasts from speakers. &quot;Meeting new people is easy, but finding someone to marry is complicated,&quot; he says. &quot;Girls want to better their standard of living by finding someone who is rich, well-educated and has a well-paid job and a car.&quot; On the thousands of cards lining eight-foot billboards throughout the hall, details of hopefuls&apos; height, birth date and education are accompanied by annual income. &quot;The standards people require of a partner have changed with modern dating; the importance placed on material factors is increasing,&quot; says Zhai Zhenwu, vice director of the school of sociology and population studies at Renmin University in Beijing. &quot;An apartment is now commonly required to broker a marriage. If a man doesn&apos;t own an apartment, it&apos;s an obstacle for him, even if he loves his girlfriend very much.&quot; For those in their late 20s and early 30s, there is also pressure to produce an heir and many of the singletons are accompanied by their parents. &quot;My father is very worried because, as I&apos;m 29, soon it might be difficult for me to get pregnant,&quot; says Huang Yushu, a translator for a manufacturing company. &quot;Last year I was really anxious about not being able to get married. I go from resigned to anxious ridden, back to resigned. My dad wanted me to come here just to try it out. I&apos;ve already tried matchmaking websites. Dad pays the fees.&quot; Strikingly, in the town hall the number of singletons around the blue cards is double those scanning the pink. When it comes to the male-to-female singleton ratio, Shanghai is beginning to buck the national trend. Here the number of older single women (30-44) outstrips older single men, according to the Shanghai bureau of statistics. Between 2000-2010, the number of older unmarried men dropped by 2.2% while that of older unmarried women increased by 3.2%. &quot;The problem is all the good candidates are already married,&quot; says Haung. &quot;Women like me aged 28-35 are in the &apos;awkward stage&apos;.&quot; Huang says men prefer younger women who are &quot;less capable&quot; than herself, something backed by a survey of 30,000 men conducted by the All-China Women&apos;s Federation in which 90% said women should marry before 27.Single women over 27 are known as sheng nu, or &quot;leftovers&quot;. &quot;In Chinese society, women prefer to marry men who are older, wealthier and more capable; men prefer the opposite,&quot; says Zhai. &quot;So in cities, those left behind are seen as the &apos;best women and worst men&apos; [highflying women; underachieving men].&quot; Huang leaves the expo alone. She says she recently met a man online, but doesn&apos;t hold much hope. &quot;There&apos;s a belief that if you pick the wrong person, you will be wronged for life.

The Scot, who recently moved past Roger Federer to No3 in the world, could hardly be lining up the world No1 at a better time. And the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich, south-east London, is a place where Murray feels most comfortable: indoors on a hard court. Tomas Berdych, who beat Murray in a tough quarter-final of the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris last week, is in the same round-robin group, along with the hard-to-beat Spaniard David Ferrer \u2013 Murray&apos;s opponent in his first match on Monday. Murray said: &quot;There are obviously no easy matches as it&apos;s only the top eight players in the world playing. That&apos;s what is so unique about this tournament. You have to be on top of your game from the very first match. I&apos;ve been happy with my form. I&apos;ve got some great memories from my run to the semi-finals last year; hopefully I can go even further this time round.&quot; Sifting through these draws is always an exercise in clutching at straws, given the quality of tennis at the highest level, but Murray, Ferrer and Berdych will be happy to catch Djokovic at his most vulnerable. The Serb quit in the second set of the final of the Cincinnati Masters against Murray and even struggled en\u00a0route to winning the US\u00a0Open against Rafael Nadal in September. He pulled out after two rounds in Paris last week with what he described as an inflamed right shoulder, but which has been troubling him more than he likes to admit for three months. He faces Berdych first up on Monday evening. Group\u00a0B has Nadal, whose uncharacteristic quietness must have his peers on edge, Federer (on a run of fine form after a rest and back to a smooth peak after winning in Paris), Jo\u2011Wilfried Tsonga and the American Mardy Fish, who limped out of his past two tournaments injured and must be considered doubtful \u2013 the rising Serb Janko Tipsarevic is standing by. Fish is scheduled to face Nadal on Sunday evening. Tsonga, who will play Federer on Sunday afternoon, said: &quot;Obviously it couldn&apos;t be an easy draw but it&apos;s a very good group for me. I&apos;ll be playing against Roger once again. I&apos;ll play Rafa on a surface that suits me really well and I&apos;ll be expecting to beat Mardy Fish. Having played there three years ago will help me, because I won&apos;t be looking around telling myself: &apos;Oh, it&apos;s great to be here.&apos; I&apos;m not going there just to participate.&quot; Three titles on the spin in Asia and 18 consecutive match wins gave Murray hope of winning in Paris too, until Berdych beat him in a three-hour classic. The upside of that is it somewhat relieved the pressure on the Scot coming to London. So, the parameters have shifted again. A year ago at this tournament, Federer and Nadal were favourites; the Swiss beat the Spaniard in the final and all seemed as it should be. However, Nadal, then No1, went into the final after the most electric semi-final against Murray, probably the best three-set match of the year. The subsequent power shifts have lent tennis the uncertainty it needed after years of the Federer-Nadal duopoly; now Murray finds himself in the mix again, and he is playing his best since that semi-final against Nadal. The Scot has won five tour titles in 2011 \u2013 Queen&apos;s, Cincinnati, Bangkok, Tokyo and Shanghai.

For the price of a good glass of wine, you get the whole white tablecloth treatment, top service, a beautiful setting, the town&apos;s prettiest patio and a choice of nine appetisers, six mains, and three non-fattening desserts. You&apos;ll be tempted by the crab cake or tuna burger, but don&apos;t miss the whole lavrakia (sea bass). A martini glass of Greek yogurt with honey makes the perfect ending.\u2022 In the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino, 3708 Las Vegas Boulevard South, +1 702 698 7930, estiatoriomilos.com, average lunch price $20.11.

UK universities once served as models for their poorer colonial cousins, but now they embrace their values and methods in the hope of attracting some of the accolades routinely showered on winners in the international race for academic pre-eminence. The UK and US so dominate the Shanghai Jiao Tong ranking that other European universities are not present at all among the top 40. Only five Asian schools \u2013 all Japanese \u2013 are ranked among the 100 best. The dimensions of prestige are plain for all to see in the selection criteria. International prizes, journal citations, and influence on the world stage: these are the goals to which the academy strives. Small wonder then that the world&apos;s academic leaders, searching for the secret of attaining this kind of success, look to US research universities, because it is the modern research university that defines the academic enterprise for the rest of the world. Therein looms a disaster for the UK and its 300 colleges and universities. When Barack Obama and David Cameron get together to talk about the potential for US-UK collaboration in higher education, they are talking about cutting edge laboratories, scientific societies, thinktanks and the potential for the next great Silicon Valley idea. You can be assured that they are not proposing the cost structure of American higher education as a model for Britain, because in the US the cost of a college education has risen at four times the general rate of consumer price increases. This cost is increasingly carried on the shoulders of families whose collective student loans surpass credit cards as the major source of consumer debt. You can also be assured that nobody is suggesting US college completion rates \u2013 which would feature last among developed nations but for Italy \u2013 as a model to be copied by the UK, which graduates among the highest percentage of its enrolled students. Nor are they talking about an enormous disconnect between the public&apos;s perception of higher education \u2013 more than 50% of the US public thinks colleges and universities are doing a fair to poor job \u2013 and how the institutions see themselves. Nearly 70% of US college presidents believe that they are doing a good to excellent job. It is not evident in the Times Higher Education or Shanghai Jiao Tong rankings, but there is reason to be concerned about the course of higher education in the US. While the business of world-class academic research sails through relatively unaffected by global economic calamity, the business of educating the millions of enrolled students is poised for a disastrous collapse. British universities have already picked up some bad habits. The Higher Education Statistics Agency reports alarming rates of unemployment among British graduates. It seems to me that grade inflation \u2013 the process by which two-thirds of US students end up earning top grades \u2013 is now also rampant in the UK, which has seen a 34% increase in top-level degrees. Like their US counterparts, British universities of all kinds see research and intellectual property as a path to prominence. The resulting strain on funding can only be relieved by siphoning academic funds to expand institutional ambitions. American universities have lost focus on their value, and British universities, in an attempt to play an expensive, rigged game, seem to be willing to follow suit. It is a game that few institutions can win. My book, Abelard to Apple: the Fate of American Colleges and Universities, is an essay about value. Universities do not like to dwell on their value. There are many who try to cast any such discussion as the opening volley of a holy war between true academicians and infidels who would sacrifice noble pursuits for economic gain. It has been a contentious subject for a long time. &quot;Of what value is a university?&quot; is a question that consumed people such as John Henry Cardinal Newman whose 1850 valedictory posed the famous dialectic: &quot;When a university has been doing useless things for a long time, it appears at first degrading to them to be useful.&quot; Is the value of a university&apos;s very existence self-evident, or must it be held accountable, along with other human endeavours? And if it is accountable for its performance, who is it accountable to and what are the dimensions of success or failure? Abelard to Apple proposes answers to some of these questions, and they all start with abandoning the grotesquely expensive, needlessly competitive race to be ranked according to arbitrary, externally imposed criteria that have virtually nothing to do with educating the many millions of students who flood our colleges and universities in ever increasing numbers. It may ruin higher education in America and it is a model that others should avoid.

When authorities handed him a \u00a31.5m tax bill, they sent money to help pay it. And now that he faces an investigation for spreading pornography \u2013 his admirers have stripped off. Internet users began tweeting their nude photographs after Ai announced that authorities had questioned his cameraman over pictures which showed the artist and four women naked. Many Chinese contemporary artists have taken pictures of themselves without clothes, and the pictures of Ai that have emerged so far do not appear sexually charged. Some suspect that it may be an attempt by the authorities to smear the artist, whose 81-day detention this spring caused international outrage. Officials accused him of economic crimes but supporters say the authorities are engaged in a vendetta because of Ai&apos;s social and political activism and criticism of the government. While a couple of internet users tweeted full-frontal shots, others have come up with more decorous \u2013 and ingenious \u2013 variations on the theme. Some posted pictures of themselves as babies; one photo shows a row of nine unclothed women and one man \u2013 with images of Ai&apos;s head superimposed over their genitals and nipples. Li Tiantian, a Shanghai lawyer who was herself detained earlier this year, appears partially concealed by a picture of a &quot;grass mud horse&quot;, a creature invented by internet users to mock censors; its name is a homonym for a graphic curse. &quot;It is an expression of support for Ai Weiwei and scorn to the Chinese government. It shows our attitude and anger towards the government&apos;s behaviour,&quot; she said. &quot;We are simply using an eyecatching way to attract people&apos;s attention. There are so many pornography websites in China: they don&apos;t regulate them, yet say that this is spreading pornography.&quot; Wen Yunchao, a blogger in Hong Kong who posted two nude photographs of himself, told Reuters: &quot;This is a matter that has made many people very indignant. The interpretation of people&apos;s naked bodies in itself is an individual freedom and a form of creative freedom. Also, we don&apos;t see any pornographic elements in [Ai&apos;s] photographs. So we are using this extreme method to express our protest.&quot; Zhao Zhao, the videographer who took the original pictures of Ai last year, told Reuters that Beijing police interrogated him about them for about four hours, telling him the photographs were obscene. Ai told the news agency that police had also questioned him about the pictures. He said they did not have a hidden political meaning and were not meant to criticise the government, but noted that authorities might nonetheless see them as a &quot;rebellious act&quot;. Separately, the artist has encouraged supporters to call bloggers and commentators he described as leaders of the &quot;50 cent&quot; \u2013 pro-government \u2013 internet users, tweeting their phone numbers. One of them, Wang Wen, told the Guardian he had received between 100 and 200 calls and innumerable messages since Sunday and that another man had received about 1,000 calls.

The &quot;exclusive&quot; that Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas is keen to sign the Bolton centre-back is also reported by pretty much every other national paper, was in the Express more than a month ago, on the back page of the People on 4 September and in both the Sun and the Evening Standard back in July. Bolton have already identified Cahill&apos;s replacement in the shape of Manchester City&apos;s Nedum Onuoha, though they will have to battle rival suitors Blackburn, QPR and West Brom for his services. The Telegraph links Chelsea once again with a move for Porto&apos;s left-sided Uruguayan ace Alvaro Pereira, but the future of Nicolas Anelka is less clear. The French forward is considered likely to leave the club, perhaps as early as January \u2013 sometimes, after all, you&apos;ve got to clear the decks \u2013 but Chinese outfit Shanghai Shenhua have admitted that they can&apos;t afford to sign him. &quot;There are so many clubs interested in him: Milan, Russian clubs and some Gulf clubs,&quot; a source told Shanghai newspaper DF Daily. &quot;If we want to sign him, it would cost plenty.&quot; The former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti&apos;s &quot;name is being mentioned&quot; in Arsenal&apos;s corridors of power as they ponder how to replace Ars\u00e8ne Wenger should the Frenchman leave sometime soon. The good news for everyone, though, is that he isn&apos;t going to. &quot;I have a few more years to go,&quot; Wenger said. &quot;I will stay and that&apos;s it.&quot; He might be joined at the Emirates by Dortmund&apos;s \u00a330m-rated 19-year-old wonderkid Mario G\u00f6tze, who was watched by not one but two Arsenal scouts as he scored the winner against Bayern Munich at the weekend. Another German on Wenger&apos;s watchlist is Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach&apos;s Patrick Herrmann, who is so manly his surname means &quot;man man&quot; in his native tongue, and who is also being monitored \u2013 or should that be manitored? \u2013 by Napoli. The Sun claims that Sven-Goran Eriksson is close to agreeing a move to Tehran club Persepolis. &quot;We are going to sign a big coach,&quot; claimed their general manager, Mohammad Ruyanian. &quot;We have negotiated with Sven-Goran Eriksson.&quot; Skipping over the question of whether anyone whose last two clubs were Notts County and Leicester genuinely qualifies as a &quot;big coach&quot;, in which case they might as well just go for Gary Johnson and be done with it, the newspaper considerately warns Sven to be aware of the implications of such a move. &quot;High-living Sven faces a drastic lifestyle change if he moves to Iran, run by ranting Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,&quot; they warn. &quot;Booze is banned and glam women like Sven&apos;s ex Nancy dell&apos;Ollio could be lashed for failing to wear a veil in public.&quot; In other news involving people who don&apos;t live here, Valencia&apos;s Turkish midfielder Mehmet Topal has declared that he fancies a move to England. &quot;I am happy at Valencia,&quot; said Topal, who first shot to international attention when he starred in the 1971 film Fiddler on the Roof, &quot;but there are teams interested in me and the Premier League is a step that I would like to make a reality.&quot; It&apos;s a similar story with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&apos;s Diego God\u00edn. &quot;I am at Atl\u00e9tico, but if there is interest from Chelsea it will be studied,&quot; he said. &quot;For the time being, there is nothing.&quot; Liverpool and Anzhi Makhachkala are both plotting a January move for Barcelona&apos;s Seydou Keita. Kenny Dalglish has also arranged a trial for Farjestaden&apos;s Swedish starlet Gustav Engvall, who at 15 years of age is less than half as old as Bar\u00e7a&apos;s Malian midfielder. Talking of promising youngsters, Manchester United are among the Premier League clubs monitoring Dulwich Hamlet&apos;s 17-year-old defensive prodigy Michael Chambers. &quot;Michael is a very talented and sensible boy,&quot; said his agent, the former Arsenal, Watford and Hemel Hempstead Town midfielder Paolo Vernazza. In other Manchester United news, Phil Jones has bought a \u00a3130,000 Aston Martin V12 Vantage. Finally, the story every football fan wanted to hear: Joey Barton is considering alternative careers. &quot;I know for a fact that if I set my mind to becoming a venture capitalist, a philanthropist, an anger management counsellor, or a Catholic priest, my mindset is such that if I want to prove people wrong then I am able to do that.

I understand that.&quot; There have in reality been no concerted calls for Chelsea to dismiss a fifth manager in four years, though the Portuguese&apos;s gallows humour revealed the paranoia that invariably grips this club and the fragility within his own setup as it endures early teething troubles. This team feels set-upon, almost beleaguered, at present. It was with apt if grim timing that the Football Association duly confirmed Villas-Boas had been warned as to his future conduct and fined \u00a312,000 for comments made about the referee Chris Foy after last month&apos;s defeat to QPR, just as he was preparing to take training at the BayArena on Tuesday night. The Portuguese intends to wait on written reasoning before deciding whether or not to appeal against that sanction, but the fighter in him is unlikely to back down. This campaign is becoming something of a slog. Throw in the continuing police and FA investigations into John Terry&apos;s conduct and recent domestic toils, with three defeats in four league games leaving Manchester City a dot on the horizon in the title race, and the underlying sense of anxiety feels understandable. Life has at least proved more comfortable in Group\u00a0E of the Champions League and victory at Bayer Leverkusen could secure a place in the knockout phase, though there is an acceptance that, for that to happen, improvement is urgently needed. The players appear to have recognised as much, with Florent Malouda seeking to shift the emphasis away from the management staff and on to an underachieving squad. &quot;Given how things have gone with different managers, I don&apos;t think the solution is about looking at the manager,&quot; he said. &quot;We are the ones going out on the pitch and performing, in a good or a bad way. We have all the ingredients at the club right now \u2013 the board, the technical staff, the manager and the players \u2013 to perform. We&apos;ve done it in the past. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to explain why it&apos;s gone wrong recently, but we were able to compete with the top teams at the start of the season. So there&apos;s no reason to panic. We have to take our responsibility on the pitch. Speaking personally, I need to step up my game more. It&apos;s not been enough, obviously. I&apos;ve never blamed a referee or a pitch or the weather to explain a bad performance. I need to do more and improve and I&apos;m fully aware of that. If I tried to explain what has been happening to us in a logical manner, people might think I&apos;m making excuses for losing. And I&apos;m not. I just want to win.&quot; Villas-Boas appears likely to juggle his options towards achieving that much on Wednesday night , though his staunch defence of David Luiz&apos;s defensive qualities suggested he could yet be tempted to retain the Brazilian in his back-line. The 24-year-old has featured in all the group games to date but has appeared error-prone too often for comfort. &quot;He&apos;ll evolve into one of the best central defenders in the world,&quot; said Villas-Boas, who likened David Luiz&apos;s development to that of Gerard Piqu\u00e9 since he swapped Manchester United for Barcelona. &quot;David is an extremely good player: he&apos;s quick, anticipates well, has amazing technical qualities.&quot; His justification for omitting Alex so often this term \u2013 the 29-year-old has played three times in the Premier League \u2013 was more baffling. &quot;We have chosen him in a couple of games, specific games or matches that have a different nature, but we have full trust in his abilities as a player,&quot; said the manager. Another who has been underused, Nicolas Anelka, was left back at home and is set to leave the club in January as he enters the final six months of his contract. Shanghai Shenhua are the latest team to have declared an interest in the Frenchman, joining clubs in Major League Soccer as suitors, though others, such as Milan, could tempt him to remain in Europe. Yet, while there may be a sense of relief at confronting European competition again given domestic travails, an awkward evening awaits. Leverkusen were no pushovers at Stamford Bridge in September and have improved since, winning their two home games to date and rising to seventh in the Bundesliga. A real test awaits at the BayArena, with the locals spying their own route into the knockout stage. &quot;But the finances in England are completely different to over here, and Chelsea have a &apos;world&apos; squad,&quot; said the coach, Robin Dutt. &quot;We have to beat the money. &quot;We have home advantage now but don&apos;t forget we put in a good performance in London. We remember that, and we know that Chelsea haven&apos;t been doing very well recently. They&apos;ve dropped points. We have respect for their players, but they&apos;re under a certain pressure and I believe my lads can do it in this game. We know it&apos;s important for this club in terms of the finances to progress, but also for the players. It&apos;s one thing to play in the group stage, but another to get through to the knockout. We see this a special opportunity, at home, to get into the last 16.&quot; Chelsea will consider it a chance to get back on track.", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Bayer Leverkusen", "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas", "Champions League 2011-12", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-22T20:40:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/23/1", "sentences": ["Nicolas Anelka will hope to skip straight to the money should he press ahead with a reported move to Shanghai Shenhua."], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Milos Krasic to Chelsea?", "article": "January is a dreary month.

What about the inimitable sense of warmth and joy to be derived from the sight of a complete stranger losing their footing on an icy pavement while you sit inside sipping a cocoa? Wait, what&apos;s that? He only actually meant nothing can happen with regards to Arsenal&apos;s interest in teenage defence-deceiver Mario G\u00f6tze? Well yes, we knew that already. One player who could be on the move in January, of course, is David Beckham \u2013 who has now told reporters that &quot;a couple of big European clubs are after me&quot;. Even as the Mill types this sentence, Sky Sports News&apos;s Gary Cotterill is setting up base camp outside Mahiki. But wait, what&apos;s this, in Gazzetta dello Sport? Becks says England is not a likely destination. &quot;I&apos;ve said it many times,&quot; he warbles. &quot;[In England] I would struggle to wear a shirt other than that of Manchester United.&quot; That may come as some disappointment to Tottenham, where manager Henry James Redknapp had become so enamoured with the idea of having Becks around that he had already begun negotiations to transfer his own son out of their weekly Nintendo Wii club. Instead he will have to console himself with flogging Jermain Defoe to Queens Park Rangers for \u00a310m. Becks, incidentally, reckons Redknapp should manage England anyway. Speaking of England managers, Sven and Tord&apos;s Excellent Adventure could be about to take another unlikely twist in the form of a move to Iran&apos;s Persepolis FC. There, they will travel back in time to a land called 4-4-2, meet some ancient babes, but finish up by learning some important life lessons. Or maybe just by collecting several large bags of cash.

Meanwhile, one or two Italian outlets have noted the Lille president Michel Seydoux&apos;s statement that Eden Hazard won&apos;t be sold to another French club and decided that Juventus themselves must be among the frontrunners.

It is crucial to marketing the city to visitors.

The company, owner of the Manchester Ship Canal and the Trafford Centre, has previously said it will not compromise any further on the scheme. Speaking during the inspection visit, Van Oers warned that Unesco&apos;s decision would have significant implications for cities around the world. &quot;The way that the world heritage committee will eventually rule about this case is going to be part of case law that is going to be used by the \u2026committee later on,&quot; he said. The committee will vote on its findings in June 2012. Liverpool&apos;s world heritage site officially stretches from Albert Dock, which has the largest collection of Grade I listed buildings in the UK, along the Pier Head and up to Stanley Dock. It takes in the elegant Edwardian &quot;three graces&quot;: the Royal Liver, Cunard and Port of Liverpool buildings, which have defined the view from the Mersey for almost a century. Dresden lost its world heritage site status two years ago after building a bridge over the river Elbe. Liverpool council&apos;s leader, Joe Anderson, said: &quot;I think we can reach a compromise, but Peel have already compromised. I think the scheme is a game changer. It&apos;s a catalyst for regeneration for years to come, that is how important it is.&quot; This year, an independent report commissioned by English Heritage warned the waterfront could lose its world heritage status because of the development plans. But Professor Michael Parkinson of Liverpool John Moores University said given a choice of no development in north Liverpool and losing the world heritage status, it was a no-brainer. &quot;Without doubt, it is a very good thing to have the world heritage status and I&apos;m sure it&apos;s helpful in sharpening the city&apos;s image,&quot; he said. &quot;But we cannot be preserved in aspic and we have to have development.&quot; In the past decade, the city centre and waterfront have developed beyond recognition. &quot;It is good to have world heritage status, but we must also have development, and investment in north Liverpool is tremendously important. But it would be a pity if the plaque on the waterfront was taken away.&quot; He praised the development on the waterfront with the Kings Dock, Arena and museum but said that north Liverpool &quot;is the nut we still have to crack&quot; in terms of development and economic growth. Tourism is worth \u00a33bn to the economy in Liverpool and 42,000 jobs depend on it. When visitors are asked why they come to Liverpool, many cite the world heritage and capital of culture designations. A spokesperson for Unesco refused to confirm the delegation&apos;s finding during the visit: &quot;We don&apos;t issue statements or discuss the finding of such missions as they are first presented to the world heritage committee.&quot;", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Unesco", "UK news", "Architecture", "Art and design", "World news", "Regeneration", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-23T17:36:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/24/football-transfer-rumours-kaka-chelsea", "sentences": ["And what does he make of the Sun rumours linking him with a transfer to up-and-coming Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua?"], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid's Kak\u00e1 on his way to Chelsea?", "article": "All that ballyhoo about poppies the other week seems to have convinced Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas that the surest way for him to become a hero is to transform himself into a Big Brave Fighting Man and so now, the Sun tells us, he&apos;s prepared to go to WAR, no less, with Harry Redknapp, which, come to think of it, doesn&apos;t sound all that brave really. Nonetheless, WAR it is. And not over a hill or a principle or a lack of imagination, but over Gary Cahill, if you don&apos;t mind.

Peninsula, one of Asia&apos;s most prestigious hotel chains, said on Monday it would no longer sell the dishes, considered a delicacy in Hong Kong and other parts of the region, &quot;in recognition of the threat facing the global shark population and in line with the company&apos;s sustainability vision&quot;. The move will affect the group&apos;s nine hotels, including those in China and Hong Kong, the center of the global shark fin market. Hong Kong handles between 50% and 80% of the global trade in shark fins, bringing in catches from more than 100 countries, with Spain its biggest supplier. In 2006 it took delivery of more than 10,000 tonnes worth US$276m, according to the UN food and agricultural organisation. Most is consumed in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but also in mainland provinces such as Guangdong, where its consumption has become a status symbol among China&apos;s nouveau riche. Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels, which owns the Peninsula group, said it would honour requests for shark fin soup made before 21 November, for consumption after 1 January. The dish, which comprises pieces of rehydrated shark fin in a rich broth, is a popular staple at wedding parties and formal banquets, with a serving for 12 people costing around US$138. In Hong Kong districts such as Sheung Wan, which specialises in dried seafood, premium shark fin can fetch up to US$1,280 per kilo. One Sheung Wan wholesaler recently told the Guardian, however, that the market price had dropped by about 20% in the past two months, partly as a result of the campaign. About 73 million sharks are killed every year, and the appetite for their fins in places such as Hong Kong has taken one in three shark species to the brink of extinction. &quot;By removing shark fin from our menus, we hope that our decision can contribute to preserving the marine ecosystem for the world&apos;s future generations,&quot; the Peninsula group&apos;s chief executive, Clement Kwok, said in a statement. &quot;As Asia&apos;s oldest hotel company, we also hope that our decision will inspire other hospitality companies to do the same.&quot; Other luxury hotel chains have attempted to reduce shark fin consumption by offering alternative menus for wedding banquets, sometimes with inducements such as a free night&apos;s accommodation for the newlyweds. The push to remove the delicacy \u2013 prized more for its glutinous texture than for its taste \u2013 has gathered momentum after a slow start, according to World Wildlife Fund, which has seen 97 caterers and hotels sign up to its alternative shark-free menu in the past year. A 2010 survey of eating habits by Bloom Association, a marine conservation group, found that despite the dish&apos;s central place in Cantonese cuisine, attitudes were shifting, particularly among younger people. According to Bloom, 66% of Hong Kong diners said they were uncomfortable with the idea of eating an endangered species, and more than three-quarters said they would not mind if it was removed from banquet menus. The Peninsula announcement came as the European commission called for a global ban on shark finning \u2013 the practice of cutting off a shark&apos;s fin and throwing its body back into the sea \u2013 by EU fishermen.

Red Bull won the constructors&apos; title in the next race. This has been another very exciting season in Formula One, with more overtaking manoeuvres (1,120 going into the Brazilian race on Sunday) than in any season in the 62-year history of the world championship thanks to DRS, Kers and fast-vanishing tyres. But it should have been more competitive. Don&apos;t blame Red Bull, who have now set the benchmark for the past two seasons. But McLaren finished a long way behind in second place. Then there was another big gap before Ferrari, another wide space before Mercedes and yet another one before the best of the midfielders, Renault. It is high time those slumbering giants Ferrari and Mercedes came to the party so the Big Four means exactly that. It was not good enough that Ferrari, the biggest team of the lot, did not understand their tyres or aero and were happy to copy Red Bull instead of coming up with their own ideas. Mercedes have been on a recruitment drive and should be stronger. Get Lewis Hamilton back to his best He is the most important driver in Formula One and it is up to McLaren, his family, his friends, his agent, his sometimes estranged girlfriend but most of all himself to ensure that he is back to his best next season. Is he the best? Most experts say that title belongs to Fernando Alonso. OK, Hamilton blew him away in his brilliant rookie year of 2007 but McLaren&apos;s egalitarian DNA never suited Alonso&apos;s matador spirit. Sebastian Vettel, too, may be a better all-round driver than Hamilton. But the very fast and aggressive Hamilton is pure box office. And Formula One needs him like no\u00a0one else. He made a number of bad decisions this year, on and off the track, and too often looked like one of JM\u00a0Barrie&apos;s Lost Boys. His mind appeared in turmoil for much of the time. He is most anxious to be a celebrity but the best way to ensure that is to concentrate on his driving and become world champion again. Make it younger Formula One&apos;s abiding image is of its 81-year-old ringmaster Bernie Ecclestone. Ecclestone has done an astonishing job to make F1 what it is but, as with Fifa&apos;s Sepp Blatter, it is time to move on. There are too many old men clinging on, and that applies to the drivers as much as anyone else. Rubens Barrichello (40 next year) may have had his last race but he is desperate to continue. Michael Schumacher will be 43 in January but, it seems, wants to drive on, Pedro de la Rosa, 42 in February, has just signed for HRT. The current fashion for pay drivers is also stifling young talent. At the front of the grid a shake\u2011up is badly needed. But that is unlikely to happen before 2013, by which time Felipe Massa, Mark Webber and Schumacher will surely have moved on. At least a number of lesser teams (Force India especially) are giving younger drivers a go before matters get serious on Sunday afternoon. Change qualifying Saturday qualifying, so compelling last year, has become a bit of a bore with too many teams conserving their tyres for race day and too many drivers making only one run. Sometimes there is hardly anyone out there. Some drivers argue that this is making qualifying tactically more intriguing but they are talking out of the top of their helmets. At least Pirelli&apos;s Paul Hembury is aware of the problem and is working on a bespoke qualifying tyre for next year. Pirelli&apos;s highly degradable tyres have been a major success this year but canny teams are already adapting to them so they need to be given fresh challenges next season. Pit stops have also become a little too slick. What about cutting down the 19 men who crowd round a car in the pits to four (as in Nascar) or two (as in GT Racing), put names on their backs and promote the rivalry between them? Address ticket prices Formula One is in danger of pricing itself out of the market. Prices change from venue to venue but overall they are far too high. That is why the crowds at Monza and S\u00e3o Paulo (two of the sport&apos;s greatest venues) were appallingly low for the Friday practice sessions. Prices must come down and youngsters should be admitted free, which is the case in many other sports, including a number of motorsport events. Some new venues, such as India, have been very successful but there must be a pyramid structure supporting the big event. The fans must be made to feel important and building new tracks outside the city centres (think Shanghai, Malaysia, Delhi, Barcelona and others) does not help much.", "tags": ["Formula One 2011", "Lewis Hamilton", "Sebastian Vettel", "Red Bull", "McLaren", "Ferrari", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-28T08:01:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/29/economic-hardship-longbridge-autumn-statement", "sentences": ["Earlier this year the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation began producing the new MG6 on the site, employing 400 people."], "title": "Economic hardship blights Longbridge where car industry once boomed", "article": "There&apos;s a huge sign outside the largely demolished Longbridge car plant, announcing: New Sainsbury&apos;s \u2013 Opening 2013. Six years after the collapse of MG Rover, diggers are gradually ploughing through 468 acres of land, cleaning the soil of decades of industrial pollutants, while developers and residents wait for new businesses to arrive. For the moment, Sainsbury&apos;s is the biggest brand to sign up, the most optimistic scheduled arrival on a redevelopment site that markets itself on becoming a hub of future employment. Longbridge is still seen as a potent symbol of Britain&apos;s manufacturing heartland, but billboards mainly advertise the acres of new retail spaces that will be created. By the end of next year there will be a lot of shops here, but it&apos;s not yet clear what other organisations will follow. As the man in charge of redevelopment explains, demand from other businesses is currently &quot;slim&quot;. Across the road, the new \u00a366m Bournville College has arrived, like a giant Lego spaceship deposited on the brown earth of the abandoned factory site. It is already educating 15,000 students, training a new skilled workforce for the area. Inside there is a palpable buzz of optimism among students enjoying the facilities of the college, which opened in September, but the mood is tempered by the knowledge that outside, employment opportunities for young people are scarcer than they have been for years. Longbridge&apos;s prospects depend on the speed with which growth returns and although no one here was watching the chancellor deliver his autumn statement, everyone recognises that the economy needs to improve if the site is to be transformed into the vibrant centre of opportunity depicted in the redevelopers&apos; brochures. Amy Moreton, 17, studying for a BTec in IT at the college, knows that there is still a risk that the town where she has grown up could go either way. Her father lost his job at the car plant in 2005, along with 6,500 other people, and for a while, she said, the area was &quot;completely dead&quot;. She wants to believe that the college is the start of a successful redevelopment of the area. &quot;Hopefully more businesses will come here...&quot; she said, before pausing. &quot;We don&apos;t know which businesses will want to come. It could be empty for ages.&quot; At the Austin Sports and Social Club, which still operates on the site of the old plant, Andrew Darwood, who worked for Rover for 21 years (and whose father worked there before him), is more inclined to pessimism. He has found new work with an energy company, but he says the area remains scarred by the closure and he is not upbeat about the prospects for the new town which St Modwen, the developers, is due to begin building on the site in the new year. &quot;There&apos;s no point in building a city centre if people don&apos;t have any money to go to the shops and the restaurants,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a lot harder to sell something if there&apos;s a credit crunch on.&quot; Longbridge is on a cusp, waiting for the economy to turn. At St Modwen, Michael Murray, who is responsible for the Longbridge project, is realistic about the short-term prospects for the area and stresses that this is a long-term venture; he says he isn&apos;t holding his breath for the economy to recover. &quot;The occupier demand is going to remain very slim for the next five years,&quot; he said. Earlier this year the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation began producing the new MG6 on the site, employing 400 people. An innovation centre has attracted 40 small businesses, creating 240 jobs. In the spring, they will begin work on building the new town centre in the shadow of the college, with houses, retails spaces, a hotel, restaurants. The college has created 500 new jobs. There are successes to celebrate, but there is a long way to go before the target of 10,000 jobs is achieved. The company is pressing on with the development of the new town centre, as part of its campaign to attract big businesses to the area. &quot;That is how you get major occupiers to look at a site. You try to get the key parts of the jigsaw in place,&quot; Murray said. &quot;It is difficult. There is a lack of confidence by occupiers.&quot; At her desk in the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, Katie Teasdale, its head of policy, watched the chancellor deliver his statement and said there was little in it that would directly make things run more smoothly in Longbridge. She said redevelopment was likely to be much slower and more piecemeal than might previously have been expected. &quot;The vision hasn&apos;t changed but the pace of change will be slower, and that reflects market demands. There&apos;s little point in investing public money in huge sites that will only be partially occupied for the foreseeable future.&quot;. Longbridge, and the Birmingham Northfield constituency which embraces it, really need the redevelopment to succeed. Across the constituency, long-term youth unemployment has increased by 37.5% since the start of the year, and unemployment in Longbridge stands at 23%, just above the Birmingham average of 21.3%. Richard Burden, the constituency&apos;s Labour MP, said the project had been hit by the closure of the Regional Development Authority last year, and the money which might be made available by the\u00a0new Regional Growth Fund (RGF), even\u00a0with the increase to the fund announced by the chancellor, was not sufficient to replace it. St Modwen is still waiting to hear whether a bid for an RGF grant to help pay for new roads has been successful. But his prime concern is how to tackle youth unemployment in the area, and he is concerned that the Northfield Connexions careers advice centre is likely to close next year, because of council funding reductions. &quot;At the very time that they are most needed, they are being starved of resources,&quot; he said. &quot;If you don&apos;t have support services then problems will be compounded.&quot; Charlie Friel, a Unison official and Connexions advisor, is angry that the support services are going at a time when youth unemployment has passed the one million mark. The job of helping young people in the area find work has become much harder in the past five years, he said. &quot;You tell them they need to be as flexible and adaptable as they can, that they need to have not just a plan A, but a plan B, C and D. We are telling more people to volunteer as a way of getting experience,&quot; he said. &quot;They are realistic. They know the situation is gloomy. You need to tell them that it is through no fault of their own. I quote the youth unemployment figures all the time, not to make a political point, but to say: you are one in a million. They do get upset and frustrated.&quot; At the South Birmingham Young Homelessness Project, a few minutes&apos; drive from the Longbridge site, project manager Carol Cooke, was torn between appreciation of the opportunities that the new college could bring, and despondency at the job prospects for the young people who use her services. During the first quarter of this year, Birmingham had the highest increase in the number of households accepted as homeless in the country, and she anticipates a further increase in homelessness next year, as a result of housing benefit changes. She is concerned at the rising numbers of people she sees who are having their benefit cut because they have failed to demonstrate adequate evidence of their attempt to search for work. &quot;People are having to demonstrate that they are searching for jobs that don&apos;t exist,&quot; she said. &quot;They have to print off CVs and applications. It&apos;s difficult for a lot of our young people \u2014 they don&apos;t have easy access to a computer. Some of them have difficulties reading.&quot; Since the closure of the car plant, the majority of people in work in Northfield are employed by the public sector and many of those jobs now look less secure. The Conservative-led Birmingham city council has announced that it needs to find another \u00a365m worth of cuts next year, in addition to the \u00a3212m already cut this year. This will mean, among other things, shedding another 2,000 jobs from the council workforce (in addition to the 1,181 jobs already cut). Stephen Hughes, chief executive of the council, recently sent an apologetic letter to staff, telling them they were right to feel angry at the cutbacks. &quot;It is not surprising that many staff are feeling angry about all of this. You are right to feel that. It&apos;s not your fault that the country faces such problems, and it&apos;s unfair that you are paying the consequences of other people&apos;s actions,&quot; he\u00a0wrote. But Hughes, who has described the level of reductions being imposed on councils throughout the country as worse than during the Thatcher era, has not been able to offer much consolation to staff, except offering them a tokens scheme, which will give them discounts at some retailers when they go shopping. Sitting in his office on the top floor of the new Bournville College, with a grand balcony overlooking the derelict remains of the old factory and the muddy expanses of land in the process of being cleaned, the college principal, Norman Cave, wants to be optimistic about his students&apos; future, but he agrees they face significant challenges. Many have seen their education maintenance allowance cut this year, which has had, he said, &quot;a dramatic impact on less well\u2011off students&quot;. &quot;Five years ago I would have expected more of them to go into work and higher education, but now students are finding it much more difficult to get employment and starting to think twice about university because of the fees and the fear of starting a career with a high level of debt,&quot; he said. Students are more inclined to study vocational subjects now, because of their concern being employable, with courses in hairdressing, construction, motor vehicles and catering proving particularly popular. &quot;They are not going into the more esoteric subjects, English literature, and sociology. It is about where they think there will be jobs,&quot; he said. His advice is that they should stay in education as long as they can and hope that things improve in a few years&apos; time. &quot;Around 500 will leave this year and a lot of them will not go into work,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Autumn statement 2011", "Politics", "Economics", "UK news", "George Osborne", "Manufacturing sector", "Business", "Economic policy", "Public finance", "Communities", "Society", "Austerity"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-29T18:20:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/climate-change-concern-highest-developing-countries", "sentences": ["We can also expect that potential climate solutions will more frequently come from Sao Paulo, Mumbai and Shanghai than from London, New York or Paris."], "title": "Climate change concern highest in developing countries", "article": "As the world gathers in Durban, South Africa for the 17th Conference of Parties (COP) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), GlobeScan&apos;s latest public opinion tracking reveals that public concern about climate change is now higher in developing nations than in developed countries.

WBCSD graph Photograph: jonathan    The growing gap between developing and developed countries on climate change is also reflected in findings from the National Geographic / GlobeScan Greendex survey of 17 countries.

She politely berates the accompanying pianist for not using enough pedal and gently coaches one of the singers to evoke more innocence: &quot;The character matures, gets pregnant and dies soon enough in this cycle. But at this point, she is still a little girl.&quot; The standard master-class drill, in fact, except that Von Otter, energetically attired in a powder blue tracksuit, is imparting her knowledge not in a conservatory or concert hall, but in a luxury car showroom in Beijing adorned with both high-end Audis and huge images of Gustav Mahler. &quot;I did know beforehand that the venue was called the Audi Forum,&quot; she later laughs. &quot;But when I came in I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes. I didn&apos;t think we would actually be in the middle of all these fantastically macho cars. It felt like being in a James Bond movie. I&apos;m not used to the smell of so much leather and rubber when singing lieder.&quot; Von Otter was in China as one of the star turns of the 14th Beijing Music festival and in many ways her master class typified the ethos of the whole event. Serious music-making from a stellar cast delivered within the very modern Chinese context of glittering new venues, enthusiastic young audiences and an unapologetic embrace of business. In China along with Von Otter were such luminaries as Riccardo Muti, Charles Dutoit, Christoph Eschenbach, Daniel Harding and Matthias Goerne. They played with some of the best Chinese and other Asian orchestras to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Mahler&apos;s death. &quot;It is plainly a moment of political and economic change in the wider world,&quot; observed Muti, who conducted the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra in the festival&apos;s closing gala. &quot;And to see that reflected so clearly in music is fascinating. During my career the way people think about music has completely changed. When I started out there was the idea that Germans were the best at German music and Italians were the only ones who could really play Verdi and so on. It was never really true. Toscanini, for example, was a great Wagner conductor. Now the idea seems preposterous.&quot; Muti says the stereotype that China&apos;s rapid musical advances had given them &quot;technique, while we, the west, still have the soul, is now very outdated. They are certainly running rather than walking with regard to technique, but they have demonstrated that their classical musicians also have soul. Of course I can see the commercial and political motivations for making links with other cultures, but when you do that via Beethoven, Verdi, Vivaldi and Mahler, people communicate in a way that will go beyond the commercial and political. The sense of universality we so value in the great tradition of our music is just that. It belongs to them as much as it belongs to us.&quot; But even for a music culture developing as fast as China&apos;s, isn&apos;t such a high-profile series of more than 20 Mahler concerts \u2013 as well as associated talks, education-outreach sessions and master classes \u2013 quite a leap? Not on the evidence of this festival, say local musicians and visitors alike. In fact Mahler is a peculiarly apt choice for such blanket exposure. It is almost exactly 100 years to the day that the first complete performance of his vast &quot;symphony&quot; for orchestra and voices, Das Lied von der Erde (&quot;The Song of the Earth&quot;), was heard in Munich. He set the 8th-century Tang dynasty poet Li Bai \u2013 who was later adapted by Ezra Pound and many other writers in the west \u2013 and the work is musically full of Chinese motifs. The Chinese-American conductor Lan Shui was brought up in Beijing in the 70s and 80s and is now chief conductor of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, as well as the principal conductor of the Copenhagen Philharmonic. He says that at the time Mahler was composing, the links between east and west were comparatively open, certainly more so than in many of the periods before and after. &quot;As a student it took me much longer to connect with the music of, say, Bach than Mahler. Perhaps in practical terms because there was not too much church music here when I grew up, but also because the emotions felt more distant. Mahler&apos;s musical language seemed to contain universal emotions and much of his work, not just Das Lied von der Erde, appeared similar to Chinese poetry in that it seemed to have both a free form and a strong structure.&quot; Von Otter was noticeably aware of Mahler&apos;s impact at her recital. &quot;The concert culture is a little different here\u00a0from the west and I detected more\u00a0noise and movement in the audience than is usual. But when I got to those six Mahler songs it suddenly became extremely still. Either they knew the music well, or the music was speaking to them in a special way.&quot; The history of classical music in China has been long and sometimes tortuous. There was a professional orchestra in Shanghai as far back as 1879, albeit one packed with European players performing to an expat audience. Classical music survived the 1949 revolution, came under Soviet influence and ebbed and flowed according to the state of relations between the two countries, before being banned and musicians persecuted during the 1966-69 cultural revolution. Its slow re-emergence began after Madame Mao allowed some of her personal favourites \u2013 Dvorak&apos;s New World Symphony, Beethoven&apos;s Pastoral \u2013 to be played. Eugene Ormandy&apos;s Philadelphia Orchestra toured the country in 1973, and education reforms in the late 70s opened the discipline up again, although well into the 1980s students were still hand-copying scores not on the official curriculum, including those of Mahler. Now tens of millions of Chinese children are learning piano and violin, and the music is heavily supported at home by local and national government and promoted abroad through organisations such as the British-based KT Wong Foundation, whose efforts have resulted in a Beijing production of Handel&apos;s Semele and will see a young Chinese-cast version of Britten&apos;s Noye&apos;s Fludde in Belfast as part of next year&apos;s Olympic celebrations. At the elite level of international music-making, Chinese players, conductors and composers have become part of the furniture, or in the case of pianist Lang Lang, a global phenomenon. A key figure behind the recent expansion of Chinese classical music is the conductor, and close associate of Lang Lang, Long Yu, who, remarkably, is music director of three of China&apos;s most prestigious orchestras and was a co-founder of both the Beijing Music festival and the China Philharmonic Orchestra. Since it was founded in 2000 the CPO has toured extensively throughout China and played the first official concert in a church since the revolution \u2013 a performance of Mozart&apos;s Requiem to mark the composer&apos;s 250th anniversary \u2013 as well as playing in New York&apos;s Central Park and for the Pope at the Vatican: &quot;He was very surprised when I spoke to him in German,&quot; chuckles the Berlin-educated Yu. &quot;I am part of the first generation to have grown up through the cultural revolution, then to have gone abroad to study and work, and then to have returned home. We have a different view of the world at a time when China is opening up to the world. Classical music is not so much a western import for us, more an obvious way to communicate.&quot; Yu is well connected both musically and politically and his take on the political, cultural and personal role music could play in the new China is an almost uniquely informed one. It offers a tiny philosophical straw in the wind, as he explains that historically in China what was good for society was regarded as also being good for the individual. But now, maybe what is good for the individual can also be good for society. &quot;Of course economics, business and money are important. But we also need spiritual nourishment. For the past 30 years we have paid a lot of attention to the development of the economy. All over Asia, people are very good at business, but how we balance life and society is increasingly questioned. For me the music is like water and people are vases of all different shapes. The music is the same, but people&apos;s individual responses release their own imagination and creativity. And surely more imaginative and creative people are more useful within society and happier within themselves. So my job is to provide them with the very clearest water. What shape they then make of it is entirely up to them.&quot;", "tags": ["Classical music", "Culture", "Gustav Mahler", "Music", "China", "Lang Lang"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-02T22:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/dec/02/terry-smith-fundsmith-investments", "sentences": ["The Mumbai stock exchange index has fallen from a level of 20,000 a year ago to around 16,000 this week, while the Shanghai Composite index peaked at above 3,000 in April before falling to just 2,350 this week."], "title": "Terry Smith's investments have other fund managers on the ropes", "article": "The multimillionaire boxing-mad son of an east London bus driver proclaimed to Guardian Money readers last December he would give Britain&apos;s &quot;fat and complacent&quot; fund management industry a bloody nose. His new low-cost fund would strip out trading costs, banish commission and sell direct to small investors. The one-year performance figures are now in \u2013 and it&apos;s round one to Terry Smith, with the industry firmly on the ropes. There are more than 2,300 funds that UK investors can choose from, and over the past year they&apos;ve managed to lose, on average, 11% of investors&apos; money. But Terry Smith&apos;s Fundsmith Equity is enjoying a year-on-year gain of 6.4% despite the worsening economic blizzard that has battered stock markets. Behind his success is a simple formula: buy shares in companies that make basic necessities \u2013 from toilet paper to nappies, baby food to pet food, soap to shampoo. No matter how hard austerity bites, western consumers will keep buying basics, while newly affluent consumers in China and India are buying for the first time. It&apos;s why his portfolio of just 20 companies includes names such as Unilever (makers of PG Tips, Flora, Dove, Persil and Domestos), Procter &amp; Gamble (Ariel, Pampers, Olay, Duracell) and Imperial Tobacco (Lambert &amp; Butler, Gauloises, John Player Special, Rizla). Makers of what analysts call these &quot;consumer staples&quot; have, in most cases, seen their share prices defy the downturn \u2013 Unilever is trading at \u00a321 a share compared with \u00a318 a year ago, Procter &amp; Gamble has edged ahead from $62 to $64, while Imperial Tobacco is changing hands at \u00a323 a share, compared with less than \u00a319. Smoking is in decline in the west, but elsewhere across the world new addicts light up every day. Among the 270 funds in the &quot;global&quot; sector of the fund management industry, Fundsmith Equity has entered the one-year performance tables in third place, behind a Morgan Stanley fund invested in global brands, and a Legal &amp; General fund which focuses on health and pharmaceuticals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, money has gushed into the fund from investors large and small. Fundsmith Equity started with \u00a325m, mostly Smith&apos;s own cash, but is now \u00a3200m and growing fast. Already cited as Britain&apos;s answer to Warren Buffet, Smith says the key to making money from shares, is sticking to fundamentals. &quot;We do the things others no longer do. Analysts no longer read the primary documents about a company. We do read the annual report, while other analysts use company presentations as the source of their data. They&apos;re the sort of presentations where you never see a clean earnings number. They&apos;re always &apos;adjusted&apos; figures.&quot; He berates other fund managers for trading in and out of shares too frequently, which drives up costs and rarely benefits the underlying investor. Over the past year Smith has sold out of just one stock \u2013 Andrex toilet paper maker Kimberly-Clark \u2013 and bought one other \u2013 3M, manufacturers of Scotch tape and Post-it products. &quot;It&apos;s important to look at the return a company makes on its incremental capital. You can be seduced into buying a company which has high returns but, in reality, is in decline, where its new projects are not making as much money as its old ones. &quot;That calculation started to flash red on Kimberly-Clark. It&apos;s the number two to Procter &amp; Gamble on things such as nappies, and P&amp;G is quite resurgent. In short, Kimberly-Clark is getting a good kicking from P&amp;G.&quot; Smith&apos;s other mantra is that investors should read, read and read rather than trade, trade and trade. &quot;Between the three of us who run Fundsmith Equity, we read around 1,000 publications regularly. &quot;I read PotatoPro magazine, Elevator World, even Tissue World. PotatoPro, for example, helps you keep on top of what&apos;s happening in the snack food industry.&quot; Low trading volumes and no commission to financial advisers means the expense ratio is 1.17% a year \u2013 a third less than most retail funds. Smith&apos;s favourite stock over the past year has been Domino&apos;s Pizza, which has doubled in value from $15 a share to nearly $33 in the last 12 months. &quot;For a while, it was producing a dire product. It did market research, and, more remarkably, published it. It found that some people thought that the cardboard box tasted better than the pizza.&quot; Management took on board what customers were saying, and turned the company around. Even today, he says, it allows unedited comments from customers to flash up on its ticker in Times Square. The drawback to Smith&apos;s fund is that it is likely to underperform when stock markets take off and consumer staples are seen as worthy but dull. That&apos;s when technology and commodity stocks tend to make the running. But Smith is unabashed \u2013 he thinks there are only around 65 companies across the planet worth investing in, and they will prove their mettle as the developed world&apos;s economy continues to stumble. Two-thirds of the world&apos;s population still don&apos;t brush their teeth every day. One quarter of the world&apos;s hair is in India, he says. Sales of toothpaste and shampoo are only going one way \u2013 and that&apos;s up. Closer to home, Smith is rather less optimistic. Neither Plan A by George Osborne nor Plan B from Ed Miliband is going to dig Britain out of the debt hole it&apos;s in, he says. &quot;It&apos;s not going to work, George. Growth is not going to come to the rescue. There is a Plan B, but it&apos;s not Miliband&apos;s, which is risible. We will have to cut public spending by a lot, lot more than this.&quot; There&apos;s no place like home Who knew? Britain is in the midst of the worst economic crisis for a generation, while China and India continue to boom. But over the last 12 months, the best investment you could have made was in British government bonds \u2013 and the worst, investing in China. UK government bonds \u2013 also known as gilts \u2013 have been the surprise beneficiary of the eurozone crisis. Greek and Italian bonds have suffered from soaring interest rates as traders have speculated on a collapse in the euro, but the reverse has happened to gilts. When the &quot;yield&quot; on a bond goes up \u2013 as in Italy, where it has headed towards 7% \u2013 the underlying capital value goes down. When the yield goes down \u2013 as in Britain, where they have dropped towards 2% \u2013 the value of the bond goes up. So if you held British government bonds during this period, the value has jumped. The best of the gilt funds, such as one operated by Insight, is up 29% over the year. Even the average gilt fund is up 15%.  Meanwhile, emerging market funds, which performed so well over the past decade, have had an awful year. HSBC&apos;s India fund is down 35% and Jupiter&apos;s China fund, down 30%. The average China fund is down 22%. The Mumbai stock exchange index has fallen from a level of 20,000 a year ago to around 16,000 this week, while the Shanghai Composite index peaked at above 3,000 in April before falling to just 2,350 this week. Among the worst hit have been British investors who bought Fidelity&apos;s China Special Situations investment trust launched by investment guru Anthony Bolton. Billed as the &quot;investment opportunity of the decade&quot;, it was heavily marketed to small investors by commission-based financial advisers.  But in November, a humbled Bolton issued an apology. &quot;I am sorry to report that the combination of the very difficult stock market background, the company&apos;s exposure to the more volatile medium and smaller capitalisation Chinese stocks and the company&apos;s gearing has produced some very poor performance figures,&quot; he said.  Bolton added that he is worried about bad bank debts and falling property prices in China. But with gilts having done so well, and China so poorly, should canny investors consider the reverse trade this year? Buy China and sell gilts?  Not at all, says David Kauders of Kauders Portfolio Management, who was a lone voice in the noughties, warning that the colossal build-up of consumer and bank debt would bring disaster. For the last decade he has been telling investors to buy gilts \u2013 and has been proved right time and again. Even as central banks act to inject liquidity into frozen money markets, he is telling investors to keep buying gilts and ignore warnings about inflation. &quot;We haven&apos;t seen anything yet. There&apos;s going to be a mass flight to quality, and yields on gilts will fall to just 0.5%-1%. This will last for another five to 10 years \u2013 we have the Japanese experience to draw upon.&quot; But he also tells investors to buy US Treasuries, as well as gilts, as the dollar is the ultimate safe haven. Brian Dennehy of investment advisers Dennehy Weller is also bearish, warning that investors should stick with gilts, or corporate bonds that mimic the behaviour of gilts. But he&apos;s more sanguine when it comes to India. &quot;In economic terms it&apos;s still some way behind China, and it has 25% of the world&apos;s population under 25. If you can put them to work, it has huge potential. Don&apos;t buy it thinking that you will make money over one year, but over the next decade it will really stand out.&quot; ", "tags": ["Investment funds", "Investments", "Money", "Investing", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-02T23:02:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/03/sports-personality-year-women-debate", "sentences": ["I watch sport on TV for a living and I do not recall seeing much of the World Championships from Shanghai \u2013 a few minutes on Transworld Sport possibly \u2013 so as with the sports editor of the Manchester Evening News, or Nuts (Nuts has a sports editor?"], "title": "Do women get overlooked for sports awards?", "article": "Jacqui Oatley, BBC sports commentator  First, let&apos;s look at some basic facts surrounding a story that attracted more than a little heated debate last week. The shortlist for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was compiled by the sports editors of 27 national and regional publications. All of those sports editors are male. All 10 candidates on their final shortlist were male. Now, I&apos;m not taking the simplistic and narrow-minded view that those two facts automatically go hand in hand. That would be absurd and an insult to the integrity of the men who voted. There are clearly flaws in the voting process when retired footballer Patrick Vieira receives a vote from the Manchester Evening News for his well-paid work in the local community while world champion swimmer Rebecca Adlington misses the shortlist by one vote. But the fact that none of those sports editors is female tells its own tale: that sport in Britain is extremely male-dominated. It always has been and always will be, largely because more men are obsessed with sport than women. But those women must still be fairly represented. Martin Kelner, Guardian sports columnist and broadcaster I am sorry, Jacqui, but the whole point of awards is that they go to the wrong people. Henry Kissinger, one of the architects of America&apos;s war in Vietnam, won a Nobel Peace prize. Possibly even more outrageously, Robbie Savage is the current holder of a Sony Radio Academy award for broadcasting. And do not even get me started on the Oscars. In 1944, the year of the great witty suspenseful Billy Wilder film Double Indemnity, the best picture went to some confection starring Bing Crosby as a singing priest. You people \u2013 by which I mean women \u2013 are well out of it. And, let us be honest, we are only talking about nominations at this stage, not the award. Who wants to be nominated, just to get all dressed up, sit through the BBC&apos;s idea of a gala occasion \u2013 a Strictly Come Dancing &quot;special&quot; is my guess \u2013 and watch some golfer get the big prize? Have you ever experienced the fear and loathing of an awards ceremony, Jacqui? A hundred expensively purchased tables of dinner-jacketed losers crying into their champagne, muttering imprecations and swearing vengeance on the judges, and half a dozen oozing the smell of smug self-congratulation. Let the men have their boys&apos; club. JO Martin, this is not about glitzy award ceremonies. And yes, I&apos;ve been to the last few BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards (this year&apos;s invitation must have been lost in the post). I couldn&apos;t care less about who wins Oscars and Golden Globes \u2013 there&apos;s hardly an under-representation of women in the film and television world. Maybe older women, but that&apos;s for another day. The award itself is not the key issue here, but it has provided an opportune excuse to raise the more serious subject about who can young girls look up to and be inspired by? If they open the lowest-hanging fruit of newspapers and magazines, they&apos;re bombarded with images of those pantomime dames from The Only Way Is Essex \u2013 all false eyelashes, bee-stung lips and hair extensions. I&apos;m all for glamour and entertainment, but not when those air-bag breasts obscure the view of dedicated, talented achievers such as Chrissie Wellington, Faye White, Jessica Ennis and Keri-Anne Payne. MK All excellent role models, but sadly mostly in sports that, outside of the Olympics, nobody could give a stuff about. That is the unfortunate truth. Keri-Anne Payne&apos;s success, for instance, laudable though it was, was in open-water swimming, not a sport that is at the heart of the national conversation. I watch sport on TV for a living and I do not recall seeing much of the World Championships from Shanghai \u2013 a few minutes on Transworld Sport possibly \u2013 so as with the sports editor of the Manchester Evening News, or Nuts (Nuts has a sports editor?), Ms Payne would have struggled to win my nomination. Swimming for 10km in open water, beating the rest of the world, is, I grant you, a phenomenal achievement, but my view on swimming \u2013 especially in open water \u2013 is that it is less a spectator sport, more a very effective method of not drowning. JO Very good! OK, it&apos;s a fair cop on the open-water swimming front. I haven&apos;t seen much of it either, but isn&apos;t that the point? Even if swimming is not your bag, there are plenty of other sports in which British women are excelling, yet you wouldn&apos;t know about it. Let&apos;s move on to my territory \u2013 football. Very much a mainstream sport. Women&apos;s football is statistically the third most popular participation sport in England behind men&apos;s football and men&apos;s cricket. Yet very few people even knew the Fifa Women&apos;s World Cup was happening this year until it actually started. Even then, few knew about it until England were knocked out in the quarter-finals on penalties, at which point they threw their hands up and exclaimed &quot;typical&quot;! It wasn&apos;t typical for the women but then they wouldn&apos;t know because they hardly ever get to read about it or watch it! MK Women&apos;s sport is undoubtedly under-represented in newspapers&apos; sports pages. It would be foolish to argue otherwise. The Solheim Cup gets a fraction of the coverage of the Ryder Cup, women&apos;s football gets a token paragraph or two, slightly more when there is a World Cup. And that maybe is an issue worth taking up with our (predominantly male) sports editors.The current campaign, however, concentrates ludicrously on the Sports Personality of the Year, or, as the BBC likes to call it, SPOTY \u2013 with the &quot;P&quot; not so much silent, as otiose. When has personality ever entered a contest won twice by Nigel Mansell, for goodness sake? It is a beauty contest that goes straight on to the evening wear round. Gabby Logan, Clare Balding and other assiduous tweeters are paid by the BBC to take SPOTY seriously. We don&apos;t have to. JO Whether people choose to watch SPOTY is up to them. But at least they have the option. Unlike with women&apos;s sport, which is not so accessible. And that&apos;s precisely the problem. &quot;It&apos;s just one of those years,&quot; say some. &quot;Next year there&apos;ll be loads of candidates because it&apos;s Olympic year.&quot; Indeed. The Olympics being a tournament with events for both men and women, so journalists cover both. Sports editors are far less likely to send their reporters to women-only events. And their readers/viewers are partly to blame. If they don&apos;t write to them to tell them what they want, why would the editor deem it necessary to redeploy their resources? Anyway, let&apos;s give much-maligned Peter Spencer of the MEN some credit. Had he not made such left-field selections (Vieira, Dimitar Berbatov and Yaya Tour\u00e9) then Adlington may have squeaked on to the shortlist and people may still think Chrissie Wellington is the funny blonde from I&apos;m a Celebrity\u2026 MK There would have been a woman on my list: Sarah Stevenson, who trained for and won welterweight gold at the world taekwondo championships, while looking after her terminally ill parents. In common with the rest of the nation, I have no idea what taekwondo is, but Sarah&apos;s dedication to it is indisputable. The fact remains, though, if Laura Robson had reached the Wimbledon semi-finals, or Hope Powell had led England to football World Cup success, there would have been female contenders. Some sports are more popular than others, a fact we will all have to deal with until the Olympics, when we can pretend otherwise.", "tags": ["Sport", "Awards and prizes", "BBC", "Media", "Culture", "Women", "Women's football"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-03T17:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/dec/04/health-unemployment", "sentences": ["Gdynia, near Gdansk, does not compare to San Francisco or Shanghai as one of the great urban centres of ideas and invention."], "title": "The fresh ideas that can help save our world", "article": "Gdynia, near Gdansk, does not compare to San Francisco or Shanghai as one of the great urban centres of ideas and invention. But last month it was giving both cities a good run for their money when it came to buzz and intellectual energy. This former fishing village in Poland, now a city of 250,000 people, was chosen to host the first international winter school in social innovation, which attracted 70 experts from all corners of the globe, including Korea, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Australia and the UK. All were seeking new, creative solutions to the increasingly serious social challenges of our times. Some were looking to solve problems relating to health; others were exercised by the problem of wealth (or rather the lack of it). Youth joblessness was a theme, as was ageing. No profit motive was attached or product pitch involved. This was just people offering ingenuity and services. The passion for social innovation is not new. But, as the success of the event in Gdynia demonstrated, an exponential rise in interest seems to be taking place, partly because of the impact of the internet and partly because government coffers are running empty and some of the bigger challenges appear intractable. Often, successful innovation means the addition of a new ingredient to what is already familiar. The arrival of television, for example, plus long-distance learning, created the Open University. Add cars to older people in need of a regular lunch, and meals on wheels is born. Hospices, charity shops, the Samaritans, the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides are all examples of social innovation that eventually became part of the nation&apos;s furniture. The first three-day summer international school for social innovation was held in 2008 in San Sebasti\u00e1n in the Basque country. It was organised, among others, by the Young Foundation, Cisco and the Social Innovation Exchange, which allows social innovators around the world to exchange ideas. But Gdynia represented the movement&apos;s first foray into the winter months. In a former wartime Messerschmitt factory, now converted into an innovation centre, the group of 70 came together to assess what&apos;s coming round the corner in 2015 and how best we can all cope. The immediate impression was that coping would involve the use of a lot of Post-it notes. Jim Dator, an expert in futurology (who also acknowledges that almost everything foretold is bound to be wrong \u2013 rights for robots and paperless offices instantly come to mind) is fond of saying that, for any prediction to come true, it must first sound ridiculous. Hence, several years ago, when Gorka Espiau, one of the those in Gdynia, and his colleagues at DenokInn, the Basque Social Centre for Innovation in Bilbao, first began to collaborate with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a group of videogame designers on a low-cost folding electric car that opens from the front (so a wheelchair-user can roll in), is &quot;driven&quot; via a laptop by a motorist of any age and ability, and can store secrets about the way we behave (for instance, the vehicle can be programmed not to exceed 50mph), the plan probably sounded too daft for words. Several million euros later, Hiriko, meaning &quot;from the city&quot; in Basque, launches next month, in Berlin, Malm\u00f6, Barcelona, San Francisco and Quito in Ecuador (London missed out). Espiau says that the car is low-cost, around \u20ac12,000 and it will be rented out by the hour at a low rate, but whoever wants you parked in their forecourt \u2013 supermarket, cinema or optician \u2013 also foots the leasing charge. It will be small-scale in production, with factories sited in areas of high unemployment. So in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, according to Espiau, there is 90% unemployment among the largest population of Iraqis living outside their home country. Now a number of them will work on Hiriko. &quot;This isn&apos;t just about a car,&quot; says Espiau. &quot;This is about bringing together people from very different professions, architecture, videogames, the web, who are driven by the belief that the poorest can be mobile; even the long-term out-of-work can have jobs. Social innovation sometimes means nice people losing money. Hiriko will show we can make social change.&quot; Some of the original attendees of San Sebasti\u00e1n in 2008 were also at this first winter school. They were told by Geoff Mulgan, chief executive of Nesta, the organisation that promotes social innovation in the UK, that the challenges have not changed in the last four years, only their scale. In many parts of the world, people are living longer, but spending more of their final years in poorer health. Health and social care is eating into national budgets. So how, for instance, will new social media and different services and organisations help to ride to the rescue on a range of issues such as education? Femi Longe, based in Nigeria, tells us that 10 years ago the country had only 866,000 telephone lines. Now, in a population of 116 million, there are 88 million mobile subscribers \u2013 mostly young people. His newly established Co-Creation Hub, independent from government, is working on 16 different ventures. They include apps that will tell citizens about their constitutional rights (Your Rights in Your Pocket), apps to help students with study, and apps to encourage greater transparency and less corruption in the government&apos;s budget (BudgeIT). In Gdynia, we heard how a partnership between food companies Danone and Lubella, supermarket chain Biedrinka, and the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw had produced a breakfast porridge offering 25% of a child&apos;s daily vitamins and minerals, costing a few pence and cleverly marketed for &quot;supermums of all income groups&quot;. Since its launch in 2006, 50 million portions of Mleczny Start (Milky Start) have been sold, 27% to Poland&apos;s poorest families. Profit goes back into promotion. &quot;One bright idea doesn&apos;t solve the causes of infant malnutrition,&quot; said one of the team, &quot;but at least it gives a child a better start.&quot; Simon Tucker, chief executive of the Young Foundation, said: &quot;Social innovation is the only way to build a future we might actually want to live in. Even after the current financial crisis, challenges such as ageing populations and climate change mean we just cannot continue as we are with minor improvements. Social innovation is a more constructive response than protest, more active than trusting in technocrats \u2013 we are together taking responsibility for shaping our future and our children&apos;s future.&quot; Yvonne Roberts is a fellow of the Young Foundation Social innovation around the world Check You Out! UsCreates, a design company headed by Zoe Stanton and Mary Rose Cook, worked with the Prince&apos;s Trust, Empire Cinemas, Birmingham East and North primary care trust and 60 young people, including 30 selected as &quot;youth ambassadors&quot;, in Birmingham to devise a campaign to improve testing for chlamydia. It is the most common sexually transmitted infection in young people, affecting one in 12, and has no symptoms. At Gdynia, Mary Rose explained how the young people tackled the lack of knowledge and stigma. They came up with the slogan Check You Out!, used themselves as the &quot;face&quot; of the campaign; designed orange wrist bands, offered a free cinema screening with a health trainer in the lavatories who rewarded young people who took the urine test with free popcorn and a soft drink, which achieved a 100% testing rate. The young people also set up a Facebook page \u2013 Check You Out! It now has more than 5,000 followers; they entered a film-making competition and designed billboards and postcards using the ambassadors to push home the message that screening matters. The 12-month strategy has won several awards, including the Best of Health Awards 2010. Hello Sunday Morning In 2008, Craig Raine, aged 24, who lives in Brisbane, decided to say goodbye to his habitual Sunday morning hangover and try sobriety for a year. &quot;I wanted to know why I drank and what my motivation was to do it and what it would take to influence the way other people looked at [drinking]. Nobody thought I&apos;d last the 12 months,&quot; he said. Hello Sunday Morning was born. It consists of a website, to which people sign up and pledge not to drink for three months. They blog their progress. Research into behaviour change tells us a public pledge reinforces resolve. Raine resumed drinking after 12 months. &quot;It&apos;s part of life,&quot; he says, &quot;but Hello Sunday Morning is about when it becomes a problem, when you depend upon it psychologically to have certain experiences or fun.&quot; In 2010, the Australian Centre for Social Innovation, established the year before, selected Hello Sunday Morning as one of eight projects and schemes chosen from 258 ideas contributed from all over Australia, to fund and support. Hello Sunday Morning has been hugely popular, especially among younger people. The target this year is for it to reach 10,000 supporters and then become a worldwide movement towards a better drinking culture. &quot;I signed up to HSM,&quot; says Brenton Caffin, head of Centre for Social Innovation. &quot;I didn&apos;t have a problem with alcohol but I wanted to see if I could do it. It worked for me.&quot; The Kafka Brigade Originally established in the Netherlands in the 1990s, the Kafka Brigade now has a UK counterpart in Wales. Its aim is to reduce red tape and regulations and bureaucratic dysfunction. Frontline workers, the public, managers and policymakers are all required to take part, to analyse what&apos;s wrong and to come up with a solution. Some solutions are simple. For instance, in 2007 in Amsterdam, 37,000 people were leaving prison only to reoffend and be involved in petty crime, because of homelessness, delays in receiving benefits and unemployment. The Kafka project meant that prisoners begin applying for benefits before their release; are better supported to find jobs; and homeless ex-offenders are a target cohort for special housing support. The Kafka Brigade UK has also helped to reduce the numbers of young people not in employment education or training (Neets)in Cardiff and Swansea. In 2010, Swansea was recognised as showing one of the two most improved performances in Wales for supporting Neets. A review published this year described the Kafka Brigade contribution as &quot;a valuable process that helped clarify performance indicators, rationalised the action plan and led to individuals and organisations taking more responsibility for reducing the proportion of young people not in employment education or training&quot;. The Kafka Brigade is a partner with the thinktank Kennisland (Knowledgeland), headed by Chris Sigaloff. The Water Hackathon The Water Hackathon took place over two days in October simultaneously in Bangalore, Cairo, Kampala, Lima, London, Nairobi, Tel Aviv and Washington DC. Lack of adequate safe water and sanitation is the world&apos;s single largest cause of illness, responsible for more than two million deaths a year. As the global population grows, and demands on natural resources increase, the sustainable management of water is ever more urgent. Technologists, engineers, programmers, designers, water experts and people with ideas worked together over one weekend to come up with solutions. At the Co-creation Hub in Lagos, represented at the winter school in Gdynia by Femi Longe, a co-founder, 32 people worked together, as part of Random Hacks of Kindness. The group came up with a number of ideas, including mobile phone games to educate Nigerians on the use of water; a mobile system to name and shame companies whose packaging clogs the drainage system the most and a mobile tool to crowdsource (encourage the public to become citizen watchdogs) and track burst pipes and leakages across the system and get them fixed quickly . The challenge is turning ideas into concrete projects and scaling them up, but companies such as Microsoft and organisations like the World Bank are investing: they see new markets in the global population explosion.", "tags": ["Society", "Technology", "Health policy", "Unemployment", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-04T00:04:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/dec/05/liverpool-heritage-unesco-london", "sentences": ["It also reduced the height of the tallest planned building \u2013 the Shanghai tower \u2013 to 55 storeys."], "title": "After Liverpool, the capital's heritage site is being investigated", "article": "Liverpool is not the only UK city under threat of losing a world heritage designation, it emerged on Monday Unesco inspectors will visit London this week to check out developments around the Tower of London and the Palace of Westminster. In a move that is reminiscent of the Liverpool world heritage debate, Unesco is concerned their status as prized buildings of world importance is being damaged by the building of skyscrapers. Liverpool was warned it will be stripped of its World Heritage Site status if a \u00a35.5bn skyscraper plan goes ahead without &quot;radical&quot; changes, when inspectors visited in November. The three-day Unesco inspection, led by Ron van Oers, had left Liverpool with clear guidance &quot;100%&quot; that, unless Peel&apos;s Liverpool Waters project was radically changed, they will recommend the city be stripped of the World Heritage accolade.  The official inspectors&apos; report will be completed by December 23 and will then be sent to Liverpool council and Peel within two to four weeks. Peel, having already dramatically reduced the number of skyscrapers, has indicated it is not willing to compromise its Liverpool Waters scheme further. It also reduced the height of the tallest planned building \u2013 the Shanghai tower \u2013 to 55 storeys. Ultimate responsibility for the UK&apos;s 28 World Heritage Sites falls to the Department for Culture, Media, and Sport. Heritage campaigner Wayne Colquhoun, who was instrumental in bringing the inspectors to Liverpool, said the fact Unesco were now visiting the capital would reinforce the importance of local heritage concerns. &quot;If London is threatened, then hopefully people in positions of power that think Liverpool is just a provincial outpost may sit up and take the matter seriously,&quot; he told the Liverpool Daily Post. Unesco has a number of specific concerns about London. It has warned that the Tower of London could be downgraded because of the negative impact of the Shard of Glass on its panorama. The 1,020ft-high Shard, a 66-storey office block next to London Bridge, will be the tallest building in Europe when it is finished. Unesco&apos;s World Heritage committee has ruled that: &quot;Incremental developments around the Tower over the past five years have impacted adversely its visual integrity.&quot; Unesco is also concerned about the 43-storey Doon Street tower, which is being built in Lambeth across the river from the Palace of Westminster. The World Heritage committee has said specific measures to protect the immediate and wider settings and have not yet been sufficiently developed.", "tags": ["UK news", "Liverpool", "London", "Culture", "Heritage", "Unesco", "Architecture"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-05T17:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/05/chelsea-transfers-fresh-blood", "sentences": ["A move to Montreal in Major League Soccer, or China with Shanghai Shenhua, should be confirmed next month."], "title": "Chelsea look for fresh blood as year of change looms at Stamford Bridge", "article": "Likely to leave in January   Nicolas Anelka Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas praised the striker&apos;s professionalism, though there has been frustration at some of his cameos this season. The 32-year-old has scored 59 goals for Chelsea since his \u00a315m transfer from Bolton in January 2008 but his contribution has been eclipsed by the emergence of Daniel Sturridge. A move to Montreal in Major League Soccer, or China with Shanghai Shenhua, should be confirmed next month. Alex The Brazil centre-half was a rugged performer when Chelsea ground out clean sheets at Stoke City and Blackburn Rovers this season but he has failed to convince Villas-Boas that he deserves more opportunities in the first team. A lack of starts has prompted his request to leave, with the 29-year-old likely to turn to Serie\u00a0A, and possibly Juventus, to revive his career. Josh McEachran The 18-year-old midfielder represents Chelsea&apos;s future but a lack of opportunities over the first half of the season is likely to herald a loan move away from Stamford Bridge next month to gain first-team experience elsewhere. Bolton had expressed an interest, though McEachran may prefer to link up with the former Chelsea reserve-team manager Brendan Rodgers at Swansea City, where he could thrive in his attacking midfield brief. Ryan Bertrand His non-inclusion in the Champions League squad cost him an appearance in Leverkusen, when Ashley Cole was injured, and he can be considered a high-quality, youthful back-up to the experienced England international. But with Patrick van Aanholt likely to return from an unsuccessful loan at Wigan Athletic, Bertrand may leap at the chance to play elsewhere on loan for the second half of the season. Off in the summer   Didier Drogba A modern-day Chelsea icon, Drogba&apos;s contract expires at the end of the season, with his attempts to secure a new two\u2011year deal having been rebuffed by the club. Given the signing of Romelu Lukaku, his days appear increasingly numbered and there is an acceptance that a parting of the ways may be close, with a lucrative move to the Middle East or back to Marseille in the offing. Salomon Kalou The Ivorian boasts a prolific record as a substitute in recent times, having scored in each of his past three cameos for the club, but a lack of first-team opportunities will see him depart at the expiry of his contract in the summer. There will be interest in the versatile 26-year-old from rival English clubs, with Arsenal established as long-term admirers, as well as from clubs in France. Paulo Ferreira The defender signed by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2004 has become this club&apos;s forgotten man, his appearances limited these days to the Carling Cup at best. Ferreira was given a new five-year contract in 2008 despite being at best the second-choice right-back and was included in the Champions League squad at Ryan Bertrand&apos;s expense this season, presumably for his experience, but did not travel to Bayer Leverkusen for the previous group game. Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa The Portuguese right-back had his deal extended last\u00a0summer and began this season in the starting XI, only to slip to the fringes in recent weeks following some shaky defensive performances. Cynics might argue that, by triggering the clause in his contract, Chelsea merely ensured they would secure some kind of fee for the defender who cost the club \u00a316.3m in 2008. Potential recruits  Alvaro Pereira The left-sided Porto utility player was close to moving to London last summer, only for Chelsea to resist meeting the release clause in the Portuguese&apos;s contract at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o. The 26-year-old has since signed an extension to his contract, taking it to 2016, with the \u00a325.7m clause retained. Yet Chelsea are expected to renew their attempts to secure him regardless. Luka Modric Chelsea have long craved a creative midfielder and targeted the Croatian last summer. Tottenham Hotspur&apos;s unwillingness to countenance his sale has reaped dividends, with the north Londoners above Villas-Boas&apos;s side in the table and appearing likely to return to the Champions League next season, though Modric&apos;s commitment to the cause will be tested should Chelsea come calling again. Gary Cahill The Bolton centre-half has attracted interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and, most persistently, Tottenham in recent months. He is out of contract in the summer and is expected to leave the Reebok Stadium next month. A fee of about \u00a37m could take him to Stamford Bridge, where he would renew the centre-half partnership with John Terry that has been employed by Fabio Capello at international level. Eden Hazard The Lille playmaker has indicated that this is likely to be his last year with the current French champions, though he may consider a move to Spain, where Real Madrid head the queue as his most fervent admirers, preferable to London. A slippery creator, he boasts the quality to thrive. Kevin De Bruyne The Genk teenager was targeted over the summer, though no fee was agreed with the Belgian club. The winger&apos;s stock remains high after showing flashes of quality over the course of his team&apos;s disappointing Champions League campaign, and he has made public his desire to follow Lukaku and Thibault Courtois from Belgium to Stamford Bridge.", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Didier Drogba", "Luka Modric", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-05T23:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/07/chelsea-didier-drogba-dilemma-villas-boas", "sentences": ["Kalou and Anelka will leave, the latter next month with the Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua hoping to see off the new Major League Soccer franchise in Montreal to secure his signature, but the enigma of Fernando Torres&apos;s form still has still to be addressed."], "title": "Didier Drogba's fine form means problems as well as praise for Chelsea", "article": "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas may be loth to admit it but even eye-catching victories and progress into the Champions League knockout phase generate problems these days. The Portuguese will break away from revelling at having &quot;slapped&quot; down Chelsea&apos;s critics to concentrate on his task of revitalising this club in the weeks ahead. Yet, in the long term, the trickiest obstacle hindering the overhaul of this team may actually prove to be the continued excellence of the old brigade. The dismissal of Valencia on Tuesday night felt reassuringly familiar. The London side were back at their resilient best, allowing Spanish opponents the ball before hitting hard on the break. Guus Hiddink&apos;s Chelsea might have hoped to have secured a similar result when confronting Barcelona in the 2009 semi-final second leg of this competition but Villas-Boas&apos;s charges, with no dubious refereeing decisions to undermine them, were better rewarded for their efforts. There was strength stiffening the spine of the team and, at its head, a battering ram of a forward who would not be denied. Didier Drogba, like his fellow forwards Nicolas Anelka and Salomon Kalou, had appeared to be playing out the final days of his Chelsea career with his contract due to expire at the end of this campaign. The club have been in talks about an extension, but the 12 months they have been offering fall short of the two years the Ivorian wants. A lucrative free transfer move to the Middle East has been mooted, offering the 33-year-old one last colossal payday. Yet, if Drogba can reproduce performances as reminiscent of his pomp as that against Valencia on a regular basis over the months to come, then pressure will mount for his services to be retained. The forward has already contributed 36 goals in 69 Champions League games and believes he should be a part of his club&apos;s future. &quot;I hope I&apos;ve got at least a couple of years left in me,&quot; he said. &quot;I started [playing professionally] late. I was 25 when I played my first Champions League games. Really I don&apos;t know [how long I can carry on playing]. I feel happy, I feel good on the pitch, I really enjoy my football and when we are winning like this I&apos;m really delighted. I don&apos;t calculate. All I want to say is that my future is not so important. When the time comes, we will speak about my future. But at the moment there is no need to.&quot; Joe Cole and Michael Ballack used to say similar things way back in Carlo Ancelotti&apos;s first season at the club, with the experienced pair eventually leaving under freedom of contract rules in the summer of 2010. But Drogba, whose attitude this term cannot be questioned, still has the ability to make the very idea that he could walk away for nothing in June unthinkable. There had been a hint of a return to his rampaging best in the fixtures leading up to the final group game. The defences of Bayer Leverkusen and Newcastle had been breached, with the brace against the Spanish \u2013 with each goal so smartly taken \u2013 leaving him a tally of four in as many matches. There was strength, power and presence to his display on Tuesday, with Adil Rami and Victor Ruiz shrinking in his shadow. Markers bounced off him as he stampeded all over Valencia&apos;s feeble resistance. The player does not believe he is fully fit, with the perfectionist in him demanding further improvement. &quot;The knock on the head [against Norwich City], the red card [at Queen&apos;s Park Rangers], the surgery on my arm [to remove pins applied before the World Cup finals] all didn&apos;t help to get my fitness,&quot; Drogba said. &quot;Now I&apos;m having more games and it&apos;s going to come back. I hope quick, but it is going to come back. I&apos;ve lost a lot of goals and this is something I hope my fitness will help me to improve. When I get to 100% fit there are a few mistakes I will try to rectify.&quot; Villas-Boas&apos;s dilemma, if he considers it one, is that offering Drogba more than a year may feel rather regressive when everything the Portuguese is hoping to implement at Stamford Bridge is aimed at the long term. Kalou and Anelka will leave, the latter next month with the Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua hoping to see off the new Major League Soccer franchise in Montreal to secure his signature, but the enigma of Fernando Torres&apos;s form still has still to be addressed. Romelu Lukaku may be raw but he, too, will need greater involvement over the next two years. Drogba may actually block the path to progression. With that in mind, one blazing performance against Valencia is unlikely to dictate the club&apos;s policy in further contract negotiations. Yet should he consistently deliver such explosive displays, along the lines of those mustered en route to the Double two years ago when he scored 37 times, then that stance may shift. The manner of Tuesday&apos;s qualification was a reminder that, while Chelsea continue to adapt to the style that Villas-Boas so craves, they can still flourish playing the way they know best. An approach in which Drogba is key.", "tags": ["Didier Drogba", "Chelsea", "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-07T18:27:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/delhi-congestion-charge-ease-gridlock", "sentences": ["Authorities in Beijing recently said they were considering congestion charging, and other Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Nangjing are reported to be interested."], "title": "Delhi plans congestion charge to ease gridlock", "article": "No one could fault the plan for lack of ambition: to tame the choked streets of India&apos;s notoriously chaotic capital by imposing a congestion charge modelled on that in London, Singapore and a handful of other cities. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the authority charged with providing civic services to the city, hopes to introduce a system to levy a 150-rupee (\u00a32) fee on cars, motorbikes and even rickshaws entering central areas during the day. &quot;This will help reduce congestion \u2026 [and] encourage people to use public transport,&quot; the head of the authority, KS Mehra, told local press. Lorries will be made to pay a higher fee. A congestion charge has existed in Singapore since the 1970s and various systems have been successfully introduced in London, Rome, Milan and several Scandinavian cities in recent years. Authorities in Beijing recently said they were considering congestion charging, and other Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Nangjing are reported to be interested. But no city of the size and complexity of Delhi has attempted to introduce such a scheme. Few doubt the necessity of radical measures in India&apos;s capital. Construction of a metro system and measures to boost the use of buses has barely slowed the increase in traffic in recent years. A decade of rapid economic growth and a broad distaste for public transport among the expanding middle class means there are now 6.8m vehicles on Delhi&apos;s roads, at least twice as many as five years ago. Gridlock is common and, during winter, heavy smog leads to accidents, respiratory diseases and mass flight cancellations. Other Indian cities such as Mumbai, the country&apos;s commercial capital, are considering similar measures. The Delhi scheme would first be implemented in areas around the historical old centre. But experts are sceptical. &quot;If you look at what is already in place to reduce congestion, such as toll gates around Delhi, they make the problem worse, not better,&quot; said Rumi Aijaz, of the city&apos;s Centre for Policy Research thinktank. &quot;Even if the proposal is accepted politically, the necessary infrastructure simply isn&apos;t there.&quot; The tolls on key roads linking Delhi with satellite cities cause huge traffic jams. Occasionally they are the focus of protests that can turn violent. Aijaz said a broader strategy to tackle traffic in the city was necessary. &quot;There has to be a range of measures to manage the issue. Nothing done in isolation will work,&quot; he said. Experts point out that one serious problem is a lack of proper licensing or law enforcement in Delhi. Driving permits can be bought illegally and laws that should ensure safe driving and a smoother traffic flow are routinely ignored. Fines for traffic violations can usually be avoided by paying a small bribe to police officers. There are few cameras, although a Facebook page asking irate commuters to post their own photographs of offenders has met with a massive response. Senior police officers said charging would be a positive step \u2013 if technology to avoid queuing was introduced. But even if the practical obstacles can be overcome, the support of the infamously fractious &quot;delhiwalla&quot; \u2013 inhabitants of the city \u2013 will be hard to win. Some shopkeepers welcomed the move, but their customers were less enthusiastic. &quot;People are already reeling under taxes \u2026 we don&apos;t need any more,&quot; Mamta Choudhary, a teacher who regularly shops in one of the areas designated for the new scheme, told the Times of India newspaper. Ram Thakur, a 45-year-old manager who spends up to two hours a day in traffic driving from the satellite city of Faridabad to his office, said no amount of charging would make him give up the small car that he bought a year ago. &quot;I started on a bicycle and I&apos;ve taken buses for 20 years. Now I am a car owner and life is very much nicer. I am not giving it up to go back on buses or bikes,&quot; he told the Guardian. Dr Robin Hickman, an expert in urban transport at London University, said that implementing a congestion charge in Delhi would be &quot;extremely difficult. &quot;It would probably be a better option to increase tax on fuel in the city and invest the funds generated in public transport,&quot; Hickman, who has worked in Delhi, said.", "tags": ["India", "Road transport", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-08T14:10:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/09/the-rumour-mill-balotelli-stoke", "sentences": ["West Ham&apos;s teeny tiny tactical maestro can be interested all he likes, though, because the Chelsea striker&apos;s off to Shanghai Shenhua if you believe the hot chat."], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Balotelli, Hoilett and Zaha to Stoke City? | Scott Murray", "article": "Chelsea and Manchester City \u2013 if you&apos;re of a certain vintage, those four words together mean the 1986 Full Members Cup final, nothing more, nothing less \u2013 are both in the hunt for Ajax right-back Gregory van der Wiel.

Yes, he really is thinking of living like there&apos;s no tomorrow, and see if he cares! Salomon Kalou is off to Paris St Germain, unlike Rafael Ben\u00edtez, who isn&apos;t.

Or rather, several Lewis Carroll characters come to life. On Tuesday afternoon in Paris, at a long table laid for high tea with a maharaja around which the world&apos;s most expensive and expensively dressed models paraded in his latest collection, he cast himself as the Queen of Hearts, pronouncing himself inspired by India because &quot;even the poor have dignity there&quot;. With Wonderland logic, he explained that this was evidenced by the fact that in India &quot;even poor women own three gold bracelets&quot;. Even by his prolific standards, this week was a vintage one for Lagerfeldisms. The designer delighted in telling the reporters who filed backstage after the Paris-Bombay collection that he had never actually been to India. &quot;Fantasy is often better than reality,&quot; he explained. &quot;It&apos;s much more inspiring not to go to places than to go.&quot; A sentiment with which the Mad Hatter would probably agree. Entitled Paris-Bombay, the collection was steeped in an Indian aesthetic: pearl-beaded Nehru-collared jackets were layered over sari-draped dresses and slim leather churidar trousers, while ornate headpieces dipped diamonds between the models&apos; heavily kohled eyes. The use of Bombay rather than Mumbai was deliberate: Lagerfeld&apos;s India is of an era where the glamour is imperial, rather than Bollywood. One of his references was a palace designed by the German architect Eckart Muthesius in the 1930s for the maharaja of Indore, which combined modernist furniture by Corbusier and Eileen Gray with traditional Indian pieces. The clothes are certainly not for the hoi polloi. (Not even the ones with bracelets and dignity.) Prices will make the pricetags in Chanel&apos;s Bond Street boutique look cheap, since this collection is part of the Metiers d&apos;Arts series, which showcases the craftmanship of the couture ateliers which Chanel now owns. The lavish, intricate hand embroidery of these clothes is as eyewateringly expensive as it is mouthwateringly lovely. Indian reaction to the show was mixed. &quot;Indian fashion can finally claim to have arrived on the international scene, especially when fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld pays an ode to desi styles and trends,&quot; enthused India Today. The Hindustan Times took a rather more acid view of Lagerfeld&apos;s homage, noting that if the intention is to woo an Indian customer, &quot;subtle marketing is clearly not Chanel uber designer Karl Lagerfeld&apos;s strong point&quot;. For while the setting was historical, the reason behind the spotlight on India is very much rooted in the present. Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel&apos;s president of fashion, describes India as &quot;a strong opportunity for the future&quot;. It could be argued that the inspiration for other recent Metiers D&apos;Arts collections \u2013 Paris-Shanghai and Paris-Moscow \u2013 seems to have drawn on economic impulses as well as aesthetic ones. Twenty-four hours later, Lagerfeld had returned from his imperial rabbit hole to the 21st century, announcing to the Le Web conference in Paris an audacious bid to &quot;make history in fashion and technology&quot;. Next month, just one day after the Chanel haute couture fashion show, he will launch a new lower-priced line named Karl. It will be the first online-only launch of a major fashion brand, debuting exclusively at net-a-porter.com before going on sale on karllagerfeld.com. The launch of a collection where a jacket will cost \u00a3200 during the same week as haute couture \u2013 where a Lagerfeld-designed jacket costs \u00a350,000 \u2013 is, of course, deliberately provocative. But Lagerfeld sees a connection between haute couture and online fashion, in that both are devices by which designers showcase their clothes direct to the customer without mediation by journalists or buyers. Lagerfeld, with his high-camp-meets-black-tie dress sense, makes an unlikely Apple geek. However, despite the fact that he is a &quot;paper freak&quot; who does not use email and has a personal library of around 300,000 books, he owns four iPhones, &quot;20 or 30&quot; iPads which he uses as diaries and sketchbooks and &quot;hundreds&quot; of iPods. Onstage at Le Web, he unzipped his manbag to reveal what he carries around during a typical day: one iPad, several iPods and all four iPhones. At times, it is hard to know which version of Karl Lagerfeld is the real thing: sharp-eyed businessman of the digital age, or picturesque refugee from the belle epoque. It is a mystery he enjoys. Backstage after the Paris-Bombay show, a reporter questioned his decision to take inspiration from an India that exists in an imaginary past, rather than visit the real India. &quot;I&apos;m against reality,&quot; he replied.

All things to do with football - not just one small bit, or only half of the things to do with football, or even a quarter or 75%. The Fiver is a fan of it all, all the time, without exception. When it comes to mad-keen football fandom it goes like this. Tim Lovejoy. Prince William. That Portsmouth bell-ringing man with great bouncing tattooed man-belly. Then the Fiver. Then fresh air. Then everyone else. One of the many things that makes the Fiver one of the world&apos;s top all-football fans - rather than, say, someone who just happened to get into writing snarky things about people involved in football as a laughable, quite temporary-seeming but in fact horribly persistent so-called &quot;career&quot; option - is the Fiver&apos;s love of the great club games. Those timeless match-ups that seem to be a vehicle for wider forces. For example Spain&apos;s El Clasico, which pits the tiny, loveable non-corporate, sustainable wooden shoe-wearing Steve Jobs-style ewoks of Barcelona against Real Madrid&apos;s evil Franco-worshipping Death Star-building Microsoft-esque Fourth Reich. Or the Glasgow derby, which gives the hate-crazed nutcases of [insert Glasgow team here] the opportunity to shout complex historical abuse at the hate-crazed nutcases of [other Glasgow team]. So many great games, such a rich sense of cultural history - and the good news is the Premier League now finally has one to compete with the best of them. Yes, this evening Chelsea will host Manchester City in the latest, and most frothingly exciting, clash of the Big Rich Petrol-Splurging Two, a match the Fiver is confident will soon be routinely referred to as El Carbonco. Like all the great games it&apos;s very much a meeting of ideological opposites: the fossil-fuel powered newbie against the fossil-fuel powered slightly olderbie; the overpaid squad of hardened Euro-mercenaries against the overpaid squad of Euro-mercenaries; the ones in blue against the ones in blue. So many points of contrast. It&apos;s like E.ON versus npower. Do you like your transformative oil money extracted from Persian Gulf state wells? Or do you prepare Siberian natural gas? For City this is a chance to re-establish a 19-point league at the top of table [note: Fiver&apos;s extreme football fandom prevents it from checking the exact number of points involved here]. They will have to do so without marauding Micah Richards, who has calf-knack. Plus it&apos;s also defiant T-shirt time for Mario Balotelli who is in trouble after being spotted in the wee hours of Sunday in a city-centre restaurant called, for some reason, Zouk. Chelsea must cope without David Luiz who is banned for passing 500 domestic bookings for the season. And with that, all that remains is to settle in for the season&apos;s first El Carbonco. Will it be victory for the ones with the handsome thrusting young manager in the nice suit? The ones who used to be a slightly boring, annihilating force but are now a bit more exciting? Or the ones who have affected a destabilising mini-boom on an entire league structure in the past few years? All that seems certain is that the Fiver will be hoping for a match full of raw passion, men being angry at referees, pictures of Frank Lampard sitting down looking glum and both clubs put in a sack at the end and thrown into the Thames from the Wandsworth Embankment. The Fiver is fairly confident that it only thought that last bit inside its head. \u2022 Join John Ashdown from 7.30pm for live MBM coverage of Chelsea 1-2 Manchester City. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;Gary has been fantastic - he has impressed everybody. People like listening to him - I know I certainly do. The hour on a Monday night before the game is always fascinating, hearing someone talk who knows what they&apos;re talking about. I don&apos;t think he has been outspoken at all - that&apos;s the one thing he hasn&apos;t been. He has done Manchester City games, Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea and I think he has given a fair account of what has been happening. Even though he is a die-hard United fan I don&apos;t think anyone can label what he has said. Since he&apos;s been on Sky I think he has been pretty impartial&quot; - Phil Neville offers a completely impartial verdict on his brother&apos;s punditry skills.  FIVER LETTERS &quot;Re: Friday&apos;s last line. After falling for the first drop of his shoulder five times, and guessing his first movement wrong, I gave up. What chance did Peter Reid et al have?&quot; - Jack Millington. &quot;Am I drunk? I just read a joke in the Fiver and had to explain to colleagues why I was laughing out loud in the office&quot; - Jon Clark. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you&apos;ve nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. BITS AND BOBS Yet more proof that football fans aren&apos;t always Mensa-botherers: after some controversial decisions from the referee Chris Foy in their match at Stoke, Tottenham fans have bombarded Sir Chris Hoy with sour nothings on social-networking travesty Twitter. Nicolas Anelka has signed a two-year-deal to accept loads of coin from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua, whom he will join in January. Shanghai also want to throw money at Didier Drogba. Bolton manager Owen Coyle ain&apos;t &apos;fraid of no P45. &quot;I have never ran from a fight in my life,&quot; he said, &quot;but if someone felt there was a better solution for the football club, I have no problem with that.&quot; Arsenal fans have received a boost with the news that Andre Santos will be out for around three months. There was more good news when Marouane Chamakh announced he may leave the club next summer in pursuit of regular football. Football club in principled behaviour shock: Sydney have fined their defender Shannon Cole for diving against Gold Coast United on Sunday. And Johan Cruyff&apos;s latest tedious bid to control absolutely everything within a 500-mile radius received a boost when a judge temporarily suspended Louis van Gaal&apos;s appointment as Ajax director. Cruyff says the appointment clashes with his plan, some pompous-sounding youth project called The Future. STILL WANT MORE? Sid Lowe knows what real bravery is, and it&apos;s not headbutting a wall 947 times. It&apos;s what Victor Valdes and Barcelona did in El Clasico on Saturday. So what&apos;s the worst Christmas present you&apos;ve ever received? Whatever it is, we&apos;ll wager it&apos;s not as bad as some of these. Stoke are like Barcelona, Blackburn need Gok Wan, and other things we learned this weekend. We locked Michael Cox in an air-conditioned room with some chalk and a board. This is what happened. And then we locked him in a pod with AC Jimbo, Simon Burnton and Rob Smyth. Here&apos;s the result.

Now he&apos;s come up with an idea that could very well change the way we read it. Instead of publishing the script of his recent play, The Blue Dragon, Lepage&apos;s theatre company Ex Machina decided to take an entirely different route, commissioning Quebec City-based artist Fred Jourdain to transform it into a graphic novel. Now published in English by Toronto&apos;s House of Anansi Press, Jourdain&apos;s gorgeous mise en images of the play, which appeared in Britain at the Barbican earlier this year, includes every word of dialogue spread over 176 pages of comic-book panels and cinema-inspired paintings. The Blue Dragon, which Lepage co-wrote with longtime collaborator Marie Michaud, tells the story of a love triangle between Pierre Lamontagne, an expat art dealer in Shanghai; his ex-lover Claire For\u00eat, who has come to China from Canada to adopt a baby; and a young Chinese artist named Xiao Ling. The Shanghai setting only partially seen (and heard) through the stage design is fully fleshed out in the book, while the characters retain a strong resemblance to the actors who played them in the original production. (The comic-book version of Lepage, as Lamontagne, looks pretty much exactly like him, if a little more stubbly.) While I&apos;m usually content to pick up a play&apos;s text when I can&apos;t see a production on stage, reading plays for pleasure can be a frustratingly incomplete experience. Plays aren&apos;t, after all, written to be read. (Closet dramas excluded, of course.) Particularly when it comes to practitioners of visually oriented theatre such as Lepage, words only capture a sliver of the work&apos;s appeal. I remember studying the script of one of Lepage&apos;s plays and thinking: &quot;What&apos;s the big deal with this guy?&quot; The Blue Dragon graphic novel goes much further in capturing what is so special about Lepage&apos;s work. From Annie to Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, theatre hasn&apos;t been shy about stealing from comics culture; I wonder why the reverse hasn&apos;t been true? Sure, there are plenty of Shakespeare comic-book adaptations \u2013 such as the Manga Shakespeare series \u2013 but I can only think of a few fringe comic books based on contemporary plays. Many of us would enjoy reading a Complicite or Punchdrunk comic book, and I suspect War Horse could be turned into an excellent graphic novel. More traditional, text-centred work might benefit from this treatment, too. Imagine reading one of Harold Pinter&apos;s plays and being able to see what&apos;s going on during those enigmatic pauses \u2013 at least according to one cartoonist&apos;s interpretation. Brad Fraser, a fan of comic books, tells me he&apos;s at work on a graphic-novel adaptation of Snake in Fridge, his play which premiered at the Royal Exchange in Manchester in 2000.

Nicolas Anelka had landed back in Europe, at Heathrow, after his World Cup tantrum in South Africa had sparked mutiny and meltdown in the France camp. He was click\u2011clicked every step of his way to the getaway car. He did not need the shades. Anelka&apos;s public face has always resembled a mask; the eyes staring impassively into the distance, whether in triumph or disaster. When the striker became a Champions League winner in 2000 with Real Madrid \u2013 he started in the 3-0 victory over Valencia in Paris \u2013 he seemed cut off, somewhat isolated, in the post-match celebrations. Spool forward to the 2008 final in Moscow and when his shootout miss for Chelsea saw Manchester United crowned as the champions, unleashing extremes of emotion in all quarters, there was barely a flicker from him. Anelka&apos;s nonchalance borders on the fatalistic; his professionalism is so icy that he regularly invites the accusation that he does not give a fig. His transfer from Chelsea to Shanghai Shenhua, from the &quot;greatest league in the world&quot; to the fringes of the world game, at the age of 32, feels like his latest cold-blooded career decision. He might have been lining up at Stamford Bridge against Manchester City, one of his many former clubs, in one of the English season&apos;s showpiece games. Instead, he is preparing to leap into the unknown in January. It ought to be mildly shocking yet Anelka has lost the capacity to shock. He merely polarises opinion like few others. He is a hero to the kids in the banlieues, an icon with the power to roll up one of his tracksuit legs to the knee and spark a fashion craze. There are few players cooler than Anelka. But to many others in France he is seen as a mercenary who will be forever tainted by his rant at the national team&apos;s manager, Raymond Domenech, at half-time in a 2010 World Cup group fixture against Mexico. &quot;Go and fuck yourself and your tactics,&quot; Anelka told Domenech. After refusing to apologise, he was put on a flight to London, the end of his World Cup coming shortly before that of his country. His international career was effectively over when he was given an 18-game suspension. &quot;I&apos;m dying of laughter,&quot; he said. When Domenech&apos;s players went on strike over Anelka&apos;s expulsion, it showed his popularity in dressing rooms. Apart from at Madrid, when established stars made sure he was never welcomed, he has been well liked. At Chelsea, there was tremendous admiration for him and no little disillusionment when he was marginalised and then banished by Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. Authority can fire Anelka&apos;s non-conformist streak. If he has always tended to put himself first, he does not take kindly to being treated with disrespect. A hasty exit was likely when Villas-Boas told him he could not use the first-team facilities, after he had requested a transfer. It took him less than a week to finalise his two-year contract at Shenhua, which is worth \u20ac10.6m (\u00a38.9m) a year. Some misconceptions have built around Anelka. He was not a disadvantaged Parisian urbanite \u2013 he was born in Versailles and his parents had regular jobs. He is a committed family man, a father of two boys who enjoys nothing more than quiet time. He believes that Shanghai will be a great city for the children. But he has allowed the enigmatic image to grow, spiced by his apparent wanderlust, the transfer fees that total \u00a385.8m and the influence of his brothers Claude and Didier, who advise him \u2013 some would say badly. Anelka would argue that his move from Arsenal to Madrid came too early; that he wanted to stay at Liverpool; and that the transfers to City, Fenerbahce and Bolton were part of the quest to return to a leading club. Anelka attended the Clairefontaine centre of excellence with Thierry Henry and was thought the better prospect. He was the prototype modern No9: jet-heeled, super fit and efficient, with silky smooth technique. But if he can look like the best player on any pitch, he has also shown infuriating inconsistency and, at times, indifference. The debate rages as to whether he has fulfilled his potential. In 1997, at the Under-20 World Cup, Anelka missed a penalty in a quarter-final shootout lost to Uruguay. The France manager, G\u00e9rard Houllier, spoke of him lacking mental strength but being honest enough to recognise it. Plenty of people have got between the hip-hop beat in Anelka&apos;s ears and found complexity.

Roberto Mancini is your man. Looking for tips on how to set off fireworks without setting your house ablaze and overcoming grass allergies that manifest themselves with baffling infrequency? Mancini can hook you up with someone in the know. Looking for the hottest ticket in town for a match featuring a team managed by Mancini? Sorry, Mancini can&apos;t help, even if you are a good pal. We know this because of the vantage point of the chum that Mancini invoked when expressing his incredulity at Mark Clattenburg&apos;s refusal to award a penalty after David Silva went down following a mis-timed tackle by Jose Bosingwa at Stamford Bridge last night. &quot;There was a friend of mine outside the stadium who saw the penalty but the referee didn&apos;t,&quot; gasped Mancini. &quot;Maybe because it rained a lot,&quot; added the Italian in a blistering broadside at the British weather. Yes, Bosingwa&apos;s leg was flailing clumsily in the vicinity of Silva, and the new oracle of punditry, Gary Neville, declared that it definitely caught the Spaniard&apos;s knee. But the Fiver was watching the match through a beery fug and several fat heads down the Quaff and Barf, and even after several replays and refills we couldn&apos;t assert categorically that Bosingwa made contact. And we certainly couldn&apos;t go so far as to say that decision was definitely the reason that City lost in the league for the first time this season. We&apos;d suggest that had more to do with yet more slovenly defending, Mancini&apos;s decision to take off all his attacking players just before Chelsea took the lead and, of course, the loyalty and lionhearted rectitude of Frank of Lampard, who, by the way assorted admirers in the media are going on, is the only player in the world who could have converted a spot-kick last night. &quot;It&apos;s easy to stand aside and let someone else take it but I wanted to win for the team,&quot; boomed Lampard, whose goal came after a splendid strike by Raul Meireles, the man who was again chosen to start ahead of Lampard. &quot;I&apos;ve been in a good run of form and now I&apos;ve not been playing \u2013 I haven&apos;t spoken [to Andre Villas-Boas] so I don&apos;t know [why],&quot; explained Lampard. Well, the Fiver is no confidant of Villas-Boas but it fancies it knows why. Lampard himself might be able to hazard a guess if he consulted DVDs of Chelsea matches before he was dropped. He would note, no doubt, that his passing and shooting are still as accurate as ever when he&apos;s on the ball and may also note that getting him on the ball seems to be increasingly difficult due to declining dynamism that makes him something of a passenger, albeit one who can still influence games in cameos. &quot;This was a very good win for the players,&quot; hurrahed Villa-Boas, whose reinvention of Chelsea is taking effect. The Portuguese&apos;s task, surely, is to keep within touching distance of the likes of City until January, when he can further his overhaul of the team with extensive trading and hope they all gel in time to overtake the City bandwagon. &quot;Seven points in this Premier League title is nothing, many games will continue to happen, and we believe in our title challenge. But for our title challenge to continue to be alive we will have to continue to be competent. We have to continue to perform.

Former Sweden midfielder Pelle Blohm, who played in China in the mid-90s, has offered Nicolas Anelka some advice on Chinese fans ahead of the Chelsea striker&apos;s move to Shanghai Shenhua: &quot;They&apos;ll often laugh if someone gets a ball in the face \u2013 they&apos;re ashamed for that player because he loses face, but they laugh at the situation,&quot; he said.

The manufacturing monster of the east is expected to suffer a rapid slowdown following the collapse in demand across the eurozone, according to several analysts. Without a strong and growing European market, they say, China&apos;s export driven industrial and commercial sector must see its current 9% growth rate lose momentum. For a country that needs 5-6% growth just to keep pace with population growth, the eurozone recession could make for a hard landing in Beijing. HSBC and Standard Chartered, two of the largest western banks operating in the region, have reaffirmed their confidence in the China growth story. But Standard Chartered, while pencilling in 8.1% growth next year, is extremely worried by a growing housing bubble and the lack of a broad base of domestic consumption. At the moment even some of the poorest households save much of their income. Without higher taxes, giving rise to more sophisticated government services like health and social care, and protection from poverty in old age (better pensions would help) people feel compelled to save. Standard Chartered&apos;s chief economist Gerard Lyons is of the firm belief that the head-in-the-sand approach of the Chinese leadership, many of whom are up for election, could, &quot;given the complex and interconnected nature of the current challenges&quot;, mean the strategy stops working. Michael Derks, chief strategist at currency trader FxPro, takes an even gloomier view. As Michael writes in English, readers can read his own words. He says: &quot;Europe may be terrifying, but equally frightening are the signs that China&apos;s booming economy is rapidly unravelling. &quot;Recent surveys of manufacturing suggest that growth in the sector is actually contracting, money supply growth last month was the slowest for more than a decade and export growth has slowed markedly, especially to Europe. Property prices are declining and quite quickly in some major cities. For instance, one survey of new home prices in Beijing claimed that they fell by more than one-third in November alone. &quot;As is so often the case, excess leverage is amplifying China&apos;s slide.

Toe-punt! Having done a penalty, he ran off to celebrate. He was really happy that he had done a penalty. You could tell he was really happy because he was frowning and shouting and thumping the badge on his titend with his fist and frowning a bit more and screaming. Then he went off to give some passive-aggressive interviews to the media about how he doesn&apos;t know why he doesn&apos;t get to play all the time WHEN HE WANTS because he is only 33 and he is more influential than Pele. In fact, Frank was so happy at doing his penalty that it looks like he&apos;s going to spend the entire week celebrating by frowning and getting a bit hot in the face and screaming I WANT I WANT I WANT I WANT I WANT I WANT I WANT I WANT ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME like a cross between Veruca Salt and someone on Twitter.

(For the record, exactly one centimetre wider than Jose Mourinho&apos;s.) The big-leggy Villas Boas is also magnificently uninterested in the needs and desires of Fernando Torres, who \u2013 and here&apos;s why Frank should thank his lucky stars for getting the occasional run-out, and stop flapping his gums so furiously \u2013 is currently stored in a box underneath the larder stairs. Or did they put him in the loft? &quot;I&apos;m sorry, Torres is not available at any price,&quot; drawled swoonsome Andre, with such supercool detachment that it was unclear whether he was chastising reporters who had linked the striker with a move back to Atletico Madrid, or ironically apologising to Chelsea fans for keeping hold of him. &quot;Everyone wants to be involved more, Fernando is pushing for a place. It is a question of time when we see him back, sooner or later I don&apos;t know, but we have to make the best decision for the team.&quot; So that&apos;s Fernando told, too: with Chelsea target David Villa having broken his leg while playing for Barcelona at the Blatter Platter, Torres will have to stay put, just in case he&apos;s needed in an emergency, and like it.

Why else would the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards, which take place next week, have no women on the short list? I currently hold the title of British 100m champion, and reached the final of this event at the Beijing Olympics. On seeing the short list, I was disappointed but not surprised that there were no female nominees, because I do not remember seeing any significant media coverage around any of\u00a0our female world champions. What message are we sending out to our young females when our sports editors would rather pick three non-Brits for a British award than one of our own world champions? And what does this say about our nation just months before the biggest sporting year in our recent history? It&apos;s time the media broke with the status quo and gave decent coverage to female excellence in sport. The sports personality awards present\u00a0a brilliant opportunity to celebrate our nation&apos;s elite sportsmen and women. With top sportswomen on the list, young females can be inspired and gain the confidence to explore activities that help them fulfill their potential. The awards also acknowledge the unsung heroes who have tirelessly worked behind the scenes to help develop world-class athletes. Unfortunately, these grassroots opportunities seem to be more appealing for boys than for girls, but many believe the lack of women&apos;s sport on television plays a crucial role. In netball, for example, the England squad are ranked third in the world, but the lack of media coverage means it will never attract enough followers to become a high-profile sport. It will merely remain a staple of the PE curriculum. To encourage the necessary changes, British sportswomen need to become role models for young girls who are considering sport, but risk being put off. Alongside training for the 2012 Olympics, I also work for the Youth Sport\u00a0Trust, delivering a programme in\u00a0schools to encourage participation among young children. What is\u00a0evident is that British women have the\u00a0highest level of obesity in Europe, and one of the lowest rates of participation in school sport. Only 22% of girls aged 16-17 in the UK engage in the recommended daily level of sport, compared with 48% of boys. It is clear that extensive work still needs to be done to encourage young girls to take part in competitive sport \u2013 regardless of whether or not they have aspirations to become the next Jessica Ennis. Initiatives with high-profile female athletes should be rolled out with the curriculum. As next summer&apos;s Olympic extravaganza approaches, and profiles continue to rise, I live in hope that our female world champions and my fellow Team GB members, such as Kerri-Anne Payne and Victoria Pendleton, can dispel the myth that you cannot be feminine and powerful at the same time.", "tags": ["BBC Sports Personality of the Year", "Sport", "Media", "BBC", "Women", "Life and style", "Gender", "World news", "Equality"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-15T21:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/16/schools-exam-system-not-fit", "sentences": ["And in Shanghai, China, as Mansell points out, school-by-school exam results tends not to be published \u2013 yet this didn&apos;t stop Shanghai from taking the top spot in last year&apos;s Pisa rankings."], "title": "Our schools exam system is\u00a0no longer fit for purpose | Mehdi Hasan", "article": "It was a sorry sight. On Thursday, the heads of England&apos;s four exam boards, as well as three of their examiners, filed into the Thatcher Room of Portcullis House to be quizzed by MPs on the education select committee. The examiners had been secretly filmed by the Daily Telegraph offering teachers advice on how to boost their exam results \u2013 from telling them which topics their pupils could expect to be tested on, to advising them on how to &quot;hammer exam technique&quot; \u2013 and subsequently suspended by their boards. However, in the midst of their litany of excuses (&quot;We all make mistakes,&quot; whined one examiner; &quot;It was a throwaway figure of speech,&quot; wailed another), some revealing remarks were made. Mark Dawe, chief executive of exam board OCR, told MPs there is &quot;an enormous amount of pressure on the system&quot;. Suspended examiner Paul Barnes admitted there are &quot;pressures to raise achievements&quot;, and that it is a &quot;competitive world&quot;. They have a point. The corruption of the testing regime is only a symptom. The disease is the tyranny of testing itself; a culture of relentless exams, spurious league tables and artificial competition between schools. Our exam system isn&apos;t fit for purpose. English children are now the most tested children in the industrialised world (thanks to devolution, their Scottish and Welsh cousins do not suffer the same burden of examination); the average pupil will be subjected to at least 70\u00a0tests during his or her school career. This preoccupation with testing is bad for schools, teachers and pupils. For schools, the costs have ballooned: spending on exam fees nearly doubled, to over \u00a3300m, between 2002 and 2010. Astonishingly, exams now account for the second biggest cost to schools after teachers&apos; pay. For teachers, it is deeply demoralising and demotivating to have to &quot;teach to the test&quot;, as so many of them are forced to do. For many, teaching has become dull, narrow and uninspiring. There is no reward for creativity, only results, results, results. For pupils, high-stakes tests are a well-documented source of stress and anxiety. According to children&apos;s charities, this can physically manifest itself as sleep-loss, bed-wetting or skin disorders. Critics of the current system abound, and include the education select committee, the Children&apos;s Society, the Royal Society and various academics. In 2009, for example, a Cambridge University review of primary education described national testing as &quot;the elephant in the curriculum&quot; and noted that in the final year of primary school &quot;breadth competes with the much narrower scope of what is to be tested&quot;. In his book Education by Numbers: The Tyranny of Testing, Warwick Mansell explains how a strategy of &quot;pursuing results almost as ends in themselves has been forced on schools, in their desperation to fulfil the requirements of hyper-accountability&quot;. But, he writes, &quot;this grades race is ultimately self-defeating. It does not guarantee better educated pupils, just better statistics for schools and the government.&quot; He documents how primary school pupils spend an average of 150 hours purely in preparation for the Sats tests: &quot;England&apos;s education system is now an exams system,&quot; he says. Mansell&apos;s book should be required reading for the test-obsessed education secretary, Michael Gove, and his Labour shadow, Stephen Twigg. Politically motivated meddling in the examination system, by both Conservatives and Labour, has done little to boost school standards or pupil performance. Over the past decade, according to the OECD&apos;s Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) global survey of 15-year-olds, Britain has slipped from fourth to 16th in science, seventh to 25th in literacy, and eighth to 28th in maths. The OECD&apos;s Economic Survey 2011 points out how, in spite of school spending per pupil rising sharply over the past decade, improvements in educational outcomes have been limited, bolstered only by grade inflation. The OECD notes that &quot;high-stake tests&quot; have proliferated in England, and yet these can often &quot;produce perverse incentives&quot; and &quot;lead to negligence of non-cognitive skill formation&quot;. So what if we took a radically different approach? What if we scrapped all\u00a0the endless exams, abolished the headline-grabbing school league tables, and freed our teachers to teach kids how to think instead of how to take a test? Would our schools get better or worse? Finland provides a clue. The country has topped the various Pisa rankings over the last 10 years. But Finland has no league tables, no school inspections, no pupil-by-pupil tests. In fact, the first national test a Finnish child sits is when he or she is about to leave school, at 18. The government does carry out regular assessments of school performance, by testing representative samples of students, but these are only for internal use and the results aren&apos;t published. The Finns prefer to empower their teachers, who tend to be better-qualified and better-paid than our own. But it&apos;s not just sandal-wearing Scandinavians. Take Japan. A recent report for\u00a0the Japanese ministry of education said the country should &quot;avoid school ranking and unhealthy competition&quot;. And in Shanghai, China, as Mansell points out, school-by-school exam results tends not to be published \u2013 yet this didn&apos;t stop Shanghai from taking the top spot in last year&apos;s Pisa rankings. Here in the UK, though, we have fetishised exams and deified league tables; we have prioritised test results \u2013 statistics, numbers, scores \u2013 over the hearts and, crucially, minds of our children. And to what purpose? Exams are means, not ends; they do not, of themselves, raise standards or produce better-educated children. Nor do they truly measure the qualities necessary for a well-rounded education \u2013 from independent reasoning to creative thinking. Instead, in the words of the US educational psychologist Joseph Renzulli, we have created a new version of the Three Rs: &quot;ram, remember, regurgitate&quot;. For far too long, the debate over exams in this country has revolved around &quot;dumbing down&quot;. The issue, however, is not whether exams are easier or harder than they once were but what role they serve. To conflate mere test results with a high-quality education is to do a disservice to our children. The truth is that education by exam isn&apos;t an education worthy of the name.", "tags": ["Education", "Schools", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-16T21:15:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/sue-arnold-audiobook-choice-reviews", "sentences": ["As for her legendary sexual domination of &quot;the little man&quot;, as all his mistresses referred to him, until the &quot;China Dossier&quot; \u2013 said to detail how Wallis had learned techniques variously called the Baltimore grip, Shanghai squeeze or China clinch when living in the Far East \u2013 we could only guess what went on in the master bedroom."], "title": "Sue Arnold's audiobook choice \u2013 reviews", "article": "That Woman, by Anne Sebba, read by Samantha Bond (11\u00bdhrs unabridged, Orion, \u00a325) As the femme fatale for whose love a king renounced his throne, the universally reviled Mrs Simpson must be thanked for saving the nation \u2013 better make that the Empire, which was still around in 1938 \u2013 from being ruled by a man described by Lord Wigram, George VI&apos;s private secretary, as almost certainly certifiable.

Wallis, n\u00e9e Bessie Warfield from Baltimore, remains the ruthlessly ambitious, gold-digging socialite portrayed on screen by, among others, Faye Dunaway, Joely Richardson and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Which means that backstage it&apos;s very smelly, the language is of the gutter, and the testosterone is off the charts. I first worked for this company in 1998 when I performed, er, Henry V with them. At the Watermill in Newbury, the director Ed Hall had an idea about creating a Henry V with a bunch of male actors who would play modern-day soldiers telling the story through the words of the Chorus. The ethos of the company was founded in a small theatre, where the play was bounded by the audience and thus had no set to get in the way of the action. All we had was the same as Shakespeare had: a group of blokes, some costumes and a stage. Actors lived on site; songs that were sung in the Green Room until the early hours found their way into the show; routines created in the bar were used the next day in rehearsal. Out of this came a house style based on camaraderie, humour, hopefully some intelligence, and a good deal of pace and precision. In the years since, the company has gone on to play the West End, Broadway and all over the world. Now we are once again performing Henry V, and this is my first time back after my own travels with the Royal Shakespeare Company. It&apos;s great to be back, and nice to be doing a show with my mates. This is theatre, so you get to know and trust your fellow performers very quickly, but there is nothing like being on stage with a guy who has been one of your best friends for 13 years \u2013 you seem to know where they&apos;re going to go, what they&apos;re going to do.

I have had the privilege of being in a couple of the great ensembles over the past 15 years \u2013 firstly Propeller and then the Histories company at the RSC \u2013 and they have both had the advantage of time. We spent five weeks rehearsing this crazy show. We even underwent military training three times a week. Some really enjoyed it, others (like me) merely used it as an excuse to get to the bar faster. But it did form us into a cohesive unit.

Another democracy campaigner, Chen Wei, was sentenced to nine years on 23 December. The two men are not related. It is one of the heaviest sentences for inciting subversion since the Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years on Christmas Day 2009. Arrests and detentions have gathered pace this year as the Communist party reacted to online calls for protests like those that have toppled dictators across the Middle East. The calls, however, have drawn little response and no large-scale protests have taken place in China. The intermediate people&apos;s court in Guiyang, in south-west China&apos;s Guizhou region, tried Chen Xi, 57, on charges linked to more than 30 political essays he published online. &quot;The judge said this was a major crime that had a malign impact,&quot; his wife, Zhang Qunxuan, told Reuters by phone after the trial. The judge said Chen was a repeat offender who deserved a long sentence, she added. Chen has insisted he was innocent, but will not appeal. &quot;The court ignored all the points raised by the defence lawyer at the trial, so what point is there in appealing?&quot; said Zhang. He was detained on 29 November after campaigning for independent candidates to win seats in upcoming elections to the local People&apos;s Congress. His family were given notice of the trial on Saturday. Chen is a leading member of the Guizhou Human Rights Forum, which has been declared an illegal organisation, according to Amnesty. The former factory worker was first jailed in 1989 for supporting student protests in Tiananmen Square, then served a second, 10-year jail term from 1995 to 2006. Both he and Chen Wei signed Charter 08, which urges political reforms. Chen Wei also took part in the 1989 student movement. He was sentenced in Suining, Sichuan province, for incitement to subversion relating to four essays online. Beijing&apos;s nervousness about criticism has led to tighter online controls. On Sunday Shanghai became the latest large city to order Chinese tweeters to register their real names when opening accounts, the Xinhua news agency reported. Twitter is banned in China but lively debate, cynical jokes and criticisms of official corruption spread rapidly on home-grown services such as Sina Weibo. The decision applies to new users from Monday, and will eventually cover all\u00a0users. The new real-name registration rules were first applied in Beijing on 16 December, then expanded to Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The EU ambassador to Beijing, Markus Ederer, said on Saturday that the EU was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the nine-year sentence given to Chen Wei. &quot;The EU firmly upholds freedom of expression as a universal human right and we encourage political debate rather than the use of criminal law as a means to resolve diverging political opinions,&quot; Ederer said.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-26T09:23:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/27/florent-malouda-january-transfer-chelsea", "sentences": ["Nicolas Anelka has joined the Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua and the Brazil centre-half Alex is transfer-listed and available, with Bolton Wanderers&apos; Gary Cahill to replace him and the Juventus winger Milos Krasic, on loan, the most likely immediate additions to Villas-Boas&apos;s options further up the pitch."], "title": "Florent Malouda seeks January transfer from Chelsea as Euro 2012 nears", "article": "Florent Malouda has expressed his frustration with life on the fringes of the Chelsea first team and would be willing to leave Stamford Bridge next month, particularly if an offer materialises from Paris St-Germain that is deemed acceptable by the London club. The 31-year-old France international, signed from Lyon for \u00a313.5m in the summer of 2007, has found his chances limited since the arrival of Juan Mata. Chelsea have been reluctant to indicate whether they would seek to prolong Malouda&apos;s stay at the club as he enters the final 18 months of his current contract, with a parting of ways having been expected at the end of the season. That exit could yet be brought forward should Carlo Ancelotti seek to be reunited with the player in France. The former Chelsea manager is expected to be formally announced as Antoine Kombouar\u00e9&apos;s replacement at PSG next month with the incumbent in the process of being sacked despite steering the money-flushed club to the top of Ligue\u00a01. Malouda is anxious to gain regular first\u2011team football ahead of Euro\u00a02012 and neither the size of any transfer fee nor his salary demands would be a problem for the Parisian club&apos;s Qatari owners. &quot;I&apos;m not getting enough playing time,&quot; said Malouda. &quot;It&apos;s too limited for the ambitions I have. I can&apos;t be happy with that. If it is necessary, I will leave.&quot; The instinct of the Chelsea manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas\u2011Boas, will be to retain Malouda&apos;s services until the summer unless any offer is simply too good to turn down, with the Portuguese expecting limited business in the midwinter transfer window. Nicolas Anelka has joined the Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua and the Brazil centre-half Alex is transfer-listed and available, with Bolton Wanderers&apos; Gary Cahill to replace him and the Juventus winger Milos Krasic, on loan, the most likely immediate additions to Villas-Boas&apos;s options further up the pitch. Any attempts by Guangzhou Evergrande to secure Didier Drogba before the summer will be resisted. The Londoners will add one more player to their defensive ranks by re\u2011registering Sam Hutchinson in their senior squad with the Premier League next month. The 22-year-old defender had retired from football in August 2010 with a serious knee complaint, but continued to work with the club&apos;s academy while he pursued his coaching qualifications. However, having been drafted into the club&apos;s reserve squad this term and proving his fitness in the process, Hutchinson signed an 18-month deal earlier this month and will now become an option for Villas\u2011Boas&apos;s first-team squad.", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Transfer window", "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas", "Paris Saint-Germain", "Premier League 2011-12", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-27T18:12:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/27/britain-stores-tempt-chinese-shoppers", "sentences": ["The biggest push so far to this end has just finished, a promotional tour of Beijing and Shanghai led by the VisitBritain tourism organisation."], "title": "Britain's stores tempt Chinese shoppers", "article": "As a harbinger of a gradual shift in global power it is easy to miss: a discreet red, blue and green banded symbol bearing the mysterious legend UnionPay. But walk into Harrods, Selfridges and other high-end stores and you will see it at many tills, meaning the shop accepts China&apos;s most popular bank card and is thus actively chasing income from one of the few global economies still expanding at speed. The taste among mainland Chinese consumers for luxury brands is nothing new. Louis Vuitton first set up shop in Beijing in 1992, and now has almost 40 outlets inside the country; within a few years Burberry will have 100. More notable is the current effort being expended by UK stores to target high-spending Chinese tourists who will \u2013 they hope \u2013 plug the gap left by austerity-conscious Britons. The biggest push so far to this end has just finished, a promotional tour of Beijing and Shanghai led by the VisitBritain tourism organisation. It included representatives from London&apos;s Westfield shopping centre, the luxury goods emporium at Bicester in Oxfordshire, and even Gretna Green, which now has its own similar retail park, as well as Harrods and Selfridges. At stake is a slice of a still relatively small but fast growing and high-spending tourism market. China accounted for just under 110,000 visits to Britain last year, a 23% annual increase. Of equal significance for retailers, the overall spend by Chinese nationals rose even faster, by 57%. The trend appears to be accelerating, with VisitBritain recording a near-doubling of the spend per Chinese tourist during 2011. &quot;The reason all these retailers came with us to China is that at a time when domestic demand is, let&apos;s say, soft, the Chinese market is expanding,&quot; said Patricia Yates of VisitBritain, who led the mission. &quot;If you&apos;re a retailer looking at where growth is going to come from then China is hugely important.&quot; A spokesman for Selfridges said sales to Chinese customers had in recent years &quot;consistently achieved high double-digit growth numbers&quot;. He said: &quot;Chinese customers are of growing importance to Selfridges, have been for the past four to five years and will remain so in the foreseeable future.&quot; Even with annual growth still hovering near 10% China remains significantly poorer overall than the UK, with average incomes little more than a fifth of those here. However, the wealth is disproportionately based among an urban elite prone to conspicuous displays of economic status. While this group remains proportionately tiny, China&apos;s 1.3bn population makes them sizeable in absolute terms \u2013 one report earlier this year said the country has 960,000 people worth at least \u00a31m each. With luxury brands taxed at high rates in China, a trip abroad inevitably involves a fair degree of shopping for the country&apos;s new rich. Britain lags some way behind countries such as France in popularity. Aside from the draw of well-known brands, France offers a Schengen zone-wide visa, allowing travel within Europe, while the UK requires a separate document. With this in mind, UK shops are working all the harder to make Chinese shoppers welcome. A pioneer of this has been Bicester Village, where Mandarin-speaking &quot;concierges&quot; take groups round the shops, helping to explain mysteries such as UK clothes sizing. The complex is reaping the benefits, with takings from Chinese shoppers rising almost 80% year-on-year. Chinese-speaking sales staff are common in some places, with Harrods alone employing more than 70. But there is another aspect, according to the association representing shops in London&apos;s upmarket Bond Street. A spokeswoman said: &quot;It&apos;s not just about bringing in staff because they can speak Mandarin. They have to know about, say, the jewels and the mechanisms of a watch someone is buying. The Chinese tend to be very well informed. It&apos;s also the small things, like the way they greet customers coming in, that they&apos;re trained to take their credit cards with two hands, almost like a presentation. They have to know how to make customers feel at home.&quot; And when people are spending significant sums, they need to be parted from their money as efficiently as possible, which is where UnionPay comes in. It is less than 18 months since the cards were first accepted in any UK shop. Now Selfridges, the pioneer in accepting it, has 75 UnionPay machines while Harrods has 100. The big brands While the major French labels such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci remain perhaps the biggest draws for wealthy Chinese shoppers, British brands are on the rise. Apart from the ubiquitous Burberry, Bicester Village reports brisk trade at stores selling Mulberry, Dunhill and Pringle, even, for the more daring, Vivienne Westwood. Bond Street in London sees a similar pattern, a spokeswoman said: &quot;They tend to go for the brands they already know, but there is a growing interest in quintessential British brands, like Asprey, or Gieves and Hawkes. You&apos;ll find the Chinese in Jermyn Street as well, looking at shirts or handmade shoes.&quot;", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business", "China", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-27T18:52:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/29/transfer-window-club-guide-premier-league", "sentences": ["Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, has identified a centre-back to replace Alex, and could seek to strengthen his attacking ranks with Nicolas Anelka sold to Shanghai Shenhua and both Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou away at the Africa Cup of Nations."], "title": "Transfer window shopping: Premier League club-by-club guide", "article": "Arsenal What they need Ars\u00e8ne Wenger requires short-term cover at left-back to compensate for the serious injuries to Andr\u00e9 Santos and Kieran Gibbs while he also wants something similar up front, where he only has three recognised centre-forwards and will lose one of them \u2013 Marouane Chamakh \u2013 and the winger Gervinho to the Africa Cup of Nations. There are constant worries that Robin van Persie will break down. Money to spend Yes. Lots. And Arsenal&apos;s fans want to see the club&apos;s multi-million pound profits spent on eye-catching recruits. Ins and outs Wayne Bridge is on the list of left-back loanees while Wenger is interested in the K\u00f6ln striker Lukas Podolski. Thierry Henry is expected to return on a two-month loan from the New York Red Bulls. Wenger is keen to offload Andrey Arshavin. David Hytner Aston Villa What they need Desperately need to strengthen central midfield with an attacking player capable of injecting some creativity into a team that has often played with a lack of imagination and struggled to score\u00a0goals. Money to spend Alex McLeish has admitted that he will have to adopt a sell-to-buy policy. &quot;I can&apos;t just go into the market without there being a kind of balance,&quot; the Villa manager has said. Ins and outs There is interest in taking the young Chelsea midfielder Josh McEachran on loan and McLeish has also been linked with a move for Rangers&apos; former Villa player Steve Davis. McLeish has said selling Darren Bent to raise funds would &quot;send out the wrong message&quot;. Finding a club to take Stephen Ireland, the highest-paid player at the club, would make more sense, although that will be easier said than done. Stuart James Blackburn Rovers What they need A defence that has conceded 39 goals - second only to Bolton Wanderers - must have ballast added or the bottom-placed club will stay there. Yakubu Ayegbeni has done well but he tends to fade so a striker plus a midfielder \u2013 as David Dunn is injury prone \u2013 are required. Money to spend Despite Steve Kean saying: &quot;I am very optimistic we will get funds. The financial side of the club is dealt with by the financial directors and the people that crunch the numbers,&quot; it seems doubtful there will be any sizeable amount as the owners, Venky&apos;s, have documented problems financing Rovers. January could test Kean&apos;s ability to secure loan signings or cut-price deals with the Scot stating he wants at least four additions. Ins and outs Fulham&apos;s Andy Johnson would cost around \u00a32m and Kean is interested while Christopher Samba is again attracting attention, from some of the bigger clubs - Spurs are one - though given the problems in defence, Kean would hope to wholly reinvest the \u00a38m he could raise from the defender&apos;s sale. Jamie Jackson Bolton Wanderers What they need Twelve points from 18 games, with 14 defeats and the worst defence in the league, it&apos;s very simple for Bolton: they require improvements in every department, especially as Owen Coyle has a full XI out of contract at the end of the season. Money to spend Not much. Bolton have had no choice but to be frugal ever since it was revealed their debt was over \u00a3100m last year. Ins and outs Gary Cahill is almost certainly on his way out, with firm interest from Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, so a central defender is the priority. Nedum Onuoha is available from Manchester City, who may also discuss a permanent deal for the on-loan Dedryck Boyata. Daniel Taylor Chelsea What they need The manager. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, has identified a centre-back to replace Alex, and could seek to strengthen his attacking ranks with Nicolas Anelka sold to Shanghai Shenhua and both Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Money to spend Yes, though the bulk of Villas-Boas&apos;s revamping of his squad will be reserved for the summer. Ins and outs Gary Cahill should arrive from Bolton for around \u00a37m, and there is strong interest in the out-of-favour Juventus winger Milos Krasic, who may be taken initially on loan. Josh McEachran and Ryan Bertrand may be loaned out, while Ga\u00ebl Kakuta is moving to Dijon until the end of the season. Dominic Fifield Everton What they need Everton have scored just 18 goals in 17 league matches \u2013 only Wigan and Swansea have a lower tally in the Premier League. David Moyes said earlier this month that his team &quot;need a striker badly. We needed one badly last season if we are honest.&quot; Money to spend Everton&apos;s transfer spending has been feeble and Moyes is still not sure how much he will have to spend in January. Tottenham, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United have all been linked with a transfer in the region of \u00a320m for the midfielder Jack Rodwell, which could raise funds. Ins and outs Landon Donovan will arrive on a two-month loan deal after a successful loan deal in 2010. Offers for Rodwell are sure to come in. Tom Lutz Fulham What they need Martin Jol is still attempting to make this side his own, with the process of clearing the decks somewhat painful to endure. The team needs goals and the squad some refreshing. Money to spend The chairman, Mohamed Al Fayed, sanctioned the \u00a39.5m arrival of Bryan Ruiz in the summer and has rarely been afraid to spend, though money may also have to be raised through sales. Ins and outs Jol is likely to tap into his knowledge of the Bundesliga and Dutch football as he seeks to recruit, though there is interest in the former Spurs full-back Chris Gunter, currently with Nottingham Forest. Bobby Zamora appears likely to leave, while there is interest in Andy Johnson with the striker out of contract in the summer. Both players would need to be replaced. DF Liverpool What they need A striker, desperately. A lack of ruthlessness in front of goal has cost Liverpool already and with Andy Carroll still struggling to make an impact and Luis Su\u00e1rez set to be banned for a lengthy spell, the club&apos;s top-four hopes are likely to evaporate unless a poacher is brought in next month. Money to spend John W Henry, the club&apos;s principal owner, has backed Kenny Dalglish with sizeable funds during the last two transfer windows and is likely to do so again. Ins and outs Liverpool have supposedly told Aston Villa that they are interested in Darren Bent while there also could be a move for a midfielder to cover Lucas Leiva&apos;s long-term injury. Swansea&apos;s Joe Allen and Fiorentina&apos;s Riccardo Montolivo have been mentioned. Sachin Nakrani Manchester City What they need The league leaders have only three strikers now Carlos Tevez is on strike and three central defenders when Kolo Tour\u00e9 leaves for the Africa Cup of Nations, so an injury or two in key areas could be costly. Ideally, Roberto Mancini would like a forward, a central midfielder and a centre-back. Money to spend Not as much as most people reckon. The club revealed an annual loss of \u00a3195m and, mindful of Uefa&apos;s Financial Fair Play rules, Mancini says he may have to sell before he can buy. Ins and outs Mancini likes Thiago Silva at Milan and Barcelona&apos;s Gerard Piqu\u00e9 but considers them out of reach, and the same might apply to Daniele De Rossi of Roma. Tevez and the fringe players Wayne Bridge and Nedum Onuoha should leave \u2013 and it may be that nobody arrives. DT Manchester United What they need The champions are short in central midfield, though Sir Alex Ferguson has repeatedly stated that he is satisfied with the squad as it is. Money to spend The club tried to sign Wesley Sneijder and Samir Nasri in the summer so, in theory, there should still be money available. Ferguson insists that is the case, but the Glazer family operate in a way that makes it difficult to be certain. Ins and outs Unless Ferguson was being economical with the truth and has a surprise in store, it is unlikely United will bring in anyone. &quot;It can be disruptive,&quot; says Ferguson, who will loan out Federico Macheda and Mame Biram Diouf. DT Newcastle United What they need A centre-back and a specialist left-back. Alan Pardew says he has abandoned plans to sign another striker. Money to spend The \u00a335m accrued from selling Andy Carroll last January has barely been touched but Pardew is only likely to be able to spend a maximum of \u00a310m, possibly much less. Ins and outs The ruptured achilles tendon that ended the captain Steven Taylor&apos;s season means Pardew is casting covetous eyes at Blackburn&apos;s Christopher Samba, Ajax&apos;s Jan Vertonghen and West Ham&apos;s James Tomkins. Erik Pieters, the Holland and PSV Eindhoven left-back, is another player on the wishlist. Alan Smith will be allowed to leave although his high wages may put off potential suitors. LT Norwich City What they need 27Twenty-seven goals scored and 33 conceded (with no clean sheets) to leave a difference of minus six suggests additions in attack and in defence are required by Paul Lambert, who says: &quot;I have told the club the players I would like to try and get in.&quot; Money to spend To listen to Lambert not a great deal: &quot;We have to box clever with what we are trying to do. It is up to the club to try and sort something out.&quot; Ins and outs Lambert had a big clearout during the summer and this is now his squad so he will hope to keep it intact. Nottingham Forest&apos;s Chris Gunter, who would cost around \u00a31m, is a target to strengthen the defence, and Lambert will monitor Andy Johnson&apos;s situation at Fulham, where the striker is holding out for a longer new deal. JJ Queens Park Rangers What they need Now 16th, QPR have scored an uninspiring 18 goals in their 18 league outings so Neil Warnock needs a striker and he is also strident about the requirement for defensive reinforcements. Money to spend Yes, anything up to between \u00a310m and \u00a312m as Tony Fernandes, the owner, is not afraid to invest. Ins and outs The Spurs central defender S\u00e9bastien Bassong remains a target but Daniel Levy, Tottenham&apos;s chairman, is playing financial hardball as he did in the summer. Bobby Zamora appears to have fallen out permanently with Martin Jol and Warnock would love to sign the Fulham striker. If QPR were to receive a sizeable offer for the disappointing Adel Taarabt they may be tempted to sell. Heidar Helguson, the club&apos;s top-scorer, recently signed a new contract. JJ Stoke City What they need Not much. Stoke have a sizeable and experienced squad, are sitting in eighth place in the Premier League and have reached the knock-out stage of the Europa League. Other than a quality central midfielder it is difficult to see where else Tony Pulis needs to strengthen. Money to spend Peter Coates, the Stoke chairman, and Pulis have both admitted there will be no repeat of the summer splurge that saw five players arrive and \u00a318m spent on deadline-day alone. Ins and outs This window will see more departures than arrivals at the Britannia Stadium. Danny Collins, Andrew Davies and Danny Pugh are likely to move on. Mohamed Diam\u00e9, the Wigan midfielder, is a potential signing. SJ Sunderland What they need Still assessing his newly inherited squad, Martin O&apos;Neill says he is not quite sure yet. His team are light in the attacking department and also lack both a specialist left-back and a left winger as well as central defensive cover. Money to spend O&apos;Neill says he has not yet discussed the subject of potential transfer activity with the club&apos;s owner, Ellis Short. Steve Bruce, O&apos;Neill&apos;s predecessor, had been told January funds would be extremely tight. A spending spree seems unlikely. Ins and outs Fulham&apos;s seemingly discontent centre forward Bobby Zamora is said to be admired by O&apos;Neill. Meanwhile, Sunderland&apos;s new manager says he does not want to release anyone before he has given them a proper chance. LT Swansea City What they need Away points: a tally of no wins and three draws from nine games on the road illustrates the extent to which Brendan Rodgers&apos;s side have struggled. A goal return of only six on their travels means a new striker is on the radar. Money to spend Will be minimal so the manager will hope to finagle bargains and/or loans: &quot;In the Premier League there are some who have all the money and some who haven&apos;t, but we just have to keep on scrapping away,&quot; Rodgers says. Ins and outs Rodgers&apos;s most wanted is Rory Donnelly, 19, of Northern Ireland club Cliftonville, with reports suggesting the manager has upped his bid of \u00a3100,000 to stave off Liverpool and Everton. Rodgers is also hoping to take Josh McEachran from Chelsea on loan but Bolton and Aston Villa are ahead in the chase. JJ Tottenham Hotspur What they need Harry Redknapp has taken to muttering about how &quot;one big signing&quot; could make a real difference. He wanted to see serious investment in the summer of 2010 and he felt that the club missed a trick to establish themselves in the top four when it was not forthcoming. As usual, he will remind Daniel Levy of the need to push the boat out. Money to spend Yes, and there would be plenty more if Roman Pavlyuchenko, Giovani dos Santos, Vedran Corluka and Niko Kranjcar moved. Ins and outs The big rumour is a loan for Carlos Tevez, although his wages would surely be a problem and they already have Emmanuel Adebayor on loan from Manchester City; the rules permit no more than one loan from the same club. Redknapp likes Blackburn&apos;s Junior Hoilett. DH West Bromwich What they need Albion have reasonable depth to their squad and cover in most positions, although Zoltan Gera&apos;s long-term injury has left a creative hole to fill between now and the end of the season. Money to spend Funds will be available, although Albion will not be breaking the bank, especially after spending heavily on Shane Long in August. Ins and outs Dundee United&apos;s Scott Allan, who has caught the eye of a number of Premier League clubs, is likely to be the first through the door in a deal worth around \u00a3400,000. There is also interest in Sunderland&apos;s Craig Gardner, who has failed to settle in the north-east. Expect the Republic of Ireland striker Simon Cox to go out on loan and a number of other fringe players to follow him. SJ Wigan Athletic What they need Barring their 5-0 loss at Manchester United, Wigan have been in impressive form recently, drawing with Chelsea and Liverpool. Despite playing some attractive football they are the Premier League&apos;s lowest scorers and need a striker to boost their often lightweight attack. Money to spend Wigan&apos;s chairman, Dave Whelan, has always been supportive of Roberto Mart\u00ednez, who has said he has identified transfer targets but will not be rushed into panic buys. Ins and outs Mart\u00ednez has been linked with a loan move for Manchester United&apos;s Federico Macheda, although the striker is hardly a proven goalscorer. Arsenal have shown some interest in Hugo Rodallega while Mohamed Diam\u00e9 could be off to Stoke City. TL Wolves What they need A commanding presence in the centre of midfield and, on the evidence of Roger Johnson&apos;s first half of the season, a central defender. Money to spend Mick McCarthy will be backed by Steve Morgan, the chairman, if the right players become available but Wolves will not be big spenders. Ins and outs Wolves have already completed the signing of the Iceland utility player Eggert Jonsson from Hearts on a three-and-half-year contract from 1 January. They are expected to rival Stoke for Wigan&apos;s Mohamed Diam\u00e9 and compete with their neighbours West Bromwich Albion for the signature of Craig Gardner if he becomes available. Manchester City&apos;s Nedum Onuoha is a defensive option.

Owen Coyle intends to select Cahill for Saturday&apos;s critical game against Wolverhampton Wanderers but is resigned to life without the defender once the window opens on Sunday and is actively seeking a replacement. At present Chelsea and Cahill remain at odds over the size of his prospective salary but Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, while making it known that he continues to monitor alternatives both domestically and abroad, believes a compromise will be reached before rival suitors emerge. &quot;It&apos;s in the hands of my chief executive [Ron Gourlay],&quot; said the Chelsea manager. &quot;It&apos;s an ongoing conversation and the best outcome for us is the player joining. I think we can sort it out. It should be no problem but at present we&apos;re miles apart regarding an agreement with the player. &quot;Gary&apos;s technical attributes are immense. His pace is fantastic as well. He&apos;s a player who has been playing magnificently well at international level, normally alongside John Terry, and he can add to this squad or any squad in the Premier League. He can make this jump. There are weaknesses but they&apos;re also related to Bolton&apos;s collective organisation. Normally the collective also makes the individual stand out. We believe that, with our collective organisation, we can improve the individual form of the player.&quot; Villas-Boas may seek to add one more player to his ranks during the window given Nicolas Anelka&apos;s sale to Shanghai Shenhua and the anticipated absence of Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou to the Africa Cup of Nations. Yet their expenditure is not expected to match the \u00a373.5m outlay made on Fernando Torres and David Luiz at the same stage last season. &quot;This squad are the players we have set out to win four trophies,&quot; said the manager. &quot;We would be calling ourselves incompetent by going on to make radical changes just because the market opens. &quot;Apart from a central defender I really don&apos;t know if we will be adding anyone else. We are always looking for talent but January is difficult because that talent is not always available. And, if it is, it&apos;s available only at extra cost. Hopefully we will finish the deal with Cahill and then, regarding the forward situation, we will study it and decide whether it&apos;s worth [entering the market again] or not.&quot; The likeliest arrival remains the Juventus attacker Milos Krasic on loan, with the bulk of Chelsea&apos;s transfer business to be done in the summer. There may be interest to field in their own players, particularly following Carlo Ancelotti&apos;s appointment by Paris St-Germain on a two-and-a-half-year contract. The Qatari-backed French league leaders will attempt to sign the likes of Alexandre Pato and Kak\u00e1 from Milan and Real Madrid respectively but could also pursue Florent Malouda, particularly with the France international frustrated by life on the fringe of the first-team at Stamford Bridge. Indeed, the emergence of money-flushed clubs such as PSG, as well as in China and the Middle East, will challenge Chelsea&apos;s ability to recruit the best in future even if Villas-Boas believes the Londoners will retain a lure to prospective signings. &quot;New clubs with new ambitions and great financial power will be involved in great transfer market activity, and that can attract players,&quot; added the Portuguese. &quot;But look at what is being built here and our recent history in the Premier League, of winning titles. The most successful period of the club has happened from 2000 onwards. I would say this plays a part in any player&apos;s ambition. It is possible to make a step forward from this club, but there are only five or six clubs in the world with the same history, prestige, economic stability and facilities. That must play highly in a player&apos;s motivation and ambition.&quot; Villas-Boas will meet his technical staff over the next few days to decide whether Josh McEachran should be loaned out firm bids have yet materialised for the transfer-listed centre-half Alex.", "tags": ["Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas", "Football", "Chelsea", "Transfer window", "Premier League", "Premier League 2011-12"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-30T23:01:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/31/tattenham-corner-horse-racing", "sentences": ["Rumours suggest that the building was recently used as the set of Shanghai airport for the new James Bond film Skyfall, due out in October."], "title": "Tattenham Corner", "article": "Mobster at a racecourse? Surely not Santa Anita racecourse are hoping for a large slice of extra publicity due to the premiere of the new horseracing drama Luck, which starts on the HBO channel later this month. The series was shot at the picturesque Californian track and stars Hollywood names Nick Nolte and Dustin Hoffman, who is taking his first television role as a mobster drifting back into gambling after getting out of prison. It uses the Santa Anita name and even features top jockeys Chantal Sutherland and Gary Stevens, who will play a rider with drug problems. &quot;We&apos;re doing a lot right now as an industry to get back into the picture again. I&apos;m hopeful [the show] will expose this sport to a whole new generation out there,&quot; Stevens told the Los Angeles Daily News. Bond checks in at Ascot Critics have compared Ascot&apos;s futuristic grandstand to an airport terminal and it is believed the connection has recently gone one step further. Rumours suggest that the building was recently used as the set of Shanghai airport for the new James Bond film Skyfall, due out in October. It will not be the first time racecourse buildings have appeared as an airport on film. Viewers of the 1990 comedy Nuns On The Run will have spotted that Robbie Coltrane is standing in the Sandown betting hall while heading for a flight. Wet blanket averted in King George Victory in the King George VI Chase brings with it a trophy, commissioned by the sponsors, William Hill, and retained by the winning owner for 12 months before being returned to the track. Next to 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 the name &quot;Kauto Star&quot; does not take up much space on the plaque listing previous winners, but alongside 2010 the wording &quot;Robert Waley-Cohen&apos;s Long Run&quot; ensures that nobody will forget the name of the last winning owner. Will Kauto Star&apos;s owner, Clive Smith, follow the precedent this year? Meanwhile there was late drama at the track when it was found that the horse blanket ordered to commemorate a possible fifth win in the race from Kauto Star had misspelled the horse&apos;s name as Kato. Thankfully, given the way events unfolded, a corrected version was delivered to the track in time on Boxing Day. Ruby&apos;s festive gift for Noel Ruby Walsh had extra cause for celebration after winning the King George as he was one of a number of Racing UK customers to take advantage of the channel&apos;s offer of three months off a 12-month subscription if Kauto Star won the big race. Walsh signed up his father-in-law Noel Doran for a subscription as a Christmas present but has saved \u00a360 off the price as a result of the victory. Racing UK say the offer cost them nearly \u00a325,000 in refunded subscriptions. Burton&apos;s jumping-off point News came through last week that Richard Burton, the most successful point-to-point rider of all time, has retired. Meanwhile, another leading pointing rider has joined the training ranks. The Cheshire-based Will Kinsey has just been granted a full training licence.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2011-12-31T22:59:02Z"}, {"webUrl":
