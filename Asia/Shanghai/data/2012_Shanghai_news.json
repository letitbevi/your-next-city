The cautionary note comes at the start of a year when Beijing, Shanghai and several other Chinese metropolises will begin publicly releasing data on tiny particulates known as PM2.5, which account for more than half of the country&apos;s air-borne contaminants and have the most damaging impact on human health. The promise of more transparency has been welcomed as an important step towards a clear-up of the foul smogs that plague urban China, but environment officials stress that more time is needed to turn grey skies to blue. &quot;It took the US and Europe 50 years to deal with their problem. Even if we cut that in half, it will still take 20 to 30 years,&quot; said Wu Dui, a haze expert at the Guangdong Meteorological Agency. His comments, which were carried by the Beijing Times, come as the government tries to massage down public expectations ahead of the release of politically sensitive PM2.5 data, which will show just how far China is from global health standards. The government says about 70% of the air in Chinese cities meets existing national standards, which include measurements of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and bigger PM10 particulate matter. But deputy environment minister Zhang Lijun has warned that 70% will fall below acceptable levels if PM2.5 is added to the index. Health campaigners insist the inclusion of PM2.5 is crucial because smaller particulates can enter the bloodstream and do far more damage to the respiratory system than bigger matter. Several cities have been quietly monitoring this data for several years. US embassy officials noted in 2006 that China was failing to release data on PM2.5 and ozone because the levels were unsafe and politically sensitive, according to a US diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks. China&apos;s omission has been made more glaring by real-time data on PM2.5 released via the @Beijingair Twitter account by the US embassy in Beijing. It has revealed that pollution is often hazardous, contrary to the municipality&apos;s claims of 286 &quot;blue sky days&quot; (the term used for days on which the air meets the government&apos;s lax standards) in both 2010 and 2011. Following a public outcry, the government recently promised to change the index this year in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and the Yangtze River and Pearl River deltas. The new system will be implemented nationwide by 2016.

But a word in the ear of David Trezeguet might have given an interesting perspective on departing European football for a distant, if lucrative outpost. Evidently it is not always the most rewarding decision. Back in August, Trezeguet signed up for what appeared to be an easy stroll in the sunshine, backed up with a handsome payday, in the United Arab Emirates. He agreed a one-year deal with Baniyas SC, the club with the camel on its badge who are based in Abu Dhabi. But Trezeguet&apos;s stay lasted only three months. Injuries, which limited him to fewer than a handful of appearances, were cited as the official reason as the player terminated his contract. The club even praised his honesty, thanking him for not wanting to pick up a fat cheque when he felt he couldn&apos;t contribute. But come the January transfer window, it seems matters of the heart convinced Trezeguet to wave an early farewell to Abu Dhabi. A call to arms from his boyhood club, River Plate in Argentina \u2013 his parents are Argentinian \u2013 proved irresistible. Trezeguet&apos;s injury concerns have miraculously disappeared, and the 34-year-old striker has fulfilled a lifetime ambition by signing a three-year deal. He is so spellbound he felt compelled to compare the act of joining River to winning the World Cup with France or collecting titles with Juventus and Monaco. &quot;For me football is passion and I wasn&apos;t getting that in Arabian football \u2026 What better place to experience that than here?&quot; he enthused. &quot;Being here is a unique feeling, motivated by everything that River represents.&quot; Trezeguet is the latest player with Argentinian roots who has cut short a career overseas to join the cause of the River revival. Fernando Cavenaghi, who had won the league with Bordeaux, and Alejandro Dom\u00ednguez, who earned titles with Zenit St Petersburg and Rubin Kazan in Russia, also mounted metaphorical white horses to ride all the way back to Buenos Aires. Another, Leonardo Ponzio, will join this month from Real Zaragoza. River are on a mission to recover from the horror of last season&apos;s relegation. They are currently second in Argentina&apos;s Primera B Nacional, and the arrival of experienced players who know what it takes to be in a winning team is a fantastic boost when River need it most. At a time when most players haggle over this many thousands and that many millions to finalise moves, thank goodness for the few who turn their back on the bucks to chase rewards of a purer kind. Trezeguet is a particularly influential person to bring into this situation as he went through the decline and renaissance of Juventus, the Serie A club where he spent a decade. Notably, players such as Gianluigi Buffon, Pavel Nedved and Alessandro Del Piero all stuck around when Juve were demoted to Serie B, and their guidance was crucial in helping along the young players who came into a strange situation. &quot;Our shirt represents a history and the Juventus youngsters understood that,&quot; Trezeguet said. &quot;River are going through a very difficult time \u2026 I want to be part of the history [of their recovery].&quot; Although Trezeguet may be known for his achievements in the blue shirt of France, with whom he won the 1998 World Cup and cracked in the goal to claim the 2000 European Championship, he has always maintained a strong connection with his Argentinian roots. He was born in Rouen, where his father, Jorge, played for three seasons in the 1970s. But Trezeguet spent most of his youth in Argentina, before heading back to France in his teens to further his career. It was there that he struck up a friendship with fellow strikers with whom he would grow up at the Clairefontaine academy, Thierry Henry, and the kid from the year below, Anelka. This month they are all on the move, probably for the last time. Trezeguet has followed his heart to River, Henry is following his back to Arsenal. We can only wait and see how much love Anelka generates for his new life in China.", "tags": ["River Plate", "Chelsea", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-05T18:48:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/06/shen-hongxun-obituary", "sentences": ["Born into a prosperous Catholic family in Shanghai, Shen began to study taiji at 11, when advised to take up sport after an illness."], "title": "Shen Hongxun obituary", "article": "Shen Hongxun, who has died aged 72, was a teacher of taijiquan and qigong, meditation and healing, in China, Europe and the US. Having studied western and Chinese medicine, he brought together his medical experience and his mastery of psychophysical arts to develop his own therapeutic system, called Buqi. He was founder of the Buqi Institute in Ghent, Belgium, and of Shen Hongxun College, based in Bristol, which runs courses around the UK. Born into a prosperous Catholic family in Shanghai, Shen began to study taiji at 11, when advised to take up sport after an illness. He was soon taken as a student by a master in the subject, Yao Huanzi, and later studied a variety of systems under different masters. He also practised Chinese and Tibetan forms of Buddhist meditation, but chose to teach as a layman, without a religious framework. In the late 1970s, after the Cultural Revolution, there was a flourishing of new versions of traditional self-cultivation systems going under the name of qigong. There followed a proliferation of schools and masters, among whom were charlatans or inadequately trained teachers, and the scandals that resulted eventually brought a government clampdown. Shen was called upon to help people who had suffered mental and physical problems as a result of practising ill-conceived systems. In 1987 he was invited to supervise PhD students at universities in Belgium and Italy, and decided to stay in the west, along with his daughter, Jin, and his son, Zhengyu, who survive him. Shen was considered a master of &quot;empty force&quot;, able to move people from a distance through the creation of strong vibration, and taught his followers the skills of using such force for healing.

It has been snapped up by publishers in 15 countries who have been impressed by the fact that it has sold more than a million copies in China and inspired a film by an Oscar-winning Chinese director. Some publishers even bought it before reading a translation. Yet none of the publishers, translators or editors knows the author&apos;s identity. Under the Hawthorn Tree, a tragic love story set during the Cultural Revolution, is written under the pen name of Ai Mi. All that is known about the author is that she leads a reclusive life in Florida, having gone there to study. She is thought to be in her fifties or sixties, if only because her insight into the Cultural Revolution suggests someone who experienced first hand the political and social persecution of Mao Zedong&apos;s last decade. She tells her readers that it was inspired by a true story. Her central character \u2013 a young woman from a &quot;politically questionable family&quot; who falls in love with the son of a general \u2013 is based on a real person with names and places disguised. In a publishing world where an author&apos;s identity is often more important than their talent, it is striking that publishers as far afield as Italy, Norway, Brazil and Israel have responded to the writing alone. Lennie Goodings of Virago bought it without knowing a word of Chinese \u2013 and was relieved to discover that it lived up to her expectations when she commissioned an English translation. She said: &quot;It&apos;s a beautiful love story, almost like a Romeo and Juliet. It has that real simplicity about people trying to love each other across class. [Set] against the Cultural Revolution, it shows the startlingly intimate reach of politics in that period [which] even affects \u2013 and infects \u2013 their love.&quot; Goodings asked someone from Shanghai who works in Virago&apos;s accounts department to read it: &quot;Her face fell and she said, &apos;I&apos;m not interested in the Cultural Revolution. It&apos;s my parents&apos; generation.&apos; The next day she was at my shoulder, eyes brimming, saying &apos;it&apos;s so wonderful and I cried&apos;. On the basis of that, I bought it blind.&quot; Although the original blog was serialised on a website that was blocked by the Chinese authorities, an admirer had passed it to one of China&apos;s state-affiliated publishers, which has been overwhelmed by its sales. Anna Holmwood, the English translator, said: &quot;It doesn&apos;t present a problem for the Chinese government. If you were to take a particular political line about the Cultural Revolution, that might be problematic. But nowadays people are very open about talking about what a terrible time it was.&quot; In the opening chapter of the book, which will be published by Virago this month, the central character is befriended by a Russian who teaches her a Russian song, The Hawthorn Tree. Ai Mi writes: &quot;Of course, this had to be done in secret. Not only had everything associated with the Soviet Union become dangerous but, just as importantly, anything contaminated by the idea of &apos;love&apos; was considered the bad influence and the putrid remains of the capitalist class.

The new campaign against the ancient practice targets pharmaceutical companies, such as Kaibao, that make fever suppressants from bile extracted drip by drip from holes punched into the bodies of thousands of caged bears. This harvesting technique is approved by the Chinese government, but the animal welfare activists have linked up with professors who argue that the product may be harmful to human health and could easily be replaced by safer, more humane alternatives. Gao Yimin, a professor at Capital Medical University and a former member of the health ministry&apos;s drug evaluation committee, said synthetic materials were as effective as bile, and much safer. &quot;The way the gall is extracted from live bears introduces bacteria and potential infections. This technique actually reduces the effectiveness of the gall and is harmful to human health,&quot; he said at an event for the Healing Without Harm campaign in Beijing.The bile industry is secretive, but China is estimated to have 96 farms \u2013 mostly in the north-east \u2013 containing between 10,000 and 20,000 bears. Each produces 3kg a year, worth about 12,000 yuan (\u00a31,120) at wholesale prices and a great deal more in end-sales to consumers and hospitals. This is a lucrative business for the farmers and pharmaceutical companies, such as Shanghai-listed firm Kaibao, which is believed to account for almost half the bile. The material is used in most commonly used in tanreqin, which is prescribed by Chinese doctors to lower fevers in children. There are 241 other types of medicine made from bear gall, which has been part of the Chinese pharmacopeia for more than 1,400 years. But the industrialisation of the industry has made it more of a health hazard, say animal welfare groups. Toby Zhang, external affairs director of NGO , said studies by the Chengdu military scientists found that 100% of farmed bears were suffering from infections and other ailments despite being pumped full of antibiotics. More than one-third of the animals rescued from such farms died of liver cancer, prompting warnings that their bile may contain carcinogens. &quot;We are trying to reduce demand by making people angry with this industry,&quot; said Zhang. &quot;Many people don&apos;t respond to arguments about cruelty, but once the public realise that there are safety issues, it will change attitudes.&quot; Forty pharmacies in Chengdu and Shenyang signed up to the campaign, saying they will not stock bear bile for the sake of their customers&apos; safety. This is just a tiny proportion of the many thousands of drug stores in China, but campaigners said it was a sign of progress. &quot;It is a major step forward to have the support of some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, who accept that the current techniques compromise not just the health of the bears but of the consumers,&quot; said Jill Robinson, the founder of Animals Asia who has been campaigning on the issue since 1995. &quot;What&apos;s new is the knowledge about the risks. We are working with more doctors, more celebrities, more schools to spread the message. We are not going to give up because we see this industry for what it is.&quot; There is no indication, however, that the government will drop its support for farmers, who claim their techniques are painless. As well as a long-standing desire to protect traditional medicine, the authorities may be concerned about the costs of closing the industry, which would require compensation for the owners, alternative jobs for the workers and a programme of either vast shelters or mass euthanasia for more than 10,000 bears. Chinese scientists have been studying synthetic replacements for more than 30 years and carried out extensive field trials, but the health ministry has yet to grant approval for commercial use. \u2022 Additional research by Cecily Huang \u2022 Get the Guardian&apos;s environment news on your iPhone with our new app. You can also join us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+", "tags": ["Wildlife", "Environment", "Animal welfare", "Animals", "World news", "Health", "Society", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-09T14:10:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/10/grammar-school-return", "sentences": ["In contrast, the non-selective principle now governs some of the most successful education systems in the world, from Shanghai to Finland."], "title": "The creeping return of the grammar school | Melissa Benn", "article": "Remember that robust national debate we had before the 2010 election about the need to expand grammar schools across England? Exactly. Neither do I, because it didn&apos;t happen. What I do remember, however, was a sequence of carefully placed interviews with Michael Gove and David Cameron promising a raft of excellent non-selective schools for all. The terms of the education debate have shifted over the last 18 months, almost without our noticing. We are now facing a de facto return to a tripartite system, the same system that was abandoned from the mid-60s onwards. On the one hand, the government plans to open hundreds of new technical style schools; the studio schools and University Technical Colleges. On the other, the grammar school estate is to be enlarged on the sly. By law, no new grammar schools can be opened. Why? Officially, at least, all the main political parties are opposed to academic selection. Instead, existing schools are to be expanded, with so called satellite add-ons, as has just been proposed in Sevenoaks, Kent. No doubt, other authorities and schools will soon follow suit. And thanks to government sleight of hand on the new admissions code, other local schools, even if demonstrably affected by the expansion of selective education in their area, may not even object. At the same time, we are seeing a return of the powerful &quot;social mobility&quot; narrative in relation to grammars. The House of Commons played host last autumn to one of the most partial debates I have ever read on the subject. Now BBC4 has apparently joined the fray with an emotive two-parter on the glories of the old grammar and the apparent tragedy of their so-called destruction. Grammar school education clearly provided some children from families of modest means \u2013 the Alan Bennetts and Ted Heaths of this world \u2013 with undreamed-of educational possibilities in a world dominated by the powerful public schools. But the wider claim that grammars gave a significant boost to working-class youngsters simply does not stand up to statistical analysis. According to Early Leaving, a government study in the mid-50s which tracked the school careers of 9,000 grammar school children, only 23 children from the cohort who went on to get two A level passes were from unskilled working-class families. According to the 1963 Robbins report, only 1% of the children of semi-skilled or unskilled workers went on to higher education. As for the 164 grammars that exist today, the evidence is incontrovertible. A Sutton Trust report in 2008 found grammars to be among the most socially exclusive schools in England, educating tiny numbers of children on free school meals. This followed the seminal 2007 speech, by David Willetts, then frontbench Conservative spokesman on education and employment, who declared that &quot;we must break free from the belief that academic selection is any longer the way to transform the life chances of bright poor kids&quot;. Not surprisingly, the grammar school lobby were incandescent at Willetts&apos;s intellectual honesty. But there is a modern twist to the age old selective narrative. Grammars are now presented as just one element in a tempting menu of parental choice, their middle-class base very cleverly played down. There is also a shift away from arguing for the 11 plus \u2013 increasingly hard to justify in a more sensitive, child-aware culture \u2013 towards the introduction of a more continental-style division of children at around 13 or 14. Nearly 50 years on from the phasing out of a national grammar/secondary modern model, largely as a result of massed parental revolt against the inhuman division of the nation&apos;s children into winners and losers before puberty, we are still in limbo about the fundamental direction of our schooling system. There is a clear choice to be made. The grammar school clearly fits neatly into an elitist top-down template, in which the private sector still holds sway and the state subsidises an elect minority to both complement and challenge that privilege. Whatever the faux democratic rhetoric around the rest of the school estate, it still leaves the vast majority of our children consigned to second-rate institutions and lesser resources and grievously divides many communities. In contrast, the non-selective principle now governs some of the most successful education systems in the world, from Shanghai to Finland. And in many parts of England, from Hackney to Hampshire, genuinely comprehensive provision can still be a vehicle for excellence for poorer children, while schools can at the same time play an important part in uniting, rather than dividing, communities. Sadly, the coalition has not made up its mind which model it really wants to follow. But it&apos;s clear you can&apos;t have both. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "tags": ["Grammar schools", "Schools", "Education", "Social mobility", "Education policy", "Politics", "Children", "Society", "Parents and parenting", "Teaching", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-10T12:14:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/11/skyscrapers-china-india-recession", "sentences": ["The number of residential property sales had decreased by 40-50% in Beijing and Shanghai and developers had slashed prices by 5-20%, he said."], "title": "China's skyscraper craze 'may herald economic crash'", "article": "China could be the next country to go bust, if its headlong rush to build ever-taller skyscrapers is a guide to its future economic health. According to a study by Barclays Capital, the mania for skyscrapers over the last 140 years is a sure indicator of an imminent crash. It points out that the construction boom that threw up New York&apos;s Chrysler and Empire State buildings preceded the New York crash of 1929 and Great Depression. More recently, Dubai built a forest of skyscraping offices, hotels and apartment buildings, including the world&apos;s tallest, the Burj Khalifa, before it got into terrible financial difficulties. In 2010 Dubai had to be bailed out by its neighbour, Abu Dhabi, to avoid going bankrupt. Bar Cap&apos;s report said: &quot;Thankfully for the world economy, there is not currently a skyscraper under construction that is planned to overtake the height of the Burj Khalifa.&quot; However, BarCap said the &quot;unhealthy correlation&quot; between construction of the world&apos;s tallest buildings and economic crashes was likely to ensnare China, which is home to half of the world&apos;s skyscrapers currently under construction. India, which has just two skyscrapers, sometimes defined as buildings over 240\u00a0metres (787ft) tall, is also on the radar after giving the go-ahead to its first skyscraper building boom, with 14 under way, including the world&apos;s second-tallest tower in the financial capital, Mumbai. Andrew Lawrence, director of property research at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong, said: &quot;Building booms are a sign of excess credit.&quot; Lawrence said that historically, skyscraper construction had been characterised by bursts of sporadic, but intense activity that coincided with easy credit, rising land prices and excessive optimism, but often by the time the buildings were finished, the economy had slipped into recession. China is already showing signs of fulfilling the prophecy. Its largest quarterly business survey showed that confidence among property developers had collapsed to a point where it was worse than the lowest point in the 2008 recession. More worringly, the same survey revealed that confidence among construction firms, while a little down on the previous quarter, remained bouyant. Capital Economics, the independent analysts, said Beijing&apos;s decision to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into construction projects, bypassing private developers, has prolonged the building boom and potentially stored up a bigger crash. Even funds pouring into residential schemes are at risk following years of high-rise developments near factories and businesses dependent on the west for trade. A recession in Europe that drags the rest of the world into a period of lower growth will hurt Chinese exporters, jobs and demand for property. BarCap said signs of trouble were escalating in China and India. China had the dubious distinction of being the world&apos;s &quot;biggest bubble builder,&quot; as it erected ever more and higher towers, it said. Home to 53% of the 124 skyscrapers now under construction globally, China is primed to increase its stock of them by 87%. About 80% of new buildings are going up in cities away from developed coastal areas of the Pearl river delta and Yangtze river delta, which Barclays called &quot;evidence of the expanding building bubble&quot;. Lawrence, who was lead author of the report, said China&apos;s property market is already wobbling. The number of residential property sales had decreased by 40-50% in Beijing and Shanghai and developers had slashed prices by 5-20%, he said. India, which has just two skyscrapers but is building 14 more, takes top honours for hubris: The second tallest building in the world, the Tower of India, is now under construction in Mumbai. Nonperforming loans in India \u2014 a substantial number of them to real estate ventures \u2014 grew by nearly a third in the first half of this fiscal year, more than triple the average annual growth rate since 2006, according to the Reserve Bank of India. BarCap said: &quot;If history proves to be right, this building boom in India and China could simply be a reflection of a misallocation of capital, which may result in an economic correction for two of Asia&apos;s largest economies in the next five years.&quot; A branch of economics founded by followers of US economist Henry George has charted property collapses over the last 100 years and found that booms create the conditions for a downturn around every 18 years. Fred Harrison, a Georgist and research director of the Land Research Trust, wrote in his 1997 book The Chaos Makers that &quot;by 2007 Britain and most of the other industrially advanced economies will be in the throes of frenzied activity in the land market \u2026 Land prices will be near their 18-year peak \u2026 on the verge of the collapse that will presage the global depression of 2010.&quot;", "tags": ["Construction industry", "Commercial property", "Real estate", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "China", "India", "World news", "Skyscrapers"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-11T19:17:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/12/australian-open-2012-murray-clijsters", "sentences": ["Nevertheless, there was anger in the ranks and, although a players&apos; meeting in Shanghai never seriously entertained strike action, the issue was on the table."], "title": "Australian Open 2012: injuries take toll as roadshow heads to Melbourne | Kevin Mitchell", "article": "The temptation to sneer at tennis players who complain about their creaking bodies in the course of hitting a fluffy yellow ball over a net is considerable when such seeming physical sacrifices are set against the workplace health risks of, say, boxing, rugby, extracting coal from the ground, or policing riots. Given only the first three of the above beats to cover, your correspondent is sometimes at a loss to sympathise with the finely tuned millionaires of the ATP and WTA circuits. The puzzlement is rarely more heightened than just before the first grand slam tournament of the season when, in January&apos;s southern hemisphere warm glow, at least half a dozen elite players of both sexes are struggling to muster the combined menace of a suet pudding. The reason given most often is familiar to modern sport: all athletes now stretch their bodies so dangerously to the limit that breakdown is inevitable. In tennis, that strain travels from toe to shoulder in nearly every stroke. They hit harder, longer, better. Most of them have wintered well in their training camps. The women have arrived in the new year and the antipodes without serious competition for nearly two months \u2013 apart from those who indulged themselves for tempting money in tournaments of minor consequence; yet, among their number, Venus Williams, out since August, has failed to recover from her autoimmune disease, while sister Serena (a frequent visitor to the nurse, now carrying a sprained ankle), Caroline Wozniacki (sprained left wrist), Kim Clijsters and Maria Sharapova arrive in Melbourne this week with varying degrees of pain and trepidation. Wozniacki was cleared of major damage after a scan on Thursday but is racing to prove her fitness before the tournament starts on Monday. &quot;She is very hopeful of being able to compete at the Australian Open and will do everything she can to be ready,&quot; the tournament organisers said of the world No1. &quot;She will continue to undergo treatment and will also see a specialist in Melbourne on Friday morning.&quot; As for Clijsters, who will almost certainly retire after the Olympics, she is struggling with a hip that gave up on her in Brisbane, having recovered from a ripped stomach muscle sustained in August; and Sharapova&apos;s scarily combative soul remains at odds with a body that has been fighting against her talent since she won her last major title four years ago. The men have idled like recuperating lions since the ATP World Tour finals in London before Christmas, but many of them are wounded. Rafael Nadal, his tender feet finally recovered after Wimbledon, has more recently been managing a suspect shoulder and a bruised spirit that recall his darkest days. The Spaniard, normally so full of life, seems to have had the zest drained from his tennis. Roger Federer withdrew during a tournament for the first time in his career in Qatar this month, with a sore back, so we will see over the next fortnight if his vaunted self-belief has been dented. Novak Djokovic, invincible until the final stretch in 2011, is yet to convince doubters that the shoulder trouble which cut him down in Cincinnati against Andy Murray before he roused himself in a quite wonderful US Open campaign has entirely cleared \u2013 and Murray&apos;s movement, an ace weapon in his armoury, was briefly compromised as he wobbled again on a pair of disjointed knees, as is his genetic curse. Still, he is winning and smiling. It is no mystery that the game&apos;s leading players are the most familiar faces in the casualty ward. They go deeper into tournaments more often than their lesser rivals and, generally, play with such physical commitment that muscles and bones will give up on them, intermittently or serially. Like all athletes, they spend much of their working lives either injured or living in anticipation of injury. As Clijsters said this week: &quot;When I came on tour, nobody was hardly ever in the gym besides warming up with a skipping rope or doing some shoulder exercises and now there&apos;s everybody \u2013 because it&apos;s necessary. The tennis that I play is physically so demanding on the body and then combine that on a hard court.&quot; The answer to the conundrum, as Murray sees it, is continuity versus rest. &quot;My body takes time to get used to playing competitive matches again,&quot; he said, after going to ground for treatment twice in Queensland in his first match back after pulling up lame at the start of the final tournament of 2011, the ATP World Tour finals in London. He nevertheless added the Brisbane International to his CV, and declared: &quot;I&apos;ve had a few niggles. I just need to play through them.&quot; Only a few months ago in New York, the workload of the tour became so unbearable in that back-end-loaded US Open that the first major outbreak of player-power in tennis since the 70s seemed at least a remote possibility. Murray and Nadal, worst hit in the second week by rain delays, led that charge up the Flushing Meadows hill \u2013 with Federer a conscientious objector and Andy Roddick a wild-eyed foot-soldier \u2013 before they were marched down again and ordered to get real. Nevertheless, there was anger in the ranks and, although a players&apos; meeting in Shanghai never seriously entertained strike action, the issue was on the table. That tournament completed Murray&apos;s Asian hat-trick and, after the disappointment of the World Tour finals, he retreated to his warm-weather training camp in Florida to rebuild his body and confidence \u2013 as well as negotiate a coaching deal with his neighbour Ivan Lendl. All of which skews the odds for Melbourne. Djokovic, of course, is favoured to keep the title he won so devastatingly against Murray 12 months ago; he showed in New York that pain hampers him rather than debilitates him. Nadal is a worry. He has not looked in prime physical or mental shape since Wimbledon \u2013 rarely more vulnerable than when Murray bageled him en route to winning in Japan. And Federer \u2013 who ignores injury the way Kelvin MacKenzie ignores questions \u2013 might nevertheless harbour thoughts of vulnerability as he goes in search of his first slam trophy since beating Murray here in 2010. Murray? The 5-1 odds on his breaking through at last are tempting \u2013 if his body does not let him down. They are all human, some more so than others.

Apple later said it was suspending all retail sales of the new phone in China for the time being although it would still be available to buy online. Scuffles broke out before dawn on Friday between security staff and shoppers, many of whom had waited in line overnight in temperatures below freezing, after an announcer with a megaphone told the crowd that the phones would not go on sale as planned and they should go home. Police dragged some customers away while others threw eggs at the windows of the store in Beijing&apos;s fashionable Sanlitun district. Many of the customers were working for touts who try to buy up popular products en masse and sell them on at a profit. &quot;I got in line around 11pm, and beyond the line the plaza was chock full with people,&quot; said Huang Xiantong, 26, outside the store. &quot;Around 5am the crowds in the plaza broke through and the line disappeared entirely.

China is Apple&apos;s fastest growing market, accounting for one-sixth of the company&apos;s global sales. However, despite being manufactured in China, the latest version of the iPhone was only launched there on Friday. &quot;The demand for the iPhone 4S has been incredible and our stores in China have already sold out,&quot; Apple said in a statement. &quot;Unfortunately we were unable to open our store at Sanlitun due to the large crowd and to ensure the safety of our customers and employees the iPhone will not be available in our retail stores in Beijing and Shanghai for the time being,&quot; Apple said. Apple&apos;s chief executive, Tim Cook, said earlier this month that &quot;customer response to our products in China has been off the charts.

Customers began gathering on Thursday afternoon outside the Sanlitun store.

There were about 350 people left when the protest erupted after 7am. &quot;On the one hand there is poor organisation and on the other there were just too many people,&quot; said a man outside the store, who would give only his surname, Miao. &quot;I don&apos;t think they prepared well enough.&quot; Another man who refused to give his name said he was a migrant labourer who was paid 100 yuan (\u00a310) to wait in line overnight. Others in the crowd said touts had organised groups of 20 to 30 migrant workers to buy phones or hold places in the line. Organisers held coloured balloons aloft to identify themselves to their workers.

At the 2007 census, its members formed the largest single ethnic minority in the city, and census figures are generally believed to underestimate the size of the population. On Sunday 22 January, Liverpool&apos;s Chinese will hold a festival to mark the beginning of the Year of the Dragon and end of the Year of the Rabbit. The festival will also reflect the growing ties of recent years between Liverpool and Shanghai, and there will be many activities on the streets of Chinatown, including the traditional Lion, Dragon and Unicorn dances. The Chinese connection goes back to the 1830s, when seamen began to come to work for companies such as the Blue Funnel Line. Later, many Chinese opened businesses in the city and plenty of them married local women. The recent BBC 2 series Mixed highlighted the deportation in the mid-20th century of many Chinese men whose English wives were never informed, and lived for many years under the impression that their husbands had abandoned them. This tragedy is one of many aspects of the history of the Chinese community recalled in an exhibition in the Museum of Liverpool. The original Chinatown was located in the dockland area, but following bombing in World War II, the community largely moved to an area west of the Anglican cathedral. In 2000, Europe&apos;s largest Chinese arch was erected here at the junction of Nelson Street and Duke Street. Links between the community and Chine itself have strengthened in recent years with the coming of many Chinese students to the city&apos;s three universities and numerous language schools. In October 2009, the Liverpool Confucius Institute was established as a collaboration between the University of Liverpool, its partner institution Xi&apos;an Jiaotong University and Hanban, the Chinese government agency which promotes Mandarin language learning and awareness of Chinese culture. Events being held during the New Year festival include a tai chi demonstration, a street market, firecracker display, a VIP dinner compered by Billy Hui of BBC Radio Merseyside&apos;s Orient Express programme, a strawberry lunch at St Luke&apos;s (commonly known locally as the &apos;bombed-out church&apos;) and a book signing at the Black-E. The book in question is the autobiographical East Meets West by Joan Chan, while the weekend will also see the launch of Radio Chinatown, an online station and there will be an exhibition of photos of Chinatown taken in 1984 by Magnum photographer Martin Parr. The Chinese Community Centre on Duke Street will see performances by the Wah Sing singing and dance groups, as well as Tibetan dancing, Cantonese opera, gymnastics, karaoke and other events. Celebrations are not going to be confined to Chinatown. Elsewhere in the city, the Merseyside Chinese Community Development Association Luncheon Club will hold a party on January 17, while the Pagoda, a Chinese centre in Henry Street, will host an exhibition of calligraphy, and several other cultural events. The Unity Theatre will have a new year celebration on February 11, as will the Liverpool Chinese Students and Scholars Association on January 31.

Now the Soho House group has taken the most significant step yet in its seemingly unstoppable march across the globe, agreeing a \u00a3250m deal with a US billionaire to fund its expansion into subcontinental Asia and the Far East. The deal, which will earn founder Nick Jones \u00a325m for half his 20% share, will make Soho House the most valuable private members&apos; club in the world. Jones, who is married to the broadcaster Kirsty Young, sold 80% of the business to the British high-street tycoon Richard Caring in 2008, in a deal that valued the company at just over \u00a3130m. Caring will pocket around \u00a3125m in exchange for 50% of the group. The new controlling partner is Ron Burkle, a retail magnate who began his career bagging groceries at his father&apos;s supermarket and rose to become ranked 297 on the Forbes 400 richest list in 2010. A prominent political donor and Democrat supporter, he is a close friend and former business partner of Bill Clinton and reportedly raised more than $1m (\u00a3653,000) for Hillary Clinton&apos;s presidential campaign. Jones and Caring have been looking for a major investor for some months to fund expansion. As well as its original home in Soho, the group owns three other members&apos; clubs in London, opening further &quot;houses&quot; in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Berlin. It also operates 11 restaurants in London, Los Angeles and Miami beach, seven hotels, including Babington House in Somerset, as well as London&apos;s oldest cinema, the Electric in Notting Hill. The rooftop pool of the New York club, situated in the once shabby, now stylish Meatpacking district, was featured in an episode of Sex and the City, and the clubs have attracted an exclusive membership particularly in the media and film worlds. Some 26,000 people are now members worldwide, with 11,000 on waiting lists. New sites in Mumbai and Chicago have reportedly been agreed, while Jones and Caring have been eager to expand to San Francisco and Washington as well as exploring sites in Shanghai and other Asian cities such as Singapore, potentially on a franchise model. &quot;Ron believes in the way we do things and the resilience of our membership offering,&quot; Jones said.&quot; &quot;Though we&apos;ve had a number of interested parties table offers for Soho House in the last few years, I believe that Ron shares our vision, and provides us with the backing to expand and improve our clubs whilst remaining true to our original ethos.&quot; Burkle also owns stakes in bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble, American Apparel and the Pathmark grocery chain and invested $100m in rapper P Diddy&apos;s clothing line Sean John.

As Britain tips back towards recession and the eurozone hovers on the brink of implosion, George Osborne hurried off to the former British colony of Hong Kong this week to drum up business for the City as a future trading centre for the Chinese currency. On Tuesday he was in Beijing to lobby China to do what neither the British private nor public sector is prepared to do \u2013 invest in crisis-ridden Britain. The chancellor&apos;s quest follows the European Union&apos;s fruitless attempt to convince China to use some of its colossal reserves to back the eurozone&apos;s bailout fund. And given the relative performances of the European, US and Chinese economies in recent years, it&apos;s not hard to see why western politicians now feel the need for Chinese support. It&apos;s a commonplace that China is the world&apos;s emerging economic giant. After 30 years averaging more than 9% annual growth, China is now the world&apos;s second largest economy and its fastest-growing market. Hundreds of millions of Chinese have been taken out of poverty, as its international share of manufacturing has risen from 2% to 20% in 20 years. But it has been the slump in Europe, the US and Japan that has most dramatically underlined the yawning gap in performance between the world&apos;s long-established economic powers and China. In the four years from 2007 to 2011, US national income increased by less than 0.6% (the figure is still being revised down), the EU shrank by 0.3% and Japan declined by 5.2%. In the same period, despite the decline in export markets in those economies, China grew by more than 42%. But there is a deep reluctance in the austerity-afflicted western world to consider the reasons for such an astonishing gap. Europe is already heading ever deeper into the second phase of the crisis that erupted in 2007-8, now centred on the eurozone. When the credit agency S&amp;P downgraded nine states&apos; creditworthiness and the eurozone&apos;s own bailout fund, warning that &quot;fiscal austerity alone risks becoming self-defeating&quot;, Angela Merkel&apos;s response was to press for the adoption of even tighter austerity. It is a recipe for economic disaster. Meanwhile, western analysts are predicting that China is heading in the same direction \u2013 as they have consistently and wrongly done for the past decade, but especially since the crash of 2008. The latest predictions of a &quot;hard landing&quot; for China focus on inflationary pressure, a legacy of bad bank loans, an overheated housing market, and the impact of stagnation or worse in Europe and the US. Maybe the pessimists will be proved right at last, but there are powerful reasons to suggest otherwise. Chinese growth for 2011 was 9.2%, compared with forecasts for Britain of around 1%. It&apos;s expected to drop back this year to between 7% and 8% \u2013 the kind of crisis to dream for. Last year&apos;s inflation is cooling off, as is the property bubble which, unlike in the US and Britain, was funded by savings rather than borrowing. As the Shanghai-based British economist John Ross argues, China has a strong record of absorbing bad loans in the wake of the 1997 Asian debt crisis, and is cushioned from the collapse in western demand by the fact that most of its trade is with the developing world. But crucially \u2013 unlike Britain, the US and the stricken eurozone economies \u2013 China has a modest budget deficit of around 2%. Which points to the central reason why China was able to ride out the global crisis of 2007-8 with such dramatic success. China&apos;s response was to launch the biggest stimulus programme in the world, investing heavily in infrastructure. But instead of doing it through deficit spending and printing money, the Chinese government was able to use its ownership and control of the banks and large state companies to increase lending and investment. Which is why China has grown by 10% a year since the crash, while the west and Japan have shrunk or stagnated. China has travelled a vast distance from the socialised economy of the Maoist period and has a huge private sector and large-scale foreign investment. But its hybrid economic model continues to be based around a publicly owned core of banks and corporations. So while in Europe and the US governments rely on indirect (and so far entirely ineffective) mechanisms to reverse the collapse of private investment at the heart of the crisis \u2013 and private banks and corporations hoard bailout cash \u2013 China has the leverage directly to boost investment, jobs and incomes. And that state-owned core has been central to the country&apos;s extraordinary growth over the past three decades. Of course that advance has also been based around the largest migration of workers in human history. And the costs of its economic rise have been massive: from rampant corruption and exploitation of low-wage labour to environmental degradation, decline in health and education provision, an explosion of inequality and serious restrictions on civil rights. Strikes and rural upheavals across China \u2013 as well as political shifts \u2013 are now challenging and having their impact on those failures. But China&apos;s authoritarian system can also lead people elsewhere to ignore some powerful lessons about its economic experience. And one of those is that what used to be celebrated across the political mainstream in Britain and Europe as a &quot;mixed economy&quot; \u2013 along with long-discarded levers such as capital controls \u2013 can deliver results that a privatised, deregulated economy is utterly unable to do. There&apos;s no sense in which the evolving Chinese economic model could or should be transplanted to Britain or Europe. And having long ago sold off public stakes across the economy, most European states don&apos;t have anything like the financial or industrial leverage that China does to drive economic growth. But it would also be obtuse not to recognise that a private-sector and market failure is at the heart of the current crisis; or to reconsider the role that new forms of public ownership could play in a modern economy in the light of China&apos;s experience; or to refuse to use publicly owned institutions that do exist, such as Britain&apos;s part state-owned banks, to forge a way out of the crisis. China&apos;s success represents a global opportunity, as George Osborne has grasped. But it should also be a challenge to a failed and discredited economic consensus.

Authorities have grown increasingly concerned about the speed with which information and allegations can spread on the Twitter-like services, which have more than 300m registered users in China. Last month, the Beijing municipal government said users would have three months to register their real identities or face the consequences. &quot;Currently, this type of registration is being tested in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. We will extend it to other areas once the pilot programmes prove successful,&quot; said Wang Chen, minister of the State Council Information Office. &quot;We will focus on newly registering users and then extend it to existing microbloggers.&quot; He added: &quot;Microblogging is a new medium that can spread information rapidly and have a big influence. It covers a wide population and can mobilise people.&quot; He said the growth of services had been &quot;explosive&quot; and that microblogs could help officials to understand the social situation and public opinion, spread positive opinion and improve their information services. Authorities were committed to becoming more open and had launched their own accounts. But he warned that while authorities welcomed the benefits of new media, &quot;We also need to control the spread of rumours undermining social stability; harmful, for example pornographic, information; and illegal conduct for commercial purposes.&quot; A spate of recent official commentaries have attacked online &quot;rumours&quot;, with one editorial describing them as &quot;worse than cocaine&quot;. Beijing-based internet analyst Bill Bishop said the move was no surprise. &quot;They tried real-name registration with cell phones \u2013 that was harder because there were so many retailers. They tried it with online games, but that was more about protecting kids,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a whole different level. It is a much more serious thing and it is not that difficult for the government to enforce it; there are only two providers that matter.&quot; Although sensitive content is removed from microblogs, and words or phrases can be blacklisted so people cannot post them, the popularity and ease of using the services means censors have often struggled to keep up with users posting reports of protests or attacking officials. Many users fear that real-name registration will make it even easier for officials to track down and punish people posting sensitive content, such as attacks on officials, while others are concerned about the security risks it poses. South Korea was the first country to adopt real-name registration, but recent media reports have suggested it now plans to phase the system out after hackers exposed the personal details of millions of internet users.

Watching Chinese football is so frustrating it will destroy your life.&quot; For most of the past 10 years, Chinese football has been a national joke. Sardonic aphorisms \u2013 like the one above \u2013 fill the comment sections of soccer websites. The national team is the subject of ridicule, referees are reviled for match-fixing and the sport&apos;s managing body is derided for incompetence and corruption. But that image is in the midst of a dramatic overhaul as the French superstar Nicolas Anelka becomes the biggest name yet to play for a Chinese club and the local Football Association attempts to purge itself with arguably the widest match-rigging trial in world history. The 32-year-old striker \u2013 formerly of Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Real Madrid \u2013 has joined his new team-mates at Shanghai Shenhua this month on a rumoured \u00a3175,000-a-week, three-year deal that looks likely to herald an exodus of other foreign stars to the east. The contract, easily the most lucrative signed in China, is part of a nationwide attempt to rebuild respect for the sport with an infusion of cash, a crackdown on bribery and the backing of the highest echelons of the Communist party. The revamp will be good news for football, but there is an outside chance it may force Anelka to start his career in China playing for a second division team. Shenhua face an ongoing corruption trial in Dalian that involves more than half the teams in the top division, as well as players, managers, officials, referees and the former head of the football association. Some may be penalised with relegation. So many clubs are implicated, that there is even talk of the entire season being cancelled. Sentencing in the trial is due before Chinese new year on 23 January. &quot;The CFA has taken this so high that they have to show they are serious with the punishments,&quot; says Rowan Simons, the author of Bamboo Goalposts. But they will also be reluctant to choke the recovery of Chinese football. After years in the doldrums, attendances are up, money is pouring in and ambitions are soaring. In July, Xi Jinping \u2013 who is expected to take over this year as China&apos;s president \u2013 stated that he had &quot;three wishes&quot; for Chinese football: to qualify, host and then win the World Cup. The Communist party has instructed business tycoons to inject millions of dollars into club budgets. As a result, some Chinese clubs are offering higher wages than Chelsea and Manchester City. Last year&apos;s league champions, Guangzhou, spent $17m signing Argentinian midfielder Dar\u00edo Conca and Brazilian forwards Cl\u00e9o and Muiqui. Other clubs have snapped up Serbs and Romanians. Didier Drogba and Ronaldinho are among the names of those who could follow. There are echoes of Japan, when it launched the J-League in 1993 with big name imports like Gary Lineker, Zico and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to boost the sport&apos;s status. Anelka is expected to draw more people to games and generate revenue from commercial endorsements and TV rights sales. Currently, the state broadcaster CCTV refuses to pay for domestic matches because they are such low quality. Interest in second division teams is so low that clubs actually have to give the TV companies money to film their games. Anelka may have already changed that even before he kicks a ball, according to reports that a French TV company has offered $350,000 for live feeds of his games. &quot;This is the first time that China has invited such a big star. It is very good publicity. There will be a butterfly effect. Whenever people mention the name Anelka, they will think of Shenhua and Shanghai,&quot; said a club official, who declined to give his name. The Frenchman has played for eight teams, including Arsenal, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea, winning a cabinet full of trophies and notching up 69 appearances for France. But he will have to adjust to a very different level. His new side performed dismally last season, finishing 11th in the 16-club Chinese Super League. China&apos;s national team are no better. They are ranked 72 in the world, having failed to qualify for the London Olympics and the 2014 World Cup. The main problem is that connections and money have long trumped ability and graft. Recent exposes show matches could be bought for \u00a3200,000 and places on the national team for \u00a310,000. Nobody is under any illusions that Anelka is moving for the love of the game, but there are hopes his professionalism will rub off. &quot;It&apos;s good to invite players and referees from Europe. They help to purify the Chinese football environment. They play more fairly and they talk more openly to the media. That will put pressure on the China Super League to change,&quot; says Wu Celi, a veteran sports reporter at Soccer China magazine. Anelka \u2013 who is not known for his charisma or forthrightness \u2013 will also come under pressure to sell products, take sides in Shanghai&apos;s rivalry with Beijing, and answer critics who wonder how he can be paid more in an hour than millions make in a year. Even to a superstar used to the limelight in Europe, the attention could come as a shock. &quot;In London, there are five or six Premier League clubs full of superstars. In Shanghai he will stick out like a sore thumb. It will be him and him alone,&quot; says Simons. &quot;How will someone so introverted cope with a job that is more about his image than his football?&quot; The past experiences of big name foreign players is not encouraging. Paul Gascoigne spent a miserable few months in Lanzhou playing for Land Reclamation Flying Horses at the dog-end of his career in 2002. The former Rangers star J\u00f6rg Albertz left after only a year with Shanghai Shenhua from 2003-04 because of concerns about match-fixing. Long-term observers say the situation is now much better thanks to the corruption crackdown and the rising standard of living. But Chinese football still has many problems. It is losing ground to basketball among the young. There are few places where ordinary people can play. And it is under tight political control. Cai Zhenhua, the chairman of the Chinese Football Association, is also the vice-minister for sport \u2013 a clear violation of Fifa rules about political independence and elections. China&apos;s lively microblogs have buzzed with discussion about the changes that will come with Anelka&apos;s signing. Many said they were more likely to attend Shenhua matches. But there was realism about the impact one player could make. &quot;Maybe Anelka will attract more foreign stars to China and the league will be more entertaining to watch,&quot; said a comment under the name Ang on the Sina Weibo microblog. &quot;However, if the China Football Association doesn&apos;t make it cheaper to play football at the grass roots then we won&apos;t nurture good new players so big name imports will make no more of an impact than a floating haze. They will just take their money and leave nothing behind for Chinese football.&quot; Additional research by Cecily Huang This article has been amended since first publication", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Nicolas Anelka"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-18T13:18:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/19/shanghai-shenhua-didier-drogba", "sentences": ["Shanghai Shenhua are increasingly confident of making Didier Drogba the latest eye-catching arrival in the Chinese Super League next summer under freedom of contract in a move that would end the Ivory Coast striker&apos;s glittering eight-year stay with Chelsea.", "Chelsea will therefore resist any attempt by Shanghai Shenhua to secure the player in the midwinter transfer window but they are helpless to prevent Drogba negotiating terms with a foreign club over a move in the summer.", "Asked whether he was concerned that Shanghai may be speaking with the player, Villas-Boas said: &quot;It&apos;s not something that has crossed my mind."], "title": "Chelsea's Didier Drogba set for summer move to China on \u00a3270,000 a week", "article": "Shanghai Shenhua are increasingly confident of making Didier Drogba the latest eye-catching arrival in the Chinese Super League next summer under freedom of contract in a move that would end the Ivory Coast striker&apos;s glittering eight-year stay with Chelsea. Talks between Drogba and Chelsea over a new deal have been at an impasse for some time, with the 33-year-old seeking a two-year package to remain at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea, conscious of the player&apos;s age, had been willing to offer only a 12-month extension to his contract, which expires at the end of June. Although the club&apos;s manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, intends to utilise the forward upon his return from the Africa Cup of Nations, a parting of the ways in the summer has long felt likely. Chelsea will therefore resist any attempt by Shanghai Shenhua to secure the player in the midwinter transfer window but they are helpless to prevent Drogba negotiating terms with a foreign club over a move in the summer. Asked whether he was concerned that Shanghai may be speaking with the player, Villas-Boas said: &quot;It&apos;s not something that has crossed my mind. I count on Didier, on what he represents as a player and an icon, and I will rely upon him still [when he returns from the tournament in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea next month].&quot; Shenhua, who signed Drogba&apos;s former Chelsea team-mate Nicolas Anelka this month, are confident they will entice the Ivorian with a salary of around \u00a3270,000 a week and the promise of a three-year deal, with a pre-contract agreement between both parties edging ever closer. That salary would eclipse the reported offer of \u00a3200,000 a week made to Drogba by the Chinese Super League club Dalian Aerbin this month, a wage similar to that accepted by Anelka, and underlines Shenhua&apos;s desire to make Drogba a figurehead for an emerging and wealthy league. Shenhua finished 11th out of 16 teams in the Chinese league last season but intend to recruit heavily under the former France international and Fulham manager Jean Tigana. Shenhua have gone public with their interest in Drogba in recent days, with the club&apos;s chairman, Zhu Jun, claiming the talks with the striker&apos;s representatives were &quot;like flirting with a girl: perhaps she will resist you at first, but if you continue to ask her out, it always ends well. Never give up.&quot; Drogba&apos;s move would disappoint his former club Marseille, who hoped the forward would end his playing days at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome. The Abidjan-born forward moved to Chelsea from the French club for around \u00a324m in 2004 and has won three Premier League titles, three FA Cups and two League Cups with the Londoners.

In the Yemen section of the game, where Nathan and Sully explore a vast underground crypt, lots of the tasks are based around optical illusions \u2013 there&apos;s a room full of statue parts suspended at various angles, which must be viewed from a specific place to create a complete picture. In another area, a duo of strange symbols on a wall need to be looked at through a series of shutters in order to convert them into a zoetrope-style animated sequence. These ingenious puzzles are not only fun to solve, they accentuate the mysticism of the narrative. How did Naughty Dog come up with this brilliant idea? Ideas are the currency of creativity \u2013 yet strangely, we&apos;re often taught to undervalue them. There&apos;s an anecdote about Peter Molyneux being approached by a fan who told him, &quot;I have a great idea for a game,&quot; to which the famed designer replied: &quot;I have a great idea for a painting.&quot; Of course, an idea in itself is worthless; it&apos;s the implementation that&apos;s key. But if you&apos;re sitting in front of Game Maker 8.1 or your Unity3D interface, with plenty of coding nouse but no inspiration, how do you get started? &quot;It&apos;s all about reference material,&quot; said Andy Schatz, when I asked him about how newcomers to game design should think about ideas. Schatz is the designer of Monaco, an IGF award-winning co-op stealth game, tipped by many to be the crossover hit of 2012. &quot;All art is just an evolution of existing art. But the art we call innovative is the art that takes the biggest evolutionary leaps. Sometimes this takes a lot of experimentation to get right. Don&apos;t be afraid to take those leaps and throw out the experiments that don&apos;t work out!&quot; This is a widely accepted, glibly post-modernist stance on creativity \u2013 that there are no new ideas, just new combinations of existing concepts. At the Develop conference in Brighton last year, Mark Green \u2013 from the creative development group at Sony Worldwide Studios \u2013 gave an intriguing talk on how the company&apos;s in house studios came up with new ideas. &quot;A classical definition of a new idea is one or more existing ideas combined in a new way,&quot; he said. &quot;So we might take the idea of a monster movie, combine it with the idea of YouTube and come up with the idea of Cloverfield \u2026&quot; That essentially seems to be how Hollywood has operated for the past 30 years, but is it a dead end for indie developers who don&apos;t want to make the gaming equivalent of &quot;Godzilla on a shaky cam&quot;? Green doesn&apos;t think so \u2013 he sees investigating accepted game mechanics as a key way to spark inspiration. &quot;A lot of what we&apos;ve done has been about taking techniques that have been used in other industries,&quot; he says. &quot;There are very innovative companies working in product development \u2013 for example, the design consultancy IDEO is one. They use exercises that allow you to think differently about problems. &quot;There&apos;s one known as the challenge technique where you sit down and think about all the assumptions we have about something. Then you all start to remove some of those things to destabilise the fundaments and see how that can help generate new ideas.&quot;  In his Develop talk, Green discusses taking an accepted genre \u2013 the RTS for example \u2013 then writing down its six absolutely vital elements. There is some kind of battle going on, there are at least two sides, there are various units, there are resources, etc. Now the idea is to roll a dice and remove one of the tenets. What would the resulting game work like? Removing just one rule can result in a fundamentally different gameplay experience. &quot;There&apos;s another very simple exercise we sometimes carry out,&quot; Green says. &quot;It&apos;s called A+B. We print out a list of 200 game titles, put them in a hat, then pull two out. We might get something like Professor Layton and Call of Duty: Black Ops. That&apos;s not the end of the process \u2013 we&apos;re not literally going to make Call of Duty and the Curious Village. But what we&apos;re doing is using this unusual combination as a starting point. &quot;We may combine the theme of one with the gameplay of the other \u2013 so, perhaps a puzzle game with a military theme. Or it could be an FPS with strong puzzle elements. Or we&apos;d take the audience of one and apply it to the other \u2013 so a first-person shooter for family audiences. These are just good brain-storing start points, and this exercise take you down paths you may not previously have considered.&quot; This is a quite insular way of thinking about games and creativity, but it can work. Dan Marshall, the Bafta award-winning designer of games such as Time Gentlemen Please and Privates, is a great believer in immersing yourself in games and game culture. &quot;Go to the pub and talk about them,&quot; he says. &quot;Great ideas do come up like this \u2013 but you need to take a pen and some paper because otherwise they&apos;ll be lost forever in a half-drunken haze. &quot;Oh and play lots of games. Sometimes you expect a game to do something, but it goes in a totally different direction. Well, that thing you were hoping it would do is a completely original idea \u2013 it&apos;s all yours and you can use it yourself. Use other people&apos;s work as a springboard.&quot; It doesn&apos;t have to be new games either. Hideo Kojima, after all, became interested in the whole idea of stealth and avoidance by playing Space Invaders and hiding behind the defence shields. Charles Cecil, designer of the Broken Sword titles, agrees with the idea of immersing yourself in games, but sounds an extra note of caution. &quot;Don&apos;t try to write games in a genre that you don&apos;t have a passion for, because you will fail,&quot; he says. &quot;When you&apos;re coming up with ideas, try to keep in mind all the things you love about a genre, and innovate on those; add to them in an interesting way. You&apos;ve got to focus on what you love, but it has to be about the mechanics. &quot;It&apos;s no good saying, I&apos;m going to design an FPS that&apos;s based underwater, because that in no way suggests you&apos;re going to innovate on the gameplay itself. Everything needs to be driven by gameplay.&quot; In short, you need to think like an engineer rather than an artist. Although admittedly, art has proved a fecund source of game ideas. Tetsuya Mizuguchi was inspired by Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky to create Rez; Ken Levine drew on the Art Deco movement for Bioshock; Uncharted co-lead designer Richard Lemarchand looked at the works of Victorian painters such as David Roberts and Caspar David Friedrich for the exotic locations that Nathan Drake discovers. And countless dungeon designers have looked at the complex works of MC Escher and Giovanni Battista Piranesi for their labyrinthine environments.  Beyond art there is\u2026 everything. Lemarchand talks about finding inspiration and awe in dramatic natural wonders \u2013 the Giant&apos;s Causeway, the fronds of a fern, the fractal self symmetry of Romanesco broccoli. &quot;I always try to get ideas for games from non-game sources,&quot; says Schatz. &quot;I like to think of game design the way Michelangelo thought of sculpting \u2013 he was just discovering the object inside of the stone, and the chisel was just there to reveal it. When you build a game out of a non-game concept, the designer has to whittle that subject matter down and find the game inside it. So I&apos;ve made games inspired by animal ecosystems, heist movies, conversations, documentaries\u2026&quot;  There is also biography and experience. Miyamoto was inspired to create Legend of Zelda by his childhood spent exploring the countryside near his home, and daring himself to wander into caves. Jenova Chen of thatgamecompany told Edge that he came up with the idea for Flower after seeing the grass fields along a Californian highway for the first time after arriving in the country from Shanghai. Ideas are experiences processed. But they are also about seeing the value in empty time. In a blog post titled Where do you get your ideas, an exasperated Neil Gaiman writes: &quot;You get ideas from daydreaming. You get ideas from being bored. You get ideas all the time. The only difference between writers and other people is we notice when we&apos;re doing it.&quot; The skill is in utilising these fleeting moments of inspiration. &quot;When you&apos;re making games, you&apos;re constantly having ideas that are brilliant but completely wrong for that project,&quot; says Marshall. &quot;So store them up in the back of your mind; every indie developer I know has a list of games tucked away in the damp, dark bits of their brain queuing up to be made. &quot;You should also keep tabs on the stuff you throw away: some game ideas are completely wrong for what you&apos;re working on, but sing in a different project. We killed time travel mechanics in Ben There, Dan That because it just didn&apos;t gel, but when we decided on a sequel it was the perfect fit.&quot; Interestingly, Hidetaka &quot;Swery&quot; Suehiro, the designer of cult survival horror adventure Deadly Premonition, has the exact opposite approach. In his GDC speech last year he provided a seven-point guide to game design and the last one was simply to use everything, every idea, whenever it occurs to you. Don&apos;t save it, don&apos;t lose it, just stick it in there. Hence, in Deadly Premonition, the town of Greenvale is shaped like a dog raising its paw. Swery had that idea and he put it in. This is the stuff that cult genius is made of.  One of the most important philosophical ideas about \u2026 ideas \u2026 is that they don&apos;t just pop into your head fully formed. The science writer Steven Johnson has a brilliant YouTube video explaining this, which I&apos;ve embedded below.            This reflects some advice on creativity in Richard Wiseman&apos;s excellent book 59 Seconds, which suggests that sometimes it&apos;s best to leave an idea and go off to do something else \u2013 a word puzzle, a long walk \u2013 anything to get your mind off the creative problem at hand, if only for a few minutes. He refers to the work of psychologists Ap Dijksterhuis and Teun Meurs from the University of Amsterdam; in a report titled, Where Creativity Resides: The Generative Power of Unconscious Thought, they posited that leaving a task for just a few moments allows your unconscious mind to have a bash at it, quietly working away on the logistics without your conscious thoughts bellowing in its ear. Dan Marshall puts this in very simple terms: &quot;&apos;Play&apos; the game in your head at night \u2013 this is where everything gets fleshed out, for me.&quot; It seems that retaining the purity of those early, half-unconscious ideas is the key to great games. Lemarchand discusses the process of &quot;design by subtraction&quot; during his fascinating talk, Beauty and Risk: Why I love indie Games, given at IndieCade and GameCity last year.             If you don&apos;t have time for the whole thing, forward to 15:00. Here, he talks about how his approach to design ideas is influenced by the &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy of William Morris \u2013 &quot;put nothing in your home that you don&apos;t know to be useful or believe to be beautiful&quot;. Game ideas are the same. This was also a concept employed by Fumito Ueda while designing the wonderful Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. In his classic 2002 GDC talk on the creation of the games (conveniently entitled Design by subtraction), he talks about how the idea for Ico came from just the idea of a young boy holding hands with a slightly older girl, and that every subsequent design decision was made to retain the purity of that image.  So back to those intriguing puzzles in Uncharted 3. Keen to find out how Naughty Dog arrived at them, I contacted Richard Lemarchand and asked him. He told me that his co-lead designer Jacob Minkoff actually created a huge open environment and filled it with optical illusions \u2013 he then toyed with each one until he had a couple that really worked; these are the ones we have in the final game. Sometimes creativity is just about putting yourself in a position where the only possible outcome is a good idea.", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "PC", "PS3", "Xbox", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-20T10:40:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/20/chinese-economy-headaches-to-die-for", "sentences": ["Making that primary task more difficult, the Communist party also declared last month that it wanted to puncture the housing bubble in Beijing, Shanghai and other east coast boom towns."], "title": "Chinese economy: headaches to die for", "article": "China is enduring the sort of problems other countries can only dream of. Like everywhere else, GDP has been a tad disappointing of late \u2013 but that means a growth rate of 8.9%, according to figures released this week, rather than 9.1%. (By way of comparison, Britain&apos;s final-quarter output figures are out in a few days and could well record growth that disappears in the margin of error, or even show flat-out shrinkage.) Exports are rather under par, too: Beijing estimates the trade surplus dropped to about $160bn (Britain runs a persistent trade deficit). And the big worry is whether Beijing can check overheating to engineer a &quot;soft landing&quot; \u2013 as opposed to the crash that hit the west in 2008, whose tremors are still being felt. That&apos;s not the whole story, of course. China&apos;s economy is also &quot;unstable, unco-ordinated and ultimately unsustainable&quot;, a verdict delivered not by some capitalist running dog on a Canary Wharf trading floor, but by none other than premier Wen Jiabao. Nevertheless, any appraisal of China&apos;s prospects must begin by admitting that the Middle Kingdom is the most astonishing development success story in the world today, and that its three decades of 9%-plus growth have been achieved in the face of widespread scepticism from foreign observers. Economic discussions of China usually range over three questions. First, what is its own outlook? Second, how will that affect the rest of the world? Before 2008, the global economy had two locomotives: the US and China. Now it has one. George Osborne&apos;s visit to Beijing this week is a reminder of how even the most free-market politicians have come to rely on China to pull the world out of a slump. News that the People&apos;s Republic has acquired a stake in Thames Water, an asset the cash-strapped British state disposed of long ago, underlines the point. The third and most interesting question of all is how will the biggest tiger economy&apos;s performance affect Beijing&apos;s status as an alternative to the tainted Washington model of prosperity? Let&apos;s start with China&apos;s own outlook. The economy is almost bound to slow this year \u2013 the debate is over how far and fast. Changing economic gears will pose big challenges, with less reliance on exports in a sluggish world, and more on domestic consumption. It&apos;s a rebalancing act \u2013 the mirror image of the one Britain must perform. Making that primary task more difficult, the Communist party also declared last month that it wanted to puncture the housing bubble in Beijing, Shanghai and other east coast boom towns. Doubts about how Beijing can pull off both tasks at once has led some to predict a big crash over the next couple of years. Then again, China&apos;s collapse has been foretold many times since the early 80s. If Beijing does succeed in keeping China growing, but at a slightly more moderate pace, what does this mean for the rest of the world? Sadly for Mr Osborne, the news is better for emerging markets than developed nations. As economist and China-watcher John Ross points out, over half of China&apos;s trade is with other developing economies. Moreover, this is the club that&apos;s doing all the growing: in the three years up to 2010, developing economies provided 78.6% of world growth. China is more likely to develop greater trade links with India, Brazil and Africa, rather than Britain and Europe. Developing countries can provide Chinese industry with all the natural resources and investment opportunities it needs. Little scope, then, for more business with the west. Beijing does not provide the world with a fully articulated model like the Washington consensus. It does, however, provide a potent example of how growth can come from investing in new plant as opposed to the capitalist reliance on raising productivity; and it shows that this can be achieved with a finance and banking sector that is in state hands. Whatever 2012 holds, China will carry on posing an implicit challenge to the western way of business.", "tags": ["China", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-20T19:19:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/20/under-hawthorn-tree-ai-mi-review", "sentences": ["The authors are well established in mainland China, though both are resident in the US: Shanghai-born Geling Yan left her homeland after the suppression of the Tiananmen student movement in 1989, while details about Ai Mi \u2013 a pen name \u2013 are notably scarce."], "title": "Under the Hawthorn Tree by Ai Mi \u2013 review", "article": "History is tricky stuff, particularly in China. Both of these novels are set in a passage of 20th-century history that has been the object of both state manipulation and censorship. Although they stand alone as works of fiction, their historical settings also offer clues to China&apos;s contemporary concerns. The action of The Flowers of War (by Geling Yan, trabslated by Nicky Harman, Harvill Secker, \u00a310) takes place during the dreadful months of the Nanjing massacre of 1937-38; Under the Hawthorn Tree opens in 1974, in the dying days of the cultural revolution. The authors are well established in mainland China, though both are resident in the US: Shanghai-born Geling Yan left her homeland after the suppression of the Tiananmen student movement in 1989, while details about Ai Mi \u2013 a pen name \u2013 are notably scarce. Her novel first appeared in 2007 on a website popular with \u00e9migr\u00e9 Chinese students. The website was blocked in China but the novel was sent to a Chinese publisher and became a bestseller in print. Both books have inspired feature films directed by film-maker Zhang Yimou, the choreographer of the 2008 Olympic opening ceremony. The historical events of the cultural revolution remain sensitive for the censors despite the party&apos;s posthumous verdict on Mao Zedong, which ruled it a decade of catastrophe for which he was responsible. After his death in 1976, with censorship relaxed, it became the inspiration for an outpouring of literary emotion; at the time, this &quot;scar literature&quot; seemed refreshingly therapeutic, but the public eventually tired, China changed, and authors moved on. Since then, the cultural revolution has been reinvented as kitsch for the younger generations, whom censorship keeps ignorant of the events themselves. It has become a favourite theme for restaurant d\u00e9cor; it is bathed in musical sentimentality at weekends as pensioners gather to sing songs of the time. The darker memories below the surface are contained by censorship and the passage of time. We do not know into which category \u2013 memory or nostalgia - Ai Mi fits, though her agent in Beijing, who has never met her, speculates that she had direct experience. Chinese-language sources, on the other hand, suggest that her book is based on its heroine&apos;s 1977 memoir, rejected for publication at the time because the characters showed insufficient &quot;fighting spirit&quot;. In Under the Hawthorn Tree, the period is drawn with convincing detail, evoked to illuminate how political repression and strict social mores affect two characters engaged in one of China&apos;s favourite literary themes \u2013 the melodramatically doomed love story. The young Jingqiu arrives in the village of Xiping as a pious revolutionary hiding a troubled family background: her father languishes in a labour camp and her mother is fearful that any transgression will bring further disaster. At the time, romantic love was labelled a bourgeois indulgence, but by the end of her stay Jingqiu is involved in a love affair with a charming young geologist with a relaxed view of political rules. Jingqiu&apos;s extreme innocence and the many obstacles in the way of their romance mean that the affair is conducted obliquely and is fraught with misunderstandings, leading to a poignant finale worthy of a Mexican soap opera. If there is a message here for contemporary Chinese readers, as the novel&apos;s high sales suggest, perhaps it is that human happiness can still be thwarted by an unjust state. The background to The Flowers of War is familiar from several recent works: these include Ha Jin&apos;s Nanjing Requiem, and Lu Chuan&apos;s film City of Life and Death. All are set during the months after the Japanese capture of Nanjing, the Nationalist government&apos;s capital, in December 1937. Despite the well-attested horrors of mass murder, pillage and rape, this tragic period was little discussed until the 90s. Today it forms part of China&apos;s post-1989 official narrative of suffering overcome. The 37 foreigners who had not escaped the city when the Nationalist government abandoned Nanjing to the Japanese occupiers enjoyed a vulnerable neutrality. They included a number of Christian missionaries and teachers, and used their neutrality to designate a safe zone in the city, where they gave precarious refuge to hundreds of Chinese civilians. Their role in protecting Chinese civilians has only recently been acknowledged in China, where foreigners are generally cast as pantomime villains in official histories. The Flowers of War, ably translated by Nicky Harman, tells the story of a group of Christian schoolgirls hidden in the attic of a school. They are joined by a group of prostitutes, who settle, symbolically and literally, in the cellar. The novel is rewarding for its spare prose and subtle treatment of the conflicts, quarrels, racial ambiguities and acts of transcendent heroism woven into the story. It is unsparing in its account of the horrors of war and returns to a theme also found in other treatments: the enforced choice to sacrifice a few to spare the greater number. It explores, too, the story of the city&apos;s prostitutes at a moment when all the women of Nanjing were at risk of being reduced to occupying soldiers&apos; whores. There are doomed love stories, amid the tragedies, but they are drawn from a deeper well and speak to the persistence of humanity in the grimmest of circumstances. \u2022 Isabel Hilton is editor of chinadialogue.net \u2022 Download the audiobook at audible.co.uk.", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-20T22:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lawrence-donegan-golf-blog/2012/jan/21/tiger-woods-book-hank-haney", "sentences": ["Kaymer&apos;s impressive ascent to the top of the rankings and rapid fall thereafter were among the more curious aspects of the 2011 season, although his decisive victory in the HSBC champions event in Shanghai at the end of the year suggested his time in the wilderness has ended."], "title": "Tiger Woods distracted by book as he prepares to face Europe's best | Lawrence Donegan", "article": "Tiger Woods excels at hitting irons. Irony, on the other hand, is not his forte, as was apparent in his reaction to the news that his former swing coach Hank Haney is to publish a book about their time together. &quot;I think it&apos;s unprofessional and very disappointing, especially because it&apos;s someone I worked with and trusted as a friend,&apos;&apos; the former world No1 said in an interview with ESPN.com on Friday. &quot;I think people understand that this book is about money.&quot; This from Woods in the week he was readying himself to fly from his home in Florida to the Middle East where he will start his 2012 golfing year at the Abu Dhabi Championship, a drastic change in routine (he usually begins the season at the PGA Tour event in San Diego) prompted by a $2.5m appearance fee. Everyone has their price, a fact of sporting life that applies as much to Tiger Woods as it does to Hank Haney. Neither man has any need to apologise for that, although Woods would do well to develop his powers of self-awareness. As for the rest of us, rather than judge the two former friends for chasing dollars, we should be grateful for the friction that now exists between them. The 2012 season, in which the Ryder Cup will be contested in Chicago in the autumn, already promised to be one for the ages. Now there is even more to look forward to. Haney&apos;s book The Big Miss, written in conjunction with the highly respected Jaime Diaz of Golf Digest magazine, is due to be published in March, just before the Masters, and draws on the six and a half years he worked for Woods. He is not by nature a reticent man, and nor does he hold back when it comes to settling scores, two personality traits that suggest his opus will not be dull. It will surely be complimentary about Woods the golfer. What else could it be, given what the pair achieved together? However, the portrait of Woods the man and his dealings with those around him could well be less than flattering. Woods has already said he will not read what Haney has to say. That is hard to believe (by most accounts, he reads a lot of what is written about him) but what is certain is his motivation to prove himself on the golf course will be intensified. He likes nothing better than watching those whom he perceives as critics, a broad church that now includes Haney, dine on their own words. And he has an early chance to do exactly that in Abu Dhabi this coming week, where he will face all the top European golfers with the exception of Ian Poulter, who has chosen not to travel, and Paul Casey, who is injured. Three months ago, few would have given Woods a chance against such players as the current world No1, Luke Donald, the surging Rory McIlroy or Lee Westwood, who has apparently been restored by a new putting coach. But that was before he won his final event of the 2011 season, the Chevron World Challenge. Admittedly, it was a limited field event and his only opponent over the closing stretch was the less-than-intimidating Zach Johnson, but there was more than a glimmer of the old Woods in a welter of fine shots over 72 holes, not to mention two birdies on the final two holes that secured the win. With that victory Woods stalled for the time being all talk of his career being in terminal decline. Now comes the trickier task of restoring his reputation. Leaving aside the appearance fee, the suspicion has to be the American might have preferred to begin his 2012 campaign on the more familiar terrain of San Diego, on a Torrey Pines course where he has been a multiple winner, against a PGA Tour field that will be noticeably light on world-class names. The Abu Dhabi Championship, on the other hand, promises to be a bear pit. Woods is at an immediate disadvantage in not knowing the course, compared with, say, Martin Kaymer \u2013 the world No4 has won the event three times. He may also find himself cast in the unfamiliar role of bit-part player as Europe&apos;s best seek to assert themselves over each other. Donald has been No1 for eight months and will hope to extend his stay for a while longer, an ambition that will be advanced with a victory against a field of such high quality. Westwood and McIlroy, meanwhile, are locked in a fight over the No2 and No3 rankings, a contest made more meaningful by their burgeoning personal enmity. Kaymer&apos;s impressive ascent to the top of the rankings and rapid fall thereafter were among the more curious aspects of the 2011 season, although his decisive victory in the HSBC champions event in Shanghai at the end of the year suggested his time in the wilderness has ended. At his peak, Woods would have relished the challenge presented by Europe&apos;s best. More pertinently, most people would have fancied him to see it off. Not any more, not after a two\u2011year stretch in which golfers of a new breed have asserted themselves. The sport has a new world order now and Tiger Woods no longer rules.

While China undoubtedly offers sound opportunities for UK and global business, and is attractive enough to have lured chancellor George Osborne for a recent visit, there are warning signs galore for private investors. Growth slowed in 2011 and China&apos;s stock market struggled throughout much of the year \u2013 the Shanghai Composite Index fell by over 20%. The Chinese government has been fighting inflation, but its measures have damaged growth, while a boom in the housing market may well have come to an end. Analysts put China&apos;s total economic growth for 2011 at just over 9% and many forecasts see it dipping below 8% in 2012, which would be its weakest expansion in more than a decade. China&apos;s manufacturing and export sector is partly dependent on the recession-hit US and European economies. There are also fears a slump in property prices in some Chinese cities could damage consumer confidence and banks&apos; balance\u00a0 sheets. Patrick Connolly of AWD Chase de Vere urges investors to tread with caution. &quot;The region&apos;s ongoing growth story is indisputable. However, strong economic growth doesn&apos;t necessarily translate into strong stock market returns, as we saw in 2011 when China was the worst performing of all investment sectors. It is important that investors don&apos;t get suckered into any hype and invest too heavily in the region.&quot; This was arguably demonstrated by the performance of Fidelity China Special Situations Investment Trust, which launched in 2010 and is managed by respected investment guru Anthony Bolton. It raised \u00a3430m, making it the biggest ever investment trust launch in the UK, but after rising by 20% in the first six months the fund nosedived. Those who invested at launch are sitting on losses of\u00a030%. But some analysts believe the sell-off of Chinese equities last year means the market is undervalued and alluring. Despite the negative data, China fund managers are lining up to sing the region&apos;s praises. Andreas Roemer, head of emerging markets at DWS Investments, says investors &quot;should take a positive view&quot;. And Bolton remains bullish, saying: &quot;It will become apparent in the next 12 months that the house-of-cards view that many have of China is wrong. We won&apos;t see a hard landing and we won&apos;t see growth disappear and that will lead to a reassessment of international views on China.&quot; Howard Wang, manager of the JPMorgan Chinese Investment Trust is equally optimistic, stating: &quot;very attractive opportunities exist&quot; in the region. Danny Cox of adviser Hargreaves Lansdown is also positive, despite &quot;significant policy errors (or even civil unrest) disrupting economic growth and stock market returns&quot;. He says: &quot;I believe the Chinese growth story has much further to run in the longer term. Chinese companies are still growing their earnings strongly, and following 2011&apos;s market falls I believe shares are looking good value.&quot; Social reform and transparency remain key issues for many would-be investors. But for those prepared to take the plunge, most financial advisers believe a pan-Asian or broad-based emerging markets fund is the least risky way to gain exposure to the region \u2013 few advocate a dedicated China fund. Connolly recommends JPM Emerging Markets (which has 24% of its assets invested in China), Schroder Global Emerging Markets (21% in China) or Aberdeen Emerging Markets (16% in China). Cox recommends Jupiter China. Even though it struggled in 2011, &quot;this under-performance could well reverse if the Chinese market rallies&quot;, Cox says. For broader exposure he suggests Aberdeen Emerging Markets and First State Global Emerging Market Leaders. Darius McDermott of Chelsea Financial Services says risk-averse investors should look at the Allianz RCM BRIC fund, which has roughly 25% exposure to China, &quot;but also to some of the other large, exciting emerging markets without diluting the opportunities too much&quot;. For adventurous investors prepared to take on China single-handedly, he recommends the Henderson China Opportunities fund. &quot;The manager has been running the fund for five years, knows the market inside out and has first quartile performance over that time.&quot;", "tags": ["Investment funds", "Investments", "Savings", "Money", "Investing", "Financial sector", "Business", "Chinese new year", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-21T22:59:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jan/21/damaging-child-modelling", "sentences": ["In December 15-year-old Julia Schneider won the Elite Model Look Contest in Shanghai."], "title": "What is the best age to start modelling?", "article": "Being a supermodel isn&apos;t easy. Especially when you&apos;ve not hit puberty. Last week Cindy Crawford&apos;s daughter Kaia made her modelling debut, for Young Versace, at 10. Donatella Versace said: &quot;Like her mother, Kaia has a very special gift. The camera really, really loves her. It was a special treat watching Kaia walk in her mother&apos;s footsteps.&quot; Betty Lowe, daughter of designer Pearl, has been modelling for her mother&apos;s range for Peacocks from the age of five. &quot;I know it seems odd that I would let Betty model at this young age. But she loves the limelight. It&apos;s not like she&apos;s in beauty pageants,&quot; says Lowe. She draws the line at make-up, however. &quot;No. Absolutely not.&quot; Meg Mathews, ex-wife of Noel Gallagher, has a picture on Twitter of her 11-year-old, Anais, taken by fashion photographer Mario Testino. The image has been compared to Kate Moss&apos;s early pictures. Anais is now signed to model agency Select. While you&apos;re unlikely to make it as a model by the age of 11 unless you have at least one celebrity parent, it&apos;s now not unusual to see models barely in their teens on the runway and in magazine adverts. Carole White, director of Premier, one of the UK&apos;s leading model agencies, says it worries her that several of the big fashion houses in New York and Milan, including Prada and Balenciaga, have started using girls aged 13 or 14 to front campaigns or do catwalk work. &quot;They&apos;re looking for a specific image and they want a girl no one has used before.&quot; This doesn&apos;t really happen in London, she adds. &quot;For London Fashion Week, girls have to wait until they&apos;re over 16. We have to provide documentation,&quot; says White. &quot;Before then it&apos;s possible that they could work, but it would be unpaid, editorial work.&quot; White appeared in last year&apos;s TV documentary The Model Agency, which featured Premier models such as Darya, 18, signed at 15, and Leomie Anderson, now 17, who was spotted by one of White&apos;s team walking home from school. She says it&apos;s common for girls to be scouted from the age of 13, although they won&apos;t work for a couple of years. &quot;They don&apos;t actually do anything [with a model agency] at that age. You tend not to do anything until they&apos;re 15. They just get used to having their picture taken in the school holidays. And having lots of Polaroids done,&quot; says White. Fashion PR Debra Bourne is co-founder of All Walks on the Catwalk, which campaigns for diversity of age, shape and ethnicity in fashion. &quot;Hard competition drives them to scout models incredibly young, for fear of losing out,&quot; she says. &quot;If models start being used by 15 or 16, this gives the model agency a lead-in period to build the relationship. But I would argue that, emotionally, this is a huge amount to contend with at that age, even though good agencies will argue that they are there to fully protect them.&quot; Renewed controversy about the age of models has been brewing for a while. Last year a Prada campaign featured Ondria Hardin, 13 at the time the advert was made with director Steven Meisel. In November an advert for Marc Jacobs&apos;s perfume Oh Lola! was banned for featuring 17-year-old actress Dakota Fanning in a &quot;sexually provocative position&quot;. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that &quot;the actress actually looked to be under the age of 16&quot;. Canadian model Coco Rocha, 23, recently complained in a US television interview that &quot;15 is way too young to be a model&quot;. &quot;I was scouted at 14, started modelling at 15 and lived in New York at 16,&quot; she says. She has done runway shows for Marc Jacobs, Anna Sui and Stella McCartney and was the face of advertising campaigns for Gap, Dior and Yves Saint Laurent. She now feels her early career was too much for her. She says girls are taken out of high school, away from their parents and put into an industry &quot;that treats them as adults, and they do not know how to work with that. They are just thinking, &apos;How do I please you?&apos;&quot; Rocha also said that a year ago she was losing out on modelling jobs for being &quot;too big&quot; \u2013 at size six and 7st 7lb. More recently she has been told she is &quot;too small&quot;. Sitting next to her on the TV show was actress and model Carr\u00e9 Otis, 43. She started modelling at 16 and now thinks this was too young: &quot;I don&apos;t think any young girl should be put in that situation.&quot; Although it is supposed to be hard for girls to get work under the age of 16, increasingly younger girls seem to crop up. The Wall Street Journal recently profiled 15-year-old Valerija Sestic, a Swiss-Croatian model who did 16 shows in 15 days at New York Fashion Week on her first trip to the US. The Council of Fashion Designers of America recommends that no girls under the age of 16 be cast in catwalk shows. In December 15-year-old Julia Schneider won the Elite Model Look Contest in Shanghai. Last year an edition of French Vogue edited by designer Tom Ford featured 10-year-old Thylane Lena-Rose Blondeau in a Dynasty-style outfit slashed to the waist. Child actresses Elle Fanning, 13 (sister of Dakota), and 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld have signed modelling deals with Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu. Victoria&apos;s Secret model Behati Prinsloo, 22, has spoken out about what it was like to be &quot;discovered&quot; at 15. &quot;There&apos;s no one that helps models figure out what they should do or helps them with their money. It&apos;s especially hard for under-age models.&quot; She added: &quot;You have to figure it out on your own. It&apos;s very stressful, it&apos;s a lot of travelling, a lot of time away from family, a lot of dealing with stuff you shouldn&apos;t be dealing with at that age.&quot; The preference for younger models also influences the aesthetic: the younger she is, the more likely she will be skinny and boyish. Psychologists at the University of Queensland in Australia and the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE in Bristol are investigating whether we respond as negatively as the fashion industry claims to images of women who don&apos;t resemble a slim 16-year-old. The author of a 2011 paper entitled &quot;Waif goodbye!&quot;, Dr Philippa Diedrichs, created a series of adverts using a size eight and a size 12 model and interviewed women about their feelings and likely purchasing decisions after looking at the images. Younger women, aged 18 to 25, reported feeling despondent about the size 8 picture. They said they would be more likely to buy something if it was advertised by a size 12 model. This research is ongoing and if it becomes influential the fashion industry may be forced to challenge the mid-teenage aesthetic as the norm for the &quot;idealised woman&quot;. Caryn Franklin, a former presenter of the BBC&apos;s The Clothes Show, lectures on body image and works with All Walks on the Catwalk. &quot;I question why the industry is so attracted to the pre-pubescent waif to the point where it seems like arrested development,&quot; she says. &quot;Why are we wanting to promote an underdeveloped young woman as a feminine icon? I&apos;m glad that as an industry we are talking about it, but there is a desire from some design labels not to engage in responsible and considerate practice. Fashion likes to think it&apos;s making dramatic artistic statements. But it&apos;s last in line to understand the impact of its decision-making on the psyche of women both young and old.&quot; How young, then, is too young for fashion? And what&apos;s too old? &quot;Sixteen is a good age to start,&quot; says White. &quot;Seventeen is the perfect age for a model, because most girls feel comfortable in themselves by then; 18 is good too, though, because then all their schooling is out of the way. If a girl started at 20, she would find it difficult to get work. Her agent would probably lie about her age and say she was a year or two younger.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Monday 23 January 2012 to make changes to the headline and standfirst.", "tags": ["Fashion", "Children", "Women", "Parents and parenting", "Society", "UK news", "Fashion industry"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-21T23:49:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jan/22/chinese-new-year-china-hong-kong", "sentences": ["Adults about \u00a330, children about \u00a316, children under 1.2m free Shanghai Lantern Festival     City God Temple during the Lantern Festival, Shanghai.", "In Shanghai&apos;s Yuyuan Garden, it&apos;s a press of crowds, chaos and colour as themed lanterns of various shapes and styles are paraded through the grounds.", "Expect Mushu, the dragon from Disney&apos;s film Mulan, to make an appearance ahead of the planned opening of Disneyland Shanghai in 2016."], "title": "Chinese New Year: the best events from Hong Kong to Beijing", "article": "On Sunday, in a deafening blitz of pyrotechnics, more than a billion Chinese rang in the new lunar year \u2013 the 4,710th of the Chinese calendar, if you&apos;re counting.

The title of an influential book by Edward Glaeser says it all: Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier. But urban living comes at a psychological cost. Small towns and villages provide a sense of community grounded in historical continuity and culture. Big cities, in contrast, smother difference; when urbanisation is combined with the seemingly inexorable force of capitalism, it has the effect of transforming a variety of local cultures into a single culture of consumerism. The drab, uniform look of Chinese cities seems to have erased the diversity that makes human social life so valuable. Chinese cities were subject to 30 years of Soviet-style modernisation, followed by 30 years of American-style modernisation. From an architectural point of view, it may be the worst of two worlds. But the similar look of Chinese cities masks a quest for particularity and community deeply rooted in human nature. I teach in two megacities \u2013 Beijing and Shanghai \u2013 and the two express a different set of social and political values, as reflected in street layouts, economic activity, openness to outsiders, and even the conversations of taxi drivers. If cities could be personalised, Beijing would be a public-spirited scholar/warrior, Shanghai a beautiful woman committed to fashion, food and entertainment . China&apos;s other cities are also less uniform than they seem at first. Some, such as Hangzhou, take pride in their environmental ethos, and megacities such as Chengdu and Chongqing compete for commitment to social justice. One of the new fields of social scientific research in China is survey work on the different &quot;spirit&quot; of cities such as Changsha and Harbin. The idea that we love our cities should not be surprising. One of the most well-known slogans in modern history is &quot;I love New York&quot;. &quot;I love Beijing&quot; \u2013 in English \u2013 is commonly seen on T-shirts in the Chinese capital. It&apos;s easy to be cynical, to say the whole thing is driven by money, but the slogan does tap into a real emotion. People do love their cities. The New York ethos is famously individualistic, but its underlying sense of community and urban pride emerges with full force in times of crisis, such as 9/11. And part of that urban pride \u2013 what can be termed &quot;civicism&quot; \u2013 comes from the sense that New York is different to the rest of the country; New Yorkers often say they feel more attached to their city than their nation. The challenge is to combine the advantages of urban life with the sense of community found in small towns and villages. It&apos;s hard to feel proud of a city that only expresses the homogeneity of globalisation, just as it&apos;s hard to feel proud of a neighbourhood McDonald&apos;s. But cities that express a distinctive ethos can generate a sense of attachment that fulfils the need for community. Yes, civicism of this sort is often defined against another city that expresses contrasting values. But cities, unlike countries, won&apos;t go to war with each other, so we don&apos;t have to worry too much.

That is where Murray is at in the 2012 Australian Open on Wednesday, against the emerging Japanese talent, Kei Nishikori, who is playing way above his 24th seeding, and showed heart and class in dispatching Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five gruelling sets over three and a half hours in the afternoon heaton Monday. Murray took a shorter route: just 49 minutes of blazing strokeplay before the 92nd-ranked Mikhail Kukushkin surrendered to a seized-up left hip and retired without holding service once \u2013 although he broke the world No4 once in each of the two completed sets. The interest in Murray, who was 6-1, 6-1, 1-0 up, is intensified here, naturally, by the presence of Lendl, who has returned from years of anonymity and is being hounded for interviews all over Melbourne. When he sat down with the British media after the Kukushkin and Nishikori matches, he was relaxed and funny \u2013 and not a little upset with his old rival, Jim Courier. First, he expounded on where he and Murray have got to in their still fresh partnership. &quot;I wasn&apos;t hired to get Andy to the quarters,&quot; he said. &quot;We all know that. He doesn&apos;t need me to get to the quarters or semis, he&apos;s done that without me and he could do that without me again. That&apos;s not to say he&apos;s going to win. Nishikori is a good player, you don&apos;t get to the quarters by being a bad player now, ten years from now, or 20 years ago. It just doesn&apos;t happen. &quot;Hopefully I can help Andy, whether it&apos;s talking to me, asking for my experience, helping him a little bit here and little bit there, just to go to the next step \u2013 that&apos;s the goal. Not just for here obviously.&quot; And what about Courier, whom Lendl beat in their four meetings and who is now a slick TV presenter with no shortage of anecdotes from the past for the local Channel 7 viewers? Courier plainly has an edgy relationship with Lendl, having said on air on Monday that his reason for hooking up with Murray was &quot;a little bit more mercenary&quot; than it might appear. &quot;He hasn&apos;t been allowed to make any money from tennis for the past 15 years because he cashed in disability insurance [because of his back trouble],&quot; Courier said. &quot;That is the reason Ivan is back playing again. There are all sorts of complexities there.&quot; He tried to leaven the broadside, when he added: &quot;I think it is great that Ivan is back in our sport. I don&apos;t like it when our champions disappear and lose contact with the sport. Now he will be 20-25 weeks on the road. It is great to have him back.&quot; Well, he might be advised to steer clear of Old Stoneface for a while. &quot;That&apos;s ridiculous,&quot; was his response. &quot;Jim shouldn&apos;t be saying stuff like that. First of all it&apos;s wrong and he doesn&apos;t have the proper information. End of story.&quot; His more immediate concern is his new day job. And he will not be tinkering much with Murray&apos;s game, although there have been signs the player is keener in this tournament to attack when opportunities present themselves. &quot;Some players learn quicker than others,&quot; Lendl said. &quot;When the door is open, you have to be ready to step through it.&quot; But, he added: &quot;Obviously I have an idea how the game should be played. You asked me if that was the way I would ask Andy to play, and I said absolutely not. You have a player of this calibre, you don&apos;t do anything radical, that would be suicidal, crazy, the biggest mistake we could make. You do a little thing here, a little thing there.&quot; What he has done is take Murray away from the hubbub of Melbourne Park to the serenity of nearby Kooyong to practise. &quot;I used to do it this way at the French, over here and at Flushing [Meadows]. On any day you don&apos;t have to come here, it takes less out of you mentally and physically because nobody is tugging away at you. It&apos;s just the four or five of us [in Murray&apos;s team] there, nobody around. You can make any kind of joke with anyone you want. &quot;We just have a good time and they treat us nicely. Andy can get his physio done there, you get a really nice lunch, it&apos;s very quiet instead of being in the rushed atmosphere over here.&quot; Off the court, they recognise each other&apos;s space as well. Do they dine together? &quot;It&apos;s Andy&apos;s call. I don&apos;t want to make too many changes. Kim [Sears, his girlfriend] is here, they do their own thing for dinner. I just say to him, &apos;Let me know whenever you need me, I&apos;m here.&apos; I just go down to the food court, get something to eat and go to bed. If he doesn&apos;t need me on a day off I go off and play golf; if he needs me and wants to talk over dinner then we talk over\u00a0dinner.&quot; There could be many pleasant dinners to come if their relationship continues to prosper. Lendl is taking nothing for granted, though. If Murray beats Nishikori, the prize is a replay of last year&apos;s final against Novak Djokovic in the semis on Friday. It is a recurring nightmare he is desperate to erase. Do that, and there will be plenty of time later for laughs. Who is Kei Nishikori? The yoke upon which a developing tennis nation&apos;s hopes are carried, in the men&apos;s game at least. The 22-year-old has long since moved on from Project 45 \u2013 his plan to eclipse the career-best ranking of Shuzo Matsuoka, the Wimbledon quarter-finalist who retired in 1996 \u2013 rising to 24th in the world in November. In Melbourne this year he became the first Japanese male to be seeded at a slam, and moved into uncharted territory by reaching the last eight. Is he used to playing under pressure? Japan identifies its icons at a young age and few nations generate hype in quite the same way. Like Murray, Nishikori had celebrity bestowed upon him as a gauche teenager and the corporate world took notice. For Murray&apos;s representation, XIX Entertainment company read IMG for Nishikori \u2013 the publicity behemoths who look after Tiger Woods, Roger Federer and Li Na, the only Asian slam winner. In IMG&apos;s eyes Nishikori is a commercial sure-thing. Where did he come from? Born in Shimane, one of Japan&apos;s sleepier prefectures, he began playing tennis at five. Seven years later he went through a selection process in Tokyo to win a place at Nick Bollettieri&apos;s academy in Bradenton, Florida, where he still lives. An assiduous worker, he struggled for self-belief among the tennis brats, but eventually made the transition through the Challenger Tour and on to make his World Tour debut in 2007. He won his only career title \u2013 at Delray Beach \u2013 the following year, also qualifying for Wimbledon and winning ATP newcomer of the year for 2008. Injury has hindered his progress but was a losing finalist in two Tour events last year. How well does he know Murray? Brad Gilbert, Murray&apos;s coach between 2006 and 2007, now coaches Nishikori. They have played only once \u2013 at the Shanghai Masters last October. Murray, the eventual winner, won in straight sets. Even so, Nishikori can swot up on the Scot&apos;s game with his coach Brad Gilbert, the father of a former room-mate and more significantly, Murray&apos;s coach for 16 months between 2006 and 2007. Gilbert and Murray did not get on, so this meeting could be interesting. How does he play? Tommy Haas, the veteran German player and a friend of Nishikori, describes him as &quot;a very dangerous player. He&apos;s got that &apos;Bollettieri style&apos;, with the big forehand and quick feet. He&apos;s very eager to improve and he has.&quot; Bollettieri himself goes a little further: &quot;He&apos;s a great shot-maker and a fantastic mover. What we&apos;ve worked on is getting a little more zip on his second serve so it&apos;s not attackable. I feel if he doesn&apos;t get injured, he has a darn good chance of getting into the single digits in the rankings.&quot;", "tags": ["Australian Open 2012", "Ivan Lendl", "Andy Murray", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-23T23:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/24/liverpool-heritage-waterfront-damage", "sentences": ["But they warned that if the \u00a35.5bn Peel Holdings development, including tall buildings such as the Shanghai Tower, went ahead, this profile would be shifted to the north by introducing a secondary cluster of high-rises, with towers three times the size of the Three Graces.", "Liverpool Waters features 9,000 flats, hundreds of offices, hotels, bars and a cruise terminal, as well as the 55-storey Shanghai Tower and other skyscrapers.", "Peel Holdings has previously agreed to scale down the height of the Shanghai Tower to address heritage concerns."], "title": "Liverpool's world heritage waterfront faces 'irreversible damage', report says", "article": "Liverpool&apos;s world heritage site waterfront will be &quot;irreversibly damaged&quot; unless urgent modifications are made to a multibillion-pound skyscraper scheme, a delegation from Unesco has warned. The delegation said the skyscraper proposal would result in &quot;a serious loss of historic authenticity&quot;. The Unesco inspectors praised the &quot;more or less symmetrical profile&quot; of the city&apos;s waterfront, with the Three Graces \u2013 the Port of Liverpool and the Liver and Cunard buildings \u2013 at centre stage and historical docklands to the north complementing those to the south. The Graces were &quot;at the heart of the shipping and harbour operations during the height of [Liverpool&apos;s] glory, surrounded by dockyards and port structures&quot;, they said. But they warned that if the \u00a35.5bn Peel Holdings development, including tall buildings such as the Shanghai Tower, went ahead, this profile would be shifted to the north by introducing a secondary cluster of high-rises, with towers three times the size of the Three Graces. They would &quot;[relegate] the Three Graces to playing second violin&quot;, the inspectors found, &quot;thereby losing an important visual and historical reference to the city&apos;s glorious past&quot;. The Unesco report said the views of the Three Graces from Kings Dock would disappear amid the supertowers. The report urged Peel Holdings, Liverpool city council and English Heritage to find a compromise on the Liverpool Waters scheme to regenerate the city&apos;s northern docklands. But it did not spell out what would happen to the city&apos;s world heritage status if no changes were made to the project. It had been feared the report could recommend removing the status if the scheme was given planning permission, but it did not go that far. The report said: &quot;The mission concludes that, if the proposed Liverpool Waters scheme as outlined during the mission would be implemented, the world heritage property would be irreversibly damaged, due to a serious deterioration of its architectural and town planning coherence, a serious loss of historical authenticity, and an important loss of cultural significance.&quot; Unesco, which oversees world heritage sites, dispatched inspectors to the city last November over concerns that the huge project, which falls within the world heritage site, would damage its &quot;outstanding universal value&quot;. Ron van Oers and Patricia Alberth, from Unesco, and Giancarlo Barbato, an Italian conservation architect from the International Committee on Monuments and Statues, conducted a three-day visit. Their findings will be considered by its World Heritage Committee in the summer. Liverpool Waters features 9,000 flats, hundreds of offices, hotels, bars and a cruise terminal, as well as the 55-storey Shanghai Tower and other skyscrapers. It involves two clusters of tall buildings, one near the city centre and a second further north. Peel Holdings has previously agreed to scale down the height of the Shanghai Tower to address heritage concerns. Liverpool City council&apos;s leader, Joe Anderson, said he welcomed the findings of the report, adding that it was &quot;really encouraging they are pressing for a compromise which would enable Liverpool Waters to go ahead&quot;. He said: &quot;I have always believed there is a way forward which will allow us to redevelop the North Liverpool Docks and secure the massive investment and badly needed new jobs, and to also preserve our world heritage status. Peel have already made significant alterations to their proposals since drawing up the original plans.&quot; Anderson said the \u00a36bn plans were vital for the future of what is one of the poorest parts of the country, and the investment is vital to Liverpool&apos;s future prosperity. &quot;However, we are mindful of the need to build a better future for our city in a careful and sensitive way,&quot; he added. The delegation, he added, found the conservation of the world heritage site had improved since its last visit in 2006, with new developments at the Pier Head, Liverpool One shopping and the Ropewalks area. Anderson said he was pressing English Heritage, Peel and the city council to redouble their efforts to reach an agreement on the best way forward. The council&apos;s chief executive, Ged Fitzgerald, said a public consultation was under way and discussions would continue before the planning committee decides on the application in March. &quot;We will work in collaboration with English Heritage and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to respond to the mission and its report,&quot; he said. English Heritage said the mission report identified a number of significant concerns about the impact the Liverpool Waters development on the world heritage site and advised that it should work with the city council and Peel to resolve the concerns. &quot;As a statutory advisor to Liverpool city council, we will be very willing to do so if invited,&quot; English Heritage said. &quot;We believe that a revised scheme for the central docks could reduce the amount of harm to the world heritage site and deliver long-term benefits which include jobs and growth but also the repair and reuse of historic buildings.&quot; Peel Holdings declined to comment.", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Unesco", "Heritage", "Culture", "UK news", "Skyscrapers"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-24T16:47:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/25/rory-mcilroy-tiger-woods-abu-dhabi", "sentences": ["The German has won this tournament three times and, after a few lost months spent trying to change his swing, he recaptured the form that briefly made him world No1 with a victory in Shanghai last November."], "title": "Rory McIlroy set to test Tiger Woods in Abu Dhabi Championship", "article": "Changed days indeed for Rory McIlroy, who not so long ago had to sneak inside the fairway ropes to steal a closer look at Tiger Woods. On Thursday the Northern Irishman will have the best seat in the house when the defining golfer of a generation begins his 2012 season. The pair played a practice round together here on Tuesday and, along with Luke Donald, will spend the first two rounds of the Abu Dhabi Championship in each other&apos;s company. &quot;Not exactly low profile,&quot; was McIlroy&apos;s assessment of the tournament draw. Not exactly, although the world No3 was not complaining. &quot;There&apos;s not many tournaments where you get really excited about a Thursday or a Friday, but this is one of these times. It will definitely get the juices flowing,&quot; he said. Hopefully the same will be said about galleries. Professional golf may have gravitated towards the Middle East in recent years but that is more a reflection of corporate pursuit of oil dollars than of local taste. Golf as a spectator sport remains a marginal pastime in Abu Dhabi, although Woods&apos;s presence this week is expected to bump up ticket sales. No prizes, then, for guessing which three-ball will attract the biggest galleries on Thursday or which player of the three will garner most attention. Woods&apos;s lustre may have diminished in recent times but he remains the sport&apos;s pre-eminent draw \u2013 a fact acknowledged by McIlroy, the heir presumptive to the American&apos;s status as the game&apos;s most recognisable figure. The king is dead, long live the king? No way, suggested McIlroy. Woods is still the man to measure yourself against. &quot;Growing up and watching Tiger for the last 15 years he was the face of golf for a long, long time. He still is the face of golf. He set the benchmark for a lot of guys \u2013 no one may play the way he did in 2001. He&apos;s still the main attraction in 2012. &quot;I see him contending again in majors. I practised with him and he looked in good shape. He seems determined and looks at full fitness. It can only be good for the game. Hopefully I can get in the mix with him down the stretch on a few Sundays.&quot; For the moment, the 22-year-old from Holywood will have to content himself with trying to beat Woods over four rounds of the brutishly long National course at the Abu Dhabi golf club. That should be eminently possible, not least because while the former world No1 has never played here before, McIlroy has managed three top-five finishes here. He has also spent the past couple of weeks in Dubai fine-tuning his game for the new season. Given his grandstand finish to 2011, when he won twice in Asia against high-quality fields, it is hard to imagine much fine-tuning is needed, although he apparently believes he will step on to the tee in better form than ever. &quot;There were a couple of things I felt I could do a little better, with my posture and with the position of my club at the top of my backswing, and I feel they are clicking into place. This week will be a good gauge of how things are coming along.&quot; If, as he suspects, things are coming along then it is hard to imagine anyone beating McIlroy come Sunday afternoon. If not, there are plenty of others who will happily deny him a victory to open the 2012 season, Martin Kaymer for one. The German has won this tournament three times and, after a few lost months spent trying to change his swing, he recaptured the form that briefly made him world No1 with a victory in Shanghai last November. &quot;There&apos;s just something about this place I really, really like. I can&apos;t wait to get started,&quot; he said on Wednesday. Luke Donald is another for whom the 2012 season cannot come quickly enough. The Englishman is under pressure to sustain the form that elevated him to world No1 last year, although if the prospect terrifies him he is hiding it well. Once upon a time, his knees might have buckled at the news he would be playing alongside Woods, as happened in the final round of the 2006 US PGA Championship in Chicago. Not any more. &quot;I am a much more experienced player now,&quot; Donald said when asked to look back on that afternoon at Medinah Country Club when Woods gave him a lesson. And, the confident Englishman might have added, he is a much better player too. First round tee-off times (All times GMT; local time = plus four hours.

Britain&apos;s swimmers are just starting to emerge for the year, and have been competing in a series of small meets in Europe, Australia and the US. Early performances aside, the real strength of the team is not going to become clear until the selection trials take place at the British championships in Sheffield between 3 and 10 March. The sport&apos;s performance director, Michael Scott, says he expects it to be the most competitive championships in history. At the world championships in Shanghai last July the British team won six medals, which put them fourth in the table. Repeat that in 2012, and the team will have met their target. For Scott, the most encouraging aspect of the Shanghai performance was that they had more semi-finalists and finalists than at any previous world championships. There is no doubt, then, they have strength in depth, a fact also reflected in the nine silver and bronze medals won at the European Short Course Championships in December. But the scale of their success in the Olympics will hinge on whether those swimmers who made finals are able to progress on to the podium. As Scott says: &quot;We had three fourth places that were 2.7 seconds away from the podium. Our focus is on those inches and making sure we convert them next year.&quot; The new Speedo Fastskin 3 suit and the boost provided by competing at home could both give an edge that helps them do that. There is a disparity between the relative strength of the British women and the British men. Of the six medals won in Shanghai, only one was by a man, Liam Tancock in the 50 metres backstroke. Sadly, that discipline is not on the Olympic programme. In 2012 Tancock will focus on the 100m backstroke, but his chances there are not nearly so good. Michael Jamieson, the 200m breaststroke swimmer, finished fifth in Shanghai, and James Goddard finished fourth in the 200m individual medley. But the bulk of those six medals will most likely come from the women&apos;s squad, who have been one of the great success stories of British sport in recent years. Rebecca Adlington and Keri-Anne Payne are both world champions in Olympic disciplines. Adlington could conceivably win three medals across the 800m freestyle, 400m freestyle and 4x200m freestyle relay. In 2011 there were also breakthrough performances by Ellen Gandy, who was a fingertip away from gold in the 200m butterfly, and Hannah Miley, who won silver in the 200m individual medley. Their performances compensated for the slight tailing-off in form shown by the freestyler Jo Jackson and the backstrokers Gemma Spofforth and Lizzie Simmonds. Fran Halsall, who won five medals at both the 2010 European championships and the Commonwealth Games that same year, finished fourth in both the 50m and 100m free in Shanghai. Given her recovery from an ankle injury meant she had only a month&apos;s training before the championships, she will expect to do better in 2012. What&apos;s still to be decided? Barring injuries, the top end of the squad picks itself. But below the racing certs the competition, especially in the women&apos;s freestyle and butterfly, is fierce. &quot;There will be surprises at our trials, and disappointments, no doubt,&quot; Scott says. &quot;But the positive is that this is going to occur because of the depth of talent we have in a number of events. In some disciplines we have four or five people competing for two slots. That is very healthy from my perspective because it keeps everyone honest and hungry.&quot; What they say Michael Scott, performance director &quot;Our style is to work towards key points in our journey, and the first of those this year is the selection of our team, which is 40 days away. I believe the swimmers in the world class programme are in the best physical and mental condition I&apos;ve seen them in the four years I have been in Britain. By and large we have very few injury concerns. People are physically fit, and mentally they are very hungry. They are looking forward to the trials and the opportunity that will give them to show how they have progressed since the world championships in Shanghai last year. So, overall we have a very upbeat and positive attitude in the programme. &quot;As soon as the trials are over our mindset needs to change. Being selected is only one step, it is not the end of the journey. Because of the importance of the Olympics we really need to emphasise that we&apos;re only at half-time for the team, and we will need to move forward with the same passion and commitment from March through to August. We will have an orientation session the day after the conclusion of the trials on 11 March, where everyone will be given a full briefing on the road to the Olympics.&quot; Guardian verdict In Adlington and Payne the swimming team will have two of the stars of the Games. Between Halsall, Gandy, Miley, Spofforth, Simmonds, Jackson, Jemma Lowe and Jazz Carlin the richness of talent in the women&apos;s squad beggars belief. If home advantage provides the boost that British Swimming are banking on, the women could win all those six medals between them. 2013 New year honours? Bunting and ticker tape for the women, brickbats and sympathetic pats on the back for the men. Synchronised swimming Performance director Biz Price With six months to go \u2026 The team have been working hard through the winter months to get a foundation of hard training under their belts before 2012. We have begun the Olympic year in good form and the Duet athletes, Jenna Randall and Olivia Allison, are currently on a training camp in San Francisco. We have put the final touches to our choreography and have enjoyed working with our BOA Olympic Ambassador Robin Cousins. We are back into full training at the High Performance Centre and the athletes are clocking up approximately 45 hours a week. We&apos;re all excited about the year to come and what it will hold for us. Medal tally prediction \u2026 Our target for both the Team and Duet is to finish in the top six in the finals of the Olympics. When I took over in 2007, the Duet achieved 20th place at the World Championships so to finish within the top six will show our massive improvements in being more competitive on a world stage. We have long-term goals and we know that what our athletes learn in London will be invaluable for their progress towards Rio. Key dates 15-22 April: Test Event and Olympic Qualifiers, London Aquatic Centre. 25 April-4 May: National Team Trials, Aldershot Table tennis Coaching and talent manager Jill Parker With six months to go \u2026 It&apos;s always a tough time of year because everyone has club commitments so they&apos;re all playing in different parts of Europe. But we will be drawing up a shortlist from our longlist of players on 26 Januaryon Thursday, then the final team will be selected around 14 May. After that the squad will be together more to train. Our three highest-ranked people are Paul Drinkhall, Liam Pitchford and Andrew Baggaley, but Liam is the one who has had the results. He beat Vladimir Samsonov, the No9 in the world, and he&apos;s also our youngest player at 19. But then Paul is only 22, so we&apos;re a young team. Medal tally prediction ... I would say it&apos;s unlikely that GB will get a medal at this Games. I think because we&apos;re a relatively young side, the likelihood of them medalling in 2012 would be difficult. If we&apos;re looking long-term, then 2016 or 2020 would be the Games. We have got a young team and it takes a good 10 years really to be top in the field. Key dates 2-4 March: English National Championships, Sheffield. 10-13 May: World Olympic qualification tournament, Doha. 14 May: Great Britain team named Taekwondo Performance director Gary Hall With six months to go \u2026 We had a good Olympics in 2008, with Sarah Stevenson winning a bronze medal, and a really solid European championships the year after. It&apos;s not all been straightforward since but last year we had a great world championships, taking four medals \u2013 three of them in Olympic categories. In terms of progress I feel we&apos;re doing really well, though there is lots of hard work still to be done. The athletes are in intense preparations currently, and are about to fly off to Mexico for three weeks. The key event this year is the European championships in Manchester in May, after which we have to select the team, which will happen in early June. We&apos;re happy with where we are right now, I&apos;d say we&apos;re ahead of where we plotted to be. Medal tally prediction ... We have been consistent on this all the way down the line: we want to build on our performance in Beijing, where we won our first ever medal. We want to be the best prepared team in London and we&apos;re on our way to achieving that. We&apos;ve definitely got the capability for multi-medal success. Key dates 3-4 March: German Open. 3-6 May: European Championships, Manchester. Early June: team selection Tennis Leon Smith, LTA Head of Men&apos;s and Women&apos;s Tennis With six months to go \u2026 Tennis has a 12-month qualifying period whereby players earn points across the course of the year to determine their ranking. On 11 June, the rankings will be set, and we will know which players have been accepted into the Games by right so for a number of our players, such as Elena Baltacha and Anne Keothavong, it&apos;s about continued hard work right up to that point. Keothavong had a great run at the end of 2011 and Baltacha finished last year inside the world&apos;s top 50 so qualification is a possibility if they can keep up their good form. Medal tally predication \u2026 Andy Murray has a realistic chance of a medal. He continues to excel at the major tournaments, having reached at least the semi-finals of all four Ggrand Sslams in 2011. Key dates 11 June: Rankings set for qualification. 28 June: Wild cards announced Triathlon Performance manager Malcolm Brown With six months to go \u2026 We&apos;re happy with where we are at the moment. The major events don&apos;t start again until mid\u2011April, and the last one was the world championships in Beijing at the end of September, so at the moment the triathletes are training away in various parts of the world. Last year went very well from a number of points of view. We tried out the course for the Olympics at the test event in Hyde Park, which doubled up as a major selection race for us. A number of our best athletes performed very well, we won the men&apos;s race and the women&apos;s race and there were a number of good performances behind that. We also had some good results in the world championships, with Alastair Brownlee coming overall first in the men&apos;s ahead of his brother Jonathan in second, and Helen Jenkins winning the women&apos;s world title. Medal tally prediction \u2026 The official negotiated target is one medal, which reflects the fact that we are yet to win an Olympic medal in the discipline. We will have six athletes competing in total, and I&apos;m sure most of those think they can win a medal and hopefully some of them will. All I want is for those athletes to come out feeling that they&apos;ve fulfilled their potential. Key dates 14-15 April: Worlds, Sydney. 10-12 May: Worlds, San Diego. 26-27 May: Worlds, Madrid.

That fascinating bit of history, which Murdoch tried to shrug off during New Corp&apos;s takeover of Dow Jones in 2007, was retold by Patten to the Leveson inquiry on Monday. He explained that his book about his experiences as Britain&apos;s last governor of Hong Kong contained material critical of the Chinese authorities at a time when Murdoch was hoping to expand in China. Patten told Leveson: &quot;Plainly, Mr Murdoch took the view that publishing a book critical of the Chinese leadership would not improve his chances, so he instructed HarperCollins to drop the book on the grounds that it was no good.&quot; It was, said Patten, a commercial decision. And it transpired that it was a commercial success for both men. Patten got his \u00a350,000 advance from HarperCollins and when the book was published in America by another company it was promoted with a sticker on the front saying: &quot;The book that Rupert Murdoch refused to publish&quot;. So, said Patten, &quot;it was worth tens of thousands on the sales of the book.&quot; And Murdoch&apos;s success? A journalist friend, Oscar Blend, points out that although the incident didn&apos;t make the least difference to his attempts to extend his empire into China, he did benefit commercially, if tangentially. In April 1998, two months after the dumping of Patten&apos;s book had become a story around the world, the Chinese communist party chief, Jiang Zemin, surprised delegates to the annual peoples&apos; congress by extolling the virtues of the movie Titanic. And one of the studios that helped stump up the enormous budget for that film was, of course, Murdoch&apos;s 20th Century Fox. No-one seemed to make the link at the time. The single report I can find about Jiang&apos;s enthusiasm for Titanic, in the New York Times, says only that he recommended it as some kind capitalist lesson. But it certainly worked in Murdoch&apos;s favour. The movie opened in Shanghai to record crowds and tickets were sold out in Beijing. Anyway, Patten has a reason to smile just now after nine successful months as chairman of the BBC Trust, the subject of my London Evening Standard column today.", "tags": ["Media", "Lord Patten", "Rupert Murdoch", "News Corporation", "The Titanic", "BBC Trust", "Leveson inquiry", "Dow Jones", "20th Century Fox", "China"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-25T16:20:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/25/hollywood-skyscraper-mission-impossible-bond", "sentences": ["In the preceding Mission: Impossible, Cruise also leapt off a tall building, this time in Shanghai."], "title": "The height of suspense: Hollywood's love affair with the skyscraper", "article": "Aerial shots over Manhattan&apos;s forest of skyscrapers. Yellow cabs crawling like ants through the city grid. The hero stands on a ledge 20 floors up, provoking a street theatre of police cordons, firetrucks, news crews and onlookers. Meanwhile, in a top-floor office, a corporate villain admires an architectural model of another shiny skyscraper. Elsewhere, an acrobatic thief hangs precariously in an elevator shaft, dropping a spanner that goes clanging down innumerable storeys to the ground. The ominous ping of an approaching elevator spells danger. The hero and villain finally meet for a climactic rooftop showdown. These scenes could be from a hundred Hollywood movies or more, but in fact they&apos;re from just one: Man on a Ledge, an enjoyably silly new thriller that at least sets out its stall in the title. You can guess most of its plot from those generic snippets, but Man on a Ledge is just the latest piece of proof that movies love skyscrapers and skyscrapers love movies. They always have. In fact, they&apos;re practically twins. The exact date of birth could be disputed, but it&apos;s safe to say that while rising land prices and advances in steel were pushing buildings upwards in Chicago and New York at the end of the 19th century, inventors like Edison and the Lumi\u00e8re brothers were realising they might be on to something with their moving-picture machines. Where would the movies be without the thrilling cinematic images tall buildings provide, both inside and out? The alone is estimated to have featured in more than 250 movies. Then there&apos;s their crashingly unsubtle metaphorical value. It doesn&apos;t take a genius to fathom the symbolism at work with, say, the diminutive Tom Cruise scaling the world&apos;s tallest building in the latest Mission: Impossible, or a rampant King Kong roaring from the top of the Empire State Building; or San Francisco&apos;s TransAmerica tower looming priapically in the background of Basic Instinct as Michael Douglas gets into a lather over Sharon Stone. For most of the 20th century, it was simple: the home of the movies and the home of the skyscraper were the same place. These two distinctly masculine enterprises worked together to broadcast America&apos;s virility to the world. But the marriage now has complications. In metaphorical terms, the attacks of 9/11 hit the US where it hurt, and the current financial crisis hasn&apos;t helped. Where the skyscrapers have gone, the movies have had to follow \u2013 and nine of the world&apos;s 10 tallest buildings are now in Asia. That recent Mission: Impossible benefited greatly from the use of Dubai&apos;s 163-storey Burj Khalifa (over $500m at the box office and counting). Dubai hasn&apos;t done badly out of it either. When the Burj Khalifa opened two years ago, the emirate had an image problem, what with its economic and architectural bubble bursting. But Mission: Impossible seems to have fixed that. According to the movie&apos;s producers, the first time they visited Dubai, they said: &quot;We have to come back here and shoot a movie.&quot; But Dubai was also a hefty financial backer of the film, and using the Burj as a major location appears to have been a condition. So the building, designed by US architects SOM, not only featured in loving closeups, inside and out, but Dubai also got to hold the world premiere of this &quot;local&quot; film \u2013 bringing Cruise, celebrity special guests and the world&apos;s media to the Dubai film festival last month. Whenever a new Asian skyscraper is completed, it seems, Hollywood rushes to get there and jump off it. In the preceding Mission: Impossible, Cruise also leapt off a tall building, this time in Shanghai. Before that, in an indication of how quickly the gimmick can date, we had Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones in 1999&apos;s Entrapment, dangling off Kuala Lumpur&apos;s Petronas Towers, then enjoying a brief reign as the world&apos;s tallest buildings. You could say the process of America&apos;s corporate emasculation began as far back as 1988, with Die Hard (surely a high-point in skyscraper movies): although set in Los Angeles, the film decided to rename its hijacked building the Nakatomi Plaza and make it Japanese-owned (in fact, it was the city&apos;s Fox Plaza). As Die Hard reminds us, skyscrapers are movie shorthand for &quot;faceless corporation&quot;, usually going hand in hand with overbearing evil and phallic overcompensation. Man on a Ledge is no different: predictably, the ledge he&apos;s on is owned by the chief baddie, the one with a model of a skyscraper (his next one). For good symbolic measure, he also smokes a huge cigar. Yet, for all that they celebrate the manly tumescence of tall architecture, such movies are invariably on the side of the little man (and we&apos;re not just talking about Cruise here). The juxtaposition of a lone individual and a gigantic edifice often tells you all you need to know about a movie&apos;s intentions. In the silent era, skyscrapers were something of a fad. There&apos;s the much-imitated image of Harold Lloyd hanging off that clock 10 storeys up in 1923&apos;s Safety Last! Lloyd made a string of high-rise movies, such as High and Dizzy, Look Out Below and Never Weaken. In most, his little man rises to the summit, overcoming the emasculating forces of urban life. His myriad successors have done the same. In 2008&apos;s Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire, in which French tightrope walker Philippe Petit conquers the Twin Towers, the little-man thrill is the same, albeit enhanced by such an emotionally loaded location. Which brings us to the other thing that&apos;s changed about skyscrapers. The destruction of the Twin Towers was the final nail in the coffin for America&apos;s skyscraper-and-movie marriage. In the immediate aftermath, the towers were removed from up-and-coming movies like Zoolander and Men In Black II. They vanished too from the original trailer for Spider-man; as for the film itself, its scenes of the superhero swinging between skyscrapers suddenly looked very out of date. Nowadays the towers have to be digitally inserted in New York movies that are set in the past. In 2004, the architect Rem Koolhaas wrote: &quot;The skyscraper has become less interesting in inverse proportion to its success. It has not been refined, but corrupted; the promise it once held \u2026 has been negated by repetitive banality.&quot; You could say the same thing about Hollywood. Just as the high-rise has nowhere to go except upwards, so movies like Man on a Ledge find themselves stuck on a familiar narrative track, running from street level up to the inevitable rooftop showdown. In the 1960s and 70s, architectural groups like the metabolists and Archigram proposed alternatives to the boom in towers, while Britain&apos;s Leslie Martin and Lionel March argued that they don&apos;t solve urban density problems. Koolhaas, who was a screenwriter before becoming an architect, presented his own anti-skyscraper in the form of Beijing&apos;s CCTV television headquarters, which effectively folds a tower in half and brings it back down to the ground. If there is a crisis, both industries are in denial. The genre-movie production line churns on, and the skyscrapers keep going up. There are a few more security measures beneath the skin of the Freedom Tower, which stands where the Twin Towers once stood, but externally its generic-looking design says: &quot;Nothing&apos;s changed.&quot; Upcoming movies like the rebooted Spider-Man also seek to reassert the primacy of the New York skyline in the face of all this competition: Norman Foster&apos;s Hearst Tower is a key location in the movie. And some of that competition is now coming from London, thanks to its belated stab at high-rise kudos with the Shard. Looming large over the city, Renzo Piano&apos;s 87-storey tower seems destined to figure in the new era of &quot;more commercial&quot; British movies the government is calling for. According to the Shard&apos;s marketing agent, they&apos;ve been receiving filming requests at the rate of about one a week. So far they&apos;ve turned them all down, they say, but you can just picture Colin Firth struggling to express himself to Keira Knightley in its lift, or Daniel Craig and Tom Cruise fighting it out on the rooftop to see who gets to use it first, James Bond or Mission: Impossible. Meanwhile, back in real life, details of the next 007 novel have just been released. It&apos;s set in Dubai. \u2022 This article was corrected on 27 January 2012 because the original said that in the immediate aftermath of the World Trade Center&apos;s destruction, the towers were digitally removed from Spider-Man.

This week, news that Marco Polo House in Battersea, south London, is finally to be demolished suggests that the nail has finally been driven into the coffin of postmodernism. This cartoonish, pseudo-classical office block, clad in grey and white marble, was designed and built by the flamboyant architect developer Ian Pollard, best known today as one half of a &quot;Naked Gardeners&quot; team. Once the Pollard building goes, it will be replaced by a Miami-meets-Shanghai mixed-use development designed by Scott Brownrigg. I wonder how long it will be before London tires of the latest round of property development? I wonder, too, what the next architectural fashion will be.     Decadent decor ... the newly renovated Hotel Le Berger in Brussels    If your taste does run to PoMo excess, you might want to check in to the newly renovated Hotel Le Berger in Brussels. Originally built and decorated between 1935 and 1937 as a decidedly spicy rendez-vous hotel (with rooms rented for the afternoon) this extraordinary 50-room hotel reopens this week. The architect in charge of the revamp is Olivia Gustot, who&apos;s working with the interior decorator Martina Nievergelt. Much of the original decadent decor has been preserved, and a smart new restaurant and bar have been added.     Inspiring spaces ... Glass House Estate from John Pawson's A Visual Inventory    Profoundly memorable architecture, however \u2013 architecture that will ride the rollercoaster of fashion and be admired in years, decades and centuries to come \u2013 derives as much from a regard for proportion, light and the intelligent amassing of materials as it does from acute observation of patterns, materials, senses and feelings. To this effect, A Visual Inventory, a new book by John Pawson published next month, is both a pleasure and an inspiration. Pawson is designing the interior of the new Design Museum housed in the striking Commonwealth Institute in Kensington, west London. Pawson&apos;s snapshots of buildings and places that have inspired him, whether through the play of light on brickwork or details of floorboards in a Swedish church hall, cut to the essence of architectural beauty without having to put this nebulous idea into words. This week, I found an equal sensitivity to architectural beauty in The Land of Decoration, a wonderful first novel by Grace McCleen. Her narrator, an imaginative 10-year-old girl brought up in a Christian fundamentalist home in an industrial town in Wales, creates the Land of Milk and Honey promised by God to Moses in the Book of Exodus; she makes this from pipe cleaners, yogurt pots and bit and bobs. This land created in her bedroom is the stuff of memorable architecture and cities.     Magical shelter ... illustration by Evgenii Rachev from The Magic Glove    Most moving of all this week, I found a website devoted to the work of Evgenii Rachev, who illustrated an old Russian folk tale called The Magic Glove. This is one of the first books I ever read by myself and I have been looking for a copy, without success, ever since. Well, here it is on the web. When Rachev illustrates the glove&apos;s transformation into a shelter for these woodland creatures, he shows a childlike sense of wonder at architecture as a magical process. He understood much about the nature of space, the desire to design alluring buildings but, above all, the ineffable qualities of a place of dream-like shelter, something the best architects try hard to imagine: spaces and buildings as far removed from both Pruitt Igoe, postmodernism and other affected styles as it is possible to get.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-27T14:53:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/china-development-renewables-sustainability", "sentences": ["Having come straight to the World Economic Forum from three weeks in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, it is immediately clear to me that there is a real commitment to develop new rules that promote sustainable development in China \u2013 and that this commitment is being backed up by significant investment in areas such as energy efficiency and clean energy through the latest five-year plan.", "But whether in discussions on the slopes in Switzerland or in the skyscrapers of Shanghai, like it or not, China seems to be the only potential game-changer in town."], "title": "Is China the global game-changer for sustainability?", "article": "One of the recurring themes in conversations at Davos this week is whether China could provide the beginnings of a solution for scaling sustainability and decoupling growth from environmental impact. And, if so, whether China could be the global game-changer in the future. As is often the case, it is partly a question of definition. To be considered a global game-changer, China would need to influence mainstream market forces of supply, demand and the rules of the game both at home and abroad \u2013 and channel these towards a more sustainable model for economic growth. So, is China moving in that direction? Having come straight to the World Economic Forum from three weeks in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, it is immediately clear to me that there is a real commitment to develop new rules that promote sustainable development in China \u2013 and that this commitment is being backed up by significant investment in areas such as energy efficiency and clean energy through the latest five-year plan. China is expected to spend nearly US$1.6tr on its strategic sectors in the next five years, with the main focus being clean energy investments. At the same time, China is also pursuing a goal of &quot;harmonious urbanisation&quot; and the shift to intelligent cities. This investment comes at an interesting time. The Chinese government is, for example, beginning to move away from GDP as the sole measure of economic development. President Hu Jintao recently vowed to reduce the country&apos;s dependence on GDP, saying economic development should aim to improve people&apos;s livelihoods and welfare rather than purely push for growth in GDP. This approach will have significant implications for government spending, state-owned enterprises and the wider context in which business will operate. Our recent study with the World Economic Forum, More With Less: Scaling Sustainable Consumption and Resource Efficiency, shows that China is beginning to envision how its development interests are aligned to sustainable growth and better environmental outcomes, and working to mobilise diverse interests to the cause. For example, the China Greentech Initiative, founded in 2008, is one of the leading international collaboration platforms offering green technology insights and partnering opportunities to technology companies, service providers, investors and policymakers. The initiative is currently focused on identifying areas where private companies can innovate to help deliver governmental targets around the 12th Chinese five-year plan. As Chinese companies seek to deliver on government \u2013 and their own \u2013 objectives, and move up the global value chain, from being the workshop of the world to becoming a major global player, there will be an ever greater imperative to drive sustainability into core business and supply chains. This would not only meet expectations in export markets in Europe and North America, but would build trust with local policy makers, consumers and other stakeholders. Businesses are also starting to make greater commitments to sustainability. The UN Global Compact local network in China was relaunched last November, with a new constitution defining membership, governance and other substantive issues. The local network, which has been shown in other regions to be one of the most powerful catalysing forces for change, will offer new frameworks to share experiences in advancing Global Compact principles, and will send a clear signal that Chinese business is serious about sustainability. While joining a business network doesn&apos;t always indicate performance or outcome, execution and action in key areas seem to indicate movement in the right direction. In 2010, for example, China invested over $51 billion in new renewable energy projects \u2013 accounting for nearly 20% of global investments. The commitment to the development of wind energy by Chinese companies is unparalleled: by the end of 2011, wind power accounted for 45GW of generation capacity, more than in the US. Renewable energy is clearly an engine for growth. So don&apos;t get me wrong \u2013 others such as South Korea, the Nordics and Brazil are making investments, but from my discussions in the corridors of the Congress Centre in Davos it seems that China is the only real, large market in the world where game-changing sustainability is emerging and has the potential to truly scale. We need to recognise that there are still significant challenges that China is aiming to overcome \u2013 for example, in moving consumption and demand onto a more sustainable path, tackling health and environmental safety, and ensuring that the proceeds of growth in a fast-rising economy create shared value. I am not saying there aren&apos;t two sides to this coin. China faces big issues, such as the transition to clean coal and more environmentally focused manufacturing. But to me, China&apos;s emerging direction offers a unique opportunity to transform sustainability from rhetoric into action, and provides the beginnings of a real solution to the challenge of sustainable development. And that will lead some to question a lot of conventional wisdom and prejudices that seem embedded in powerful streams of western thinking and the sustainability movement. So, as I reflect on discussions here in Davos, and indeed every time I visit China, I am struck that the pace of change seems greater than ever before. The scale of their ambition in areas such as clean energy, resource efficiency and environmental measures \u2013 not to mention harmonious urbanisation \u2013 is growing by the day. But is this a step-shift or is it transformational? Perhaps it is too early to tell if current efforts will be successful in driving a long-term global and local economic transformation on sustainability. But whether in discussions on the slopes in Switzerland or in the skyscrapers of Shanghai, like it or not, China seems to be the only potential game-changer in town.

A simple mass of people, a great temple, a hub of learning, trade or transport? Colin McEvedy&apos;s idiosyncratic book, a survey of 120 &quot;centres of ancient civilisation&quot;, doesn&apos;t ask the question, but unwittingly suggests some answers. In doing so, it tells us almost as much about contemporary urban life as it does about the distant past. An incomplete catalogue of every city of significance in the Roman and Mesopotamian worlds, it takes in backwaters and glittering capitals from Lincoln to Lyons to Alexandria. The author was an intriguing character who, as well as being a psychiatrist at Ealing hospital, was a historian, demographer and armchair archaeologist, and had yet to finish his magnum opus when he died in 2005. This book represents the efforts of his family and editors to collect what had already been written \u2013 and sketched out, for the mapmaking was an important part of the project \u2013 and present it in something like the form he intended. The result is a genially written encyclopedia, with each entry telling us something of the history, topography and size of the city concerned. McEvedy&apos;s particular obsessions are threaded through the book \u2013 he jousts with other scholars over population estimates \u2013 but he has a light enough touch that the prose is always readable. The maps that accompany the entries are all done to the same scale, making it possible to compare, say, the vastness of Alexandria, whose walls enclosed an area of more than 1,000 hectares, to puny, 65-hectare Pompeii. Though well-executed, they&apos;re a bit too reminiscent of diagrams in geography textbooks, passing up the opportunity for something more gorgeous. The stories of the rise and fall of each city are dealt with matter-of-factly. Some clung on to rise again in modern times, others disappeared practically without a trace. You can almost hear the sands sweeping over deserted forums as McEvedy points to a lack of adequate defences or silted-up harbours before moving on to the next. The main reason most of these settlements failed was the decline in prosperity and effective political organisation as the Romans retreated. This did for most of the northern towns they created or made flourish. In the east, dynastic squabbles and changes in patronage were as often the agents of urban decay. Memphis gave way to Alexandria as the Greeks stamped their rule on Egypt; Babylon to Seleucia on the Tigris under similar circumstances. Seleucia in turn was abandoned by the Parthians in favour of Ctesiphon. At the time, Paris and London, even Jerusalem, were poor and ramshackle. Carthage, Ephesus and Antioch were the jewels of the age, drawing to them peoples from across the Mediterranean, enriching themselves and building great public works. They didn&apos;t, of course, make it through the sieve of history (though modern Antioch, Antakya, is a medium-sized Turkish city). Those that did survive have a very different face today: most of McEvedy&apos;s cities had a population of around 10,000. Ancient Rome and Alexandria may have reached 250,000, but that is only the size of modern Wolverhampton. In the 21st century, London&apos;s population laps up against the eight million mark, which is still ten million less than Shanghai. Is there any meaningful sense in which these seas of people are &quot;cities&quot;? What is the relationship between Seleucia and Los Angeles? Ironically, given his fixation with it, what McEvedy shows us is that it&apos;s a mistake to get too hung up on population. The places he deals with were tiny by modern standards, but loom large in the imagination, suggesting that the idea of a city may be more important than its physical properties. And beyond a certain minimum level of civic pride expressed in stone or steel or glass, the essence of a city lies in its relationship to a hinterland and to other cities. Shanghai could well be to a Chinese villager what Rome was to an Etruscan farmer: a centre of wealth, power and spectacle. And Shanghai will vie with Tokyo and S\u00e3o Paulo for trophies such as the Olympics, the headquarters of international institutions and other wonders, just as its ancient counterparts did. There&apos;s another lesson, of course, in McEvedy&apos;s work: cities have a lifespan. Only a lucky few pass through that historical sieve. In the ancient world, they thrived for perhaps 1,000 years before falling into ruin.

It is, after all, the issue that binds the entire Tour in common purpose. The players&apos; insurrection over workload that was spiked in New York and subsided in Shanghai bubbled up again in Melbourne over the past fortnight and is the prevailing backdrop to the men&apos;s game. It may not be an issue to inspire a Jarrow march but, for athletes who red-line their systems in nearly every match beyond the quarter-finals, it is at the core of their self-interest. So, what shape are the finalists in? Both have hinted at recent problems, Nadal a pinched tendon in his right knee that he has strapped throughout, Djokovic a slight ping in his left hamstring and, more worryingly, trouble again with his breathing, which sapped his energy against David Ferrer and again against Andy Murray. &quot;I&apos;ve seen a doctor and I&apos;ve talked with a couple of players that have had allergy problems this year in Australia for no reason,&quot; the defending champion said of the breathing breakdowns that have twice had him sucking up air mid-match. &quot;They are problems they didn&apos;t have in the last couple years. I suppose that&apos;s my problem, as well. I&apos;ve been trying to do everything possible to clear that out. But we are all surrounded with the flowers. It&apos;s really difficult to take that away. Physically, I need to be fit. I know that I maybe have a mental edge because I&apos;ve won six finals when we played in 2011 and I&apos;ve had lots of success against\u00a0him. &quot;On the other hand, it&apos;s a new year. It&apos;s a new challenge. It&apos;s a different situation. He has maybe a day&apos;s advantage over me for recovery [having played the first semi-final, against Roger Federer on Thursday] and for getting ready for the finals. That&apos;s going to be my main priority and concern, to physically be able to perform my best and be ready to play five sets. If I am able to do that, then I can believe that I can win.&quot; As for his opponent, Djokovic said: &quot;Roger started off really well [against Nadal]. It was an incredible effort from Rafa to come back and [hit] some incredible passing shots. That&apos;s why he&apos;s a champion. That&apos;s why he&apos;s one of the best players to ever play this game. He&apos;s never giving up. He has a fighting spirit. He has very few weaknesses.&quot; Some of those have settled around both knees for years now; others visit his shoulder, or his feet. Nadal is never free of pain. It is a wonder he plays through it so often and with such brilliance. &quot;I am enjoying these two days off,&quot; he saidon Saturday. &quot;I practised for two hours, and felt I need to move well the\u00a0body.&quot; When it was put to him that Djokovic&apos;s coach reckoned it was unfair he had two days&apos; rest to Nadal&apos;s one, the Mallorcan agreed, with qualifications. &quot;Well, that&apos;s what it is,&quot; he said. &quot;In 2009 I played longer than him in the semi-finals. I played more than five hours at very high intensity, too. I had only one day and Federer had two, no? I recovered for the final, so I think you can say it&apos;s unfair, yes, but not crazy unfair. &quot;Really unfair is the US Open when you don&apos;t have a day off between semi-finals and final. If the [Friday] match happened in the US Open and the other semi-final is in straight sets, you are in big trouble for the finals. Having one day off, I believe you are not in big trouble.&quot; Destined to forever talk like Poirot, the Spaniard nevertheless made himself understood well enough. He said of the Djokovic-Murray match: &quot;The second set was fantastic. Was really impressive level from both of them. First set I didn&apos;t see, but the fourth seems like Andy was very tired. He wasn&apos;t ready to play the fourth, and [Novak] was much more fresh. &quot;The fifth seems like Andy was very tired, too, because Novak have the control of the situation. After playing for four hours 50, it&apos;s normal you will be in trouble. Novak plays well and match was done. It was an emotional match, and I enjoyed watching on TV.&quot; As for the final, he said: &quot;He is the favourite after being No1 in the world and after playing fantastic and beating me the last six times. So just happy to be\u00a0there.&quot; Just &quot;happy to be there&quot;? Not likely. This could be another war. If Djokovic is fit, he will win \u2013 and in all probability more easily than he did against Murray.

Lanchester&apos;s previous book, Family Romance (2007), had been a memoir about his parents; his last novel, Fragrant Harbour (a multi-generational saga set in Hong Kong), had appeared as long ago as 2002. In the intervening years, Lanchester had carved out a reputation as a brilliant essayist, writing for publications on both sides of the Atlantic about subjects ranging from finance, technology and the media to sport, literature and food. So fascinating did Lanchester find the contemporary world, and so good was he at describing it in his non-fiction, that it was easy to assume he&apos;d left the realm of make-believe behind. In a few weeks, though, after a decade-long absence, Lanchester the novelist makes a welcome return. Capital, set in London during the credit crunch, is already causing quite a stir in the literary world. A 600-page doorstop, it tracks the lives of a group of characters, all of whom either live in, or have a connection with, a single south London street, Pepys Road. As in so much of London, soaring property prices have transformed the street&apos;s social make-up, so that wealthy arrivistes, including a banker and a teenage Premier League footballer from Senegal, live alongside long-standing residents of more modest means: an octogenarian widow dying of brain cancer; the Pakistani-British owners of a grocery shop. In addition, Lanchester throws in characters who don&apos;t live in the street but work there: a Polish builder, a Zimbabwean asylum seeker working illegally as a traffic warden. Lanchester isn&apos;t the first contemporary writer to have had the idea for this kind of multi-character portrait of Britain; Sebastian Faulks tried something similar in A Week in December. But Capital is so effortlessly brilliant \u2013 gripping for its entire duration, hugely moving and outrageously funny \u2013 that it blows the competition right out of the water. Jonathan Derbyshire, culture editor of the New Statesman, describes it as &quot;the great London novel of early 21st century&quot; and an &quot;English response to the return of the big baggy social novel in America&quot;. He adds that the one-street setting is a &quot;brilliant structural device, since it recognises something distinctive about London, the way that different versions of the city rub up against one another&quot;. The novelist Andrew O&apos;Hagan, a friend of Lanchester&apos;s since their days working at the London Review of Books in the mid-1990s, describes it as &quot;amazingly good; I doubt there will be a better novel this year. The well-written English novel of society \u2013 of the here and now \u2013 is such a rare beast, and especially rare is the one that also captures with style the inner lives of its characters.&quot; So who is the man behind what may well come to be seen as the defining novel of credit-crunch Britain (as if producing one of the best financial books of recent years weren&apos;t enough)? What enables him to be so versatile? Lanchester was born in Hamburg in 1962, the only child of Bill, a bookish middle manager at the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, and Julie, an ex-nun from Ireland who, prior to her marriage, spent more than a decade in a convent in Madras. When Lanchester was very young, the family moved around a lot (Rangoon, Calcutta, Labuan), before settling in Hong Kong, where Bill had spent most of his childhood. (Lanchester&apos;s paternal grandfather, the first European dentist in Hong Kong, had been interred by the Japanese during the Second World War.) Aged nine, Lanchester was sent to Gresham&apos;s boarding school in Norfolk. Although he has said that he wasn&apos;t especially homesick, he remembers hating the long flights back to visit his parents. Lanchester&apos;s relationship with his parents, as he describes it in Family Romance, was far from close. This wasn&apos;t just the result of him being at boarding school. It&apos;s also because his parents&apos; marriage was founded on an extraordinary lie, which had the effect of closing down discussions of feelings and making intimacy impossible. This lie was to do with his mother&apos;s age and her past. When she had met Lanchester&apos;s father, she was already 40. Knowing that he wanted a big family, and fearing he&apos;d never marry her if he knew how old she was, she pretended to be nine years younger. But the deception didn&apos;t stop there. She acquired a British passport in the name of her younger sister Dilly. And she kept from both husband and son most of the facts about her pre-marriage life. The result was that Lanchester grew up knowing hardly anything about his mother; indeed, he only learned what her true age had been after her death in 1998. All this suppression took its toll on Lanchester&apos;s mental stability. Although he flourished at school, and won a place at Oxford to study English (where he got one of the top firsts in his year), in his 20s he suffered regular panic attics and eventually had a breakdown. &quot;The divorce between thought and feeling,&quot; he told an interviewer in 2007, &quot;was so complete I barely counted as human.&quot; Years of therapy, and marriage in the early 1990s (to the biographer Miranda Carter), helped restore a sense of equipoise. Although his experiences must have been very painful, it&apos;s hard not to suspect that they ultimately benefited him as a novelist, through the insights they provided into the workings of suppression and secrecy. Characters with double lives, or some kind of secret, appear frequently in his fiction. One of the most interesting in Capital, for example, is a Banksy-like artist who operates under the pseudonym Smitty and who keeps what he does secret from everyone, including \u2013 in a striking case of real-life reversal \u2013 his mother. During his 20s, Lanchester had spells as a football reporter, obituary writer and a publisher at Penguin, before joining the LRB. The serious, but also subtly subversive, atmosphere of the magazine&apos;s office evidently suited him and he became deputy editor. Mary-Kay Wilmers, now the paper&apos;s editor, recalls the two of them passing notes to each other, like naughty school children. Andrew O&apos;Hagan, who joined the LRB in the mid-1990s, remembers Lanchester being &quot;a terrific laugh \u2013 still one the funniest people I know \u2013 and a careful editor&quot;. While at the LRB, Lanchester completed his first novel, The Debt to Pleasure \u2013 the narrative of a psychopathic gourmand \u2013 and it was published in 1996. Mr Phillips, a day-in-the-life account of a sex-obsessed accountant, followed in 2000. Although both books were well-received (The Debt to Pleasure won the Whitbread first novel award and the Hawthornden prize), they were also small-scale works, essentially character studies. In this, Derbyshire points out, they differ markedly from the &quot;neo-Victorian panorama&quot; of Capital. Now the father of two children, and settled in Clapham, south London (the location of the fictional Pepys Road), Lanchester comes across as a contented and well-adjusted figure, absorbed in his work, but not remotely cut off. In person, he has a gentle, almost absent-minded manner, which belies his sharpness, his engagement with what&apos;s going on. &quot;He just knows so much. And he is interested in so much,&quot; says O&apos;Hagan. &quot;He cares about life&apos;s ingredients \u2013 such a good cook \u2013 and you could easily spend as much time talking to John about the genius of Family Guy as you could about the vanity of Evelyn Waugh. I suppose many novelists are just interested in what&apos;s in front of them, but John is always getting hooked on new problems. I once went to a canteen with him and he told me how it was that overcooked Brussels sprouts tasted sulphurous.&quot; Although he has written candidly about his childhood, the adult Lanchester guards his privacy; he is content to play the part of public intellectual, but does not strive for greater notoriety. Yet to those who know him, he clearly inspires extraordinary fondness. Describing their friendship, O&apos;Hagan says: &quot;We&apos;ve never had an argument. That could be a bad thing, of course, but not in our case; we just get along without hitches. When you go to dinner with him, you know you&apos;ll spend nine minutes out of every 10 laughing your head off at some unexpected thing. And then when something bad happens, like your father dies, he&apos;s the first on the phone. It&apos;s all part of the same morality and the same talent: carefulness.&quot; \u2022 The following correction was published on 5 February 2012:Our profile of author John Lanchester last week (&quot;A keen eye for the state of the nation&quot;) said his grandfather &quot;had been interred by the Japanese&quot;.

Never mind. There were plenty of other questions to ask in a 40-minute interview. Here are the highlights: \u2022 Livingstone praised Ed Miliband as a political visionary who, like Clement Attlee and Margaret Thatcher, was determined to change British society in a fundamental way. &quot;Our politics is on the cusp,&quot; Livingstone said. &quot;[Thatcher] had a sense of where she wanted to take Britain, as Attlee did. [Miliband] has that ... When you talk to Ed Miliband, which I do frequently, he is thinking of a very long-term change that would make us a Spirit Level Britain, a much fairer society.&quot; Livingstone said Miliband should ignore media criticism because almost all opposition leaders got a bad press. And he backed Labour&apos;s decision to announce that it will not promise now to reverse any of the coalition&apos;s spending cuts if it wins in 2015. \u2022 He said he hated the way personality politics were so important in mayoral elections. &quot;I loathe and detest all this trivialisation of politics,&quot; he said. &quot;I liked it when we had ugly politicians who droned on about issues.&quot; \u2022 He said Labour should propose making the state pension age flexible. Some people should postpone retirement until they are 70, he said. \u2022 He accused Boris Johnson of putting the lives of London cyclists at risk by prioritising traffic flow instead of safety. He said there was a strong case for charging Transport for London with corporate manslaughter in relation to the death of cyclists at a notorious roundabout in the capital. \u2022 He said he would freeze or cut executive pay at City Hall so he could reduce pay differentials between those at the top and the bottom. &quot;When I was leader of the GLC [Greater London Council], by the time I had been in control for three years, the difference in pay between the cleaner and the director general was a four-to-one ratio,&quot; he said. &quot;I find that attractive.&quot; \u2022 He insisted that his plan to cut London transport fares by 7% was affordable. &quot;In a budget of \u00a38bn if you can&apos;t find the money to have a 7% fares cut, you are breathtakingly incompetent,&quot; he said. \u2022 He said he would like to include the Lib Dems in his administration if he won the mayoral election. We met in an office in Labour&apos;s HQ in Victoria Street, Westminster. Livingstone was scathing about Johnson, but, given that he compared the Tory mayor to Hitler last year, such attacks have relatively little news value. What&apos;s more interesting is why he dislikes Johnson so much. Talking to Livingstone, it becomes obvious that he&apos;s one of those politicians who actually enjoys administration and his disdain for Johnson is (at least partly) fuelled by his conviction that Johnson is a slapdash dilettante with no real understanding of the smallprint of the London transport budget. &quot;I liked it when we had ugly politicians who droned on about issues,&quot; he said. We certainly droned on, at length. Here&apos;s how it went. Fighting Boris Johnson Q: Last time around the mayoral election was pitched as a contest between the charismatic candidate and the competent one. And the charismatic one won. What makes you think it will be different this time? A: In 2008 everything was going quite well in the city. We had just got \u00a35bn from Gordon Brown to build 50,000 homes. The only real problem we were having was the spike in teenage knife killings. Therefore people could say &quot;Boris is a laugh&quot;. I think it&apos;s a very different time. People have to say, do I want a good laugh, or do I want to pay less fares and see more coppers on the streets? Q: One of the comments on the blog I posted inviting people to suggest questions came from Nayim, who wanted to know what you thought Boris had got right as mayor.  A: What has he got right? Hard to think of anything, really. He&apos;s done a couple of things that you would not reverse, like the ban on alcohol on the tube, although I don&apos;t think anyone has actually been arrested for drinking alcohol on the tube in the last four years. Boris has done nothing. He&apos;s carried on opening things I started. He&apos;s carried on doing his Daily Telegraph job. And he took the equivalent of three months off last year to write a book about Dick Whittington and Florence Nightingale. I don&apos;t know why he&apos;s standing again. Q: There&apos;s been a suggestion [in this Livingstone interview] that class will be a big issue in your campaign. A: I think it absolutely is. According to the Guardian today, so it is in American politics, this question of the 1% and the 99%. Q: That&apos;s wealth rather than class. A: Well, that is exactly what class is only ever about. Every society in human history has had a small elite who have got the power and the wealth and then the vast majority who haven&apos;t. I don&apos;t see class as the AB, C1, C2, DE. I see it as the 1% and the 99%. Q: Do you think Londoners are bothered that Boris went to Eton? A: No, not at all. No one&apos;s going to worry that he&apos;s posh. They are going to worry that he spent most of the last year distancing himself from Cameron and campaigning around the issue of Europe, and his only real effort has been to campaign to cut the top rate of tax for the richest 1% whilst banging up fares and getting rid of 1,700 police jobs. This is a man who perhaps more than anybody else in modern politics is completely committed, as Cameron and Osborne are, to a small elite. They are very clever at hiding that. Shall we strip Sir Fred Goodwin of his knighthood? Who cares? Are we going to get a proper top rate of tax on bankers&apos; bonuses? I don&apos;t care whether they&apos;ve a knighthood. I just want them to pay their share. Livingstone&apos;s record as mayor Q: Here&apos;s a question from the blog [from JustinCase12]: &quot;What do you plan to do if you&apos;re elected as mayor that you couldn&apos;t have done the last time?&quot; A: In a sense, a lot of it is just rolling back to cover the things I did do last time round: restore policing levels to what they were, bring the fares down. But also there&apos;s a whole range of new things that have developed in terms of environmental technology. We could lock ourselves into a programme of retro-fitting all London&apos;s buildings to make them energy efficient. Cycling in London Q: We got a lot of questions about cycling. This [from babybat] is typical: &quot;I&apos;d like to know how you plan to make cycling safer - specifically, will you be investing in proper Dutch-style segregated bike lanes as proposed by the London Cycling Campaign?&quot; A: We had a plan which we were about two-thirds of the way through, the London Cycling Strategy, which was putting in, in some places, separation. In some places you can put in separation. Most of our roads are wide enough to do that. And we got a long way with all the boroughs that were sympathetic towards this. Johnson scrapped that and went for this &quot;paint a bit of blue down the road&quot; [the cycle superhighways]. Q: Would you keep the blue down the road? A: At the moment it is most probably more dangerous than safe, because people come into the blue lane and they assume there&apos;s some sort of safety. The regulations on it vary from here to there. Suddenly it stops and starts on the other side of the road. Two cyclists who were killed at the Bow roundabout junction \u2013 there&apos;s a classic example of what&apos;s wrong. Transport for London spent ages negotiating with local cycling groups to put in cycling safety measures. Those went up to the mayor&apos;s office. TfL specifically said this will not be safe for cyclists without these measures. The reply was: &quot;The mayor&apos;s priority is traffic flow.&quot; Now they are in a great panic because of the police investigation. There could be a charge of corporate manslaughter. That&apos;s the worst example. Q: Someone [benbro] raised this on the blog. He wants to know if you think there&apos;s a strong case for a corporate manslaughter charge. A: I think there is. It&apos;s more obvious with the captain of the Italian cruise ship, but here Transport for London officials told the mayor&apos;s office cyclists would be at risk if they didn&apos;t put these measures in. They were turned down in order to prioritise \u2013 when Johnson says traffic flow, he means more speed for cars. What we&apos;ll do, we&apos;ll get Jenny Jones, who was my cycling adviser and Green assembly member and she&apos;s a candidate for mayor, she&apos;ll be on this. She&apos;ll be in charge of driving forward the cycling agenda. The TfL board is going to be chaired by deputy mayor, Val Shawcross. And we will prioritise putting in the safety measures that Johnson has put out. Q: Would you keep the &quot;Boris bikes&quot;? A: When I started this in July 2007, my instruction to TfL was simply go to Paris, take the V\u00e9lib&apos; scheme and bring it to London. For some reason, they did not take the V\u00e9lib&apos; scheme and they&apos;ve gone for this much more expensive one that Boris has brought in. I would like to see the bike scheme London-wide. But the cost per bike and docking frame is \u00a312,000. So any major extension starts running into hundreds of millions of pounds. You&apos;ve got to get it cheaper. The manufacturer may back off and cut the price if they&apos;re told if they don&apos;t do this, we will bring in another operator to do it. Tube and bus fares in London Q: Fares are at the heart of your campaign. [Under &quot;Ken&apos;s Fare Deal&quot;, he is promising to cut fares by 7%.] The key question you&apos;ve got to answer is one posed by this reader [Onlooker2008]: &quot;Where&apos;s the money going to come from to fund the fare cuts?&quot; A: Well, the fact that you&apos;ve had a 25% increase in fares in the last four years means that they have more money to spend. When I announced the fares cut, we pointed to the fact that in the fares account they&apos;ve got a \u00a3200m surplus. So the TfL board immediately met and decided to actually repay some debts so that there was no surplus. But it comes up each year because we have the highest fares in the world. Even after my fares cut, we will still have the highest fares in the world. In a budget of \u00a38bn if you can&apos;t find the money to have a 7% fares cut, you are breathtakingly incompetent. Q: Are you saying then that there is a pool of money identified that could be used for this? Or are you just saying that the budget is so big that you will be able to find it somewhere? Originally you were saying there was a pool of money ... A: There is. I&apos;m saying there isn&apos;t now because they&apos;ve paid debts off early. But because the fares are so high, the surplus reappears in each financial year. And even after the fares cut there will still be a surplus of about \u00a3100m. Q: The Channel 4 FactCheck blog have looked at this. They&apos;ve quoted Stephen Glaister [a former TfL board member and professor of transport and infrastructure at Imperial College] as saying that this money is there for investment, and that if you take it for fare cuts, there will be less money to redo the stations and the infrastructure and everything else. A: That&apos;s not true. Because each year Boris Johnson has underspent investment in transport, in some years by \u00a3200m. They have never overspent. We will continue the investment programme. And I will do new things. But it would be the final year of the next mayoral term before any physical spending could start. They&apos;re two separate accounts. Every year there&apos;s money left in the infrastructure account. Q: That was a point Channel 4 FactCheck looked at. And their verdict was: &quot;Mr Livingstone is wrong to claim there&apos;s a \u00a3729m surplus, and there is no separate budget for investment projects.&quot; A: There was last year. Q: OK, let&apos;s put it another way. There will be people following this debate who won&apos;t understand the intricacies of the TfL budget but who will think, if that money really is there in the budget, why is Boris putting his chances of re-election at risk by not spending it? A: Of course. If I was Boris I would have looked at the surplus in the fares account and said we don&apos;t need a fare increase this year. But do you think Boris reads his accounts? Of course he doesn&apos;t. Q: He might not be a details man, but he&apos;s not completely stupid. And he wants to get re-elected. A: He&apos;s very clever, but he&apos;s bone idle. So he didn&apos;t read his own accounts, he didn&apos;t realise he had that surplus. But also he&apos;s caught. He signed an agreement with the government to increase fares 2% above inflation each year for 20 years. And therefore he&apos;s locked into that deal. It&apos;s a deal he&apos;s done with [George] Osborne. My election breaks the deal. Q: Given that this is such a key part of your campaign, what happens to your campaign if in the budget George Osborne announces that, surprise, surprise, he&apos;s found some extra money for fares in London? Your campaign would be up the spout then, wouldn&apos;t it? A: If Osborne comes along and says we&apos;re going to effectively fund Ken Livingstone&apos;s fare cut, I will say that&apos;s what I can achieve when I&apos;m not mayor. Think what I will get out of the buggers when I am. Q: Another point about fares was raised by a guy called Will [will767] on our blog. He said: &quot;Why should we believe your promises about a &apos;fare deal&apos; when they have been made twice before and broken twice before?&quot; A: That&apos;s not true. Q: In your book you do talk about having to break a promise on fares. A: There was one occasion when Gordon Brown came along and gave us permission to borrow \u00a32.9bn to do the London Overground [which was conditional on fares going up]. If I had the option of doing another London Overground a couple of months after I got elected, I say we won&apos;t put the fares down. We&apos;ll have another big investment programme. But we don&apos;t have that option. These people should remember, there is no other politician in public life who has cut fares three times in their career. Perhaps they&apos;re not old enough to remember. Relations with a Conservative government Q: On investment, why would you be able to get more money out of central government than a Conservative mayor? A: Because Boris Johnson, broadly, doesn&apos;t believe in public spending. He brags about having made cuts deeper and faster than any department in Whitehall. I believe in public investment and public spending. He doesn&apos;t. Q: When you were GLC leader, you used that as a platform to wage a propaganda war against the Thatcher government. If you win this election, will you do that again? A: I can answer that only when you tell me what Cameron and Osborne&apos;s response to my winning is going to be. It might be that Osborne says I&apos;m going to give you vast sums of money as a reward for getting rid of my main political rival to succeed Cameron. They may do what Mrs Thatcher did, which is cut all funding to London government in 18 months, in which case we will be off to court. Halfway through this parliament, when they are starting to think about getting re-elected, do they want a series of rows with me in which they are seen to punish London? Or do they want to work with me on the areas where we might agree? Housing in London Q: On housing, you&apos;ve announced a policy for a living rent. [As mouseelephant asked], can you actually enforce a rent cap? A: You need legal powers to do that that the mayor doesn&apos;t have. This is the first stage in creating what we used to have, which is proper rent controls. We will work with good landlords who want to co-operate with us to have a proper, reasonable rent that Londoners can afford. Cars in London Q: We had several questions from people [like DusterUK and AlanMoore] who thought you should ban private cars from the centre of London. Are you interested in extending road pricing at all? A: The thing we started, working with the private sector, are these car clubs. The same thing is happening in New York. You don&apos;t buy a car. You sign up for the car club. What we want to see are a lot of reserved places for car club cars to be parked all over the suburbs, where people can use them when they want. It&apos;s a bit like the bike scheme for cars. Then you look at things like this system in San Francisco. They realised that one in five persons driving in San Francisco was looking for somewhere to park. So all the car parks are now electronically linked in to your mobile phone. You can access the details of the nearest available space. Loads of things like that we can do that can reduce car usage. Q: What about the \u00a325 congestion charge for gas-guzzlers? Is that an idea that you will revisit? A: It&apos;s definitely an idea we will revisit. But over the last four years there has been a huge change in the engines of cars. There are now SUVs that are quite sustainable. You want to hit those that are polluting. The particular problem we face is that the European Union is slowly trundling towards fining London \u00a3300m for having the worst air quality in western Europe. Q: Isn&apos;t that an argument for going faster on a congestion charge for gas-guzzlers? A: The congestion charge is just a very small part of central London. Gas-guzzlers are just a small part of this. One of the first things I will do as mayor is go to [the EU&apos;s environment commissioner] to say we don&apos;t want to spend \u00a3300m on a fine. What are the measures we can take in London to improve air quality so we&apos;re not fined? Boris has not been. He&apos;s only sent his deputy. Metropolitan police commissioner Q: If you had been on the panel choosing the new Metropolitan police commissioner, would you have chosen Bernard Hogan-Howe? [Hogan-Howe was on a shortlist of four.]  A: I have no idea. I have met him since and I don&apos;t have the slightest doubt that we will be able to have an effective working relationship. I always highly valued Hugh Orde and I think when Johnson forced out Ian Blair, they appointed Paul Stephenson because they thought he would be pliable, and Hugh Orde wouldn&apos;t. Getting through three commissioners in four years has been a disaster for morale. I think [Hogan-Howe] shares the objective I&apos;ve got, which is to increase street policing. He has been quite responsive to the genuine concerns about stop and search. So I don&apos;t think there will be any problem. Routemaster buses Q: What would you do about Boris&apos;s new Routemasters? A: They will run on our streets. I&apos;m sure people will find them interesting. But we are not buying any more, not at \u00a31.3m each. The average doubledecker bus you see out there comes in about \u00a3300,000. So they&apos;re not affordable. Long-term political plans Q: If you lose the mayoral election, does that mean you&apos;re finished in public life? A: There&apos;s no way in this game that you focus on losing. I&apos;ve just gone through a whole year in which the broad line of the media has been, it&apos;s old Ken, Boris is going to have a walk-over. We had those two polls showing Boris 8% ahead. We just ploughed on, built the machine, worked out the strategy, worked out the policies. And now it&apos;s neck and neck. Q: OK, let&apos;s flip it. If you win, will you serve just one term? A: You focus on this. Q: You are 66 now. You would be 70 next time. A: Yes, but I&apos;m 150 years younger mentally than Boris is. He&apos;s Georgian. Q: So you&apos;re not just running for one term? A: I haven&apos;t thought about that. I will let you know in the middle of the next term. Second preference vote Q: Who are you going to vote for as your second preference? [In the mayoral election, voters get two votes.] A: Jenny Jones [the Green candidate]. We had a formal pact last time. Me and Si\u00e2n Berry [the Green candidate] both appeared saying vote 1 and 2. In my second administration the Greens were part of a formal coalition, and they will be again. And I would like to bring the Liberals in. If you look at the political issues at City Hall, you have had a lineup between Labour, the Lib Dems and Greens versus the Tories on almost everything for 12 years. Labour and the spending cuts Q: What did you feel about Ed Balls saying that if Labour won in 2015, his starting point would be that Labour would have to accept all the cuts? A: I was not terribly agitated by the speech, but the spin that was put on it! When you are 100 days away from office, you can spell out fairly clearly what you are going to do. They&apos;re three years away from taking office. If you actually look at everything Ed Miliband says, about predatory and productive, about the squeezed middle, about a fairer Britain, I don&apos;t have the slightest doubt that under Miliband the Labour government will produce a much fairer and equal Britain. And I feel more confidence in Miliband than I have felt in any Labour leader since John Smith died. Q: What do you mean, though, about the &quot;spin&quot; on the speech? Do you mean the spin from the party or the spin from the media? A: All the Blairites had an orgasm, and the worst Tories said this means they&apos;re endorsing us. They&apos;re not. What Ed Balls was saying was, from where we are now, we can&apos;t tell you what we&apos;re going to restore at all. I will be making announcements about pay in a few weeks&apos; time. But it&apos;s clear for me because I can see broadly the outlines of the budget I inherit. Q: On pay, where do you stand on the argument about whether it&apos;s better to freeze pay or lose jobs? A: I think it&apos;s much more important to keep people in work than have pay rises. But there&apos;s another route to all this. I think the pay differentials should be narrowed. When I was leader of the GLC, by the time I had been in control for three years, the difference in pay between the cleaner and the director general was a four-to-one ratio. I find that attractive. Now, you may not be able to get that close. But certainly there will be a freeze on top pay and there will be a cut in some areas in terms of top pay, and we will use that money for the low-paid, so that they have at least increases equal with inflation. Ed Miliband&apos;s leadership Q: Ed Miliband has had a bad press recently. What advice would you give him? A: If you go back, there are only two periods in the last 50 years when the leader of the opposition had a good time. Harold Wilson in &apos;63/64, and Blair in &apos;94 to &apos;97. Both of those were periods when the governing party was imploding. Leader of the opposition \u2013 it&apos;s a really shit job. Every leader of the opposition has nagging doubts, a bad press. It goes with the job. So, my broad view is, I wouldn&apos;t bother reading the papers. Labour and the City Q: One of the complaints about Labour&apos;s record is that it tolerated too much excess in the City. As mayor, were you also guilty of this? A: No. When I was talking to City audiences, I had a line which I often used, which was this is isn&apos;t the world I would have created, it&apos;s the one I&apos;m stuck with. If a bank is deciding whether to locate in London or New York, your job as mayor is to get them to come to London. But we did everything to build all the other areas of employment. But, let me just say, by chance I have this here. [Livingstone produces a copy of his Socialist Economic Bulletin from April 1997.] It says here the incoming Blair government has got to break the inheritance from the Tories of borrowing \u00a317.7bn that year to cover the difference between income and expenditure. [It actually says: &quot;To eliminate the inherited deficit on government current expenditure, a combination of revenue increases and expenditure cuts of \u00a317.7bn has to be achieved.&quot;] Q: You&apos;re saying you discovered sound money before George Osborne? A: In 1976, I was persuaded by Rees-Mogg&apos;s articles. I had a chat with Ed Balls after his speech and he said: &quot;I forgot you were a Friedmanite.&quot; Every budget I have every prepared has been balanced. I have only ever borrowed money for investment. I have been sound money all my life. Q: As mayor, what could you do to make capitalism more responsible? A: The mayoralty has quite limited powers. But it&apos;s a very powerful [voice] you have for advocacy. Equally, because I have been around for a long time, I&apos;ve also learned how much of what you are told is bulllshit. And when I hear so many people in the City say they&apos;re all going to go [because of higher taxes], the simple fact is we really only have one rival, and that is New York. You are not going to have major banks in the City relocate to Shanghai because there&apos;s a degree of political uncertainty, perhaps decades ahead. They are not going to Frankfurt because young men want to go out on the pull and do a load of cocaine and they can&apos;t really do that easily in Frankfurt. So you need to have a dynamic city. Our only real rival is New York. Retirement age Q: You gave an interview a year or so ago where you said that the best way to solve the deficit would be to raise the retirement age to 70 by 2020. How serious are you about that? A: You have got to have a big qualification in that. Clearly, someone like myself who has the physical vigour of a 40-year-old can work for many more years. My doctor almost had an orgasm on my annual medical checkup because I had lost a stone and a half, loads of fat has gone, vital organs are functioning well. Some people can work a very long time. I&apos;ve also met, going round London over the last 18 months, a lot of really good teachers in their late 50s who are exhausted. And they say I just can&apos;t work five days a week with the pressures there are, I would like to do two or three. But they can&apos;t do that because of the pension structure. Therefore I think what you want is a retirement age of between 60 and 70, which is flexible enough so that each individual, given their physical and financial needs, can actually do what&apos;s best for them. Q: Are you talking about a flexible state pension age? A: You&apos;ll get more if you work longer, clearly. You need that degree of flexibility. I don&apos;t think that is on the cards at all with this government. I hope at some point a Labour one would look for a more flexible rate. Q: The state pension age is going up to 66, and they are talking about 68, but you think it should go further? A: Well, you were asking me whether I would do a second term. That would put me up to 74. Look at Deng Xiaoping. What was it \u2013 82 before he gave up? I don&apos;t think I will go on that long. Ed Miliband and Margaret Thatcher Q: If you had been in a mayoral contest against Margaret Thatcher, could you have beaten her? What I&apos;m trying to ask is how you rate her as a campaigner and a professional politician. I know what you think about her politics. A: There is almost nothing that I agree with her politically that she did. But the fact that she became leader of a party where every senior figure thought she was mad, and she drove the whole agenda of British politics, got her way, got rid of all of her opponents, and she ended up having Blair adopt most of her agenda \u2026 She&apos;s undoubtedly the most successful politician in setting the agenda for a generation since Attlee. That Attlee government set the agenda for 30 years. Thatcher and Reagan did it for 30. Now I think our politics is on the cusp. When you talk to Ed Miliband, which I do frequently, he is thinking of a very long-term change that would make us a Spirit Level Britain, a much fairer society. I believe if we can get it right the future is ours. Q: Are you suggesting he&apos;s like Thatcher? A: He&apos;s not completely barking mad as well, as she was. But she had a sense of where she wanted to take Britain, as Attlee did. He has that. And it&apos;s a much fairer society. It&apos;s one I&apos;ll be very comfortable in. That&apos;s why he&apos;s getting so much venom from the Tory press. They see this isn&apos;t another Blair, this isn&apos;t some soft patsy that&apos;s going to broadly do what they want and not challenge the vested interests. This is someone who will. Personality politics Q: Mayoral elections are different from parliamentary elections. How do you think Thatcher would have fared in this kind of personality-driven, mayoral contest? A: She would have hated it, just like I do. She was not about personality. Everything about Thatcher was the about ideas she believed in. I have to say, I loathe and detest all this trivialisation of politics. I liked it when we had ugly politicians who droned on about issues. Are we better off? Blair and Clinton sit on the TV sofas and people say what a lovely person, I&apos;ll vote for them. What are the policies? I haven&apos;t a clue.

Certainly in the Propeller company. Just over a week ago, we were in technical rehearsals for The Winter&apos;s Tale, which has just opened in Cheltenham. These involve long hours standing around on stage with seemingly nothing to do, while all the technical tomfoolery gets plotted around you. People are working hard, and things start to get tetchy \u2013 there&apos;s only a few hours until the show, and it always seems that we&apos;re behind. But then someone starts to giggle (who knows about what?). The giggling turns to laughter. The mood changes; perhaps we can do it after all. This is, of course, why: coming together to telling a story as interestingly as possible, the adrenaline rush of knowing that an audience will be watching in a few hours&apos; time. No one works in theatre for the money, so everyone is there for this same reason. As a consequence the humour that pervades even the most pressured situation is universal. In the week and a half that we have been here in Cheltenham, I have seen little more than a car park. The rest of the time has been spent teching in the newly refurbished Everyman Theatre, which looks resplendent since the designs of Frank Matcham, the great Victorian theatre builder, have been cleaned up and restored. We opened The Winter&apos;s Tale, and have now brought back Henry V after last performing it in Girona in December. It&apos;s always nice bumping into an old friend, and comparing the broadsword that is Henry to the scalpel of The Winter&apos;s Tale is going to be one of our delights over the next six months of touring. In the next five weeks we&apos;ll be in Sheffield, Manchester, Australia and New Zealand. Later on this year it will be Beijing, Shanghai and London. Acting is a crazy way to make a living. You have to handle rejection, insecurity, being out of work for long stretches of time. When you do get work, you are underpaid \u2013 generally speaking \u2013 and away from family and friends for long periods. The compensation is that the company starts to become your family. The in-jokes, spats and love all become our way of life. (As do, I&apos;m afraid, the farts.) There&apos;s nothing quite like the experience of being in an all-male theatre company.

Aston Villa What they wanted Villa&apos;s desire for a forward was undermined by a lack of meaningful cash to sign one. Some generous displays from defence meant a desire for reinforcement there too What they got Most notable was the arrival of Robbie Keane on a short-term deal from LA Galaxy. Alex McLeish may yet look to extend that arrangement. The young Irish full-back Enda Stevens also signed after impressing at Shamrock Rovers D-Day moves? Villa are among a number of clubs who have been linked with Portsmouth&apos;s Ryan Williams. The Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor has been subject of speculation linking him with a transfer, although the player himself has stressed he has no intention of moving.

Outs Nathan Delfouneso (Leicester, loan); Shane Lowry (Millwall, undisc); Fabian Delph (Leeds United, loan); Elliot Parish (Cardiff, undisc). Blackburn Rovers What they wanted Although hardly flush with cash, Steve Kean sought new faces in attack and at right-back. Rovers were also of a mind to sell Junior Hoilett, who is entering the final months of his contract, and keep Christopher Samba at the club despite his transfer request What they wanted The key areas identified by Kean were boosted by the arrivals of Bruno Ribeiro and Anthony Modeste. Jason Roberts departed but Hoilett remains a Blackburn player amid a raft of speculation about his future D-Day moves? Can Rovers retain Samba? He has been perfectly plain about his desire to leave; Rovers had previously sought at least \u00a310m for his services. EM Ins Anthony Modeste (Bordeaux, loan), Bruno Ribeiro (Gr\u00eamio Barueri, free) Outs Jason Roberts (Reading, undisc) Bolton Wanderers What they wanted Owen Coyle has been keen for at least three recruits as Bolton&apos;s manager looks to pull clear of the relegation zone. What they wanted Cahill was lured away by Chelsea, with the United States defender Tim Ream arriving from New York Red Bulls. Made an unsuccessful bid for Crystal Palace&apos;s Wilfried Zaha D-Day moves? Bolton have rejected an offer from Sunderland for Kevin Davies but the forward could still move to Wearside.

Outs Gary Cahill (Chelsea, \u00a37m); Jack Sampson (Southend, loan) Chelsea What they wanted Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas had targeted a centre-half to replace the out-going Alex and was prepared to look at forward reinforcements given Nicolas Anelka&apos;s departure to Shanghai. He recognised the need to offer some of his fringe players more first-team football on loan elsewhere, with the club also maintaining its policy of investing in promise for the future. What they got Gary Cahill arrived from Bolton for \u00a37m, potentially to renew his England central defensive partnership with John Terry. Kevin de Bruyne will complete a \u00a36.7m move from Genk on Monday but will return to the Belgian club on loan for the rest of the season. There were enquiries for Willian at Shakhtar Donetsk and Marseille&apos;s Cesar Azpilicueta. Alex left for Paris St Germain, Anelka for Shanghai, while Josh McEachran, Gael Kakuta and Patrick van Aanholt moved to Swansea, Dijon and Vitesse Arnhem respectively on loan. D-day moves? Unlikely, although there is interest in Brazilian teenager Lucas Moura at S\u00e3o Paulo, who would be loaned out to gain greater experience should he eventually move to Chelsea. That deal would be revived in the summer, as could a move for Lille&apos;s much coveted Eden Hazard. The Nottingham Forest youngster Ben Bamford is another long-term target.

Everton What they wanted As has been the case for the past three years, someone who can put the ball in the net but does not cost much money. David Moyes&apos;s transfer plans have been complicated by the additional search for a new central defender after Phil Jagielka suffered a knee ligament injury What they got Landon Donovan to provide more quality and pace on the right wing, albeit for a two-month loan spell from LA Galaxy, and Darron Gibson for \u00a3500,000 from Man Utd. Moyes is still hoping to sign two more players before the deadline closes. D-day moves? Possibly. Everton are close to signing Nikica Jelavic after an improved offer of about \u00a36m last night. Moyes also the PSG forward Guillaume Hoarau on loan. Andy Hunter  Ins Darron Gibson (Man Utd, \u00a3500,000); Landon Donovan (LA Galaxy, loan).

Fulham What they wanted Martin Jol has been satisfied with the players at his disposal and there was no urgent need for additions, but he has made little secret of his frustration at the goal returns of Bobby Zamora and Andy Johnson What they got Nothing so far, save for a couple of additions to the development squad. Jol has taken heart from the improvement of Bryan Ruiz and Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 D-Day moves? If either Zamora or Johnson goes, Jol will sign a striker, with Stuttgart&apos;s Pavel Pogrebnyak a target. QPR want Zamora; Wigan are among those interested in Johnson. One or two young players might get loan moves. DH  Ins Jack Grimmer (Aberdeen, \u00a3200,000). Outs Alex Kacaniklic (Watford, loan) Liverpool What they wanted According to several sources, to swap Andy Carroll for Carlos Tevez. According to Kenny Dalglish, and in fairness he has been stating this for several months, nothing, unless a deal that will improve the club&apos;s prospects of finishing in the top four crops up. A proven finisher has been lacking all season, however. What they got No one so far, despite the loss of the influential Lucas Leiva to serious injury and the aforementioned need for a goalscorer to turn those costly home draws into victories. The only transfer involving a member of the first team squad this month has been Danny Wilson joining Blackpool on loan. D-day moves? Dalglish does not expect any arrivals or departures from Liverpool today but an astonishing U-turn by Manchester City on Carlos Tevez, in the event of a move to Milan failing to materialise and the realisation they are stuck with his disruptive and expensive presence for the next few months, would prompt (another?) telephone call to Brian Marwood&apos;s office. AH  Ins Jordan Ibe (Wycombe, \u00a3500,000); Danny Ward (Wrexham, undisc). Outs Danny Wilson (Blackpool, loan). Manchester City What they wanted Another striker would be useful now Edin Dzeko is in a dry spell and Mario Balotelli can be unreliable. It would help if City and Carlos Tevez mended their relationship but he walked out and the club see it as a matter of principle to deny him a move to Milan. Signing a forward of real prowess will be difficult even for City. What they got To date City have been dealing with peripheral matters. Nedum Onuoha, for instance, is now with QPR. The club is trying to shed its reputation for extravagance. D-day moves? There is nothing to suggest a splurge and it would, in any case, take a remarkable signing to make any difference.

Manchester United What they wanted Sir Alex Ferguson is averse to the potential panic of the January transfer window. Although Nemanja Vidic&apos;s season is at an end and Rio Ferdinand is unable to play regularly, it may be central midfield that worries . Paul Scholes has had to come out of retirement, but neither Ajax&apos;s Christian Eriksen nor Eden Hazard of Lille is likely to move anywhere until the summer What they got United have been clearing space. Darron Gibson has already been transferred to Everton, F\u00e9derico Macheda is now with QPR on loan and Mame Biram Diouf has gone to Hannover 96 D-day moves? It would be a shock if anyone of note was signed but Ravel Morrison is set to join West Ham.

Newcastle United What they wanted A centre-half to replace Steven Taylor who will be out until August with a ruptured achilles tendon, a left-back and an extra striker. To offload the high-earning but now unwanted Alan Smith. To keep hold of Cheik Tiot\u00e9, Tim Krul, Johan Cabaye, Fabricio Coloccini and Demba Ba. What they got Alan Pardew seems to have held his squad together, the only departure having been Smith&apos;s, on loan to MK Dons. Newcastle also signed Papiss Ciss\u00e9, a Senegal striker from Freiburg. D-day moves? Pardew would love to sign Adrian Mariappa from Watford, a centre-half who can also play right-back.

Outs Alan Smith (MK Dons, loan); Philip Airey (Gateshead, loan). Norwich City What they wanted To consolidate what they already had. Norwich had made a promising start to the campaign, particularly in an attacking sense, but there are limited funds to strengthen further. It appeared defensive reinforcements were most urgently required given the lack of clean sheets to date this term. What they got The only arrival has been Jonny Howson, recruited from Leeds United much to the frustration of their fans. The midfielder is still recovering fitness after a knee injury but will be relishing the chance to test himself in the Premier League D-Day moves? Ritchie de Laet&apos;s return to Manchester United has freed up a loan place but that would be the extent of City&apos;s recruitment. &quot;If I think someone is right for the club, then I would look at it,&quot; said Paul Lambert. &quot;But I&apos;m not going to get somebody in just for the sake of it.&quot; Korey Smith has been loaned to Barnsley, and Chris Martin to Crystal Palace. DF  Ins Jonathan Howson (Leeds, \u00a32m). Outs George Francomb (Hibernian, loan); Oli Johnson (Oxford, loan); Korey Smith (Barnsley, loan); Chris Martin (C Palace, loan). QPR What they wanted A left-back, a central defender, a midfielder and at least one goalscorer, despite Federico Macheda&apos;s arrival The reasoning was simple: 35 goals conceded, and 19 scored, pre\u2011Hughes. What they got Hughes has signed Nedum Onuoha from Manchester City in defence, Taye Taiwo to play at left-back, and Nancy&apos;s defensive midfielder Samba Diakit\u00e9 \u2013 the latter two each on loan D-day moves? Hughes is unsure of Paddy Kenny&apos;s abilities in goal so he may try to buy a goalkeeper and he is yet to land a forward after a deal to take Henrique from S\u00e3o Paulo fell down when the Brazilian was refused a work permit. But he is hoping to sign Djibril Ciss\u00e9 from Lazio \u2013 talks are ongoing \u2013 and is considering Bobby Zamora, S\u00e9bastien Bassong and Steven Pienaar.

Stoke City What they wanted Tony Pulis seemed a rare beast this month \u2013 a content manager. The Stoke manager made no great claims of adding to his squad, with the club chairman, Peter Coates, even admitting he foresaw no arrivals at all What they got No new signings during the window. Six players have departed on loan, with Danny Pugh returning to Leeds United for an undisclosed fee D-Day moves? Pulis has been careful not to rule out some late business. Hugo Rodallega and DJ Campbell have been mentioned as possible Stoke targets, although Pulis could wait until the end of this season before making moves.

Sunderland What they wanted Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s principal ambition was to assess the squad but a striker, a midfielder and a, preferably left-footed, defender were arguably required Any imports would be expected to add experience and, ideally, pace. Meanwhile O&apos;Neill determined to keep the much coveted Stephane Sessegnon and the homesick Craig Gardner. What they got Nothing so far; although the unwanted defender Nyron Nosworthy has gone to Watford and the promising young striker Ryan Noble has joined Derby on loan No further departures are expected. D-day moves? Quite possibly. While an initial bid, in excess of \u00a31m for Kevin Davies has been rejected by Bolton Wanderers a follow-up offer is expected for the centre-forwardand O&apos;Neill is actively pursuing an unnamed defender and unnamed midfielder. Depending on what else happens, the midfielder Bolo Zenden could yet return to the Stadium of Light.

Swansea City What they wanted Brendan Rodgers wanted to ward off bids for key performers such as the goalkeeper Michel Vorm and left-back Neil Taylor while also strengthening the squad \u2013 and upping the goal threat \u2013 on a budget What they got Highly rated creative young midfielder Josh McEachran on a loan deal from Chelsea. The French defender Darnel Situ&apos;s move from Lens was also confirmed D-Day moves? Rodgers claims not. &quot;There&apos;s nothing active really,&quot; he said yesterday. That said, Swansea retain an interest in the Watford defender Adrian Mariappa who is also coveted by Newcastle.

Then again, Redknapp usually wants one more player \u2026 What they got Nothing as yet, apart from turning the Spanish midfielder Iago Falqu\u00e9&apos;s season-long loan from Juventus into a permanent transfer and promptly loaning him to Southampton for the remainder of the campaignThe club believe that they will reap the rewards from their policy of getting on-loan playing time for their talented youngsters. D-day moves? It is impossible to rule out last-minute business for Tottenham, even if Redknapp is preoccupied with his trial and the team has a game in the evening against Wigan.

West Bromwich Albion What they wanted Szabolcs Huszti, the Zenit St Petersburg midfielder, was a prime targetbut he has now returned to Russia after flying to the Midlands for talks with the deal potentially being revived in the summer. Albion are also short of goals \u2013 just 22 in the league \u2013 but as Jeremy Peace, the owner, is a financially prudent operator, a 12-15 a-season man was always going to be difficult to land. What they got Scott Allan, the Dundee United and Scotland Under\u201120 midfielder, cost \u00a3300,000 and Roy Hodgson admits he is not ready to be thrown straight in. &quot;He is not ready to start because we have a style of play and we need our players to be in tune, not just when they&apos;re on the ball but when they&apos;re not on the ball. he&apos;s got a lot to learn in terms of his positional play and what we expect of players when the ball is lost and how we expect them to defend, how we expect them to take up new positions.&quot; D-day moves? If you listen to the captain, James Morrison, the answer seems no. Asked this question he said: &quot;I doubt it. It sums us up. I think it&apos;s our policy that we don&apos;t bring players in so I don&apos;t expect it to happen. The Zenit one [Huszti] is dead so there you go. We&apos;ve had injury problems.

Wigan Athletic What they wanted Wigan&apos;s priority was to retain their much-courted youngsters James McCarthy and Victor Moses. Roberto Mart\u00ednez played down any notion of making a high-profile signing and insisted he would be willing to retain Hugo Rodallega until the summer \u2013 when his contract expires \u2013 rather than sell him now What they got Neither McCarthy, Moses nor Rodallega has so far been prised away from the DW Stadium. Of the trio, Rodallega has been subject to the most speculation. The manager secured the signature of the Chile winger Jean Beausejour from Birmingham City D-Day moves? Although they have denied making a formal approach, Wigan have been strongly linked with a move for the \u00a32.5m Bristol City striker Nicky Maynard Mart\u00ednez is also a keen observer of the Scottish player market, where bargains can be plentiful. Fulham&apos;s late interest in Rodallega EM  Ins Jean Beausejour (Birmingham, undisc). Outs Daniel Redmond (Hamilton, loan); Nouha Dicko (Blackpool, loan); Jordan Mustoe (Barnet, loan). Wolverhampton Wanderers What they wanted A midfielder and a striker to try to arrest a scored 25 conceded 40 record that has Mick McCarthy&apos;s side second-bottom and in real peril of being relegated. Jez Moxey, the chief executive, runs the club carefully, so the manager has had to look for loans and free agents to try and deepen the strength of his squad. What they got Emmanuel Frimpong was signed on loan from Arsenal, which appears a minor coup for McCarthy as some think is worth a regular squad place at the Emirates. McCarthy is still hoping to sign a striker and will not let Kevin Doyle leave despite Everton&apos;s reported interest. D-day moves? Nicky Maynard, the Bristol City striker, and the former Norwich midfielder Mark Fotheringham are interesting McCarthy. Of Fotheringham, 28, who has been training with Wolves and played in a reserve team game for the club on Monday, the Irishman said: &quot;He is an experienced lad.

Above our heads hang models of historic aircraft. Across the room, amid lots of exotic plants, goldfish circle each other in huge bowls. &quot;Many of the world&apos;s most famous skyscrapers are designed by architects few people in the profession can name.&quot; I ask him if he can remember who designed the Empire\u00a0State Building and he gets it wrong. &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;you&apos;ve made my point.&quot; But Farrell \u2013 perhaps best known in this country for the MI6 building, that hulking, postmodern fortress on the banks of the Thames \u2013 has just become a skyscraper man, thanks to KK100. This gleaming, 442-metre high\u00a0colossus that shoots up, pencil-thin, from the business district of Shenzhen in China isn&apos;t just his first skyscraper, though. It&apos;s also the tallest\u00a0building ever realised by a British architect. With a chuckle, Farrell explains that the tower is for a group of developers known as Kingkey, who were keen to show China and the world how far they, and Shenzhen, had come in the past few decades. &quot;So they asked for a 100-storey design and wanted to call it the Kingkey Tower. I told them that, in English, this sounds like &apos;kinky&apos; and might not be a good idea.&quot; But these giant high-rises are all a bit phallic, aren&apos;t they? &quot;Machismo, yes,&quot; says Farrell. &quot;It&apos;s the characteristic that drives China&apos;s skyscrapers.&quot;     KK100 overlooking Shenzhen, a former fishing village. Photograph: Terry Farrell & Partners    In fact, if anything, KK100 looms like an improbably tall blade of glass over Shenzhen, a city on the border with Hong Kong that has indeed come a long way at breakneck speed. In May 1980, Deng Xiaoping, then chairman of the Communist party, declared the former fishing village a Special Economic Zone. In a little over 30 years, its population has exploded from 20,000 to over 10m; its container port on the Pearl River is, after Shanghai and Hong Kong, now the third largest in China. &quot;I find it astonishing,&quot; says Farrell,\u00a0who founded his practice, Terry Farrell and Partners, in London the very year the Shenzhen boom began. &quot;It changes so fast. I first came \u2013 well, to Hong Kong, actually \u2013 in 1964. I was on a travelling scholarship. I had a Chinese pal, a friend from Newcastle University, in Hong Kong and went to see him. I took a photograph over the Chinese border towards Shenzhen. Here it is.&quot; Farrell turns the pages of one of the monographs he keeps of all his work. The colour photo of Shenzhen sits within a full-page shot of KK100. The low mountain backdrop appears the same in both images, but where one shows paddy fields and junks moored to thin strips of land, the other is dominated by a forest of skyscrapers, with KK100 reaching into the tropical\u00a0cloudscape. Farrell is not one of those architects who has rushed to cash in on the recent boom in foreign-led design in China, but someone who has built up a long and increasingly rich relationship with the country. His Hong Kong office, opened in 1990, is the same size as the London one he opened a decade earlier; last month, he opened a third, in Shanghai. This is understandable, given the sheer number and the scale of the stations, airports, hotels and public buildings he has created across Guangzhou, Kowloon, Hong Kong and Beijing, not to mention the vast urban masterplans he has developed around the country.     A CGI of the pod in the sky lobby, with bar, terrace and balconies. Photograph: Terry Farrell & Partners    Farrell is clearly proud of KK100. &quot;I can&apos;t quite believe it&apos;s real. As an architect, you get asked to do design after design, competition after competition, and you&apos;re used to ambitious projects coming to nothing. I was amazed, really, when we started to build a real skyscraper.&quot; Sheathed in glass and steel, KK100 boasts floor after floor of offices that taper up to a 250-bedroom hotel. This is all rounded off with a delightful sky lobby, rather like a vast and ultra-modern birdcage, with a bar and terrace open to the public. The space inside this glass tip is\u00a0taken up by an egg-shaped pod several storeys high containing small private spaces, some perched on balconies, where guests can sit, drink and take in jaw-dropping views of Shenzhen and beyond. By night, the tower is lit from top to bottom by LED\u00a0lights. Can a developer like Kingkey simply stride into central Shenzhen with a pile of cash and build what it likes? &quot;Far from it,&quot; says Farrell. &quot;The city does have planning regulations \u2013 you can&apos;t just do what you want.&quot; The site of KK100, he says, used to be Caiwuwei village, a poor and rundown area. Kingkey had to build seven towers to rehouse local people and a further seven for other locals to own and rent out, so that they might share in the boom. It&apos;s an extraordinary idea: even as China hurtles into capitalism, it does\u00a0still show remnants of old socialist ideals. Because all of these new towers took up a lot of space, the only way Kingkey could make the kind of money it was looking for \u2013 lots \u2013 was to build its showcase tower as high as possible. The company, notes Farrell, was &quot;founded by a bricklayer&quot;. He clearly approves \u2013 but then he is one of the few British working-class boys (Norman Foster is the best known) who have risen to the top in architecture. Farrell was born in Sale, Manchester, in 1938, his father a messenger for the Post Office. His devoutly Catholic family moved to Newcastle upon Tyne. Farrell wanted to be a painter, but his parents wanted him to be a civil servant; they thought artists were\u00a0immoral. He got to university \u2013 architecture at Newcastle \u2013 and since those days this unpretentious, highly intelligent and likable man has kept his feet firmly on the ground, even as his buildings began to soar skywards. Between designing the bright and colourful, low-cost HQ for TV-am \u2013 one of the best British buildings of the postmodern era\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0setting up shop in Hong Kong in\u00a01990, Farrell produced one memorable and controversial work after another, not least One Embankment Place, a monumental office block built around a great arch over the platforms of London&apos;s Charing Cross station. There are other ambitious buildings in the pipeline. Farrell shows me designs for the 520-metre, 123-floor Z15 Tower, which will be the centrepiece of Beijing&apos;s Chaoyong business district when it opens in 2015, as well as a taller neighbour to Rem Koolhaas&apos;s mighty CCTV HQ. Continuum, a book cataloguing his practice&apos;s work, explains that Z15&apos;s elegant concave shape was inspired by traditional Chinese wine vessels, bamboo-weaving and sky lanterns, not\u00a0to\u00a0mention &quot;the freshness and beauty of flourishing lotus flowers&quot;. A very Chinese skyscraper, in other\u00a0words. In fact, sitting talking with Farrell in his flat \u2013 with its Chinese pottery, low lighting and sliding screens \u2013 the ways in which his life and work have become entwined with China is richly apparent. And when his wife Mei Xin Wang, a volunteer for the British Museum&apos;s Department of Asia, comes home, the picture is complete. Farrell is wedded to China. He is still, though, very much the young man brought up in the north, with a love of British buildings, aircraft, paintings and railways. He has even had a train \u2013 a First Hull Trains high-speed number \u2013 named after him, following the success of The Deep, his thrillingly angular aquarium on the Hull waterfront completed in 2002. &quot;The train&apos;s been moved to another line since then,&quot; says Farrell, &quot;and they&apos;ve taken my name off it.&quot; But then he has been an architect for long enough to know that reputations, fame, fortune \u2013 and even one&apos;s name \u2013 come and go as fashions change and economies swing from boom to bust. While his firm continues to pick up more commissions in China, rivals are getting in on the act, racing up ever higher buildings. Farrell seems to welcome the competition, shrugging it off and saying in his matter-of-fact way: &quot;We won&apos;t have the tallest building in Shenzhen for long.&quot;", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture", "China holidays", "Skyscrapers"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-31T21:31:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/07/the-fiver-liverpool-tottenham-belgrano", "sentences": ["BITS AND BOBS Stoke&apos;s Matthew Upson is set to become the latest short shelf-life Premier League footballer shipped off to Shanghai Shenhua in what increasingly looks like a half-cooked effort to redress the imbalance in the number of poor quality goods traded between China and Britain."], "title": "The Fiver | Stray animal; and the Iron Lady | Paul Doyle and Barney Ronay", "article": "MORAL GUARDIANS ON THE PROWL The Fiver prides itself on being a public service tea-timely football email, and by public we don&apos;t just mean British subjects but also those who aspire to evolving into British subjects, which, let&apos;s face it, means all right-thinking creatures. As you know, new applicants for naturalisation in the Glorious Realm must pass a Life in the UK test, thereby proving their knowledge of the Sceptered Isle&apos;s cherished laws, mores and reality TV shows. It&apos;s not an easy test but with the Fiver&apos;s guidance, or even just by considering last night&apos;s Liverpool-Tottenham match and the accompanying hullabaloo, everyone should score full marks on the section about English etiquette. Obviously it is already well established that any loyal and true Englishman would rather cut off his right arm and flagellate himself with it than wave an imaginary red card. Because such behaviour is befitting only of suspicious outsiders like Roberto Mancini. The English way is to appeal for red cards in whiny post-match interviews or, if you&apos;re Wayne Rooney, on Twitter. After Luis Suarez was booked for accidentally kicking Scott Parker in the abdomen, Rooney bawled: &quot;If ref sees that kick from suarez and books him for it it should be red.&quot; Many folks, possibly ignoble foreign types, suggested to the Manchester United striker that this declaration seemed hypocritical given that Rooney himself has often pleaded for understanding when his aggressive approach left opponents sore, but Rooney put those know-nothing folks in their place by riposting: &quot;For everyone saying about my aggression i aint had 1 yellow card in premier league this season.&quot; And the Premier League is, of course, all that matters, which is why we need not dwell on the international suspension that Rooney is currently serving for booting some Montenegrin from behind for the sheer hell of it. Suarez, of course, has just finished serving his own ban, his appearance last night being his first match since he was punished after an independent commission found him guilty of racially abusing Rooney&apos;s team-mate, Patrice Evra. Liverpool did not appeal against that ban, nor explain what elements of the case they think were not properly covered by the 115-page report that the commission subsequently produced, but that doesn&apos;t matter because, you see, in Britain you have the inalienable right to be arrogant and self-serving enough to still blithely chuck a &quot;we don&apos;t think he should ever have been away&quot; into your post-match press conference if you really want to, as Kenny Dalglish did last night. As for the action on the pitch, spectators at Anfield were treated to an amusing diversion when a stray animal wandered on to the field of play and prowled around in bemusement before eventually tottering off. But [drum roll please] enough about Andy Carroll [badtoom-tish!], especially as, in fairness, Liverpool&apos;s No9 had more of an impact than Emmanuel Adebayor, who is rapidly vindicating all those who said he couldn&apos;t be counted on to perform consistently for an entire season. Adebayor wasn&apos;t helped, of course, by Tottenham&apos;s timidity last night, an approach that suggested either they were more intent on consolidating a Big Cup spot than pursuing the title that they seem to believe is now beyond them. Which it is. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;Football is an emotive subject, stirring in an individual anything from deep passion to resentment. It has become so commercial that it may be thought by some to have lost its way \u2026 This case is not about football but about some allegations of tax fraud&quot; - Judge Anthony Leonard tells jurors trying &apos;Arry Redknapp and Milan Mandaric to focus on the evidence in his summing up of their case at Southwark crown court. The jury has been sent home for the night after almost four hours of deliberations. POLITICAL FOOTBALL It is of course, important always to remember. With this in mind, the Fiver would like to state right here that it bows to no man in its continuing sense of singed pride over the recent poppy-on-the-shirt furore before last November&apos;s friendly against Spain. The efforts of Fifa&apos;s apologists to prevent England players from introducing a new and slightly peculiar precedent, wreathed in a diffuse but undeniable halo of militaristic nationalism still rankles. In fact, if an uneasy compromise hadn&apos;t been reached involving the covert stitching of poppies into boots, hems and Joleon Lescott&apos;s unusually patriotic male support gusset, the Fiver would have been all in favour of some form of retaliation. Arming the Wembley ballboys perhaps. Or the dispatch of a taskforce to Zurich led by several alcoholic middle-aged American actors and England&apos;s Brave John Terry armed only with very loud clattery machine guns and unconvincing SS-uniform disguises. With this in mind the Fiver was naturally intrigued to hear the news this morning that Argentina, who lost rather than won a war and are therefore at a moral disadvantage, are planning to use football to promote their own less diffuse militaristic nationalism regarding ownership of the Falkland Islands. Thirty years on from the Falklands war the Argentinian government has announced that it will be re-naming the national league first division &apos;Crucero General Belgrano&apos; during the forthcoming football season, a tribute to the warship sunk by a Royal Navy submarine while heading away from the disputed islands (albeit this has never been conclusive evidence of peaceful intentions). What to do about all this? Naturally, like all tabloid newspapers, controversial radio phone-ins and random internet warriors, the Fiver will support wholeheartedly the change of name of the Argentinian league, as not to do so would be rather hypocritical after the poppy furore. And undoubtedly the front pages of both the Sun and the Daily Mail will reflect this even-handed treatment of reverence for war-dead through football tomorrow morning. Otherwise the Fiver can only recommend that the Argentinian government perhaps goes to see recent Baroness Thatcher biopic the Iron Lady, which revealed exclusively and for the first time that not only was Mrs Thatcher a steamily sensual saucepot with a winning smile and regal bearing not dissimilar from a glamorous award-winning American actress done up in make-up. Not only was she actually quite nice and principled and probably even secretly kind to miners and thirsty children with calcium deficiency. But she was also forced to sink the Belgrano by the requirement she make the decision in about 20 seconds while standing in a situation room surrounded by actors in army general-type hats. Failing that, perhaps the Premier League could respond by highlighting similar atrocities, maybe renaming the current season &apos;The Steve Hodge Shinned Backpass Premier League&apos; or &apos;The Distraught Terry Butcher Barclays Super League&apos;. Beyond this - and given the presence in the area of a British nuclear sub with a jittery Thatcher-wannabee Eton bruiser holding the reins - it might be best simply to dig a hole in the back garden, lie down, and prepare for football&apos;s own minor supporting role in the imminent end of the world. FIVER LETTERS &quot;Surely the only way to end the Saga of the Armband (yesterday&apos;s Fiver) is to take it back to the mountains of Mordor and throw it in the very flames in which it was forged?&quot; - Robin Fjeldstad. &quot;Re: yesterday&apos;s last line. Foiled by a play almost as rare as a Fernando Torres goal! I&apos;m not sure how comprehensive the Fiver&apos;s knowledge of American football is, so does it know exactly how close it came to predicting the correct score for Super Bowl XLVI? The scoring began with a safety (worth two points) for the New York Giants, the sixth in Super Bowl history (there were only 21 safeties in 256 NFL games this year).\u00a0It&apos;s a fallacy to assume the rest of the game would have gone the same way, but I&apos;m nothing if not fallacious: without the safety, the Giants&apos; final touchdown would have put them up 19-17, at which point they\u00a0almost surely\u00a0would have kicked an extra point (rather than go for two as they did), leaving them at 20-17 and \u2026 voila&quot; - Nick Mancini. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you&apos;ve nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. BITS AND BOBS Stoke&apos;s Matthew Upson is set to become the latest short shelf-life Premier League footballer shipped off to Shanghai Shenhua in what increasingly looks like a half-cooked effort to redress the imbalance in the number of poor quality goods traded between China and Britain. Edwin van der Sar has offered his \u00a318m jelly-wristed successor at Manchester United, David de Gea, a handy chunk of verbal pressure. &quot;It&apos;s always difficult if you&apos;re coming into a new club and new league, especially the English one. He has to deal with that. They paid a lot of money for him,&quot; he said, tossing an apple into the air and catching it just to show off. The attorney general, Dominic Grieve, has defended his decision not to prosecute Twitter&apos;s Joey Barton for comments he made about the England&apos;s Brave John Terry case. &quot;Whatever Mr Barton had been doing didn&apos;t seem to me, on the facts, to amount to creating the risk we have just been talking about,&quot; he told someone clever on Radio 4. Stuttgart coach Bruno Labbadia is resting Ibrahima Traore and Mamadou Bah from the German Cup match against Bayern Munich because the Equatorial Guinea pair have yet to acclimatise to the cold in Germany after playing at the Africa Cup of Nations.

His new mum treats him well, and she finds comfort in the smiling family photos uploaded online. Besides, she has her own biological seven-year-old to care for \u2013 and she&apos;s busy searching for another infertile couple seeking a womb. Gao is one of China&apos;s surrogate mothers working underground for vast sums of money to deliver children to wannabe parents. The &quot;rent a womb&quot; industry, which inhabits a legal grey area, came under fire in December when it emerged a wealthy couple in the southern city of Guangzhou paid nearly 1m yuan (\u00a3100,000) to have eight babies simultaneously, using two surrogates. For a country that limits families to one child, the babaotai chuanwen or &quot;eight baby scandal&quot; \u2013 unearthed when the babies&apos; portrait was used to advertise a photography studio \u2013 made national headlines. As China enters the year of the dragon, the surrogate industry is preparing for an upswing in business with parents rushing to have a baby in the luckiest lunar year. Shanghai authorities expect 180,000 babies to be born in 2012, 10% more than last year, according to the Shanghai population and planning commission. Countries with a strong Chinese diaspora typically experience a boom in &quot;dragon&quot; babies, as the creature is associated with might, intelligence and is historically linked to emperors. Gao, who didn&apos;t want to give her real name, also feels a sense of urgency. &quot;I hope I can find the next client before March, as I&apos;m already 32 and the time left for me [to be a surrogate] is limited,&quot; she says. Like many surrogates Gao is from one of China&apos;s remote regions, in her case the most north-eastern province, Heilongjiang. Two years ago she received 200,000 yuan (\u00a320,000) for her services to an infertile, middle-aged couple from the affluent former capital, Nanjing. Surrogates can earn anything from 100,000 yuan to over 300,000 yuan, approximately 120 times the average monthly salary of a graduate in Beijing. Though there is no specific law relating to surrogacy in China, in 2001 the industry was driven underground when the ministry of health banned trade in fertilised eggs and embryos, forbidding hospitals from performing surrogacy procedures. Regulations are openly flouted. While there&apos;s no official count, the Guangzhou-based newspaper Southern Metropolis Weekly estimated last year that there have been 25,000 surrogate children born in China in the past 30 years. More than 100 surrogacy agencies advertise online. Given that 10% of couples struggle with infertility, a rate that is on the rise according to research by the ministry of health, there&apos;s a potentially huge market for surrogacy in China. &quot;Parents living in Shanghai or Beijing have to travel to far-flung cities such as Wuhan, Harbin and Hohhot to meet a surrogate mother and find a hospital willing to finish the transplantation,&quot; says Mrs Zhou, a surrogacy agent in Shanghai, who requested just her family name be used. Most couple-surrogate pairings are arranged through internet-based agencies, with agents expected to find one or two surrogates each month, earning 2,000 yuan (\u00a3200) for each, according to Zhou. During pregnancy, surrogates are often contractually obliged to reside in a &quot;surrogate dorm&quot;, where they share rooms, are cared for by nannies and are governed by a strict set of rules. At Zhou&apos;s agency, violations include being awake after 9.30pm and telling friends and relatives the dorm&apos;s whereabouts. Surrogates who flout the rules are subject to a fine (typically 500 yuan or \u00a350) and may lose their end of the contract. Many infertile parents are willing to pay any price for a precious single child. &quot;You suffer psychological torture from the fear you will never have a child,&quot; says Mr Li, 42, a father whose child was born through a surrogate and who requested his name be changed. &quot;Then you fear that something will happen when the surrogate mother is pregnant, and then, even when you have the child in your arms, you begin to worry that someone will discover the truth.&quot; Li, a wealthy businessman who owns a chain of restaurants in Chengdu, already has a seven-year-old daughter but is planning to have a dragon boy this year. Though the ministry of health stipulates that the use of reproduction techniques such as IVF must conform to China&apos;s &quot;family planning policy&quot;, surrogacy is one way moneyed parents bypass the one-child rule. &quot;There are some parents trying to avoid one-child policy by surrogacy, but I think the practice should be governed by some laws or rules,&quot; says Zhai Zhenwu, director of Renmin University&apos;s school of sociology and population. &quot;It&apos;s unfair to poor citizens to whom it seems the rich can have as many children as they want. It&apos;s another negative signal to society that money can buy anything, when we should be teaching people that the golden key can&apos;t open every door.&quot; But for women such as Gao, the decision to surrogate isn&apos;t an ethical one: it provides her family with much-needed cash, even if there&apos;s an emotional cost. Though her husband cared for her in their home during her first surrogacy, for the next Gao plans to move out of town. &quot;My relatives and neighbours would be sceptical if I tell them the baby is stillborn again,&quot; she says.

Absolutely. Whether we can do it or not is something that will be proven this year.&quot; The seven-times world champion is in the third and surely final year of his deal with Mercedes after an anti-climatic comeback. At the end of the season he is expected to leave the sport he dominated so ruthlessly while at Ferrari. But he is not the only one under pressure. Last season was a desperately disappointing one for Mercedes, who finished fourth in the constructors&apos; championship, 210 points behind the third-placed Ferrari, who themselves underperformed woefully. Schumacher did improve his performances towards the end of the season but still finished eighth in the championship, one place behind team-mate Nico Rosberg, whose best position was fifth after making three podium appearances the previous year. Mercedes are the only leading team at Jerez running with last year&apos;s car. They are due to launch their 2012 model at the next testing session in Barcelona on 21 February. There are rumours that the delay has been caused by their reluctance to reveal their new front wing. A cautious Schumacher said: &quot;I don&apos;t think we can realistically achieve a championship\u2011winning car immediately from where we started last year.

I&apos;m definitely in no rush to go back home. I&apos;m thinking of doing a master&apos;s here.&quot; Older is one of scores of English students discovering the possibilities of swapping university life at home for a quite difference experience on the continent \u2013 without the inconvenience of having to speak a foreign language. Money is a factor: swingeing tuition fees are thought to be behind a 8,500 drop in the number of 18-year-olds applying for university places in England this year, according to recent figures. But Older and others in the burgeoning expat community of Brits studying in Maastricht insist that the prospect of leaving university in sizeable debt is not the key criterion that took them abroad. &quot;The lower fees are a bonus, but you need to make a commitment to come here,&quot; said Colin Behr, a second-year European studies scholar from Devon. &quot;Going to another country to study is very daunting. But it&apos;s a great opportunity. The reason I&apos;m here is the quality and the value for money. It definitely feels more serious than the UK.&quot; The pretty, small town in the southern Netherlands, close to the Belgian and German borders, is forever associated with the eponymous treaty that created the modern European Union 20 years ago. But in recent years it has become a magnet for more enterprising UK students. Because of its catchment area, the university has always been international, with a Dutch majority but also thousands of students from Germany and Belgium. British students now occupy fourth place in the ethnic jumble in Maastricht and their numbers are rising relatively fast. As of this month, 255 Britons have applied for places in September, two-and-a-half times the comparable figure a year ago. Four years ago there were 18 British students in Maastricht. The figure is now 163 and that could double later this year. &quot;The situation in Britain has changed, so we expect a lot more applications this year,&quot; said Jeanine Gregersen-Hermans, the university&apos;s marketing director. &quot;People have been forced to look outside [the UK] and now it has snowballed.&quot; If the British are increasingly clamouring at the gates of the old Catholic city, it may be crucially because most of the undergraduate teaching is in English, a rarity on the continent. &quot;I&apos;m taking a Dutch course, but you don&apos;t really need it. English is so common here and the standard is so high you can hardly tell they&apos;re not native speakers,&quot; said Theresa Bullock, a 19-year-old first-year student from Worcestershire. &quot;We don&apos;t see ourselves as providing a solution to a British problem,&quot; said Martin Paul, the president of the university. &quot;But we need native speakers. The British students improve the quality in the classroom. So the UK is interesting for us.&quot; Maastricht, however, remains an exception as the British show relatively little desire for a student life on the continent. Indeed, the traffic is overwhelmingly in the other direction. According to EU figures on cross-border study among the 27 member countries, Britain attracted a whopping share of the European total \u2013 more than a quarter \u2013 in 2009, the latest year for which figures are available. Of 600,000 EU students taking degrees in non-native union countries, 175,000 were in the UK. In stark contrast, only 11,800 Britons were studying elsewhere in the EU, compared with, for example, 80,000 Germans, 47,000 French and 41,000 Italians. Whether tuition fees will lead to a much bigger exodus remains to be seen. There is no doubt that the savings to be made by studying in Maastricht are considerable. Undergraduate tuition fees are currently \u20ac1,713 (\u00a31,440) for an academic year, less than one sixth of the \u00a39,000 maximum being levied in England from September. &quot;The UK has been considered a student import country. But now you have the situation with tuition fees and more awareness of moving abroad. We see it in the surge in applications,&quot; said Paul. &quot;I&apos;m a bit worried about the UK because there&apos;s an exodus of talent.&quot; Additionally, for students of any EU nationality who can prove they are working 32 hours a month, the Dutch government shells out \u20ac265, almost enough to cover rent and bills. Not a loan \u2013 a grant. And there is no shortage of work. Even without Dutch, Bullock landed a part-time job with the Dutch post office. &quot;I don&apos;t even want to think about the kind of debt I&apos;d be in if I&apos;d stayed in England,&quot; she said. Behr said: &quot;Even if you graduate and get a decent job with a decent salary in the UK, you will then want to buy a house and you&apos;ll effectively have two mortgages around your neck.&quot; According to Older, &quot;the UK government gives you nothing. But we&apos;re all looking at finishing our studies here debt-free. For a UK mindset, that&apos;s unthinkable.&quot; Case studies Saul Stollery, 18, from Essex, is taking a degree in international studies at Ningbo campus in China Last summer, Saul Stollery from Colchester decided to ditch his place at a British university and study for a degree in China instead. He took up a full scholarship \u2013 worth more than \u00a324,000 over three years \u2013 at the University of Nottingham&apos;s Ningbo campus, south of Shanghai. Initially, his friends and family questioned the wisdom of his decision. He had gained top A-level grades \u2013 two A*s, two As and a B \u2013 and could have gone to almost any university he wished. &quot;I was all packed and ready to go to a London university to study politics with German,&quot; he says. &quot;I decided to check my emails: there was a message telling me I had won a full scholarship to study in China. I thought to myself: &apos;When am I going to get another opportunity like this?&apos;\u2009&quot; Stollery does not regret the decision, but admits it has been tough. &quot;There are so many etiquette rules you just can&apos;t get wrong here. For example, it&apos;s extremely rude to leave your chopsticks pointing upwards in a bowl of rice at the end of a meal. It symbolises death.&quot; The university offers five hours of free Chinese classes a week, but Stollery says conveying even simple messages can be difficult. &quot;Telling the hairdresser what kind of cut you want is a big challenge, as is telling the taxi driver exactly where you want to go,&quot; he says. &quot;I miss English milk and bread. When I go to the supermarket, there are so few westerners that people almost queue to take a photo of themselves with me. People stare at me all the time. You need to be brave and be willing to stick at it.&quot; Stollery says he has learned how to think on his feet and cope on his own \u2013 skills he believes will prove helpful in his intended career, working in human rights for a non-governmental organisation. Any fears that his degree subject, international studies, might be harder to study in China than in a more open democracy have proved unfounded, he says. &quot;Our lecturers are from all over the world and it&apos;s wonderful to hear so many different viewpoints. &quot;My best friends are from New York, Norway and Australia and I have lots of Chinese friends too. &quot;I think we do slightly more work than my friends do in UK universities, mainly because of the extra Chinese lessons. I have about 12 hours of seminars and lectures per week apart from my language lessons. But I love being a foreign student and I think I&apos;ll do a masters and PhD in a university somewhere else outside Britain after my degree.&quot; Jessica Shepherd Charlotte Dinkin, 22, is an anthropology major in her final year at Columbia University in New York Charlotte Dinkin from Kent looked at a number of UK universities before her dad and school counsellor suggested she consider the US. &quot;At my school, Sevenoaks, we actually had a counsellor who specialised in American admissions, which was really lucky, but still not many people from my school applied,&quot; she says. &quot;I think that there were different reasons why students weren&apos;t interested. It&apos;s a much heftier application process to apply to a US university and some students didn&apos;t necessarily want to be so far from home, but I wanted an adventure.&quot; Dinkin visited Columbia University and decided to apply to Barnard College [a women&apos;s liberal arts college within Columbia]. &quot;While I was looking around Columbia, on a tour, someone mentioned that their sister went to Barnard so I looked at the website, was really interested and I applied. I decided to give it a shot for one year, just to see how I&apos;d adapt, but then ended up staying for the full four-year degree course.&quot; Dinkin says she knew the cost was considerably higher than UK universities, but feels she made a great choice and would be even more inclined to make the same choice now, with the price rises at home. &quot;It certainly is expensive but I&apos;m glad I did it because I think, even though it sounds cliched, what else should you invest your money in if not your education? &quot;The university is so welcoming and the pastoral care is great. Barnard College especially because it&apos;s women&apos;s college is very good with women&apos;s health initiatives. &quot;Also, there is a big emphasis on exploring interests outside of the classroom. For example, I do a lot of theatre and comedy, and even spent a semester studying in Chicago at the Second City, an American comedy theatre \u2013 that&apos;s an opportunity that I wouldn&apos;t have necessarily known about from a traditional British degree course.&quot; After spending the last four years in the US, Dinkin is open to the idea of returning to the UK: &quot;I feel like I&apos;ve had a really amazing experience and I&apos;m comfortable with going back to England because it&apos;s my home. &quot;But I have built up a wonderful support network here, just from the great connections that people make at university, and more importantly the international links I&apos;ve made here, and so, I think I&apos;m more worried about being an outsider when I come home.&quot; A growing number of British undergraduates are choosing to study in the US rather than the UK. According to the Institute of International Education (IIE), which has tracked international students coming into the US since 1949, the country is the preferred destination for students from the UK. In the 2010/11 academic year, 8,947 UK students were in the US, a rise of 600 in two years. Peggy Blumenthal of the IIE says: &quot;As degrees get more expensive in the UK, the differences between a US and UK education, in terms of cost, are narrowing. Also, there are wide opportunities for financial aid here to help with costs. The information about aid has always been available but there was much less of an incentive for British students to explore it.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a Paris-based thinktank, analysed successes and failures in education systems in 39 of the world&apos;s most developed nations. It found that countries that divided pupils into ability groups at an early age tended to have higher numbers of school drop-outs and lower levels of achievement. In the UK one in six pupils are divided according to their academic ability by the age of seven, according to a study conducted last year by the London University&apos;s Institute of Education. Beatriz Pont, an education analyst and one of the authors of the OECD&apos;s study, said streaming by ability at an early age &quot;fuelled a vicious cycle&quot; in which teachers had low expectations of students in the lowest sets. These students were often &quot;locked into a lower educational environment before they had a chance to develop\u00a0\u2026 their potential,&quot; she said. Her study \u2013 Equity and Quality in Education: Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools \u2013 found the most experienced and capable teachers often taught pupils in the highest sets. Streaming by ability &quot;exacerbates inequities&quot; because immigrants and pupils from low-income families are more likely to be placed in low-ability groups, she said. The UK and the US had the joint highest proportion of pupils in schools that divide according to ability at 99% each. Countries, such as Finland, that are well-known for their high-performing education systems, had a far lower proportion \u2013 58%. Dividing pupils into ability groups was commonplace in the UK in the 1940s and early 1950s. By the early 1990s it had virtually disappeared because studies had shown it had no effect on overall attainment. It is gradually being re-introduced into UK schools. The OECD study also shows the UK has a higher proportion of pupils with poor reading skills than our rival nations. In the UK, 18% of 15-year-olds do not have basic reading skills. This is average for OECD countries, but several countries have considerably lower proportions than we do. Finland, Norway and Sweden have 8%, 15% and 17% respectively, while Shanghai-China \u2013 which have been grouped together for the purpose of the study \u2013 only had 4%. Almost a fifth \u2013 18% \u2013 of 25 to 34-year-olds in the UK did not complete the last years of secondary school. In Canada, the US and Germany, the figures were 8%, 12% and 14% respectively. The researchers showed that the UK is better than most of its rivals at managing to reduce the gap between pupils who are new to the country and those who are born here. The gap in reading skills is considerably more narrow in the UK than France, Germany and Finland. A far higher proportion of pupils in UK schools opt for academic subjects, rather than vocational ones compared with most rich countries of the world, the study shows. In the UK, 69.5% of pupils in the last years of secondary school are on academic courses, while 30.5% are on vocational courses. This is the eighth lowest proportion on vocational courses of all countries. Across the OECD, the split between the two types of courses is almost equal, while in Germany, Austria and Finland a higher proportion of pupils are enrolled on vocational courses than academic ones. Pont said that countries should strive to make academic and vocational courses equivalent. The study recommends countries improve their education systems by stopping pupils from re-taking a year, eliminating setting by ability and allocating funding according to students needs. A spokesman from the Department for Education said it was for schools to decide how and when to group and set pupils by ability. &quot;Research shows that when setting is done well, it can be an effective way to personalise teaching and learning to the differing needs of groups of pupils,&quot; he said. &quot;When setting is not based on accurate assessment of ability, or isn&apos;t used to adapt teaching to the needs of the group, then it can be divisive and limit pupils&apos; aspirations.&quot;", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "Primary schools", "Teaching", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-09T17:30:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/09/hamilton-vettel-f1-rosberg", "sentences": ["That&apos;s what he is there for.&quot; But Hamilton did not make any comment about Adrian Sutil, even though he may be forced to go to court as a witness following the German driver&apos;s decision to appeal against a conviction following a fight in a Shanghai nightclub last year."], "title": "Hamilton and Vettel in 2012 F1 cars trumped by Rosberg's 2011 model", "article": "Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel produced almost identical times on the third day of testing in Jerez on Thursday but they were trumped by the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg, even though he was driving last year&apos;s car.

He aimed to exploit the success of the city&apos;s pavilion at the World Expo, with its video greeting from Paul McCartney and football showcase. But there was a problem. The mayor of Shanghai was confused by Liverpool having a council leader and a lord mayor. So who was in charge, he wondered? The experience convinced Anderson that his city needed to follow London and have a highly visible figurehead \u2013 especially given the intense global competition that exists between cities. Now he has his wish. Liverpool voted last week to become the biggest city outside the capital to be run by an elected mayor. As part of the move, Anderson secured \u00a3130m from central government in the first &quot;city deal&quot; of its kind. This will fund a dozen new schools and a new hospital, and give special powers to tackle long-term unemployment. The little-noticed vote is part of a little-noticed revolution this year. There will be elections for up to 12 new city mayors, depending on local referendums, along with 41 ballots for the powerful new posts of police commissioners. The results could transform the political landscape, with Birmingham and Bristol among those likely to follow London and Liverpool. They may even salve some of the deep wounds in our body politic, slightly closing the gap that has opened up between politicians and a wearily cynical electorate. For 14 years, governments have been trying to shift power from the English centre, with minimal success apart from in London. Now the drive has been speeded-up, lowering the threshold for referendums, and permitting ministers to pass extra powers, funds and functions to mayors \u2013 incentives introduced after most local electorates that voted on the idea, rejected it. The reforms are not perfect \u2013 the mayors remain too weak and few in number \u2013 and nor are they the panacea to our political problems, but they are a progressive step. Following the flop of electoral reform, these contests are the most significant constitutional change the coalition is introducing \u2013 far more important than the tedious House of Lords reform that looks likely only to bring in more party jobsworths. They take us closer to models seen abroad: after all, in France presidents build power bases on mayoralties, while in the US we saw the White House chief of staff quit to run Chicago. The titanic struggle in London between Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone shows clearly there is no place for party slaves in fiercely contested local battles. Candidates must assert independence and reflect local concerns to build a relationship with voters. If they succeed, they can become dynamic political forces and even challenge party leaders, as both these men have demonstrated. This is good for the vitality of politics while also encouraging local innovation, such as congestion charging and city cycling schemes. The winner of May&apos;s election in London will be joined by a host of similarly powerful, independent-minded and well-known characters. Anderson may be challenged by Phil Redmond, the TV mogul, while Liverpool-born &quot;red Tory&quot; Phillip Blond is being urged to run. Several prominent figures are preparing to leave Westminster for local politics \u2013 a significant change in the direction of travel \u2013 while police commissioners could include John Prescott in Hull, Falklands veteran Simon Weston in south Wales and Tim Collins, the army officer famed for his Iraq battle cry, in Kent. Some people fear personality politics, especially in town halls where ballots threaten their backroom dealings. They are wrong to do so. For a start, like it or not, it reflects the celebrity age in which we live. More importantly, it increases interest in politics. Peter Soulsby, a council leader and MP before becoming mayor of Leicester last year, told me he did two dozen hustings in his campaign \u2013 more than he had done in four decades&apos; involvement in politics. In London, turnout has risen with each mayoral vote. Studies have found more than twice as many people can name an elected mayor over a council leader and that voters are twice as likely to feel involved in decision-making. Soulsby says expectations of a mayor are far greater. And cities need vocal champions, whether to counter London&apos;s dominance or compete on the world stage. Prescott&apos;s confirmation that he is among several former Labour ministers planning to stand as police commissioners proves the party has seen the opportunity created by these new posts after opposing them for two years. Inadequate leadership has undermined the police, leading to bungling, bureaucracy and over-caution, while poor handling of low-level crimes has eroded public support. We need more innovation and accountability \u2013 and any politician able to shake things up and cut crime will deservedly win a national platform. Not all the new local leaders unleashed this year will be successful. But at least they are visible, unlike the faceless police authorities, and easily ejected, unlike council leaders in urban one-party fiefdoms. And at the very least, the cacophony of competing city champions will make politics more enlivening, which can only be to everyone&apos;s benefit.", "tags": ["Local politics", "Local government", "Boris Johnson", "Ken Livingstone", "Liverpool", "Police", "Politics", "John Prescott", "Society", "UK news", "Mayoral elections"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-12T21:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/13/xi-jinping-profile-china", "sentences": ["After the toppling of Shanghai&apos;s party secretary Chen Liangyu in a corruption scandal, Xi took charge of the city in 2007."], "title": "The Guardian profile: Xi Jinping", "article": "His name is becoming more familiar but his face is still unknown to most and his opinions and intentions are an enigma.

The Chinese vice-president&apos;s Valentine&apos;s Day meeting with Barack Obama is notable \u2013 as are his plans to catch a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game and to return to Muscatine, the tiny Iowa town he visited in 1985 as head of an animal feed delegation. His activities suggest he is shaping an image very different from that of the current Chinese president, Hu Jintao. While Hu is determinedly anonymous, Xi is &quot;a big personality&quot;, according to those who have met him. Standing over 6ft tall, he is confident and affable. He boasts a ready smile and a glamorous second wife \u2013 the renowned People&apos;s Liberation Army singer Peng Liyuan. He has expressed his fondness for US war movies and, perhaps more surprisingly, praised the edgy independent film-maker Jia Zhangke. This is, in part, a generational and social shift. Xi is 58 and, like the other rising stars in Chinese politics, grew up in the era of reform and opening. While Hu&apos;s first visit to the US was in 2002, Xi and his peers have travelled frequently and several have personal links with the west. Xi&apos;s daughter is studying at Harvard and a sister is thought to live in Canada. And like many of his peers, he is a &quot;princeling&quot; \u2013 someone who has experienced both privilege and prejudice as the child of a powerful Communist party figure. Xi was born in 1953 to Xi Zhongxun, a Long March hero who later became a vice-premier, and Qi Xin. He grew up in the relative comfort of Zhongnanhai, the party elite&apos;s red-walled Beijing compound. Loneliness But when he was only nine his father fell from grace with Mao Zedong. Six years later, as the cultural revolution wreaked havoc, young Xi was dispatched to the dusty, impoverished north-western province of Shaanxi to &quot;learn from the masses&quot;. He spent seven years living in a cave home in Liangjiahe village. &quot;I ate a lot more bitterness than most people,&quot; he once told a Chinese magazine. He has described struggling with the fleas, the hard physical labour and the sheer loneliness. There is, of course, a well-established Communist iconography of learning to serve the people. But political commentator Li Datong suggests this &quot;double background&quot; has proved genuinely formative for princelings such as Xi and might even lead them to bolder policy making. &quot;One aspect is their family background as children of the country&apos;s founders and the other is their experience of being sent to the countryside, which made them understand China&apos;s real situation better. It gives this generation a strong tradition of idealism and the courage to do something big,&quot; he said. Although he has openly criticised the cultural revolution, Xi embraced the party; in a WikiLeaks cable an academic who knew Xi as a young man suggested he &quot;chose to survive by becoming redder than red&quot;. Family links helped him to win a place studying chemical engineering at the elite Tsinghua University, followed by a post as aide to a powerful military leader, Geng Biao \u2013 the beginning of his useful People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) connections. Next came a more surprising move \u2013 his choice, says political expert Zhang Xiaojin \u2013 to an unglamorous post in Hebei province. He may have hoped to shake off suggestions of benefiting from his family name. It was as deputy secretary of Zhengding county that he visited Muscatine, a US town of 23,000 until now best known for its melons and Mark Twain&apos;s brief sojourn there in 1855. &quot;He was a very polite and kind guy. I could see someone very devoted to his work \u2013 there was no golfing on that trip, that&apos;s for sure,&quot; said Eleanor Dvorchak, who hosted Xi in her son&apos;s old room, where he slept amid football wallpaper and Star Trek figurines. &quot;He was serious. He was a man on a mission.&quot; Sarah Lande, who organised the trip, said his confidence was obvious even through a translator. &quot;You could tell he was in charge \u2026 he seemed relaxed and welcoming and able to handle things,&quot; she said. &quot;He had the words he wanted to express himself easily.&quot; The acquaintance who spoke to WikiLeaks claimed Xi always had his &quot;eye on the prize&quot; of a major party post. He transferred to southern Fujian province in 1985, climbing steadily upwards over 17 years. Most of his experience has been earned in China&apos;s relatively prosperous, entrepreneurial coastal areas, where he courted investors and built up business, proving willing to adopt new ideas. The former US treasury secretary Hank Paulson called him &quot;the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line&quot;. After the toppling of Shanghai&apos;s party secretary Chen Liangyu in a corruption scandal, Xi took charge of the city in 2007. Barely six months later his elevation to the politburo standing committee \u2013 the top political body \u2013 signalled that he was expected to succeed Hu. In October 2010 his appointment as vice-chair of the central military commission cemented his position. He describes his own thinking as pragmatic and throughout his rise he has cultivated a down-to-earth image; in the provinces he ate in government canteens and often dressed down. In a burst of publicity shortly before his 2007 promotion his wife lauded his humble nature and devotion to duty, revealing that on their second date he warned her he would not have much time for family life. And in a system known for corruption, he also has a clean reputation. One friend told the LA Times the worst the paper was likely to find were overdue library books. But while Xi is well-liked and adept at glad-handing, he appears to give little of importance away. Even his popular wife has retreated into the background as he has assumed increasing prominence. The US ambassador Gary Locke recently observed that he was &quot;very personable&quot; but that US officials &quot;really don&apos;t know that much about him&quot;. Close association with particular policies or factions has its dangers. Becoming general secretary of the party, and thus leader of China, is &quot;an issue of who opposes you rather than who supports you&quot;, said Kerry Brown, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. Beyond his openness to economic reforms, Xi is known primarily as a figure who appeals to different groupings and as a safe pair of hands. &quot;In recent years he has taken care of large-scale events, including Olympics and anniversaries, and there haven&apos;t been any big mistakes. Xi has steadily been through these tests,&quot; said Zhang. In 2007 he leapfrogged Li Keqiang \u2013 until then seen as likely to succeed Hu, but seen perhaps as too much Hu&apos;s protege \u2013 as the consensus candidate in a system built on collective decision making. Xi&apos;s networks are unusually broad, according to Brown: &quot;Provincially; through his family; and with the military through Geng Biao. His elevation is in the interests of the widest group of people and opposed by the smallest group.&quot; It is the same relatively small elite who will determine what he can do with the job. Liberal Some hope he shares his father&apos;s liberal sympathies: Xi senior was not only a noted economic reformer, but an ally of reformist leader Hu Yaobang. Some say he criticised the military crackdown on Tiananmen Square&apos;s pro-democracy protests in 1989. They say that grassroots organisations burgeoned during the vice-president&apos;s stint in Zhejiang, and there was progress in the election of independent candidates at local polls. But the Chinese Human Rights Defenders network has argued the province also saw &quot;zealous persecution&quot; of dissidents, underground Christians and activists: &quot;His track record does not bode well,&quot; it wrote. Other China watchers point to shattered hopes that Hu might prove politically liberal. Nor does Xi&apos;s confidence in overseas dealings necessarily indicate a more emollient approach to foreign relations. His most-quoted remark to date was made on a trip to Mexico in 2009: &quot;There are some well-fed foreigners who have nothing better to do than point fingers at our affairs. China does not, first, export revolution; second, export poverty and hunger; third, cause troubles for you. What else is there to say?&quot; In any case, to read Xi as a man in sole control of the agenda is to fundamentally misunderstand the Chinese political system. He will be &quot;first among equals&quot; in the nine-member standing committee, say analysts. Hu and other former leaders will still exert influence; and 2011&apos;s five-year plan has plotted the immediate course. The system &quot;is in favour of moderation, and nothing can change quickly. Steady as it goes. The political rhythm first has to be installed \u2026 significant shifts will come later,&quot; said Dr David Kelly, director of the Beijing-based political thinktank China Policy. Some think Xi&apos;s networks may allow him to strike out more confidently than Hu. Others think he will struggle to win support for bold decisions needed to tackle the country&apos;s mounting challenges. &quot;I think he&apos;s a more instinctive and gut-driven politician and may surprise us. Others say the system and the vested interests around him are too strong,&quot; said Brown. His leadership will be shaped by his colleagues and framed by external forces. &quot;What&apos;s very important is the capacity to be on the right side of history,&quot; said Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution in Washington. &quot;He himself probably does not know what he will do.&quot; Pocket profile Born June 1953 Career His father was a revolutionary hero and a steady rise through party ranks, aided by expert networking, is set to take Xi to the very top. His family background has dogged him at times but also speeded him on his course. High point Emerging as heir apparent to Hu Jintao at the 17th party congress in 2007. Many had expected Li Keqiang \u2013 now expected to become premier \u2013 to take the position.

The manager tore into his players, who had pockmarked their display with sloppy errors, but he found that some of them gave back as good as they got. In the blow-up, they told him exactly what they thought of him and his tactics, to lay bare the tensions at the club. Villas-Boas believes that he has the support of the owner, Roman Abramovich, who was also present at the training ground on Sunday. Abramovich&apos;s focus is no longer consumed by his $5bn (\u00a33.2bn) litigation battle with Boris Berezovsky \u2013 the high court hearing ended on 19 January and Mrs Justice Gloster is in the throes of writing her judgment \u2013 and he has been a regular at Cobham since the Saturday before last which, inevitably, has heightened the pressure on Villas-Boas. Abramovich, though, does not want to sack the young Portuguese, having taken the decision on his own to appoint him as the successor to Carlo Ancelotti last summer, and he shared in the manager&apos;s frustrations with the players. The defeat at Goodison Park, which exacerbated the club&apos;s Premier League slump and dropped them out of the Champions League places, was, by common consent, the team&apos;s worst performance of a season that has seen them fail to compete for the title. They lag 17 points behind the league leaders Manchester City. A big part of Villas-Boas&apos;s brief is to rejuvenate the Chelsea squad, to assimilate talented young players while still competing for silverware. He has maintained that a club of Chelsea&apos;s stature cannot tolerate mere transition. But, inevitably, he has found himself unpopular with the older guard, whom he feels he must phase out. He caused a stir with his man-management when he banished Nicolas Anelka and Alex to train with the reserves, after they had requested transfers in December; the popular pair departed in January for Shanghai Shenhua and Paris St-Germain respectively. Villas-Boas has also clashed with Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba while even the high-profile January signing, Gary Cahill, has been left bewildered at his treatment. He has played only once in his five weeks at the club. Chelsea&apos;s hopes of a trophy have come to rest on the FA Cup and Champions League \u2013 the latter is the one that Abramovich covets above all others \u2013 and their next two fixtures are in those competitions. They play Birmingham City in the FA Cup fifth round at Stamford Bridge on Saturday before they travel to Napoli for the Champions League last-16 first-leg next Tuesday. The captain, John Terry, hopes to return from a knee injury to face Birmingham, while Drogba and Salomon Kalou are due back on Wednesday from the Africa Cup of Nations. The pressure in each tie will be intense, with the resentment towards Villas-Boas in some quarters adding further spice. Villas-Boas&apos;s assistant, Roberto Di Matteo, is also under scrutiny, with Abramovich picking up on the feeling during his visits to the training ground that the former Italy international is unpopular with the players. Abramovich turned to Villas-Boas after dismissing Ancelotti at the end of last season following, coincidentally, a Premier League defeat at Everton, having been impressed at how the 34-year-old won the treble of league, cup and Europa League with Porto. He is desperate for Villas-Boas to succeed, not least as firing him would call into question the wisdom of investing such faith in a talent without an extensive track record. It is never prudent, though, to second-guess Abramovich, who has sacked five managers during his eight-and-a-half-year stewardship of the club. He dismissed Luiz Felipe Scolari in February 2009 when the club&apos;s membership of the Premier League&apos;s top four was in jeopardy. Villas-Boas is acutely aware of the need to qualify for next season&apos;s Champions League. The fallout from Everton in the Chelsea dressing room also featured a candid assessment from the goalkeeper Petr Cech. &quot;When you lose a game 2-0 and you are Chelsea football club, playing for the Champions League and with big expectations, losing is not good enough and the performance was not good enough. That&apos;s why we lost. &quot;We took so many passes side to side and we never really opened them up. In the second half, we tried to play more direct but they were fighting well and kept organised, and 1-0 up so early became so much more difficult to break.&quot;", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas", "Roman Abramovich", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-13T22:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/14/americas-apprehensive-china-diplomacy", "sentences": ["The world will have to reconcile itself to sitting on the sidelines and watching as the story is played out in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Chongqing and a hundred other places far from the White House."], "title": "America's apprehensive China diplomacy | Jonathan Fenby", "article": "Vice-presidents don&apos;t usually get top-drawer treatment when they visit Washington. But the red carpet is being rolled out for China&apos;s Xi Jinping, this week. He is getting to have talks not only with the US president and vice-president, but also with the secretaries of the State and Defense departments, as well as the speaker of the House of Representatives. Nor he will he be subjected to the trying experience of a press conference; and protesters over Tibet and human rights are likely to be kept well away.  Since Xi is set to assume his country&apos;s top job of secretary of the Communist party in October, and then become state president in March 2013, this treatment is only fitting. As the eurozone&apos;s quest for funding from Beijing to help it out of its hole continued at Tuesday&apos;s EU-China summit in Beijing, it is also the latest sign of just how heavily China weighs in the global scales. The subjects for discussion in Washington are evident. Xi and his hosts will doubtless review the state of the world and the global economy. They will disagree on Syria and express frustration over North Korea. Obama will urge the Chinese to take steps to reduce the US trade deficit with the mainland. Given the persecution of lawyers and the self-immolations of Tibetan monks and nuns, human rights may be a little more than the usual pro-forma &quot;agreement to disagree&quot;. Obama has been groping for a relationship with Beijing since his visit to China in 2009 (he stayed away on his latest Asian tour). On that trip, he was widely seen as having been railroaded by his hosts. Hillary Clinton sounded a tougher line last year, but Vice-President Joe Biden was all smiles when he went to the mainland in 2011, with Xi shepherding him around. And Biden has now reportedly been put in charge of China policy. Sino-US strategic committees meet repeatedly, but little of substance changes.  In part, this is because, aside from defending its &quot;core interests&quot; of Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan and the Communist party-led politico-economy system, China&apos;s diplomacy often seems to amount to little more than the pursuit of raw material supplies to feed its economic machine. It is correspondingly difficult to engage with. But the vacuum is also because, like Europe, the United States appears to have little clear notion of how to deal with the big new kid on the block. China&apos;s explosive growth in the last three decades has led to straight-line forecasts that the People &apos;s Republic is set to rule the world. This is not going to happen, if only because the political leadership in Beijing, which is used to having its way, does not want it to happen. That said, the emergence of the world&apos;s most populous nation from the ruins of the late Mao period faces other powers with a situation never experienced before. A country that is still relatively poor now houses the world&apos;s second biggest economy, with foreign exchange reserves of more than $3tn, making it a major contributor to paying for the federal deficit of the richest country on earth. America wants to engage with China, but it also wants to hedge its bets in case things turn sour. So, Obama launched an initiative last year to buttress the US position in the Pacific, which brings it into potential confrontation with Beijing \u2013 the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) being pushed by Washington would not include the People&apos;s Republic. (Since it may well not extend to Japan or South Korea either, it is, in fact, probably dead in the water.) The naval build-up by the People&apos;s Liberation Army arouses fears among some commentators \u2013 and anxious warnings from the arms industry \u2013 that China will come to resemble pre-first world war Germany, even though its military capacity is far, far below that of the US.  China, for its part, knows that its growth has drawn heavily on the appetite in the west for its cheap goods and that it has no interest in trade wars with the US. In an allusion to commercial tensions, Xi told former senior US officials, including Henry Kissinger, at his first meeting in Washington:  &quot;This year marks the election year of the United States. I believe no one of insight from the US side would like to see that the election factors would have a regrettable impact on the development of ties between the two countries \u2026 We should deal with friction and differences in bilateral economic and trade cooperation in the spirit of seeking mutual benefits and win-win results through a positive and constructive way.&quot;  But old, protective suspicions regularly emerge from Beijing, augmented by rising nationalism on the back of economic growth. Hu Jintao, the man who will hand over to Xi, told a Communist party plenum last October:  &quot;We must clearly see that international hostile forces are intensifying the strategic plot of Westernizing and dividing China \u2026 We should deeply understand the seriousness and complexity of the ideological struggle, always sound the alarms and remain vigilant and take forceful measures to be on guard and respond.&quot;  In this uncertain context, Xi is, himself, a source of uncertainty. Son of a Mao-era vice-premier, who was purged during the Cultural Revolution and then rehabilitated to supervise the economic development of Guangdong province, Xi has worked his way up the bureaucracy of the state and party, and was elevated to the supreme decision-making body, the standing committee, of the politburo in 2007. Ask people in Beijing how he got to the top and the answer is that all the many interest groups in China are comfortable with him. He has been careful not to express any opinion that deviates from party orthodoxy. So, on current showing, Xi does not seem to be the leader who will be ready, or able, to undertake the structural reforms China needs in the coming years. He will have to deal with a society that is evolving beyond the constraints of the party state system \u2013 and with new tensions, as demonstrated by the ongoing imbroglio around the rock star of Chinese politics, Bo Xilai, in the mega-municipality of Chongqing. China has enormous problems, ranging from the environment to the legal system, through corruption and a lack of trust in authority of all kinds. Those domestic challenges, rather than foreign relations, will be the key to China&apos;s development, as it tries to move away from the old growth model. The world will have to reconcile itself to sitting on the sidelines and watching as the story is played out in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Chongqing and a hundred other places far from the White House.", "tags": ["Xi Jinping", "China", "US news", "Obama administration", "Barack Obama", "Joe Biden", "Hillary Clinton", "US foreign policy", "US military", "Tibet", "Human rights", "European Union", "Eurozone crisis", "Hu Jintao"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-14T19:33:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/14/tom-daley-london-olympics-coach", "sentences": ["He&apos;s very strong and he&apos;s one of the best, but he is not the\u00a0best.&quot; He went on to suggest that Daley&apos;s fifth-place finish at the World Championships in Shanghai last year is an accurate reflection of his position in the pecking order."], "title": "Tom Daley's media commitments threaten Olympic medal hopes, says coach", "article": "Tom Daley&apos;s coach has warned the diver he must cut down on media and sponsorship appearances if he is to have any hope of winning a medal at the London Olympics during the summer.

Sometimes it hinders our preparations but I can&apos;t do anything about it.&quot; Asked whether he feels the obligations are putting Daley&apos;s medal prospects at risk, Evangulov replied unequivocally: &quot;Yes, it does.&quot; Daley will compete in his first competition of the season next week, when he partners Pete Waterfield in the synchronised platform diving at the Fina World Cup in London. He currently has sponsorship deals with Adidas, Nestl\u00e9 and Mini, which have all launched Olympic promotions with him in recent months. For this talented young man, the hype and hoopla around his home Games are a boon, not a burden. Daley, 17, says that he wants to be a TV presenter when he has finished his diving career. He also disagrees with Evangulov that his media work has become a distraction. &quot;I don&apos;t think that is the case, because I don&apos;t do any media now that affects my training at all,&quot; he said. &quot;Leading into competition I am on complete media lock-down \u2013 I only have a media day that is organised through British Swimming, so literally I am not allowed to talk to anyone in the lead-in to big competitions. So it is definitely very controlled, now.&quot; Evangulov also warned that the British public are incorrect if they think Daley is certain to win an Olympic medal. &quot;The people in Great Britain are mistakenly convinced that he [Daley] is the best in the world, but he is not. He&apos;s very strong and he&apos;s one of the best, but he is not the\u00a0best.&quot; He went on to suggest that Daley&apos;s fifth-place finish at the World Championships in Shanghai last year is an accurate reflection of his position in the pecking order. &quot;Fifth. That really was his rating at that moment. We are working hard to try to raise his rating position.&quot; But not hard enough for the coach&apos;s liking. Evangulov believes the Chinese squad, which includes the world champion, Qiu Bo, are free of the distractions facing their British rival. &quot;If you look at the Chinese, they work three times harder. That&apos;s the only secret. Just work hard,&quot; Evangulov said. &quot;I know how the Chinese are training and they work much harder. If you compare them to Thomas, he has many commitments in his media activities. &quot;He&apos;s very active, not like the Chinese. The Chinese have restricted their divers and I support them on this. I would recommend Tom to make not so many commitments to the media.&quot; Evangulov has recently imposed a rule preventing the British squad from carrying out any media obligations in the two weeks before major competitions. However, the coach acknowledges that &quot;the popularity of diving in this country is very high thanks to Thomas Daley, because of these activities. If his performance in London is less than we expect, he&apos;s already done a good job because there are so many little kids who look upon Tom as a god&quot;. On the other hand, Evangulov firmly believes that &quot;it is also an obstacle for him to make more of his training&quot;. The coach said that he holds regular discussions with Daley&apos;s management about the appearances he makes. &quot;Every quarter, his agency send me his list of appearances for the next three months and I go through it with them and say: &apos;This is OK, this is OK, but this is not&apos;.&quot; Evangulov also suggested that Daley&apos;s victory at the 2009 World Championships, which sparked his popularity, was misleading because it had owed so much to the mistakes made by rivals. &quot;It wasn&apos;t the real thing. There were many coincidences. For instance, [Australia&apos;s] Matthew Mitcham dropped his dive and Qiu Bo dropped his dive as well.

And I&apos;m sure more people associate the term with him than have read &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;, the story in which it first appeared in 1981. It&apos;s a great word, so it&apos;s hardly surprising it was taken up to describe the virtual space of computer networks outside science fiction, a space now so real that the Pentagon recognises it as a fifth military domain (the other four being land, sea, air and outer space). In many ways, cyberspace as we know it isn&apos;t much like cyberspace as Gibson imagined it 30 years ago, but the resemblance is close enough for him to have acquired a reputation as a prophet of the information age. As the pieces gathered in Distrust That Particular Flavor make clear, it&apos;s not a reputation he&apos;s entirely comfortable with. In a talk he gave at Book Expo in New York in 2010, published here for the first time, he joked that Neuromancer has &quot;a complete absence of cellphones, which I&apos;m sure young readers assume must be a key plot point&quot; and pointed out that &quot;imaginary futures are always, regardless of what the author might think, about the day in which they&apos;re written. Orwell knew it, writing Nineteen Eighty-Four in 1948&quot; \u2013 the year, as it happens, that Gibson was born \u2013 &quot;and I knew it writing Neuromancer&quot;. Orwell is one of the acknowledged influences Gibson returns to repeatedly here. Others include HG Wells, Jorge Luis Borges and William Burroughs. There are also pieces on musicians (Steely Dan are described, not entirely convincingly, as &quot;among the most genuinely subversive oeuvres in late-20th-century pop&quot;) and visual artists, including Greg Girard, whose photographs of the demolition of old Shanghai and the &quot;shoals of cheap-ass concrete thunderheads&quot; being built in its place are &quot;almost more than I can bear to contemplate&quot;. &quot;I know little more about Shanghai than these images,&quot; Gibson writes, but there are other pieces here on cities he knows better: the ones he loves \u2013 Tokyo, London, New York \u2013 and one he loathes, Singapore, which he calls &quot;Disneyland with the death penalty&quot;. After Wired ran this article in 1993, the magazine joined the ranks of those banned by the Singaporean government, Gibson says in a short postscript. These brief afterwords \u2013 conversational, self-deprecating and no less thoughtful than the writing they comment on \u2013 are one of the collection&apos;s principal pleasures; many of the individual pieces, after all, are already available online. In 1989, Gibson wrote an article for Rolling Stone on the subject of &quot;the net&quot;: &quot;As a science-fiction writer, I&apos;m sometimes asked whether or not I think the net is a good thing.&quot; In the postscript to the piece in this volume, he writes: &quot;What I don&apos;t recall, quite, is what I would have imagined &apos;the net&apos; to be, at that point, however freely I tossed the term around for Rolling Stone.&quot; The piece includes two vivid memories from Gibson&apos;s childhood and youth: one of listening to Chubby Checker on a crystal &quot;Rocket Radio&quot;, which &quot;requires no battery at all&quot;, using &quot;a quarter mile of neighbour&apos;s rusting fence for an antenna&quot;; the other of finding &quot;60 feet of weirdly skinny magnetic tape snarled in roadside Ontario brush&quot;. He says more than once in the collection that he believes &quot;that all cultural change is essentially technology-driven&quot;. But as well as the pieces here on new technology \u2013 the internet, digital film \u2013 Gibson shows an abiding interest in old, obsolete or obsolescent technology (though it isn&apos;t true, he says, despite the many newspaper articles that repeat the assertion, that he still writes on a manual typewriter). The longest essay in the book, &quot;My Obsession&quot;, written for Wired in 1999, describes a year he spent in the late 1990s collecting mechanical watches, compulsively bidding for them on eBay. Part of their appeal lay in their being &quot;so brilliantly unnecessary. Any Swatch or Casio keeps better time,&quot; he writes. But &quot;the idea of the Collectible&quot;, he suggests, is a &quot;basic mammalian response to the bewildering flood of sheer stuff we\u00a0produce&quot;. A semi-autobiographical character in one of his early stories, &quot;The Winter Market&quot;, is an artist who works in &quot;garbage, kipple, refuse, the sea of cast-off goods our century floats on&quot;. The tension between the urge to accumulate stuff and the desire to escape from it is everywhere in Gibson&apos;s writing, fiction and non-fiction.

If I&apos;m known for anything, it&apos;s probably for that. I look back, when I have a moment, and feel a little astonished. It&apos;s been a steeplechase, beset with publishing uncertainties (will they? won&apos;t they? and if so, who?), but above all, in terms of the array of genre-obstacles. Novels, yes, early and late, and short stories, ditto; but also novellas (this during a period in which English and American readers have perhaps finally agreed to accept the existence of a shorter prose form); a book of reportage; and two collections of a type of thoughtfully florid journalism that even in German goes by a French name: feuilletons (little leaves, or little sheets), for which Roth&apos;s own understated definition was &quot;saying true things on half a page&quot;. And now I have edited and translated and footnoted \u2013 yes, above all, it seems, footnoted \u2013 a 500-page collection of his correspondence. Everything he wrote is worth my time and anyone&apos;s. I had as a model an outstanding book originally called Letters of Anton Chekhov from 1975, edited and translated by Simon Karlinsky and Michael Henry Heim, 185 letters filed away in 15 trim chapters. (Having that, I never saw a need to read a life of Chekhov, whom I revere.) With just four sprawling sections, and getting on for three times as many letters, I don&apos;t think my book is very close. At a little distance, Chekhov seems upright, decent, civilised, broad in his thinking and feeling; a letter from him is a balanced and considered document; if he goes on a bit, he sweetly apologises for it. He has leisure to think forward and back and sideways; he is the master of his (short) life, and sets his own terms, between Moscow and Yalta and Melikhovo, with literature his mistress and medicine his wife. Roth, meanwhile, even before the Nazi takeover of 1933 (or the derangement of his wife in 1928), was a man whose element was turbulence. He claims to have been an alcoholic from the age of eight. He lived out of two suitcases in six countries. His characteristic mode of progress was the somersault, his temperature generally off the scales. His letters burn off the page with intelligence and fury. Chekhov and Roth may both have died at the age of 44, and I love them both dearly, but there isn&apos;t otherwise much in common between them. Still, I like the idea of a sort of accidental biography, told in the subject&apos;s own words, the sort of book that isn&apos;t nine parts starch, that is always medias in res, and that doesn&apos;t begin with a date of birth or \u2013 like four suits of cards \u2013 four sets of forefathers. I also liked (as it turned out) the license offered me to pass commentary on things and people and events. It seems to me that footnoting must be at least as habit-forming as the growing of side-whiskers (with which PG Wodehouse so felt himself menaced). Certainly, I&apos;ve now knocked out getting on for a thousand of them, ranging from things I never knew and have already forgotten \u2013 as it were, barely opened parcels of information, indifferently passed on \u2013 to others that are old and personal and well-worn, and have a distinct reek of me. Roth&apos;s life \u2013 for which one novel title, Flight Without End, may serve \u2013 gave him no leisure to reflect. Once he returned from the war, in 1919, he wrote for the two decades that were left to him. Initially newspaper articles of the type described above \u2013 one every day, or every other day \u2013 and then quite soon books as well, one a year, or by the end, two. He was agonisingly, volcanically, insanely productive. The usual self-love of authors, the care with which they handle their own productions, is absent in him; when he refers to a book he&apos;s writing, it&apos;s usually to say he has three weeks to finish it in; often it&apos;s not even clear which book he means. Sometimes he asks to be sent copies of this or that title; he himself has none. He has the terrible fear that in the fiction he writes \u2013 not least to distract himself \u2013 in the 1930s, the shape of the habitual begging letter can be made out like a watermark. Life at the hot core of this production is a struggle, a fight. Roth can&apos;t afford a hotel room, and he hates domesticity. (&quot;I shit on furniture,&quot; he says.) He lives off his advances, advances and loans. He doesn&apos;t have a bank account. He needs money, yes for himself, but still more for others worse off. He writes on their behalf: a German doctor leaving Hamburg for Shanghai; a Polish seamstress who does outstanding work; an old regimental colleague facing deportation from Switzerland. Weimar Germany appals him, but he keeps having to go there, to write diagnostic articles on the provinces (the atmosphere like that &quot;five minutes before a pogrom&quot;) or simply to watch his back at the chaotic Frankfurter Zeitung. He needs money, but almost more he needs comfort, from his devoted, if perhaps not very good French translator, Blanche Gidon, and from his also devoted and certainly not very good Austrian colleague Stefan Zweig. Their letters urging him to buck up and dry out (also included) are, for Roth, the price of admission. Health comes into it, and far sooner than it should have done. Surely, like Byron, he would have claimed to be &quot;a hundred&quot;. He has problems with his skin, his eyes, his liver. His legs swell up and he can&apos;t walk. He can&apos;t keep any food down. He makes himself drink milk. The letters are ferocious, proud in their abjection, mixing begging with menaces and Cassandra-like warnings (how well he understood Prussia and les boches). I learned to see Roth as his own solar system: the sparkling asteroid belt of his articles; the calm, temperate, crystalline planets his novels (populated by crooks, by enviably stupid and surprisingly heroic officers and petty officials and by fickle and beguiling women), and then his actual molten, sun-spotted core, which flares nakedly in these letters. \u2022 Joseph Roth: A Life in Letters is published by Granta.

Al-Wahda are based in central Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates&apos; second most craningly hyper-modern city-state. Plonked with some bravura between the desert and the sea, Abu Dhabi is either a monument to what mankind can achieve with enough vision, concrete and cheap labour; or it is a spookily synthetic citadel to advanced consumption \u2013 an urge that has in recent times turned its gaze towards football. The Al-Nahyan is one of four major stadiums in Abu Dhabi, housing teams that compete in the UAE Pro-League. From a distance its floodlights appear in glimpses through gaps in the skyscrapers, a dizzyingly impressive spectacle that is consistent with an image of football in the Gulf that the world has largely settled on: a region of bottomless finances, ensnaring a roster of aging superstars, poised to tilt the football world on its axis through aggressive petrol-backed expansionism. The headline stories are well known. Earlier this year, Diego Maradona was paid an estimated $10m for his presence as manager and corporate factotum of Dubai&apos;s Al-Wasl. Last year, Sunderland accepted \u00a36m from Al Ain for the one-year loan of Asamoah Gyan. At the Al-Nahyan on Sunday night it is the turn of Luca Toni, 34-year-old World Cup winner with Italy, to make his full debut for Al-Nasr, who are managed by Azzurri legend Walter Zenga (for whom this would turn out to be a interesting night). Certainly the stadium is immaculate: impressively landscaped, heavily staffed and spankingly new in its marbled periphery. In fact, climbing the steps to the pitch via a luxurious media terrace lined with leatherette thrones it seems there is just one thing missing from the spectacle. Where, exactly, are all the people? For all its financial muscle, the UAE Pro League is an institution beset by growing pains. Maradona himself caused a bit of stir last week by threatening to quit Al\u2011Wasl over, of all things, a lack of funds. The following day a beaming El Diego appeared in the national press shaking hands with assorted bigwigs, having been granted &quot;personal sponsorship&quot; by the Saif Belhasa Group Of Companies. Maradona has now declared himself &quot;enthusiastic&quot; once again about the &quot;new dawn&quot; in Emirates football. Beyond this, the league itself is encouragingly local. Clubs can sign four foreign players, but only three are allowed on the field together, with the rest of the team made up of often part-time Emirati players. Mainly, though, the issue is paltry attendances, which have at times been rather desperately massaged. There are stories of fans being paid $10 to come in and cheer. Often half-time draws are staged giving away free iPads and the like: one match last season saw a Ferrari raffled off, for which a record (by miles) 15,000 crowd turned up. Ranged around the echoey concrete banks of the Al-Nahyan there are perhaps 1500 people. The most concentrated spot is a single bank of around 500 Al-Wahda ultras, who will keep up a brilliantly sonorous call-and-response chant throughout the game, and who even raise a sarcastic cheer as Toni emerges before kick off to warm up gingerly in the fragrant desert winter air. Despite having scored on his debut as a substitute last week, Toni starts the match jogging around like a man recently dragged out of his hot tub. There are some eye-catching contributions. Al-Wahda&apos;s Ismail Matar, quick and skilful, is a candidate for best current Emirati player. Fernando Baiano, a hulking half-speed Brazilian, glides about like a geriatric killer whale cruising the shallows, and at one point sets up Toni for a tap-in, which is rustily fluffed. Indeed the Italian spends much of the match in the familiar postures of head in hands, arms outstretched, fingers clenched in pleading gestures. In his highly professional berating of the referee, there is at least a patina of big-football authenticity, a display of elite whinging that is worth the admission money alone. Al-Wahda open the scoring with a brilliant long-range goal from Hugo, another Brazilian, and by half-time the game has settled into an energetic affair of roughly League One standard. It is all pleasant, if perhaps slightly puzzling. The main question, being: why is this all happening? The Emirates is not alone. China and India have also concocted recent big-money football leagues. No doubt football&apos;s prominence in these newly emerged economies is in part a symptom of the growth of wealth. Much like the entrepreneurs of Europe&apos;s industrial revolution, the Emiratis are using their carbon wealth to construct an imperious infrastructure of their own, part of the grander project of building a service and leisure economy to sustain this desert state when the heavy industry runs out. It is perhaps a little different in China, where the Chinese Super League (home of Nicolas Anelka&apos;s Shanghai Shenhua) is supported by an economy that continues to grow feverishly. Attracting top players has still proved difficult, though, while the Indian Premier League, due to start in march, has its own problems with regulation and stadium availability \u2013 bad news for Fabio Cannavaro, Hern\u00e1n Crespo and Robbie Fowler, all of whom cut a dash at the recent auction. One of the main problems is the bolt-on nature of the new competitions. India already has a long-standing football league: the IPL is simply a glitzy invasion hovering right on top of this substructure. The Russian Premier League, founded 10 years ago, has more in the way of big-time tradition to support it, albeit the major fiscal power in the region, Anzhi Makhachkala, are Europe&apos;s most notable carbon-funded upstart. Last week Anzhi appointed Guus Hiddink as their manager, giving him the chance to work with the world&apos;s highest paid player, Samuel Eto&apos;o. At the Al-Nahyan, the second half provides more entertainment. Toni spends most if it being barracked by the home fans (&quot;Sleep Toni. Sleep my friend,&quot; is the call), but his team-mates compete energetically and salvage a draw. The most entertaining moments come in the post-match press conference, where for the first time the rather shaky nature of the Pro League infrastructure pokes through. First, the venerable Josef Hickersberger, the manager of Al-Wahda, apologises after he was sent to the stands in the second half for remonstrating on the touchline: &quot;This is my fault. I must understand the standard of the referees here.&quot; Then Zenga has what can only be described as an incredible post-match meltdown. Shaven-headed and discreetly tattooed, Zenga is an imposing figure who has elevated Al-Nasr to title chasers. He is also, frankly, a little on the edge. Asked by a local journalist to explain his defensive tactics, Zenga&apos;s response sends his questioner scurrying from the press room. He is first abusive: &quot;This is a stupid question;&quot; and then eye-poppingly intimidating: &quot;You are nobody. You are nothing.&quot; After which the questions are fairly mild. It is at least a moment of widescreen passion in the managed environment of the Pro League, with its minibus-level fanbase, its history of mercenary 34-year-olds (David Trezeguet was a notable disaster) and its encouraging roster of eager locals. Perhaps Emirates football will still realise its grand project. For now this is a football culture struggling to sprout roots in the desert.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-18T22:54:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/18/synchronised-diving-tom-daley-olympics", "sentences": ["The last time Daley and Waterfield competed together at a major event, the world championships in Shanghai last July, they finished a disappointing sixth after Waterfield was struck down with flu-like symptoms days before the final."], "title": "Diver Tom Daley optimistic of synchronised success at London Olympics", "article": "Tom Daley is confident he and diving partner Pete Waterfield can win a medal at London 2012 despite a lack of practice and preparation ahead of their first competition of the Olympic season this coming week.

Daley and Waterfield have developed a strong partnership since making their competitive debut in January 2011, the highlight being the gold they won at the Diving World Series in Sheffield last April, but there are fears they will not be at their peak come the Olympics due to a lack of time spent together on the boards, mainly due to illness and injury. The last time Daley and Waterfield competed together at a major event, the world championships in Shanghai last July, they finished a disappointing sixth after Waterfield was struck down with flu-like symptoms days before the final.

The 17-year-old, who missed the British Gas National Cup in Southend last month in order to rest an injured thumb, says: &quot;I think we are doing well at the moment, we haven&apos;t trained synchro together because of injury and things like that but we are back together now and it is like we haven&apos;t been apart.

We are going to prepare to the best of our ability and go in there with the crowd behind us. Hopefully that will give us the second wind to do the best we can.&quot; The 30-year-old speaks from experience, having won silver alongside Leon Taylor at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. It was a moment Daley, despite being only 10 years old at the time, remembers well. &quot;I was at my caravan in Newquay and I was struggling to get a signal,&quot; he says. &quot;I had to sit there with the aerial, holding it, to get a reception.

How to differentiate form and evolve the source material while maintaining consistency, coherency and respect? Certainly, you can count on a fanbase that will scrutinise your every move, splintering yet further as you introduce new ideas and creases that impact upon that unblemished view of the original. It&apos;s a challenge Richard Morgan knows only too well. For four years the science fiction author has been working with Starbreeze Studios to create the narrative for Syndicate, a reboot of the 1993 classic PC strategy game. Set in a cyberpunk world, Syndicate is only the second video game that Morgan, who has written novels, comics and screenplays, has worked on. His other game project, Crysis 2, had no grand fiction to adhere to, so how has he found approaching a property with such a fanatical, vociferous following? &quot;We had the IP bible for the original Syndicate on hand for reference when we were putting together our 2069 world and its assumptions, and there was a conscious effort to include elements from that stock that fans of the original game would recognise,&quot; he explains. &quot;For example, you&apos;ll find yourself playing as an agent for EuroCorp, one of the syndicates from the original game, and behaving pretty much the way you&apos;d expect an agent from the original game to behave. Fans of the old game are certainly going to recognise the furniture and they&apos;ll see some legacy pieces in freshly minted action too.&quot; Morgan has been working on the game&apos;s script since 2008, flying out to Starbreeze&apos;s offices in Stockholm on a regular basis for meetings to ensure the storyline synchs with level design and gameplay requirements or writing from home. &quot;What needs saying, I think, is that the underlying theme of the original Syndicate is one which transcends the game itself and stands alone as a classic concern of the science fiction genre in general,&quot; he says. &quot;Syndicate borrowed from an existing memeplex of cyberpunk-derived ideas \u2013 corporate power unleashed, the death of government, biotech-enhanced operatives, warfare over data and elite data specialists, alienating night-time cityscapes, ordinary humans as disposable chaff. The reboot has all of this and more, and for a very simple reason \u2013 we&apos;re not just rebooting Syndicate, we&apos;re mining the very same memeplex the original game fed off. My mandate was simply to do something powerful with that.&quot; That &quot;memeplex&quot; as Morgan puts it, continues to be one of the most enduring in science fiction. What is the ongoing appeal of cyberpunk? &quot;Cyberpunk brought two definable things to the table in science fiction \u2013 a current of underbelly noir borrowed more or less wholesale from the American hardboiled tradition and an understanding that the future was going to be primarily about the exploration of inner, not outer, space. The latter remains a truth today and doesn&apos;t look like changing any time soon; and noir has always told the truth about the human condition \u2013 to wit, that humans are a dodgy lot, corruption is an endemic social dynamic and it all ends in tears. Now, with that much truth on its side, how could cyberpunk (and its derivatives) not endure?&quot; For Morgan, it&apos;s this exploration of the fundamental truths of our today that have attracted him to dystopian worlds, and to Syndicate&apos;s universe in particular. &quot;The main appeal is that dystopias are an honest extrapolation from the truth of the societies we live in today,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, for you and I, the early 21st century may not feel all that dystopian, but try being a sweatshop peon in a Shanghai enterprise zone, an east European sex slave, or a migrant worker without papers in southern California. Dystopia is the world we choose not to see, curled up in the corner of our peripheral vision and snarling quietly. Dystopia is the acknowledgment of what we are as humans, minus a bankrupt rightwing belief in the validity of existing hierarchy. Which, of course, makes dystopian fiction an immensely powerful tool for social critique. If Dickens were alive today, I&apos;m pretty sure he&apos;d be writing cyberpunk of some sort \u2013 he&apos;d have seen the potential and leapt on it.&quot; Syndicate is the second blockbuster game that Morgan has worked on in as many years. What&apos;s the appeal? &quot;Novel writing tends to be a fairly staid and lonely business \u2013 you sit in your room and type, you sit in your room and type \u2013 whereas game writing is endlessly collaborative and very dynamic; you&apos;re in and out of meetings all the time, knocking ideas back and forth with other members of the team, and the landscape is constantly changing as the game evolves. It&apos;s very much an experience in staying fresh, and I value that immensely. An obligation to stay fresh is something I think all writers need.&quot; Of course, while working in video games may gift a writer a fresh approach, this kind of collaboration also comes with sacrifices, not least in bowing to the demands of gameplay designers. &quot;The terrain is very changeable; as the game iterates, you find yourself having to rejig, abandon or reinvent to suit. It&apos;s a very organic process and the challenge is to stay flexible, to be able to evaluate the evolving value of your material, but not to get too precious about any particular element.&quot; &quot;But the real key to writing well for a game is to understand and accept that the story is a support structure for the gameplay, and not the other way around. You could have the greatest story in the world set up, but if it cripples the gameplay dynamics then it&apos;s still going to make for a shit game. Accepting that fact requires, for a storyteller from any other medium, an exercise in careful humility \u2013 which can in itself be an interesting challenge.&quot;", "tags": ["Games", "PC", "Shoot 'em ups", "PS3", "Technology", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-21T12:38:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/feb/22/andre-villas-boas-chelsea", "sentences": ["The Ivorian, who will almost certainly be heading for Shanghai after his contract expires this summer, was given the captain&apos;s armband, an implied endorsement of the geeing-up he gave his team-mates against Birmingham at the weekend."], "title": "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas contemplates a Chelsea ruin in the shadow of Pompeii | Richard Williams", "article": "If Vesuvius had erupted during the match and sent its molten lava rolling down the hillside to engulf the old San Paolo stadium, the archaeologists of a future generation might have unearthed the remains of a youngish man, charred scraps of a rather fussy belted raincoat clinging to a corpse frozen for all time in a strangely contorted position, perhaps crouched down on its haunches, its hands fashioning an urgent gesticulation. The historians would have noted the anguish on the man&apos;s features and assumed it to be the result of the shock and pain caused by the lava flood, like the victims in nearby Pompeii almost 2,000 years ago. They would be wrong. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas&apos;s pain was all caused by his football team, or rather his difficulty in making his players function according to his blueprint. In their 3-1 defeat at the hands of Napoli, at least Chelsea were not as utterly hopeless as another London side in a different part of Italy last week. Chelsea scored an away goal, one which may yet turn out to be significant, although you would not rate their chances of turning the tie round much very higher than Arsenal&apos;s, given the counterattacking skills of Napoli&apos;s Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi, the scorers of all the home side&apos;s goals. Now Villas-Boas will have to beware the Ides of March. On 14 March, the eve of the Ides, his team face Napoli again in the return leg, and in the view of much of the outside world he now has exactly 90 minutes to save his &quot;project&quot; and prove to the many sceptics that, at 34 years old and with very little serious experience, he is capable of managing a side at this level. Failure would make the following morning&apos;s conversation with Roman Abramovich a very difficult one. Naturally Villas-Boas leavened his disappointment with a reaffirmation of his belief in the three-year plan undertaken at the owner&apos;s behest. In his eyes, the club&apos;s vision of a fresh future remains undimmed. &quot;We have our idea very focused on the future,&quot; he said, &quot;but we have to understand that we are committed to the present.&quot; The names on the team sheet suggested that he was prepared to gamble continued progress in this season&apos;s Champions League on his desire to continue the process of weeding out some of the squad&apos;s senior figures. With John Terry ruled out on Monday night and Ashley Cole relegated to the bench, with only two days&apos; training after returning from a calf strain, the manager made the resonant decision to leave another vastly experienced England international among the substitutes. Frank Lampard would not have taken easily to the idea of being demoted in favour of Florent Malouda, whose form this season has been so consistently dismal that most of the fans at Stamford Bridge cannot wait to see the back of him. By contrast with Lampard, who always expects to be picked, Fernando Torres probably saw it coming. His lamentable scoring record gave him no right to expect a starting place in a match so important to the club&apos;s short-term prospects and Didier Drogba&apos;s return from the Africa Cup of Nations made it logical for the Spanish forward to stand down. The Ivorian, who will almost certainly be heading for Shanghai after his contract expires this summer, was given the captain&apos;s armband, an implied endorsement of the geeing-up he gave his team-mates against Birmingham at the weekend. All day the schoolchildren of Naples had been parading the streets of the old city in masks and costumes to celebrate Carnevale, and their footballers started the match as if they were planning to confirm the impression they made on Manchester City by enjoying a pre-Lenten feast of attacking football and goals. Although they allowed their visitors to take an early lead, the three goals they went on to score constituted a restatement of the qualities they showed against the Premier League leaders earlier in the season. Chelsea&apos;s rearguard, with the untempered combination of David Luiz and Gary Cahill at its heart, were never up to coping with the combination of Cavani and Lavezzi. Napoli may be lying only sixth in Serie A, with a mere nine wins in 24 matches this season, but El Matador and El Pocho (or Tubby, as Lavezzi is known) tend to make the most of the scope offered them by English\u00a0defences. Villas-Boas could take a little comfort from his side&apos;s spirit, which was certainly superior to Arsenal&apos;s, but the decision to invite Lampard to start the game on the bench will be closely scrutinised and heavily criticised. The manager suggested that he had done it because he needed two primarily defensive midfielders in front of the back four, yet Napoli had enough chances to double their score. &quot;Whatever the explanation, it would be fantastic if we won the game,&quot; the manager said in words that could one day provide the epitaph for his time at Chelsea. &quot;Any explanation now is useless, given the result.&quot;", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Napoli", "Football", "Champions League 2011-12", "Champions League", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-22T00:39:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/22/paul-mason-top-10-books-china", "sentences": ["Sisters and Strangers: Women in the Shanghai Cotton Mills, 1919-1949 by Emily HonigA sidelong glimpse into the lost world of inter-war Shanghai."], "title": "Paul Mason's top 10 books about China", "article": "Paul Mason is the BBC&apos;s Newsnight economics editor.

Big Breasts and Wide Hips by Mo YanThis is Mo&apos;s masterpiece: China&apos;s 20th century told symbolically through the story of one man, from birth to maturity; an adult who cannot wean himself from his mother&apos;s milk, assailed by wave upon wave of misfortune, poverty, war, imprisonment and finally release into the grubby capitalism of the 1990s. Mo Yan&apos;s China is a world of magic, sexual exploitation, ignorance and senseless violence. 3. Soul Mountain by Gao XingjianThis fictionalised memoir of a journey down the Yangtse River was acclaimed as a landmark in Chinese literature when he won the Nobel prize in 2000. It&apos;s a novel of introspection and loneliness. Gao&apos;s plays have been banned from performance after the authorities condemned his drama about the Tiananmen Square massacre as &quot;a fabrication&quot; on the grounds that he had not been there at the time. 4. The Plum in the Golden Vase (translated by David Tod Roy)This classical novel has spent much of the time since 1610 on the banned list, as pornographic. For once, the censors may have a point. It&apos;s a novel of manners, set amongst noblemen and concubines, which makes Fanny Hill look Presbyterian and the artefacts available in Anne Summers look distinctly unimaginative. You can trace the influence right through to modern Chinese fiction \u2026 5. Wang in Love and Bondage by Xiaobo Wang\u2026 for example. Wang, who died in 1997, and was modern China&apos;s Genet. Haunted by his suffering during the Cultural Revolution, Wang&apos;s fiction is, well, strange: gay sadomasochism, casual satire against the state, surreal sex. When his character Wang, and paramour Chen, write a confession of their secret love affair, Wang admits his lover &quot;looked like a koala bear. She admitted she was very excited that night and really felt like a koala bear.&quot; So it goes. 6. The Penguin History of Modern China by Jonathan FenbyJonathan Fenby&apos;s scholarly volume manages to escape the biggest pitfall of contemporary history writing about China, which is anachronism. Too many studies see the modern, stagnant polity and deferential culture as simply the return of normality in China, after an interruption that began on May Fourth 1919 and ended with the death of Mao. Fenby tells it as a story of modernity and democracy - attempted and defeated. 7. Tiananmen Moon: Inside the Chinese Student Uprising of 1989 by Philip CunninghamThis memoir of the 1989 student rebellion captures the senseless beauty of the rebellion from close up: Cunningham was a foreign student freelancing for the BBC, who knew many of the protesters and witnessed the main events. As events spiral out of control, his prose becomes filmic, poetic, disturbed. 8. Chinese Whispers: The True Story Behind Britain&apos;s Hidden Army of Labour by Hsiao-Hung PaiInvestigative journalist Hsiao-Hung documents the lives of Chinese migrant workers in the UK, prey to a vivid, near surreal panoply of gangsters, traffickers, pimps and middlemen whose defining feature is that they appear to be invisible to the British authorities. She explains the push factor too: writing with brutal honesty about conditions for Chinese workers in the PRC, and the criminal networks all too ready to offer the solution of semi-slavery in Europe. 9. Chinese Reportage: The Aesthetics of Historical Experience by Charles A LaughlinIn the 1930s, China seemed headed for democracy, national liberation and modernity. On the periphery of Chinese communism and liberalism a strong tradition of reportage journalism developed, represented above all by Mao Dun, the Chinese Orwell. By the time Orwell got to Wigan Pier, dozens of Chinese writers had already journeyed to the depths of industrial squalor. Their work is intelligently explained and translated here by Yale professor Charles Laughlin. 10. Sisters and Strangers: Women in the Shanghai Cotton Mills, 1919-1949 by Emily HonigA sidelong glimpse into the lost world of inter-war Shanghai. While Hollywood stars and jazz legends cavorted on the neon-lit river-front, the largely female factory workforce did something their great grand-daughters are still not able to: formed unions, marched out on strike and, temporarily, seized power. This (1986) study is part of a canon of Chinese social history rediscovered by western scholars.", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "History", "Politics", "Culture", "Newsnight"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-22T10:49:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/23/english-heritage-objection-liverpool-development", "sentences": ["It features thousands of flats and hundreds of offices, hotels and bars, as well as the 55-storey Shanghai Tower and other skyscrapers.", "It adds: &quot;The scale of the development will compromise and unbalance the historic urban landscape of Liverpool as a whole.&quot; The heritage organisation also points out that there is a lack of clarity in what the Shanghai Tower development will involve, as there are contradictions within Peel Holdings&apos; plans.", "Peel Holdings has previously agreed to scale down the height of the Shanghai Tower to address heritage concerns."], "title": "English Heritage lodge formal objection to Liverpool waterfront development", "article": "English Heritage has lodged a number of objections to a skyscraper plan for Liverpool&apos;s waterfront a month after Unesco inspectors warned the development threatened the city&apos;s world heritage status. Peel Holdings, owner of the Manchester Ship Canal and former owner of the Trafford Centre in Manchester, wants to develop a swath of disused dockland containing a multitude of historic buildings as part of its multibillion-pound Liverpool Waters scheme. It features thousands of flats and hundreds of offices, hotels and bars, as well as the 55-storey Shanghai Tower and other skyscrapers. The scheme envisages two clusters of tall buildings, one near the city centre and a second further north. But English Heritage has written to Liverpool city council expressing its concerns that a secondary cluster of tall buildings at Clarence Dock will introduce a large and strong vertical form that will &quot;overwhelm the historic, horizontal character of the docklands generally&quot;. The density of development, the mass and scale of the waterfront blocks and the height and scale of the tall buildings &quot;will divorce, rather than connect, the two main parts of the Stanley Dock character area of the world heritage site&quot;, English Heritage argues. It believes the development will prevent an appreciation of the relationship between the docks and river that is essential to an understanding of the site. Furthermore, it says the development will detract from the historical primacy of the Pier Head buildings and will harm the setting of the Stanley Dock warehouses by largely obscuring them. It adds: &quot;The scale of the development will compromise and unbalance the historic urban landscape of Liverpool as a whole.&quot; The heritage organisation also points out that there is a lack of clarity in what the Shanghai Tower development will involve, as there are contradictions within Peel Holdings&apos; plans. Henry Owen-John, planning director, north-west, for English Heritage said: &quot;One of the things that we&apos;re anxious to make clear is that while we have serious problems with the effect on the world heritage status these proposals will have, we&apos;re also aware of the significant benefits delivered, particularly a programme that would drive jobs and growth \u2026 &quot;We&apos;re not actually specifically asking for the application to be called in [to the secretary of state]; we&apos;re asking he look at it and consider the issues on all the planning issues.&quot; English Heritage believes it is possible to find a compromise that does not mean the city will lose its world heritage status. The world heritage status inscription describes Liverpool as the &quot;supreme example of a commercial port at the time of Britain&apos;s greatest global influence&quot;. English Heritage says the dockland landscape bears testimony to this international significance. Owen-John said it was disappointing that after four years of detailed discussion, &quot;we still have a scheme that harms heritage&quot;. When the Unesco inspectors visited the city in November, their report concluded that the waterfront would be &quot;irreversibly damaged&quot; unless urgent modifications were made to the Liverpool Waters scheme. The delegation warned the skyscraper proposal would result in a &quot;serious loss of historic authenticity&quot;. The inspectors praised the more or less symmetrical profile of the city&apos;s waterfront with the Three Graces \u2013 the Port of Liverpool and the Liver and Cunard buildings \u2013 at centre stage and historical docklands to the north complementing those to the south. The Graces were &quot;at the heart of the shipping and harbour operations during the height of [Liverpool&apos;s] glory, surrounded by dockyards and port structure&quot;, it said. The \u00a35.5bn Peel Holdings scheme has been a source of controversy and English Heritage has been in talks with the developer for four years attempting to find a compromise. But Unesco did not spell out what would happen to the city&apos;s world heritage status if no changes were made to the project. It had been feared the report would recommend removing the status if the scheme was given planning permission, but it did not go that far. Peel Holdings has previously agreed to scale down the height of the Shanghai Tower to address heritage concerns. Liverpool city council&apos;s planning committee will consider the proposal on 6 March. Joe Anderson, the leader of Liverpool city council, has previously indicated that he welcomed the Unesco report&apos;s findings and was pressing for a compromise that would enable Liverpool Waters to go ahead. He regards the plans as vital for the future of what is one of the poorest areas of the country. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 February 2012.

This symbol of the capital was retired in 2005 and consigned to a ghoulish afterlife on countless mugs and T-shirts. Mayor Boris Johnson pledged to bring it back, and so he has. Our mayor may have no strategic vision for the city, but he has a talent for the popular gesture \u2013 and Routemaster II is one. Being able to hop on and off the back of an open bus is a Londoner&apos;s birthright, he might argue, so get hopping. But what is more encouraging about this move is the demonstrative return of good design to the capital&apos;s infrastructure. It is not until you&apos;ve taken a ride on the new Routemaster that you become fully aware of how unlovely our current fleet of buses is. For years now, they have been produced by manufacturers whose only imperatives were cost, and satisfying a growing pile of regulations. It&apos;s no wonder that stepping on to one is like entering an A&amp;E ward: bright orange handrails everywhere, fluorescent strip lighting, baby blue flooring and a fibreglass interior that erupts into mysterious bulges in awkward places. There is nothing to be fond of. By contrast, the original Routemaster, designed in 1954 to replace the trolley buses, remains full of rich associations for Londoners. Many of them will no doubt have sentimental memories of smoking on the upper deck or canoodling in the love seat by the staircase. So is this &quot;new bus for London&quot; a nostalgic throwback? Surprisingly not. It is a state-of-the-art workhorse designed to drive one of the busiest routes in the city \u2013 the number 38 from Victoria to Hackney. It may look like it&apos;s for sightseeing but it&apos;s built for rush hours.     The ribbon window follows the path of the two staircases, making them bright and open spaces.  Photograph: TfL    Transport for London describe this as the first bus designed for London in 50 years. What they mean is that, while London-style buses are used country-wide, no other city in the UK faces the same heavy usage as the number 38. There are three doors, including the open platform at the rear, to facilitate quick entry and exit. In other words, this is bespoke for London in a way that the Mercedes bendy buses (axed by Boris) were not, as they ill-suited the capital&apos;s often narrow, windy streets. The concept designer of the new bus is Thomas Heatherwick, working closely with Wrightbus, its manufacturer. When he appeared on the scene in the late 1990s he was instantly cast as a British engineering genius, the creator of weird, wonderful structures such as the UK pavilion for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. Undeniably inventive, his work has sometimes erred on the side of the self-indulgent. I must confess that when I first saw his new bus, with its ribbon window winding up the rear and side, I feared the worst. It seemed just the kind of silly styling I might have expected. But in fact it merely follows the path of the two staircases, making them bright and open spaces. Heatherwick says he wanted to expose the circulation of people around the bus just as you might in a glass-fronted building, and it&apos;s a compelling idea.     The bus offers better views than any before it.  Photograph: TfL    This design is one of very few fanciful notions. The side of the rear staircase is styled with a self-conscious glamour, but other than that, almost every feature of the bus is subject to some regulation or other. Within those strictures, Heatherwick has done an admirable job of making this a stately vehicle. He talks about restoring some of the &quot;grandeur&quot; and &quot;dignity&quot; of riding a London bus, qualities that &quot;had evaporated in the name of pragmatism&quot;. And I must say that, riding at the front of the top deck, one does have a sense of privilege. It&apos;s not just that this bus offers better views than any before it (except the roofless kind), it&apos;s the feeling that every detail has been designed with care. The way the ceiling is moulded and the way the interior is softly lit with LED spotlights almost suggest a plane cabin rather than a bus. With its hybrid engine, it is also quieter than other buses, and much more fuel efficient. Heatherwick has reintroduced the bench seat of old, but with individual cushions in a bespoke livery. Bus and Tube liveries are part of the visual language of London, and pattern recognition is one of the subconscious rhythms of its commuter life. An experienced citizen can tell what line they&apos;re on just from the seat covers. Designed to hide dirt, just like all the others, Heatherwick&apos;s is one for the digital age, highlighting the contours of the cushion just as a computer modelling programme might.     The new design is spacious and efficient.  Photograph: TfL     Such details aside, what is most impressive about this bus is how spacious and efficient it is. I assumed that the rounded roof was a reference to the original Routemaster&apos;s shape, but it turns out that it&apos;s a way of reducing the vehicle&apos;s perceived mass \u2013 this bus is 3m longer than the original, and 1m longer than recent ones. Couple that extra size with two staircases and three doors, and passengers should find it much less of a squeeze. The Routemaster II will also bring the return of the conductor, to oversee the use of the much-vaunted open platform. But since conductors will only patrol the bus during the daytime, the open platform will alas be shut behind perspex doors at night. Only eight of these buses will be in operation by the summer time. With an overall budget of \u00a38m, the tabloid press is predictably whingeing about them costing \u00a31m each. The other way of looking at it is that, amazingly, Transport for London is investing money in research and development instead of just taking whatever manufacturers give them. From here on, it won&apos;t cost much more to build one of this new breed than it does to build a boxy competitor. Whether or not the order is given to put them into production will come down to politics. In May we may have a new mayor and a new agenda. If Ken Livingstone wins, he shouldn&apos;t write this off as one of Boris&apos;s whims but embrace it as an investment in the daily life of Londoners.", "tags": ["Design", "Art and design", "London", "Road transport", "Transport", "Boris Johnson", "UK news", "Thomas Heatherwick"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-23T11:23:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/23/tom-daley-peter-waterfield-diving", "sentences": ["This was the first time the pair had been able to dive competitively together since the world championships in Shanghai last July."], "title": "Tom Daley and Peter Waterfield leave huge room for improvement", "article": "Tom Daley received the full support of his synchronised diving partner Peter Waterfield on Thursday night after the pair finished a disappointing seventh at the Fina World Cup, a week after British Swimming&apos;s performance director had criticised the 17-year-old for supposedly taking on too many media commitments. Alexei Evangulov had suggested Daley was getting distracted from his diving, claiming his Chinese rivals were working &quot;three times harder&quot;, but Waterfield dismissed the notion that this had been a factor. &quot;We didn&apos;t miss a dive because Tom&apos;s done too much media, we missed a dive because we&apos;ve had setbacks with injuries at the beginning of the year,&quot; said Waterfield. A thumb complaint hindered Daley&apos;s training last month and his partner was able to resume his weightlifting programme only at the end of the same month following a back and side injury suffered in December. This was the first time the pair had been able to dive competitively together since the world championships in Shanghai last July. Daley insisted that Evangulov&apos;s comments had not played on his mind going into this competition. &quot;Not at all, because I know that I&apos;ve been putting in all the hours that I can,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously the preparations for me for this competition haven&apos;t been great because my thumb&apos;s been injured \u2026Alexei had an interview and that was it. He knows the amount of training that I&apos;m doing and he knows I&apos;m doing as much as I can. I&apos;m pushing myself as hard as I can go without my body breaking.&quot; In truth there were reasons for the British pair to be encouraged by their performance at Stratford&apos;s Olympic Aquatics Centre despite their final standing. After struggling through the morning&apos;s preliminary session \u2013 to the extent that their participation in Thursday night&apos;s final was far from assured going into their final dive \u2013 the evening brought drastic improvement. Going into their penultimate dive, Daley and Waterfield sat third on the leaderboard. At that point, though, they contrived to undo their good work with a disastrous effort. Attempting a highly challenging forward four and a half somersaults, the pair lost synchronisation and each entered the water clumsily. Both scored poorly on their individual ratings but Daley particularly so, receiving just 3.5 out of 10 from two out of three judges. &quot;The start of my dive felt really good but as I went to grab my hand I just missed it and when you do that you make a big splash,&quot; explained Waterfield of his contribution to the attempt. Daley had known his own dive was going wrong from the very beginning. &quot;I was cramped in the run-up because I took too big a step at the start and when you&apos;re cramped at the end of the board, if you still go for it, there&apos;s a chance that you miss the end of the board and you slip. I didn&apos;t really want to take that chance. You have to balance it between going for it and maybe risking that or going for it and making sure that you land in the water safely.&quot; The disappointment was palpable among an approximately 3,000-strong, vocal crowd. Their hopes had been raised by an almost flawless reverse three and a half somersault by Daley and Waterfield \u2013 a dive which the Chinese pairing of Yuan Cao and Yanquan Zhang, who had led the final from the outset after dominating the preliminaries, later performed rather less impressively at the end of the same round. Daley had been accused of trying to &quot;have his cake and eat it&quot; by the Australian diver Matthew Mitcham this week after a statement was released on his behalf rejecting Evangulov&apos;s claim that he was taking on too many commitments but agreeing with the suggestion that public expectations that he should triumph in 2012 may be unrealistic given the form of China&apos;s divers. On Thursday Daley seemed perplexed by Mitcham&apos;s comments. &quot;I don&apos;t actually really understand what that means,&quot; said Daley. &quot;But no, I just do everything the way I do it because I enjoy diving and I enjoy working with the media and everything like that. With diving it&apos;s an on-the-day sport but the Chinese obviously do well on most days. At the moment in syncro it&apos;s theirs to throw away in the Olympics because they&apos;re really up there.&quot; Certainly that was true here, with Cao and Zhang&apos;s final score of 481.29 leaving them 21.12 ahead of Mexico&apos;s second-placed pairing of Iv\u00e1n Alejandro Garc\u00eda and Germ\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez. Germany&apos;s Patrick Hausding and Sascha Klein took bronze. Daley and Waterfield finished 61.32 points behind the leaders. &quot;I think there&apos;s a bit of both,&quot; said Daley when asked if he left feeling more encouraged than disappointed \u2013 their final score having at least been higher than the one they posted in finishing sixth at the world championships. &quot;Me and Pete are competitors, we&apos;re athletes, we want to go into every competition and win. But that&apos;s not the reality \u2026 Our reverse three-and-a-half [somersault] might have been the best reverse three-and-a-half in that competition.

It was 1966; the artist was eight; and he had learned, to his shock, that his kindly young teacher was the daughter of a landlord \u2013 an enemy of the people. Outraged, he drew a hideous caricature and pinned it to the blackboard. When Miss Liu entered the classroom, &quot;She turned pale but didn&apos;t say a word,&quot; he said. She had good reason to be frightened. The Cultural Revolution was at its height, and across China teachers, former landlords and intellectuals were being humiliated, beaten and murdered. They were hounded by neighbours, colleagues and pupils moved by misguided revolutionary fervour, personal grudges or little more than whim. Friends, children and spouses turned on them. By the time the chaos subsided 10 years later, an estimated 36 million had been persecuted and at least 750,000 were dead in the countryside alone. Red Guards had smashed up temples, burned books and destroyed historical treasures. Universities had closed and pupils missed years of schooling. Even Communist party historians describe it as a disaster, unleashed by Mao Zedong. But their terse verdict is designed to pre-empt, rather than encourage, debate. An event that defines China to this day \u2013 that helps to explain its fixation with political stability; its dramatic economic reforms; even, some say, its increased individualism \u2013 remains largely taboo. Xu, now 53, is among the handful daring their country to confront its past. The faces of the Cultural Revolution are captured in the immense black-and-white portraits stacked in his Beijing studio. Each standing 2.5m tall, they are both personal and powerful, demanding attention. The monochrome oils are in stark contrast to the garish colours of 60s propaganda.           Some of Xu&apos;s subjects were victims, some perpetrators. Many were both. Mao is there, as is his infamous wife Jiang Qing; so are unknown scholars and Red Guards. It has taken the artist five years to complete this series of just over 100 paintings. But it is work he has been preparing for all his life. &quot;I feel they are related to that first portrait,&quot; Xu says. &quot;I feel guilty [about my teacher]; but it also helps me to understand\u2026 People who were close to you \u2013 who were friendly and kind \u2013 could suddenly turn upon you.&quot; The theory was that creative destruction would eradicate old habits and ideas, transforming a struggling country. More urgently, the disastrous Great Leap Forward and Khrushchev&apos;s fall in the Soviet Union impelled Mao to see off rivals and critics. His heir apparent Liu Shaoqi was one of many to die in disgrace. The violence shook every strata of society and rippled out to the farthest corners of the country. Teenagers and youths were encouraged to attack fellow citizens. More than one observer has compared the anarchy to Lord Of The Flies. &quot;It&apos;s very, very vivid,&quot; Xu says. &quot;I remember all the demonstrations and public denunciations; people breaking pictures and smashing Buddhas. At the beginning, people were using bricks or wooden rods and metal bars to hurt people. We could hear gunshots at night and people were beaten to death.&quot; His hometown in Xinjiiang was far from the worst affected. In Chongqing, rival factions battled with guns and tanks. In Guangxi, there are accounts of cannibalism. Victims were condemned as &quot;monsters and freaks&quot;; Xu&apos;s response is not to demonise their accusers, but to approach each subject with the same neutral gaze. &quot;Even if they are bad people, they are still people. I have to respect them,&quot; he says. As a child he, too, believed the Cultural Revolution was &quot;a great thing, a right thing, and something we must do&quot;. In retrospect, the movement was not just horrific but often ludicrous in its paranoia: the most &quot;sinister&quot; aspect of one supposed conspiracy, notes the book Mao&apos;s Last Revolution, was that even some of its core members appeared unaware of its existence. China&apos;s current leaders undoubtedly understand the damage; several of their parents suffered, even died. But a fuller reckoning of events \u2013 and Mao&apos;s role \u2013 would risk undermining the party&apos;s hold on power. &quot;In textbooks this long period of history is described with one sentence, and you can&apos;t discuss it,&quot; says Xu, who believes it has become harder to talk about over the last decade. Several of his portraits were exhibited in Beijing\u00a0a few years ago, but he does not expect another show on the mainland. He merely hopes more people will become aware of his work, and reflect on their own experiences. &quot;Most people think the\u00a0Cultural Revolution was the Gang of Four&apos;s fault, but actually everyone should be responsible.&quot; That includes the eight-year-old who scrawled his teacher&apos;s picture. That Miss Liu\u00a0survived the decade largely unscathed is some comfort, Xu says, but, &quot;Of course, I was responsible. It&apos;s only a question of how great or\u00a0small my responsibility was.&quot; Yu Xiangzhen, former Red Guard     Photograph: Dan Chung for the Guardian    Almost half a century on, it floods back: the hope, the zeal, the carefree autumn days riding the rails with fellow teenagers. And with it comes the shame, the fear and the blood clotted on a dying man gasping for\u00a0water. Yu Xiangzhen was an idealistic 14-year-old when the Cultural Revolution broke out, and among the first to form a Red Guards group. &quot;We were taught that Chairman Mao was closer to us than our parents \u2013 he was like a god to me,&quot; she says. From the first, she had doubts: when she saw fellow students berating and humiliating teachers, hacking off their hair and pouring glue over them; when she watched her peers assaulting &quot;capitalists&quot; and &quot;rightists&quot;. It felt wrong, and yet, &quot;I still thought it was right because everything I was hearing was that we needed to break the old\u00a0world to build a new one. &quot;I didn&apos;t think these people deserved to be beaten up....[But in refusing to take part] I felt I was, indeed, not brave enough. It was a\u00a0loss of face.&quot; Then, she says, came &quot;something so horrifying I will never be able to forget it as long as I live&quot;. There is no doubt she is still traumatised, and her voice rises to a shriek as she describes it. &quot;It was dark \u2013 I was standing by the side of a road, waiting for my friends. I heard someone whispering for water and saw a man crawling towards me from the basketball court,&quot; she says. &quot;He was covered in blood. The\u00a0blood on his head had congealed already. I\u00a0was terrified. Then I saw the court \u2013 it was almost covered by dead bodies.&quot; All, she believes, beaten to death by Red Guards. Yet, for these teenagers, it was a\u00a0heady as well as a frightening time. Hours after witnessing the atrocity, Yu was on a train to Shanghai. They\u00a0were travelling first to spread the cause \u2013 bearing leaflets titled &quot;Long live the red terror&quot; \u2013 but then &quot;it just became travel and leisure&quot;. Trains were free to Red Guards; food and lodgings awaited them. &quot;There were no plans, no destinations\u2026 I\u00a0was just very happy.&quot; Yu has begun to blog about her past in an attempt to understand it. &quot;I turn 60 very soon. There isn&apos;t much time left to think properly and write,&quot; she says. But she struggles to make sense of the violence, and few friends want to discuss it. &quot;The Red Guards who were most active had [political] problems in their family and tried to prove they were different,&quot; she suggests. &quot;Every time we get together, I look for the people who were most brutal. One told me it was exciting to go to people&apos;s houses and smash things and beat them up. You felt you could do whatever you wanted \u2013 that you were in control\u2026 And you thought it was the right thing to do.&quot; Carol Chow     Photograph: Dan Chung for the Guardian    Chow is a modern Chinese success story. She returned six years ago, from the States, lured back by the country&apos;s transformation. Her company sells cupcakes and confections to Beijing&apos;s elite. And yet there is a space in her life so profound that, &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t know what it would even mean to have that gap be filled; I\u00a0would be another person.&quot; It was left by the handsome young man hanging on the wall of Xu&apos;s studio: the father she knew for a few months before he was taken away. Zhou Ximeng killed himself in captivity, aged 27. &quot;It&apos;s painted like a memory. It&apos;s like he&apos;s frozen in that time,&quot; she says. She knows her father from a handful of photographs and from the stories her mother has told, of a smart, confident, capable man \u2013 too accomplished, perhaps. &quot;My mother said he was an overachiever.,&quot; Chow says. &quot;Whatever he did, he excelled at \u2013 he was always top of his class. The\u00a0reason she gave for his suicide was that he had never encountered any huge obstacles. I think he reached a point where it was all beyond his control and he didn&apos;t feel\u00a0he could change anything. You had to first renounce yourself and then renounce your family and friends. I think, when he got to that point, really, he just closed up.&quot; Zhou came from a long line of landowners and scholars; his father, a\u00a0renowned paleontologist, had spent time in America and Taiwan. But in the Cultural Revolution such a privileged pedigree condemned him. All it took was &quot;some really small comment&quot; for him to be seized and held, in a village outside Beijing. His body lies somewhere near the train tracks where he died. Xu has painted Zhou&apos;s mother, too; another of the casualties: she never recovered from her son&apos;s death and killed herself years later. Chow and her mother moved to Hong Kong \u2013 and later the US \u2013 as soon as China began to open up after Mao&apos;s death. Friends were equally keen to leave but too frightened to apply thanks to the previous decade&apos;s frequent reversals: &quot;They say one thing, you do it, then they say, &apos;You guys are going to jail because you have revealed your true selves.&apos;&quot; Her father was subsequently forgiven &quot;for his crimes, whatever they were&quot;, she says. &quot;I don&apos;t feel bitter or angry \u2013 I feel sad for him, that he missed so much,&quot; adds Chow, now 42, and who has two daughters. She wants the next generation to comprehend what happened. &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t think they really know about it or understand it or even talk about it. It&apos;s important for them to know what their ancestors went through and what was lost.&quot; Lin Zhu, widow of Liang Sicheng,\u00a0the father of modern Chinese\u00a0architecture When Liang Sicheng was denounced as a counter-revolutionary, he was scared to look even his wife in the eye. Lin Zhu, who had been working in the countryside at the time, rushed home to him on learning the news. &quot;He said, &apos;I&apos;ve been waiting for you and missing you every day, but\u00a0I&apos;m afraid to see you,&apos; &quot; the 83-year-old recalls, reaching for a\u00a0tissue to wipe away tears. Her husband sensed the horror ahead. Beijing&apos;s Tsinghua University \u2013 one of the country&apos;s top institutions \u2013 was already covered in posters attacking\u00a0professors. &quot;Back then, I thought this was like a dark cloud that would soon pass. I\u00a0didn&apos;t realise it would cover the country for the next 10 years,&quot; Lin says. When it lifted, Liang was dead, his health wrecked by the scores of lengthy &quot;struggle sessions&quot; publicly to humiliate him; by beatings from Red Guards; and by the cold, damp conditions of the building to which the family had been moved. Lin still struggles to understand how hundreds of millions could participate in such cruelties. Some of Liang&apos;s persecutors were forced into taking part, she says; others were jealous of his success. Most were young students who did not understand his ideas. To her husband, who had loved teaching, that was particularly painful. &quot;He wrote confession letters, one after another, but didn&apos;t know what he had done. The most important claim was that he had received a &apos;capitalist education&apos;. No one could\u00a0tell us what proletarian architectural design was \u2013 and you were too afraid to ask.&quot; As the movement escalated, Lin\u00a0considered demands to join it: &quot;I\u00a0thought probably I would be beaten to death by the Red Guards. Maybe my children would desert me\u00a0and my friends would keep their distance. But I couldn&apos;t understand what Liang Sicheng had done. I\u00a0couldn&apos;t go against my conscience by leaving him.&quot; Together they endured six years of enforced Maoist study and public denunciations that often ran for hours. &quot;Because it was all day long, the brain sort of became numb,&quot; Lin\u00a0recalls. &quot;Normally he was not beaten up at those sessions, but sometimes they would come and beat us at home.&quot; Liang&apos;s ordeal ended when he grew so sick that he could no longer rise from his bed for the struggle sessions. He died in 1972, aged 70. In later years, Lin worked with her\u00a0husband&apos;s accusers; some, quietly, apologised. She does not blame individuals for caving into pressure to attack others, though she is adamant that she never did so. She even suggests those years helped her to grow. &quot;Whatever happens, whatever comes, I&apos;m not afraid any more. It made me stronger and made me think,&quot; she\u00a0says. But she fears that intellectual life\u00a0in China has never fully recovered \u2013 and she worries the country could\u00a0see another such movement. &quot;Many of us are concerned about whether we can avoid a similar disaster in future. History doesn&apos;t repeat itself exactly\u2026 but it&apos;s possible.&quot;", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-24T16:38:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/25/british-swimming-london-2012", "sentences": ["The team claimed six medals at last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai \u2013 matching the target they have been set for the Games.", "Francesca Halsall \u2013 who barely missed out on two medals in Shanghai after having her preparations disrupted by an ankle injury \u2013 is the most high-profile, but Lizzie Simmonds, Jessica Dickons and Jemma Lowe have all claimed world and European titles."], "title": "British women swimmers making fast profit from Smart Track training", "article": "The countdown to London 2012 begins in earnest for Britain&apos;s swimmers next Saturday, with the start of the national selection trials at the Olympic Aquatics Centre in London. It is indicative of the sport&apos;s rude health that the performance director, Michael Scott, expects this group to be the most competitive in British history. The team claimed six medals at last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai \u2013 matching the target they have been set for the Games. Yet while the overall picture is a positive one, it is also true that one half of the programme has been outperforming the other. Five of those six medals were won by female swimmers and the only one that was not \u2013 Liam Tancock&apos;s gold in the 50m backstroke \u2013 was in an event that does not feature on the Olympic programme. Just as they did in Beijing four years ago, the women seem likely to provide the lion&apos;s share of British triumphs. What, then, is behind this disparity in performance? To Scott&apos;s mind one of the largest factors may simply be timing. &quot;Part of it is cyclical,&quot; the Australian told the Observer. &quot;There have been periods in British swimming \u2013 just like in other nations \u2013 where the men have been dominant or the women have been dominant. &quot;We had periods in Australia where the women have been completely dominant and then Ian Thorpe came on the scene and that changed because the men had a role model, a leader, and created that sense of belief within the team. So what is happening right now is not unique to Britain. Yes our women are stronger, but from my perspective the tide is starting to turn with the men&apos;s programme improving.&quot; There is evidence to support such claims. Scott notes that while they may not boast so many medal contenders, Britain has more men than women ranked in the top 16 of their respective disciplines. What they are still searching for is that break-out performer who can raise the sights of the squad as Thorpe did for Australia. As, indeed, Rebecca Adlington did for Team GB&apos;s female swimmers at the 2008 Games. &quot;It makes a difference,&quot; says Ellen Gandy, who reached the semi-finals of the 200m butterfly as a 16-year-old in Beijing and has since taken silver in the same event at last year&apos;s world championships. &quot;When Becky got her two medals at the Olympic Games it really just said to all of us &apos;it&apos;s possible&apos;. When someone does well like that you just feed off the energy.&quot; Yet Gandy&apos;s presence among Team GB&apos;s top medal prospects hints at another significant factor in the recent strength of the women&apos;s team. She was among a group of 14 teenage girls selected under a talent identification scheme set up by the former performance director Bill Sweetenham in 2004. The Smart Track programme aimed to introduce these young prospects to international competition and top-level training methods from an early age. &quot;Bill took us all over the world and got us to experience as many different environments as possible,&quot; says Gandy. &quot;We went to Mexico for a five-week altitude training camp, we went to China, we went to heaps of places in Europe; and we did World Cups, we did so many different competitions and training camps. &quot;I didn&apos;t really realise it at the time, but Bill tried to expose us to everything at a young age so that when we got to proper competition, we&apos;d be ready for it. It prepared me for everything in the last couple of years especially, which is why I think that we&apos;re all able to step up at those major meets, being quite young and yet being able to rise to the challenge.&quot; Not all of the girls involved went on to achieve great things, but, equally, Gandy will not be the only Smart Track graduate seeking a medal this summer. Francesca Halsall \u2013 who barely missed out on two medals in Shanghai after having her preparations disrupted by an ankle injury \u2013 is the most high-profile, but Lizzie Simmonds, Jessica Dickons and Jemma Lowe have all claimed world and European titles. Gandy is certain she would not have reached this point without the Smart Track programme. &quot;In England at the time swimming wasn&apos;t really that big and there wasn&apos;t really that much excitement about it,&quot; she says. &quot;Going around the world and experiencing all these things at such a young age really just gave me a love for swimming and made me excited to keep doing it and progress to those levels. &quot;Without that I would have just been like &apos;oh, what&apos;s the point?&apos; I wouldn&apos;t have known what is out there. So for me it was massive.&quot; There was no equivalent men&apos;s programme at the time; Sweetenham instead targeted efforts on that side with an elite training centre in Australia that took on slightly older candidates for a two-year residential period. Although it did train some athletes who would go on to represent Great Britain at international level, \u2013 such as Roberto Pavoni and Michael Rock \u2013 none have gone on to enjoy the same success as their leading Smart Track counterparts. Scott, though, believes the foundations are being laid for future success across the board in British swimming, with five intensive training centres now established \u2013 in Bath, Loughborough, Stirling, Stockport and Swansea \u2013 to train young prospects locally. The development structures as a whole are being reviewed to refine them further after the Games. &quot;The elite training centres such as the British Gas ITCs take a while to establish,&quot; says Scott. &quot;You just don&apos;t click your fingers and they&apos;re established overnight. So really they&apos;re just over three years old and just starting to make an impact.&quot; For both the men and the women.", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: swimming", "Swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-25T23:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/feb/27/funding-creative-disciplines-in-higher-education", "sentences": ["Professor Crossick&apos;s Shanghai lecturer can be downloaded here This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional."], "title": "Lack of higher education funding could stifle UK's creative industries", "article": "The London fashion week has cemented UK&apos;s reputation as a global force in the fashion industry. The rise of British fashion is just one aspect of the enormous contribution that the UK is making to creative and digital industries globally. According to the Work Foundation, the UK &quot;has the largest creative sector in the EU, and relative to GDP probably the largest in the world.&quot; A review led by professor Geoffrey Crossick, vice chancellor of the University of London, published by UUK in 2010 amply describes the importance of creative and digital industries to our economy. They employ 1 million people directly and another 800,000 with creative skills or roles in other sectors. Creative and digital businesses contribute 7% to the GDP and the sector has consistently achieved above average economic growth. This vital part of our economy and our national life is disproportionately reliant on higher education to nurture and hone creative talent. They require graduates. As the UUK report shows, on average graduates make up about a third of the workforce. But the proportion is far higher in creative sectors. Graduates make up more than two thirds of the workforce in interactive media, literature, computer games, TV and radio. In animation the proportion of graduates is a staggering 80%. Universities are constantly being exhorted to cooperate with industry, yet as the report illustrates, this is precisely what HE is doing with creative businesses. 81% of the universities in England have identified the creative industries as a target sector for external engagement \u2013 the next highest was energy, identified by 36% . As professor Crossick says: &quot;without higher education, there would be no creative economy&quot;. It has taken politicians some time to understand the importance of the creative economy but David Cameron&apos;s frequent visits to London&apos;s &quot;silicon roundabout&quot; shows that the penny is beginning to drop. This has yet to be translated into hard cash. As the Council for Industry and Higher Education highlight in their report &quot;The Fuse&quot;, creative disciplines are poor relations to STEM subjects when it comes to research funding. The report, calls on the government to set creative and digital industries and technologies alongside STEM as a national priority and for funding councils to give the same priority to creative and digital programmes. Government may be willing to fund creative and digital research but the problem is that output and the creation of value is usually isn&apos;t that tangible. It is difficult to measure the real impact of creative work. Crossick says that we need to see creative contributions in terms of knowledge exchange rather than the transfers for favoured by the Treasury and as interactions which usually need to be site specific and face to face. One of the examples he uses is a collaboration between the choreographer Wayne McGregor and a group of neuroscientists. Their output was a scientific paper published in the usual way, his was a major new dance work, perhaps harder to credit and measure. The funding of teaching for creative and digital undergraduate courses is a vexed question. Many which are lumped in as arts and humanities have lost most of their teaching grant. Yet art, drama and digital and creative subjects do cost more to teach than classroom based subjects. They will have to be cross subsidised by courses that are cheaper to deliver. Universities which can confidently get away with charging all students \u00a39,000 will find it easier to cross-subsidise than those charging lower average fees. We are likely to see the emergence of a &quot;squeezed middle&quot; of universities that may struggle to sustain the extra costs of providing creative and digital courses. Small specialist institutions, many of them represented by Guild HE, have done relatively well in the funding settlement. They include drama schools and specialist arts colleges such as Ravensbourne in London. Colleges which admit students on the basis of a portfolio or performance based interview have been allowed to opt out of the core and margin carve-up which has seen some universities lose 14% of their places. At Ravensbourne, the director, professor Robin Baker, has succeeded in getting most of his courses designated for the higher &quot;B level&quot; teaching funding. But his gratitude is tempered with fear for the future. &quot;We are grateful, but the future doesn&apos;t look rosy. The issue is uncertainty, we are all right this year, but have no idea if that will be sustained next year. It&apos;s impossible to plan.&quot; Baker acknowledges that colleges such as his produce only about 7% of arts, creative and digital graduates in the UK and calls for a more comprehensive strategy to support these subjects. &quot;The creative industries in this country have succeeded because they have a good higher education base, if that gets damaged then our reputation as global leaders in creative businesses will suffer and so will the UK economy,&quot; he says.

They include three college campuses and the Ningbo History Museum, and his work typically mixes modern design with traditional material. China&apos;s rapid urbanisation makes the issue of &quot;the proper relation of present to past \u2026 particularly timely&quot;, said jury chairman Lord Palumbo. In 2011, China became a majority urban country for the first time, as farmers have migrated for work, with rapid urbanisation producing megacities such as Chongqing (population 32 million) and vast urban-industrial sprawls through the factory belts of the Pearl river and Yangzte delta. Much of this new building is mediocre, with public buildings often emphasising giganticism and grandeur rather than style. The jury praised Wang&apos;s work as &quot;exemplary in its strong sense of cultural continuity and reinvigorated tradition&quot;. Wang reworks Chinese styles with recycled materials; 2m tiles from demolished traditional houses were used in the China Academy of Art&apos;s Xiangshan campus, in Hangzhou. A library at Suzhou University&apos;s Wenzhang Campus is a cluster of low cubes sunk half underground to reflect feng shui traditions, which oppose high buildings that block energy between mountains and water. Born in 1963, Wang graduated from Nanjing Institute of Technology. His first job was to research building restoration and he worked with craftsmen for 10 years to gain a feeling for materials. He tries to recover what he has called the &quot;handicraft aspect&quot; of building design, in contrast to &quot;professionalised, soulless architecture, as practised today&quot;.

The third Bond film to star Daniel Craig, Skyfall has raised eyebrows for filming in the distinctly un-Bond Bognor Regis, though Cosgrave points out that it has also been shot in Shanghai.

There will be a boat, there will be a snowmobile, but that&apos;s a very specific show.

Bond&apos;s anniversary has come at an opportune time, with a multitude of other British cultural figures, from Shakespeare and Dickens to Damien Hirst and the Queen, the subject of shows and celebrations as the Oympics come to London. Cosgrave said that the Bond show will be a good fit with the Games. &quot;The athleticism that runs through the films will be reflected in the show. Think about the stunt that opens The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; - a downhill ski chase which Bond escapes by a parachute emblazoned with the union jack.

Nicholas Kenyon, the Barbican&apos;s managing director, said the show would &quot;welcome new audiences&quot; to the centre. He said: &quot;The Barbican centre&apos;s wide-ranging arts offer includes the best of high-quality design, and there has been no bigger icon of British design style over 50 years than James Bond. From the cutting-edge of our Bauhaus exhibition to the huge popular appeal of Bond, the Barbican is at the forefront of expanding audiences to the arts.&quot; &quot;You can&apos;t deny that the Bond films are masterworks of filmmaking,&quot; said Cosgrave. &quot;They&apos;re blockbusters but they&apos;re beautifully designed.

Another 113 cities must adopt new standards next year, and all but the smallest cities by 2015. To &quot;help allay public concern over official air quality readings&quot;, levels of ozone and PM2.5 particles must be included. PM2.5 particulate matter is below 2.5 micrometres in diameter, or 1/30th the width of an average human hair, and easily penetrates lung tissue. &quot;This is a major step forward in terms of China&apos;s process to combat urban air pollution,&quot; said Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. &quot;The prerequisite for mobilising our people is to let them know what is going on. &quot;It doesn&apos;t mean that the sky will turn blue automatically because at the end of the day we still need to cut off these emissions.&quot; Following the announcement, more than a million \u2013 mostly positive \u2013 comments were posted on the Weibo micro-blogging service in under 24 hours. &quot;Good news, applause,&quot; wrote Xu Xiaonian, a prominent economist. Others questioned whether the rules would be enforced. In January, Beijing&apos;s environmental agency included PM2.5 particles in its calculations after months of postings from netizens mocking the discrepancy between officially clear days and the dense smog at their windows. Ma said social media had played an essential role in changing government policy last year. State media also acknowledged the role of bloggers: &quot;A stirring campaign on the country&apos;s social network websites since last autumn seemed to have gained a satisfying response from the country&apos;s policymakers,&quot; Xinhua news agency said.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Pollution", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-01T12:52:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/01/audi-hybrid-le-mans-toyota", "sentences": ["WEC 2012 season 12 Hours of Sebring, USA: 17 March 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium: 5 May 24 Hours of Le Mans, France: 16 &amp; 17June 6 Hours of Silverstone, GB: 26 August 6 Hours of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil: 15 September 6 Hours of Bahrain: 29 September 6 Hours of Fuji, Japan: 14 October 6 Hours of Shanghai, China: 27 October"], "title": "Audi unveil new hybrid prototype to take on Toyota at Le Mans 24", "article": "Audi have unveiled a new hybrid-powered car that will compete at this year&apos;s 24 hours of Le Mans race and as part of its season-long entry in the new World Endurance Championship (WEC), which begins at Sebring on 17 March. It will use flywheel technology developed by the Williams F1 team. Long expected to bring a hybrid car to endurance racing, the German manufacturer will go head-to-head with Toyota who are returning to the sport this season with their own brand new hybrid racer. The new car, which was revealed in Munich on Wednesday, is a development of last year&apos;s Le Mans-winning R18, designated the R18 e-tron quattro, and is itself a further refinement of this year&apos;s, new diesel-powered prototype \u2013 the R18 ultra. Audi will run both versions of each car in all rounds of the WEC (with the exception of Sebring, where last year&apos;s iteration of the R18 will take to the grid) with a full, four-car entry for its debut at the six-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps in May and the Le Mans 24 in June. The hybrid will run on a four-wheel drive system, with the Williams-developed flywheel recovering energy from the front axle during braking. It will work in tandem with the standard V6 TDI engine providing power to the rear wheels. Audi revealed they began the project in February 2010 and that it has evolved in parallel to the development of their diesel prototype. The base of both cars is identical and the new R18 ultra was designed specifically to minimise weight (including a new gearbox with a carbon-fibre composite housing) so that its sister car could accommodate the additional hybrid technology. &quot;The new R18 ultra is a distinct evolution of last year&apos;s Le Mans race winning car,&quot; explained head of Audi motorsport Dr Wolfgang Ullrich. &quot;Our drivers&apos; impressions were very positive from the first moment. Without the weight optimised R18 ultra we would have not been capable of realising the R18 e-tron quattro which is absolutely identical with the exception of the hybrid system.&quot; Britain&apos;s two-times Le Mans winner Allan McNish will be behind the wheel of one new hybrid at Le Mans and Spa, joined by team-mates Dindo Capello and Tom Kristensen, while the second will be driven by last year&apos;s Le Mans winners Marcel F\u00e4ssler, Andr\u00e9 Lotterer and Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer. The announcement, although anticipated, provides a considerable fillip to the WEC which was hit hard when Peugeot unexpectedly pulled out as a manufacturer just before the closing date for entries this year. Toyota had already increased their commitment to the series by becoming a full-time manufacturer entrant and will make their debut with the new TS030 Hybrid at Spa. They will also race two hybrids at Le Mans, the second to include Britain&apos;s Anthony Davidson, who was without a drive for the season when Peugeot pulled out. That the grid will now feature two manufacturer hybrids in the highest Le Mans Prototype category will be a great relief to fans and organisers, the Automobile Club de l&apos;Ouest, alike. Peugeot&apos;s exit left a gulf between the diesel-powered Audi&apos;s and the other petrol-powered entrants, however, with two different hybrids on the grid the contest will begin from a far more level playing field. On a technological level at least, with 10 Le Mans 24 wins since 2000 Audi still enter the season as strong favourites.

Ahead of the British Gas Swimming Championships at an Aquatics Centre that will be filled with 17,500 spectators at Games time, the national performance director, Michael Scott, said their target was at least six medals this summer. He said that over the next eight days the focus of Britain&apos;s swimmers, including the double Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington, would be exclusively on finishing in the first two places to qualify. &quot;The next part is how we motivate our swimmers to swim faster at the Olympics than they did at the trials,&quot; he said. &quot;In Shanghai [at the 2011 world championships] we had a 67% strike rate of swimming faster at the championships than the trials. We have to improve that strike rate.&quot; He said changes to the rules meant Britain could select only two swimmers for the London Games in the open water events \u2013 in which three medals were won in 2008 \u2013 so more would have to be won in the pool. &quot;We won six medals in Beijing in swimming, that was our best Olympics in 100 years \u2013 our challenge must be to at least match that,&quot; said Scott. &quot;We had three in the pool and three in open water. We can only have two swimmers in open water this time so to match our medals in Beijing we have to get better in the pool. &quot;In the previous four-year period at two world championships [prior to 2008], we won six medals in Olympic events. In the two world championships in this quad, we have won 12. As a swimming nation we have progressed.&quot; But Scott and British Swimming&apos;s head coach, Dennis Pursley, also said that the depth of competition had improved, with swimmers from more countries competing at the top of the sport than ever before. Scott said: &quot;We can only control what we can control, we can&apos;t control what the other countries are doing and the competitiveness is stronger than ever. More countries are making semi-finals and finals and winning medals.&quot; The performance director also said that, despite the relative strength of Britain&apos;s women in comparison to the men in recent years, he believed the pendulum was starting to swing. &quot;There are potential men&apos;s medallists on our team. In our stronger events we are pushing with quality swimmers,&quot; he said, singling out the 200m breaststroke as one event where three or four \u2013 Michael Jamieson, Andrew Willis and Kris Gilchrist among them \u2013 will compete for the two places on offer. &quot;A lot of it is cyclical. You&apos;ll have times when the men are dominant and then the women are dominant. But in the world rankings, we&apos;ve got more men in top 16 than the women. We have more women at the pointy end. I&apos;m starting to see that trend change. Our men are getting stronger, but they&apos;re not at the same standard as our women.&quot; Swimmers finishing first at the British championships have to have also met the qualifying time set down by the world governing body, Fina, while those finishing second also need to record one of the 16 best times in the world this year. Pursley said being able to familiarise themselves with the venue over the eight days of competition would be an advantage for British swimmers, but added that the real boon of home advantage came from the support of the crowd. &quot;The crowd can make an exceptionally strong difference. It can bring the best out of a team,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve seen that through the history of the Olympics, ever host nation will typically get some great performances from their athletes.&quot; Scott said all Britain&apos;s swimmers, including Adlington, were right not to take their place in the team for granted in deference to the strength of younger swimmers coming through. &quot;No swimmer on this team is taking selection for granted. It is something they have to earn. Our two-time defending Olympic champion knows she has to earn her spot,&quot; he said. Those who fail to qualify in the Olympic aquatics centre will get a final chance to make the 52-strong team at the ASA championships in Sheffield in June. Debbie Jevans, director of sport for the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said that the recent diving test event had thrown up few problems once an early issue with the temperature of the Aquatics Centre being too cold had been rectified. She said 850 swimmers would compete over the eight days, including 151 disabled athletes, compared to 950 at the Games. Around 250 are from abroad, with the rest from Britain. &quot;The swimmers have got to qualify for the Games, it&apos;s very important, so there&apos;s a lot of pressure on us to get this right. It&apos;s going to be amazing. The spectators are close to the pool, there&apos;s finals every day, lots of British swimmers and the atmosphere should be fantastic.&quot;", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Swimming", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-02T20:47:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/02/rebecca-adlington-london-olympic-games", "sentences": ["The whole hype that surrounded what she did four years ago \u2026 she&apos;s learned to handle that, and that&apos;s a big bonus.&quot; The best illustration of that came in Shanghai last year at the world championships where Adlington battled back from struggling to qualify in the 400m to win silver in the final."], "title": "Rebecca Adlington: My times don't matter, I just want to make the team", "article": "     Swimmers age before our eyes. In professional sport lives are compressed but in swimming they are squeezed tighter still, so that Rebecca Adlington, full of breathless precocity in Beijing four years ago, now \u2013 at 22 \u2013 has a hoary wisdom and even thoughts of retirement. The girl who emerged from China clutching two gold medals, a world record and a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes, presented to her by the mayor of Mansfield and which seemed to delight her just as much as anything she achieved in the pool, has been accelerated into maturity. Being the wise old trouper she is, Adlington is taking nothing for granted this year, though perhaps that admirable quality has been adopted in the extreme. Her diary is full of blank pages after the Olympic trials which begin in the Aquatics Centre on Sunday. As for the pages covering this summer&apos;s London games, they almost ache with emptiness, such is her caution. &quot;I just want to make the team for the Olympics,&quot; she says, in imploring tones. &quot;I can&apos;t explain how much of a relief it will be just to make the team. I think it is weighing down on everyone&apos;s shoulders. We just all want to know. If you swim fast and post amazing times that&apos;s just a bonus. It would be brilliant, but it doesn&apos;t matter what time I do now. It&apos;s just about getting a spot on that team.&quot; To guarantee a place at the Olympic Games, swimmers need to finish in the top two in their event at the British Gas Swimming Championships which double as the trials and also make the A standard time set by British Swimming. In Adlington&apos;s first event, the 400m freestyle, whose final is Sunday night, she is one of three rivals \u2013 Jo Jackson and Jazz Carlin are the others \u2013 who will compete for the two places. And so, Adlington&apos;s concern is genuine. This is no false modesty. It is also a way of coping with the stratospheric levels of expectation. And it was her difficulty in coping with expectation that was her biggest problem in the post-Beijing years, according to her articulate coach, Bill Furniss. &quot;It was very difficult after Beijing,&quot; says Furniss. &quot;She was a 19-year-old girl, she was unknown and suddenly overnight her life totally changed. Her life wasn&apos;t her own and I think we had a period where we had to learn to handle that \u2013 anybody would&apos;ve. &quot;The biggest thing was the expectation. That was the hardest thing to handle. Every time she jumped into the pool she was expected to win. It&apos;s not that easy. She&apos;s learned now \u2013 as she did before \u2013 very much to focus on preparing well, turning up to the competition and racing.&quot; Adlington admits: &quot;I think at first, especially at the world championships in 2009, I let the pressure and expectation get a little bit too much for me. Instead of just going along and enjoying it and trying to do my best I was putting too much pressure on myself, more than anything else. &quot;But I&apos;ve got over that. I&apos;ve realised that I should just enjoy it. I&apos;m in the sport because I love it so why not enjoy it? Why put so much pressure on myself when I don&apos;t need to. It&apos;s better when you swim happy and relaxed and just enjoy the experience of where you are.&quot; Perhaps her first important performance after China should not have been judged so harshly. In the 400m, in the 2009 world championships, she came third. &quot;But Federica Pellegrini smashed the world record. And I took two seconds off my PB.&quot; But in her main event, the 800, she came fourth. And at the same distance in the 2010 European championships, she was seventh. &quot;It was definitely a mental thing. I&apos;d lost quite a bit of confidence after the worlds and I let it get to me.&quot; She did, though, repeat her Olympic double gold performance in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. After Beijing, where she became the most successful British swimmer since 1908, she presented a profile of almost exaggerated ordinariness. Here was the Nottinghamshire girl, living at home with her mum, who had been propelled to an unlikely stardom. She had taken her first dip in the Sherwood Colliery Swimming Club. But now she had a pub named after her, the Adlington Arms, and an OBE was on its way. &quot;My life hasn&apos;t changed,&quot; she says, rather unconvincingly. &quot;I&apos;m still at the same club, still the same coach. I&apos;m still training in the same pools, still in the same environment. It&apos;s just that now, obviously, I&apos;m a bit more well known, I get more media interest \u2013 I can&apos;t remember having this many people interviewing me before the last Olympic trials. That&apos;s very different. But nothing has changed with who I am. I&apos;ve grown as a person and I&apos;ve grown as an athlete and hopefully that experience can sit well on me and not be a bad thing.&quot; Furniss&apos;s observation is a little more profound. &quot;She is a woman now, she was a girl four years ago. She&apos;s matured physically, she&apos;s matured mentally. She&apos;s not the same person I suppose \u2013 she&apos;s got the same good traits, her determination and her will to win but she&apos;s much more aware now, confident, self-assured. &quot;She&apos;s much more in control of what she does. Our relationship has changed a lot. I&apos;m now more an adviser. We agree things. She has a lot more responsibility now for her own training, her own performance than she did four years ago. The whole hype that surrounded what she did four years ago \u2026 she&apos;s learned to handle that, and that&apos;s a big bonus.&quot; The best illustration of that came in Shanghai last year at the world championships where Adlington battled back from struggling to qualify in the 400m to win silver in the final. Then, she triumphed in an almighty tussle with Lotte Friis in her favoured event, the 800m. She is, says Furniss, &quot;the ultimate racer&quot;. He explained: &quot;Her strength is a racer. You have got nothing until you finish the race and it is that mindset she has very much bought back into. &quot;There&apos;s been a lot of blood, sweat and tears. It&apos;s experiential \u2013 you have to go through it. But all coaches know their athletes. That&apos;s why I say I&apos;m happy with where Rebecca is. She&apos;s happy with herself \u2013 and a happy swimmer is a fast swimmer. While it&apos;s a pretty punishing regime and pretty brutal what she does, I think she&apos;s happy in herself. She&apos;s happy and confident in the work she&apos;s doing.&quot; At the London Olympics \u2013 provided she qualifies \u2013 Adlington aims to compete in the 800m, 400m and 200m. &quot;I have not done any training for the 200 and it would be a miracle if I was to make even the final or finish top six. I am not expecting anything but it is just nice to race something completely different \u2013 and short as well. It&apos;s always a good laugh doing the 200.&quot; She looks forward to being at home. &quot;Everything from not going through the jet-lag thing or picking up something from the flight, you have to deal with time difference, different food, you have to deal with so much [abroad] it&apos;s nice not to have to think about those things. The biggest worry will be &apos;how do I get down to London?&apos; It will be amazing to have it all here.&quot; The other big difference, this month and in the summer, will be that she will be performing in front of supportive crowds. &quot;Even my parents and my family can&apos;t wait to see the Olympic pool. Everyone is just more excited than anything, which is so nice to have for a trials. &quot;I&apos;ve done trials before but never had a big home crowd. The difference is huge. I remember when we went to Rome in 09. It was crazy for Federica [Pellegrini]. We all got excited thinking this could be us in London. That would be amazing to have because it does lift you. It does pick you up. Everyone has that little bit extra when you have everyone cheering for you and none of us has experienced that before.&quot;", "tags": ["Rebecca Adlington", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Team GB", "Swimming", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-02T22:08:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/03/andy-murray-roger-federer-live", "sentences": ["In the last two finals in which they&apos;ve met (both in 2010, in Shanghai and Toronto) Murray has won, but Federer has beaten him in actual big finals twice: Australian Open 2010, US Open 2008."], "title": "Andy Murray v Roger Federer - as it happened", "article": " Preamble: Afternoon all, and welcome to some live coverage of Andy Murray&apos;s attempt to beat Roger Federer to win the exotically named Dubai Duty Free Championship. Wouldn&apos;t it be nice if the trophy was a giant Toblerone. Murray was impressive yesterday against Djokovic having already played probably the best game of his life in losing against the Serb in the Australian Open semi-final. If Djokovic is now tennis&apos;s man to beat, then Murray must now have the belief he can beat him in tournaments that matter. He&apos;s been in fine form since linking up with Ivan Lendl - the ranting&apos;s down, the sulking&apos;s lessened and yesterday suggested his serve is on fire: he hit five aces, put 71% of his first serves in and won points on 85% of those.  Or at least that&apos;s one way of looking at it. The other way is to put it this way: the reason Murray and Federer are competing in the final here is because Djokovic and Nadal care about minor tournaments like this and so don&apos;t play at their best. Certainly Djokovic wasn&apos;t as brilliant as he can be yesterday. Hence they can shrug off losses in these tournaments since its the majors they care most for. It leaves the likes of Murray and Federer to fight over the scraps. Certainly Federer, when at his most dominant and imperious, never used to care so much about tournaments such as these. Now, though, he seems grateful for the ranking points they can offer him. His performance yesterday was a battling one: two tie-breaks were needed for him to progress, the final one of which being marked by a stunning comeback in which he had to save four set points.  It suggests a Murray victory today. Firstly, he seems the more in form of the two and, secondly, the fact it&apos;s a best of three means that a Murray loss of concentration probably won&apos;t be a factor.  2.58pm: Some stats: Murray has beaten Federer eight times, while Federer has beaten him six times. In the last two finals in which they&apos;ve met (both in 2010, in Shanghai and Toronto) Murray has won, but Federer has beaten him in actual big finals twice: Australian Open 2010, US Open 2008. Which still points to a Murray win, today then.  3.00pm: The pair haven&apos;t played each other since 2010 ATP Tour Finals and Federer reckons today&apos;s match is going to be tough: &quot;We&apos;ve played each other so many times we know each other&apos;s games well. I&apos;m just excited playing against him again after such a long time. Andy is an amazing player, and so far he&apos;s proved that this year.&quot;  3.07pm: It&apos;s chilly in Dubai apparently. Or at least not blazingly hot anyway. Federer won&apos;t be able to play that terrifying mind-game trick of his of not ever sweating in the heat.  3.12pm: The players are out on court, the coin has been tossed and a few snaps have been taken. Murray&apos;s in red, clean-shaven and looking relaxed. Federer&apos;s in black and white and looking entirely unruffled too.  First set: *Murray 1-0 Federer (* denotes server): The Murray second serve allows him to take the scores to 15-15 after he conceded the first point of the match, but then two quick, powerful first serves take him to 40-15. Next Murray hits long at the end of a short rally, the ball really pinging about this fast service, before a far longer baseline rally battle is won by a patient Federer to take the scores to deuce. Federer charges into the net after a Murray second serve, but thumps the volley straight into the chord with the Scot well out of the picture. He hits the chord again seconds later as Murray converts his advantage into the game.  First set: Murray 1-1 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer entirely takes Murray apart in the first point: he sends him wide with a serve, then fires a glorious backhand across the other side of the court. He then sends Murray scampering about the court again to go to 30-0 and looks ominously powerful. He hits long next, though, and Murray claws a point back before a delicate drop shot takes Federer to 40-15. But then a strong service return earns Murray another point, before Federer nets and the second game goes to deuce too. Murray is attempting to attack Federer&apos;s forehand - and well he might after the backhand that began this game - but the Swiss still hits two winners to win the game.  First set: *Murray 2-1 Federer (* denotes server): Federer comes barrelling up to the net but Murray spots him, fizzing a winner past his backhand. He goes to 30-0 after some more baseline hitting. Still, Federer takes advantage of a poor Murray second serve and belts a service return straight back past him for 30-15. It gives him the impetus to send an imperious forehand across the court following a decent Murray shot to even things up at 30-30. But Federer nets after a slow Murray serve, then the Scot fires down an ace to claim the game. &quot;Murray is clean-shaven. Good,&quot; emails Adam Hirst. &quot;Perhaps that is part of Lendl&apos;s coaching as well. Ditch the bum-fluff stubble, time to be a man Andy. Money&apos;s on him today and for a slam this year then.&quot;  First set: Murray 2-2 *Federer (* denotes server): Murray returns weakly from Federer&apos;s first serve, allowing the Swiss to clatter across court comprehensively. He then effortlessly strokes another winner past him: 30-0. There&apos;s a let next, and then the TV director elects to film the umpire rather than the next point, which Federer wins to go to 40-0. Murray wins one back, before Federer thumps a final winner past him. Federer is looking very, very good.  First set: *Murray 3-2 Federer (* denotes server): Murray&apos;s first serve is working well - he&apos;s averaging 66% of first serves in for the tournament, the TV tells us - and his first one in this game is a belter. But Federer takes the next point, before another baseline rally ends with Federer hitting long: 30-15. Murray gives the umpire the benefit of his lip after a decision is reviewed, before he fires down an ace - called out, which he reviews too - to go to 40-15. Federer charges into the net on the next point but Murray smears the ball past him to clinch the game. &quot;Fed vs Murray is usually a good watch, but it doesn&apos;t answer the only two questions left about both men,&quot; poses Gary Naylor. &quot;Can Federer beat two of Nadal, Djokovic and Murray over five sets towards the end of a fortnight&apos;s tennis and can Murray banish memories of failure to close out a Slam final? No and No would be my answers.&quot;  First set: Murray 3-3 *Federer (* denotes server): Murray splatters a great winner past Federer, who was rushing into the net. Next, Federer hits long as Murray goes 0-30 up. Federer takes one point back, but hits a backhand into the net as Murray goes to 15-40 up. But he blows the first break point by hitting too long, then blows the second by whizzing a Federer forehand into the net. Federer rules the game from there: eventually winning in some style after sending Murray wide, back, very short, then finally out of the game.  First set: *Murray 4-3 Federer (* denotes server): Don&apos;t think Federer has actually been broken at all this week, so that would have been a decent feat if Murray had pulled that off. But he didn&apos;t. So that&apos;s that. Another ace, then some solid defensive play from the back of the court takes Murray to 40-15 before, on the final point, he dominates - eventually rushing to the net to smash the winner.  First set: Murray 4-4 *Federer (* denotes server): A nice Murray double-hander takes Federer by surprise, before the Swiss levels the scores at 15-15 having got away with a weak cross-court smash (returned by Murray but put away again by Federer). He clinches the next two points in commanding style before Murray hits a very special cross court return, that Federer is again surprised by. Still, he serves out the game easily enough.  First set: *Murray 5-4 Federer (* denotes server): Murray goes to 30-0 after a Federer again attempts a drop shot. Murray is good enough to get to it, though, and Federer nets his return. Murray goes to 40-0 up, then double faults, but his following first serve is accurate, forceful and too good for Federer.  First set: Murray 5-5 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer starts strongly and goes to 40-0 with the minimum of effort - though he&apos;s helped by a Murray slip agt 15-0. Then Murray lobs him beautifully after he charges into the net - that was so well disguised - but Federer takes the game home on the following point. Incidentally, in that last game, Federer cleared an errant ball to a ball-boy - chipping long to the back of the court. The ball-boy nonchalantly caught it, while still holding another ball, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. My team of cricketing casuals, The Toriano Tigers (I didn&apos;t choose the name) could do with someone of that kind of catching ability in the team. If you&apos;re reading this, ball-boy, do you fancy joining us?  First set: *Murray 5-6 Federer (* denotes server): Murray hits his second double fault of the game, then finishes a rally by hitting long into the corner. He goes 0-30 down and takes a moment to towel himself down. Federer is, of course, not bothering to sweat. Federer then gets a little luck - he mishits a return on Murray&apos;s second serve and the ball just about slices over the net. Murray&apos;s scampering return just goes out: 0-40. The Scot then takes two points back, the second after a powerful first serve. Masterfully, he then takes the game to deuce after suddenly erupting from the baseline, turning his defence into a clinical attack. He&apos;s lucky, though, and despite netting to give Federer advantage, the Swiss then hits a wild forehand to return the scores to deuce - just as a weird howling noise rumbles around the court. Odd. But then Federer does break him! The Swiss wins the game after thrashing a ball at Murray, who can only just get a racket to a return which lobs high into the sky, then out again.  Federer wins the first set 7-5: Murray, pointlessly, challenges a good Federer serve, then gets sent to both sides of the court by a dominant Federer: 30-0. The Swiss takes it to 40-0 with the minimum of effort, but Murray is able to claim a point back after two poor serves from Federer. But, with two set points in his pocket, Federer clinches the first set as Murray hits a poor return out.  Second set: *Murray 5-7, 1-0 Federer (* denotes server): Murray goes to 30-0 after two dodgy forehands from Federer but then the Swiss dinks the ball just over the net from the baseline. Murray looked as if he could have chipped it back, while hammering into the net, but failed to lift the ball over the chord. Federer then comes into the net and, with the court at his disposal, elects to knock the ball into the tramlines: 40-15. Murray serves the game out with an ace. &quot;Somebody at the Guardian doesn&apos;t like A. Murray or s/he could have found a better photo,&quot; emails Honor Haidar. &quot;The one chosen is diabolical!&quot; I think it gives him a certain focussed intensity. Or it makes him look like he really hates that ball.  Second set: Murray 5-7, 1-1 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer thrashes his way to a dominant game to love. Murray is playing too defensively here, sticking to the baseline - or, in fact, a good way behind it - which is going to play in Federer&apos;s hands in these fast conditions.  Second set: *Murray 5-7, 1-2 Federer (* denotes server): Uh-oh, Murray goes to 0-30 down but, as Federer comes charging into the net, Murray sends a winner up the line and past his opponent: 15-30. Next, though, Murray comes charging into the net - but his drop shot is too long and Federer smashes the ball back past him. Murray replies with what looks like an ace - but Federer correctly challenges it. The Scot&apos;s next serve is nothing like as potent and Federer breaks him early in the second set.  Second set: Murray 5-7, 1-3 *Federer (* denotes server): An exceptional reply from Federer ends a rally and earns him the first points of the game: the Swiss dinked a floated backhand at an outstanding angle across the court. It gives him the confidence to clinch the next two points - the last of which is an ace - with simplistic ease. Murray then scoops long, looking unblanaced as he does so, and Federer is in clear control of this match at the moment.  Second set: *Murray 5-7, 2-3 Federer (* denotes server): Despite appearing to be, like a teetering pile of Jenga bricks, about to fall apart Murray romps to a 40-0 lead in the game. The final point of which features a remarkable Federer return from a very quick Murray second serve - he simply plonked the racket in front of his face and hoped it would go back over. It did, but Murray forces him deep and his return is wild. Murray then cleans up the final point of the match after another woeful return from Federer. From appearing to be completly in control, Federer has just had a shocker of a game.  Second set: Murray 5-7, 3-3 *Federer (* denotes server): A Murray unforced error - uncharacteristic of his form recently, but charactersitic of this match - begins proceedings but Federer nets to make the scores 15-15. Then, with dogged tenacity, Murray keeps hitting the ball back at Federer forcing the Swiss to eventually miss. It&apos;s a defensive tactic and, on the following point Federer proves why it won&apos;t wash - he&apos;s powerful and takes the scores to 30-30. But then a brilliant lob after another Federer drop shot gives Murray a break: which he clinches! Murray breaks Federer for the first time this tournament.  Second set: *Murray 5-7, 4-3 Federer (* denotes server): Murray attempts an unwise backhand winner down the line, ang goes 0-15 down. There&apos;s a long, gruelling rally next - each player rooted to the baseline and beating the ball at each other. Federer eventually nets and it feels suddenly as though Murray is clawing his way back into this. It&apos;s a feeling reinforced by his subsequent 212kph ace to go to 30-15. More baseline slugging follows but this time Murray slams the ball into the net: 30-30. He follows that with a double fault and, in the space of a couple of points, that Murray resurgence begins to flicker. Still, he does take the game to deuce, then goes on to advantage and game after a thumping ace. Interesting ...  Second set: Murray 5-7, 4-4 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer comes out swinging: he romps to 0-40 with the minimum of fuss. But then after a second service let, Murray flashes a winner back past him to take the score to 15-40. It unsettles Federer for approximately 0.0000023 of a second and he then sends Murray wide on his next serve and the Scot can&apos;t get the ball back.  Second set: *Murray 5-7, 4-5 Federer (* denotes server): The crowd make it clear who they want to win when Federer goes to 0-40 up after errors from Murray. They&apos;re whooping everything Federer does, yet there&apos;s silence at anything of Murray&apos;s. With three break points, though, Federer splatters a return long and then Murray clatters a reply into the net. Murray is broken again, and Federer will serve for the championship.  Second set: Murray 5-7, 4-5 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer&apos;s first serve is too strong for Murray and his reply is scrappy and long. He mouths off about something afterwards. Not sure what. 15-0. Then, following a short rally, Federer hits long and looks utterly disgusted with himself: 15-15. He&apos;s back on his game shortly afterwards - a great serve puts Murray onto the back foot and the Swiss goes to 30-15. Murray forces his way back into it on the next point, though: 30-30. Next, Federer sends Murray all over the court but, remarkably, he manages to retrieve every return. It&apos;s sensational stuff, really, but eventually Murray nets. Match point to Federer ... which he blows. Deuce.  Second set: Murray 5-7, 4-5 *Federer (* denotes server): Federer&apos;s first serve goes wide. His second forces Murray wide. A long rally follows which Federer wins when Murray goes the wrong way. Federer making all the running in that rally, Murray was just hitting the ball back. Match point.  Federer wins! Murray 5-7, 4-6 Federer: Federer wins in two straight sets. He&apos;s still barely broken a sweat and that may well knock Murray off his stride. Federer&apos;s forehand was good, Murray&apos;s serve was not as good as it has been but really it was that old age problem: Murray was too defensive and that allowed Federer to unpick him.  Thanks for reading: I&apos;m off. Murray was outplayed today by someone willing to take the initiative. Where he sat back and hoped Federer&apos;s forehand would fail (it didn&apos;t), Federer was proactive, fluid and aggressive. Still, Murray can take heart from the fact he was able to break Federer: no-one else managed it in this tournament.

For four years Adlington has been dreaming about competing in front of her home crowd at the London Olympics. Now she has secured a place in the 400m at least, and the Games are so close she can almost taste them. Adlington won the event at the British Championships, finishing well ahead of her friend and rival Jo Jackson. The two-time Olympic champion from 2008&apos;s time of 4min 2.35sec was the fastest in the world this year, but she did not think twice about that. All that mattered was that she had won selection, and her joy and satisfaction showed in the broad smile she wore on her face. Ellen Gandy was no less elated when she won the 100m butterfly, breaking the British record as she did it. Her time of 57.25sec was 0.15 quicker than the old mark, set in 2010 by Halsall, who finished in second and also took the second spot on the Olympic team. Her lifelong friend Jemma Lowe, who finished seventh in the event at the World Championships in Shanghai last year, missed the cut. &quot;It&apos;s the biggest meet of all our lives,&quot; Adlington said, with irrepressible enthusiasm. &quot;I am feeling so much relief, happiness, excitement \u2013 it&apos;s just an amazing feeling. I wanted this so badly. London has always been my target, and to actually finally know that I am going is the best feeling in the world.&quot; Gandy agreed. &quot;It&apos;s the greatest feeling ever,&quot; she added. &quot;All I&apos;ve wanted to do for the last four years is just be able to say: &apos;I&apos;m going to the London Olympic Games&apos;, and now I can say it.&quot; There is so much at stake here in the days until Saturday, with even swimmers of Gandy and Adlington&apos;s calibre terrified by the idea that they might miss out on Olympic selection. Great Britain have real strength in depth in both the freestyle and the butterfly, so neither had the comfort of feeling like qualification was a given. Adlington was stricken with nerves before her final, wobbling on the blocks as she waited for the gun. Jackson who won the bronze behind Adlington in the 400m at Beijing 2008, and is still the British record holder, had to fight hard to hold off the double Commonwealth Games medalist Jazz Carlin, as well as Ellie Faulkner. That Jackson did it only made Adlington happier. &quot;I so wanted it to be Jo. Jazz and Ellie are amazing girls, but they have their whole careers ahead of them. Jo and I have so much experience together \u2013 we are such close friends.&quot; Gandy, one of the Guardian&apos;s Olympic diarists, has been honing her technique in the turn over the winter. She is convinced it cost her the gold in the 200m butterfly at the World Championships in Shanghai. The work she has put in told. Halsall is a sprinter and as is her style, she swam the first 50m hard and fast. Gandy was behind at the turn, but stayed underwater longer as she came back for the second 50. She and Halsall were neck-and-neck coming into the final 25m, but Gandy just edged ahead in the final few strokes. The 100m butterfly will be as fiercely a contested event as any at these Championships. In 2011 there was just 0.12 of a second between Halsall, Gandy and Lowe. And as Halsall said: &quot;Three into two doesn&apos;t go.&quot; Coming into the final, they were all in the top five of the world rankings. But Saturday night provided a salutary reminder of the difference between domestic and international success, when Sweden&apos;s Sarah Sjostrom, one of several overseas swimmers competing here to familiarise themselves with the Olympic venue, swam 56.79. Gandy knows she will most likely need to break 57 to win an Olympic medal. She is sure she can do it. &quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;ll be aiming for at the Olympics later this year,&quot; she said, before letting slip an involuntary yelp of joy as she realised what she had just said. &quot;Oh. I&apos;m so glad I can say that now!&quot; As can Daniel Sliwinski and Craig Benson, who both qualified for the team in the 100m breaststroke. The butterfly and the freestyle made it an enthralling evening in this impressive pool, marred only by a tediously insistent MC and a headache-inducing pop soundtrack. &quot;It&apos;s an unbelievable venue,&quot; said Adlington. &quot;And that&apos;s been all the talk of the last two days.&quot; For some it took more getting used to that for others. The sinuous bulges of the roof posed problems for the backstrokers, who tend to take a steer from what they see above them. &quot;It&apos;s not straight,&quot; said Gemma Spofforth after her heat. &quot;It&apos;s actually quite awkward with the lights.&quot; Her team-mate, and rival for the title, Lizzie Simmonds agreed, to a point. &quot;Every roof is different,&quot; she said, before dissolving into giggles. &quot;That sounds really, really boring. It sounds as if I&apos;m going to start discussing my conservatory.&quot; Liam Tancock shrugged it off. &quot;If the pool and roof are off kilter, you do tend to follow the roof. But we race outdoors, where there&apos;s nothing to follow apart from a few pelicans and a couple of clouds.&quot; All three will be back in the pool on Monday, when they will hope to be experiencing the same kind of elation as Gandy and Adlington.", "tags": ["Rebecca Adlington", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-04T22:03:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/mar/05/liverpool-electedmayors-joeanderson", "sentences": ["The GEC was in Shanghai last year, and Dubai the year before."], "title": "Liverpool is the country's most deprived city.

I want to lead Liverpool proudly and passionately into an exciting future. I want to be the driving force that makes Liverpool, once again, the international powerhouse it once was and still deserves to be. We are a city which faces massive challenges. But at the same time, we are also a city with massive opportunities. I firmly believe Liverpool is the most innovative, most enterprising, most ambitious city you could possibly imagine. And during the eight weeks of campaigning to come, I will highlight the very best Liverpool has to offer. During my campaign, Liverpool will host the Global Entrepreneurship Congress. This is a massive coup for us, and will bring 5,000 of the world&apos;s leading entrepreneurs to Liverpool. The GEC was in Shanghai last year, and Dubai the year before. That the Kauffman Foundation has chosen Liverpool to continue this legacy shows just how seriously the world takes our city. Liverpool will be put under the spotlight, and this is just one example of how far our city has come. Its time to think again about Liverpool. We&apos;re not a city down and out, depressed and demoralised. We are a city which is ambitious and confident. We are a city full of imagination, creativity, and talent. My promise, as Mayor of Liverpool, will be to help that talent flourish wherever it is found. My vision for Liverpool is one where all of our residents have a decent home and all our children have an excellent education. One where every family is able to work and earn a living, one where our city is growing and thriving and where we all can share in a bright future. Ultimately, my vision of Liverpool is one where my values of fairness, equality and freedom are the underpinning principles that govern the daily lives of all of our residents. Our city faces great challenges. We are still the most deprived city in the country. We still face massive Government cuts. More people are being left unemployed, more families are losing their homes, and our schools still desperately need investment. Meeting those challenges will require one thing above anything else: leadership. And showing strong and effective leadership is what I do best.

It cannot be the owner&apos;s laid-back attitude to the terms of a contract once results turn bad. Nor, perhaps, is it the caring and sharing vibe among the players in the dressing-room. It is possible, if a little unfair, to paint Chelsea as a club overrun by ruthless egomaniacs. The clue, of course, is in the question. Abramovich&apos;s fortune is estimated at $13.4bn and, when managers sign up, they have come to expect a certain leverage, over and above their handsome wage packets. Put simply, they believe that serious transfer market clout will be theirs. Thanks to Abramovich&apos;s financial backing since his takeover in 2003, Chelsea have become serial contenders at home and in Europe. New managers imagine the dream job, cherry-picking the world&apos;s finest talent, a sort of Fantasy Football without restrictions. But, as Abramovich began the process to appoint his sixth permanent manager, after Andre Villas-Boas paid on on Sunday,in the traditional way for a failure to meet expectations, the feeling was that the sales pitch had to change. The expected big-name arrival will most likely want big money to reshape the squad in his own image. The realities of Financial Fair Play, however, ought to dictate otherwise. As of the 2013-14 season clubs throughout Europe must fulfil the requirement to break even on their balance sheets and the calculations will be based on financial information from the 2011-12 and 2012-13 reporting periods. There are caveats, chief among them the &quot;acceptable deviation&quot; of \u20ac45m over the first two years, and there are doubters within the game. Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, has voiced his fears about whether FFP will have real teeth. Yet Uefa&apos;s leading officials are adamant that sanctions will be taken against any club which oversteps the mark. Exclusion from the Champions League or Europa League, which would come into force in 2014-15, are their most swingeing measure. According to Chelsea&apos;s most recent accounts, released on 31 January, as the media was consumed by transfer deadline day action, the club made losses of \u00a367.7m. The numbers have not generally been helped by the recoil from Abramovich&apos;s trigger finger. When he paid \u00a313.3m last summer to secure Villas-Boas&apos;s release from Porto, it took his compensation outlay on managers hired or fired to \u00a364m in a little over four years. Villas-Boas might not enjoy a windfall settlement on the remaining term of his \u00a34.5m-a-year contract, which was scheduled to run to the summer of 2014; he is to continue to receive his weekly wage from Abramovich until he gets a new job. But if this represents an unwanted outlay, the Stamford Bridge books stand to be hit rather harder by a failure to qualify for next season&apos;s Champions League. With 11 Premier League games to play, Chelsea trail fourth-placed Arsenal by three points, with a visit to Emirates Stadium to come on 21 April. Whichever way you look at it, a summer spending splurge, of the kind that saw \u00a371m lavished on Fernando Torres and David Luiz in January of last year, is unlikely; unless, of course, Abramovich intends to raise two fingers at FFP which, again, is unlikely. Not only has the Uefa president Michel Platini promoted Abramovich as a standard bearer for FFP but the Russian has made efforts to cut costs in all areas at his club. The latest financial figures showed that losses were down while turnover reached a record \u00a3222.3m. The Torres/Luiz spend even felt like an anomaly at the time. The chairman, Bruce Buck, and the chief executive, Ron Gourlay, have spoken of their commitment to FFP and they are adamant that Chelsea will comply, although they do continue to live in the red. If one of the frustrations that Villas-Boas feels at present concerns the denial of being able to oversee the squad&apos;s renewal, the task still needs to be carried out. It might feel more urgent in the summer, when the thirty-somethings have another season in their legs. It would be difficult, though, to horse-trade with the existing players, in the hope of upgrading the squad. The veterans&apos; values on the market have diminished. Chelsea allowed Nicolas Anelka, for example, to complete a cut-price move to Shanghai Shenhua in January while Didier Drogba could leave as a free agent in the summer. The younger players, meanwhile, represent the future and it would be counterintuitive to cash in on them. Torres remains the big imponderable but one of the many questions about him involves how sharply his price has dropped. It does not feel like a great time for a manager to come to Chelsea. Four years ago, they were a missed penalty from winning the Champions League; now, they might have to contest the Europa League. There are misgivings over recruitment policy; player power and thorny politics remain rife while highly regarded managers have fallen short. The new broom must inspire, rebuild and, above all, win.

While Adlington was a picture of unadulterated joy following her gold medal in the women&apos;s 400m freestyle, Tancock declined to get carried away after comfortably coming home in 53.16sec on day three of the British Championships, a little over his British record time of 52.73 sec. &quot;I&apos;m really pleased but it was about coming here, doing a job and making the Olympics,&quot; said the 26-year-old. &quot;I&apos;m a pretty calm guy and that&apos;s how I swim. But it&apos;s also about looking at the bigger picture; this is a stepping stone towards the Games, obviously a big one, but a stepping stone nevertheless.&quot; The hard work, then, has paid off for Tancock, who as part of his preparations for the final was made to push the car of his coach, Ben Titley, up a hill during a team cross-training session in Derbyshire last month. It was an exercise designed to improve Tancock&apos;s endurance and make him capable of transferring his excellent abilities at 50m backstroke, where he is the world record holder and a two-time world champion, over a longer distance, a necessary requirement given the absence of the 50m backstroke at this summer&apos;s Games. Stronger and determined, he can look forward to a return to this venue later this year. &quot;I love the pool and it felt fantastic to have finally got the chance to swim here,&quot; said Tancock, who had to overcome seven swimmers who had all recorded their personal bests in qualifying for the final. &quot;It&apos;s going to be even more incredible come the Olympics.&quot; Gemma Spofforth also sealed her place in Team GB with gold in the women&apos;s 100m backstroke final.

She also suffered a broken nose in a cycling accident. &quot;I&apos;ve had my ups and downs and there have been times when I wondered whether I had the strength to come back,&quot; said Spofforth, who finished just outside the medals in Beijing four years ago. &quot;But I&apos;ve always tried to overcome adversity and for me it comes down to those last 10m and trying to finish stronger than everyone else. If I hadn&apos;t qualified [for the Olympics], that probably would have been it for me; this would have been my last race. I&apos;m delighted to have made it.&quot; The Welsh swimmer Georgia Davies finished second to qualify alongside Spofforth but there was disappointment for Lizzie Simmonds, the European silver medallist, who did not secure a place at the Games after finishing third in 1min 0.43sec. The 21-year-old will, however, return for Thursday&apos;s semi-finals of the 200m backstroke, an event she has always felt represented her best chance of making the Olympics having won gold in the event at the 2010 European Championships. Elsewhere in front of an enthusiastic 2,000-strong crowd, the Commonwealth gold medallist Robert Renwick was victorious in the men&apos;s 200m freestyle final in 1:47.33.

Rebecca Turner, who won gold in the 200m freestyle, and Sophie Allen, who finished behind Miley in the 200m medley, demolished personal bests to exceed expectations and demonstrate the strength in depth that British Swimming&apos;s performance director, Michael Scott, paid tribute to ahead of this competition.

Miley, backed by the sporting philanthropist Barrie Wells and trained by her helicopter pilot father Patrick at a 25m pool in the Aberdeenshire market town of Inverurie, paid tribute to the young talent snapping at the heels of more established members of the British team. &quot;I knew it was going to be a big race on my hands with so many younger girls coming through and stepping up to the medley,&quot; she said. Earlier Turner had expressed disbelief at finishing first in the 200m freestyle. When she was 14 years old, she was told the times she would swim five years later by her Sheffield coach Russ Barber. She said she did not believe him until Tuesday night. As the 19-year-old demolished her personal best by almost a second with a &quot;gold or bust&quot; performance in the final length, Turner said she had surprised herself. &quot;I only came into this trying to get a relay spot, so to get an individual and win is pretty amazing,&quot; she said, having overhauled Caitlin McClatchey in the final 50m. Turner said training with Miley in Scotland had helped inspire her to claim her place at the London Games: &quot;It was a good taste to see what a world medallist does. We all really enjoyed ourselves and got a lot out of it.&quot; Despite finishing second, there was disappointment for McClatchey. She failed to secure the required time, despite having done so in the semi-finals when she swam half a second quicker, and she will have to try again at the ASA Championships in Sheffield in June. In the men&apos;s 200m butterfly final, the 2010 Commonwealth Games silver medallist Michael Rock missed out in a three-way shoot-out for the two places on offer, which was settled by the width of a single stroke. Joe Roebuck and Roberto Pavoni claimed the two Olympic places by finishing first and second respectively \u2013 a reverse of their positions in the 400m individual medley, in which they both also qualified on Saturday. Roebuck&apos;s winning time of 1:55.94 was the fastest in the world this year. Just like the 20 other British swimmers who have so far claimed places, Roebuck betrayed a mixture of relief and quiet determination. &quot;I knew it was going to be a good race between the three of us. Qualifying [on Saturday] gave me more hunger to come back today. I am sure my coach will think I did a lot of things wrong but at the moment I&apos;m just enjoying my win.&quot;", "tags": ["Swimming", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Hannah Miley", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-06T22:08:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/07/faith-schools-selection", "sentences": ["What that common good might be we can see in those education systems across the world, from Alberta to Shanghai, whose pupils leave our own for dead in international comparisons."], "title": "Letters: Faith, schools and selection", "article": "Your report on the advantaged intakes enjoyed by many church schools is a welcome reminder that the Holy Spirit is unlikely to be the cause of their superior academic performance (Poor pupils less likely to attend church schools in England than rich neighbours, 6 March). However, the response of your leading article (6 March) \u2013 that the figures point to &quot;pausing for thought&quot; \u2013 is somewhat pusillanimous, to say the least. What holds good for church schools holds good for all schools: educational outcomes primarily reflect the socio-economic makeup of the pupil intake and, in a system as hierarchical as ours, it takes either extraordinary talent or extraordinary incompetence for a school to prove an exception to this rule. The mulish insistence by politicians that school intakes do not matter and that &quot;great leadership&quot; and &quot;inspiring teaching&quot; are all that is missing from the lives of the poor flies in the face of all evidence and is a dishonest attempt to avoid confronting powerful minorities in order to promote the common good.\u00a0 What that common good might be we can see in those education systems across the world, from Alberta to Shanghai, whose pupils leave our own for dead in international comparisons. Sadly, rather than learn from these examples, we have chosen to import failed models from Sweden and the US. Of course, by the time it becomes apparent that this policy has failed, our log-rolling secretary of state will have moved on and his successor will blame the teachers.Michael PykeCampaign for State Education \u2022\u2008The final case study in your piece on church schools seems to me rather to undermine the argument of the rest of your coverage. Thorner CofE primary school, as the piece points out, is a voluntary-controlled school. This means that it uses the same criteria for admissions as a local authority school, usually things like siblings and distance from the school. Voluntary-controlled schools cannot use faith or church attendance as admission or oversubscription criteria. If Thorner&apos;s intake is wealthier than the surrounding postcode area, it is not because of faith-based selection by the school, but the result of selection by the parents who have chosen to apply for places there. Whatever one thinks of faith-based admission criteria (and personally I would love to see the back of this practice), it&apos;s not what is happening here. More nuanced research is needed in order to tease out what is going on.Rev Anne Le BasSeal, Kent \u2022\u2008So church schools allegedly discriminate against the poor based on the dubious premise that, if the number of pupils receiving free school meals is low, this must mean that the majority of pupils come from &quot;well-heeled&quot; families. This ignores the fact that not all those who could benefit from free school meals qualify for them and families with a similar income who are not eligible are worse-off because they have to pay for meals. Then there are families who do not claim free school meals because of the stigmatising effect on their children; one of the reasons why the Child Poverty Action Group has called for all children to receive free school meals. Do you believe that if all schools were to become secular overnight, the problem of pushy parents trying to get their offspring into good schools would disappear? There are plenty of non-church schools that are equally oversubscribed by middle-class applicants and if, as the Church of England points out, local authorities manage the admissions in more that half of its schools then that hardly amounts to cherry-picking.Barry WadesonMilton Keynes \u2022\u2008If the social profile of church schools in deprived areas includes more rich pupils than that of their immediate neighbourhood, this is because the churches have created schools on council estates to which the middle classes are prepared to send their children. I am surprised that organisations concerned about class divisions do not regard this as a commendable. It is certainly better than the situation in Bristol where even people living on council estates cannot be persuaded to send their children to the secondary schools on those estates.John HallStoke Bishop, Bristol \u2022\u2008As a retired deputy headteacher of a large Catholic comprehensive school and currently a governor of a small Catholic primary school (both having within their catchment areas postcodes recognised as being of significant social deprivation), I can confirm that in both establishments the number of pupils on free school meals (FSM) is well above national averages. Also it would be of statistical interest to analyse the remaining faith schools as to what their proportion of pupils were on FSM (ie in the Catholic sector: 23.7% at secondary level and 35.3% at primary) and comparing these with the remainder.Bogumit PolachowskiWirral, Merseyside \u2022\u2008Although your article mentions the fact that the state-funded Muslim schools have &quot;more than the local authority average of free school meal pupils&quot;, not surprisingly the poor showing of church-run schools is used by the British Humanist Association (BHA) to call for &quot;the government to end faith-based selection in all state-funded schools&quot;. One has to assume that the BHA&apos;s intention is to end what it sees as &quot;inequality&quot; and yet, in its zeal to make all schools secular, they would do away with parental choice for those of us who believe that faith does indeed have an important role to play in education. That&apos;s hardly equality by any stretch of the imagination. I have no wish to impose faith schools on every Muslim parent, let alone those of other and no faith. why does the BHA wish to impose its secular agenda on everyone, humanist or not?Ibrahim HewittManaging trustee, Al-Aqsa Schools Trust", "tags": ["Faith schools", "School admissions", "Schools", "Education", "Poverty", "Social exclusion", "Society", "Anglicanism", "Religion", "Christianity", "Catholicism", "World news", "Education policy", "Politics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-07T20:59:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/09/constructive-criticism-architecture-skyscrapers", "sentences": ["According to the developers, it will leave Liverpool with a waterfront to rival those of Dubai, New York and Shanghai.", "It hasn&apos;t been designed yet (Chapman Taylor are the architects) but it already has a name: &quot;Shanghai tower&quot;."], "title": "Constructive criticism: the week in architecture", "article": "Tall buildings: stairways to celestial magnificence or the prongs of Satan&apos;s pitchforks? It&apos;s a debate that never goes away, and never seems to get any more nuanced, but both sides got more ammunition for their causes this week. On Tuesday, Richard Rogers nailed his colours to the (very tall) mast via a speech at MIPIM in Cannes, the property industry&apos;s annual bash. &quot;If you have high buildings, they might as well be as high as possible,&quot; he said, arguing that once you get above 10 storeys or so you&apos;ve lost contact with the ground, so buildings of 40 or 60 storeys might as well just keep going. &quot;If the Shard had 10 storeys more, who would it disturb?&quot; he asked. Before a mob of Londoners take up their own pitchforks in reply, Rogers wasn&apos;t saying you can put skyscrapers wherever you like now, but his general points were that they add to the city, and that the more expensive ones tend to be the most successful. Could he by any chance have his own 48-storey &quot;Cheesegrater&quot; in the City of London in mind? Or perhaps his 80-storey Three World Trade Centre, which has been capped at seven storeys until more tenants are found? By coincidence, Roger&apos;s old mate Norman Foster this week unveiled his designs for &quot;the tallest mixed-use towers in western Europe&quot;: a pair of 85-storey buildings in Paris. The towers are recognisably Fosterish, you could say, deploying the same faceted, diagrid language as his Hearst tower in New York. They&apos;ll contain a hotel and apartments, as well as the usual shops and business stuff, plus a new public plaza on the banks of the Seine. Parisians are even less well-disposed towards skyscrapers than Londoners, but these ones are at a safe remove, in Courbevoie, a good five miles from the city centre and close to La D\u00e9fense, where all the other skyscrapers are. Thus the Eiffel tower&apos;s central dominance remains unchallenged. But just to be safe, Foster&apos;s towers are four metres shorter than Eiffel&apos;s. And then what about Liverpool? The skyscraper debate is just warming up there, thanks to the city council&apos;s decision to approve the ambitious and controversial Liverpool Waters scheme. It&apos;s colossal in scale \u2013 a \u00a35.5bn investment, the UK&apos;s largest planning application, redeveloping 60 hectares of the city&apos;s historic docklands. According to the developers, it will leave Liverpool with a waterfront to rival those of Dubai, New York and Shanghai. But it will also detract from the city&apos;s famous &quot;Three Graces&quot; at Pier Head, critics say, and for that, Unesco has threatened to strip Liverpool&apos;s world heritage site status if Liverpool Waters goes ahead. The most heavily criticised part of the scheme is, of course, the skyscraper. It could well be the tallest building in Britain outside of London. It hasn&apos;t been designed yet (Chapman Taylor are the architects) but it already has a name: &quot;Shanghai tower&quot;. A public inquiry is likely the next step. Incidentally, if you were wondering how it turned out in the referendum on Aberdeen&apos;s City Garden (aka the Granite Web, or &quot;Teletubby Park&quot;, depending on whose side you&apos;re on), after last week&apos;s Constructive criticism: the result was a narrow &quot;Yes&quot;, by a margin of about 2,000 votes out of 86,000 cast. Or about 52% in favour of the garden. Scottish parliament is now debating whether that&apos;s enough.     New look \u2026 the Palace of Westminster seen through the London Eye at dusk. Photograph: Dominic Burke    On to other news. This week also saw the death of Lord St John of Fawsley, flamboyant politician, collector of royal memorabilia and longtime chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission, the architectural watchdog superseded by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. To some he was a champion of good design (&quot;a great supporter of modern architecture&quot;, Ken Shuttleworth told the Architects&apos; Journal), but to others he was the enemy. If he&apos;d had his way, the London Eye would never have been built. He undertook a personal crusade against the Eye and its designers, invoking its &quot;wholly unsuitable&quot; proximity to the City of Westminster \u2013 also a Unesco world heritage site \u2013 and demanding a public inquiry. Fortunately, the then secretary of state, John Gummer, didn&apos;t listen to him. On a brighter but still death-related note, if that&apos;s not a contradiction, it&apos;s just over three years since the passing of Jan Kaplick\u00fd \u2013 the pioneering, much-admired Czech-born architect fondly remembered as the friendly face of futuristic high-tech. The Birmingham Selfridges and his Stirling prize-winning Lord&apos;s Media Centre are his best-known works, but on Saturday a brand new Kaplick\u00fd building (well, sort of) opens in Modena, Italy: the Enzo Ferrari Museum.     Yellow fever \u2026 the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena, Italy, built according to a design by the late Jan Kaplick\u00fd. Photograph: Studio129.com    This striking building unashamedly speaks the language of sports cars, with its curvaceous, bright yellow aluminum roof and skylights resembling air intakes \u2013 thus ensuring maximum petrolhead pilgrimage-site status. It was actually executed by Andrea Morgante, formerly of Kaplick\u00fd&apos;s Future Systems and now director of his own Shiro Studio, but it&apos;s vintage Kaplick\u00fd. Not just in its attention grabbing and technical daring, but also in its energy efficiency and greater sensitivity to its surroundings than is first apparent. Those older buildings it wraps around in the foreground of the picture are Enzo Ferrari&apos;s original home and workshop, which have also been restored. The new building is sunk into the ground so as not to eclipse them. Under the yellow hood, it&apos;s one continuous, white, curving space, within which Ferrari&apos;s story is told via exhibits \u2013 including, of course, some priceless vintage cars.

Meanwhile, in the last race of what was the final day of the British Gas Swimming Championships, there was something of a shock as Daniel Fogg took gold in the 1500m freestyle final in a time of 14min 55.30, beating David Davies, the 2004 Olympic bronze medallist, into second place by almost six seconds. The pair were neck and neck up until the split but then Fogg, the 2010 Commonwealth bronze medallist, pulled away to record a personal best time and an English record. Both men, however, swam quick enough to make Team GB, with Davies, who won silver in the 10km marathon in Beijing four years ago, heading for his third Olympics. Fogg and Davies make it 28 swimmers (12 men and 16 women) who qualified for individual Olympic places during these eight-day trials. For those who failed here, a last chance to fill Team GB&apos;s 52 spots for the Games presents itself at June&apos;s ASA Championships in Sheffield. Whoever does make the final party will be under pressure to meet the target set by British swimming&apos;s performance director, Michael Scott, of winning six medals at the Games, the same number as they achieved in Beijing four years ago \u2013 which was the country&apos;s best Olympic haul in 100 years \u2013 and at last summer&apos;s world championships. The task is even tougher this time around given Team GB can only select two swimmers in the open water events \u2013 in which three medals were won in 2008 \u2013 meaning more medals will have to be won in the pool, but confidence can be taken from many of performances over the past week. For the men, for instance, Roberto Pavoni swam the fastest time in the world this year when he took gold in the 400m individual medley final (4min 12.43sec), while Joe Roebuck did the same in winning the 200m butterfly (1:55.94). Andrew Willis, meanwhile, set a new English record time when winning the 200m breaststroke (2:09.33). The women, who captured five of Britain&apos;s six medals at the world championships, have also impressed \u2013 Hannah Miley posted the world&apos;s best time upon taking gold in the 400m individual medley (4:32.67), while Ellen Gandy set a new British record time when she won the 100m butterfly (57.25). Rebecca Turner also became only the fifth British woman in history to swim under 1 minute 58 when she recorded a time of 1.57.65 in the 200m freestyle.

Britain won six swimming medals in Beijing, the country&apos;s best Olympic haul in 100 years. But repeating that feat will be tougher as, this time around, Team GB can select only two swimmers in the open water events \u2013 in which three medals were won in 2008 \u2013 meaning more will have to be secured in the pool. &quot;For Britain to win medals in any sport is tough because the Olympics are now a truly global competition, with more and more athletes helping to raise the standards across the board,&quot; said the Australia-born Scott, who was appointed performance director in September 2007. &quot;It is part of my job to set targets and [winning six medals] represents a significant challenge.

Payne is one of 12 swimmers within the 38 presented here on Saturday who have world championship medals, while there are 20 who hold British records. There are also a couple of world record holders, including Adlington, whose time of 8min 14.10sec set in the 800m freestyle final in Beijing has yet to be surpassed. In total, 28 swimmers (12 men and 16 women) qualified for individual events during these championships, with Joe Roebuck and Fran Halsall achieving places in three different individual Olympic disciplines. Among the rest, there were also notable landmarks, with those among the men particularly encouraging given their paucity of success in recent years \u2014 of the six medals Britain won at the 2011 world championships only one was achieved by a male swimmer; Liam Tancock&apos;s gold in the 50m breaststroke, an event that is not part of this year&apos;s Olympic roster. Here, Roberto Pavoni swam the fastest time in the world in 2012 when he took gold in the 400m individual medley final (4:12.43), while Roebuck did the same in winning the 200m butterfly (1:55.94). Andrew Willis, meanwhile, set a new English record time when winning the 200m breaststroke (2:09.33).

Jenova Chen, the designer of Journey, in a still from the documentary    &quot;I wanted another big project for myself, I wanted to spend my sixties productively,&quot; she tells me via a Skype connection from her home in Christchurch, New Zealand. &quot;I wanted to make a film that touched some of the grand themes. I do think there&apos;s a wonderfully rich and soulful layer to game production. I wanted to be part of telling that story with a documentary that has a life outside of the games industry hype. I could see that indie developers were slowing down to more reflective work in the face of this huge mainstream assault. I saw that as my point of entry.&quot; The result is Us and the Game Industry, a feature-length documentary, which Beth is currently shooting and editing. It is something of a meditation on the games creation process, and on the motivations of indie developers. Through the film, Beth follows the production of Journey, but also interviews Rohrer and other indie developers like Douglas Wilson, of Copenhagen studio Die Gute Fabrik, responsible for the genre-defying physical game, Johann Sebastian Joust.  &quot;I was inspired by titles like Flow, Aether, Passage, World of Goo and Braid,&quot; she says. &quot;These small games were designed to allow players to experience curiosity without their sensibilities being barraged by all the extras accrued in commercial games. They had a quieter purpose. It was this shift to more respect for the player&apos;s mood that was deeply exciting.&quot;     Stephanie Beth with indie game designers Edmund McMillen (left) and Daniel Benmergui at the Independent Games Festival    Beth has an eclectic working background. In the seventies and early eighties she made feminist documentaries I Want to be Joan and IN JOY before travelling extensively and then moving in to teaching. &quot;My undergraduate university life was fine arts, moving image and then some anthropology and cultural studies a decade later,&quot; she explains. During the last decade she has taught Media Studies and film production at the progressive Hagley Community College in Christchurch. Here, pupils habitually use creative games like LittleBigPlanet and Minecraft as a key element in their studies.  For Beth, games are about much more than throwaway entertainment. Indie titles like the heavily spiritual Journey and Rohrer&apos;s collaborative narrative adventure Sleep is Death explore the sorts of themes tackled by the great indie filmmakers, and do so in similarly expressionistic ways. &quot;Game design is the 21st century frontier,&quot; she says. &quot;There is an opportunity to engage in a quest, whether that&apos;s intellectual, spiritual or emotional.  &quot;There&apos;s been a great convergence of the media. How wonderful that the virtual world has widened our space \u2013 and we need space to not feel crazy. These forms \u2013 these games \u2013 are now superior, in terms of speed, impact and participation, to the long forms we&apos;ve had since the nineteenth century. We don&apos;t need long narratives as much anymore \u2013 a French friend of mine keeps reminding me that the French language is just an antique luxury now!&quot; Throughout our chat, we keep returning to this notion that indie developers are the modern equivalent of the counter-culture artists and musicans of the sixties. In the US, the indie games scene is heavily centred around San Francisco, the birthplace of the hippy movement. Lots of the key developers are based here, plus major indie-friendly events like the Game Developers Conference and Independent Games Festival take place in the city. Undoubtedly, of course, many are here because of the area&apos;s role in the development of computer technology. From the forties, nearby Silicon Valley has been the beating heart of the US tech industry, while the dot com boom of the nineties saw hundreds of internet start-ups hit the city. But then, the computer industry and the rise of psychedelic culture in San Francisco share similar origins. Stanford University provided many of the brilliant graduates who would go on to populate the research centres of Silicon Valley, but it was also where Ken Kesey experimented with LCD and where many of the major Vietnam War protests began.  With indie studios like thatgamecompany, there is a similar concern with exploring the parameters of audio visual experience. Jenova Chen&apos;s first commercial PlayStation game, Flow, is essentially a psychedelic music toy, while titles like Aether and Braid are surreal meditations that carry some of the spirit of Frank Zappa and Terry Southern.  &quot;The sixties was all about this urgency to critique the fetid decline of apathetic civilisation,&quot; says Beth. &quot;It&apos;s incredibly important to support people who are forlorn with the way the world is. That&apos;s where game development has given fresh hope \u2013 it&apos;s an open space; it&apos;s a space to feel alive in. That&apos;s what excited me about these people making games - there is an emotional timbre to why they&apos;re doing it. There is a soul.&quot;     The creative puzzler, Crayon Physics Deluxe    Interestingly, Beth is looking to raise money for her film using the same crowd-sourcing techniques as the game makers themselves. She has set up a page on the funding website Kickstarter, which is mostly used by media companies and game makers who want to appeal directly to their supporters and communities rather than venture capitalists or mainstream publishers. Popular US indie developer Double Fine has just raised over $2m for its next title using the site. Beth&apos;s plan is to get the movie into festivals over the summer, and then start looking for a cinematic distributor. It will also be available via DVD and internet streaming, but she wants to get these games on the big screen in front of a more mainstream film-going audience. And this isn&apos;t the only current work exploring the indie games community. Filmmakers James Swirsky and Lisanne Pajot are currently touring the festivals with Indie Games: The Movie, another documentary interviewing and analysing the works of North American game makers, most notably, Phil Fish, the creator of the surreal and ingenious platform game, Fez, and Edmund McMillen, co-creator of the Xbox indie hit, Super Meat Boy. Theirs is perhaps a more conventional work, more knowingly structured as an &apos;outsiders-done-good&apos; tale. It got a standing ovation when shown at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last week and is due for a DVD and internet streaming release later this year. Did it worry Beth that another indie games movie was doing the rounds? &quot;As soon as I was aware that it was being made, I sort of switched off to it,&quot; she says. It was more about not wanting to be influenced by their approach or their subjects, though, rather than worrying about competition. &quot;I thought it was exciting because it&apos;s more media about this point in the games industry - it just shows the depth of material there is in this realm. And I knew it wouldn&apos;t be the same, structurally. I knew I&apos;d have a different pace, a different tempo and a calmer scrutiny.&quot;     The collaborative story-telling game, Sleep is Death, by Jason Rohrer    We talk a little about the way indie games are seeping in to the mainstream. While massive titles like Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto are still making billions of dollars, many publishers are struggling to attract big audiences with their conventional Triple AAA releases \u2013 so they&apos;re looking toward the indie sector for inspiration. Sony has funded the development of Journey, as well as other smallscale projects, while mega-publishers like Electronic Arts are keenly scouring the indie scene for offbeat titles. Many games industry watchers are wondering whether we&apos;re reaching the point that the movie business got to in the late-sixties, when the major studios just lost touch with their audience and started giving creative freedom to auteurs like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin.  &quot;The interface between art and technology is becoming more sophisticated now and that means people are not as impressed with advanced technology for technology&apos;s sake,&quot; says Beth. &quot;That&apos;s a great place to be, to really look at this form. I&apos;d like to think this film will communicate the &apos;wow&apos; factor of indie games \u2013 the players and the makers both embody this excitement. Games give us the opportunity to indulge in curiosity, they provide factors that keep the brain active - and that helps human growth.&quot; What Beth also sees in indie gaming right now, which again takes us right back to the counter-culture movement, is this sense of youth and alienation, of frustration with the order. And sometimes of brilliance. &quot;You must take a stand in your twenties,&quot; she says. &quot;You have to work alone to see where you can rank yourself as a designer or programmer. You need to know that you can take the whole thing through to completion without falling apart.  &quot;Every developer makes a decision about the meaning of life. Game design is for the bright and the focused, it&apos;s not for everyone. It&apos;s an incredibly hard discipline.&quot; You can find out more about Us and the Game Industry at the film&apos;s dedicated website.", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "Film", "Documentary", "Indie games", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-12T15:53:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/13/f1-2012-circuit-guide", "sentences": ["China \u25b6 Shanghai \u25b6 15 April \u25b6 8am \u2022 Laps 56 Lap length 3.39 miles 2011 winner L Hamilton \u2022 f1.f1china.com.cn \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Lewis Hamilton  I&apos;ve won in China twice and last year&apos;s victory was one of my favourites because it was so touch-and-go whether I&apos;d even get on to the grid after we suffered a fuel leak in the garage.", "Shanghai&apos;s a good circuit for racing because there&apos;s a 1km straight followed by a first-gear hairpin, so you can really be late on the brakes and pass somebody; with Kers and now DRS it&apos;s even more exciting."], "title": "F1 2012 circuit guide", "article": "Australia \u25b6 Melbourne \u25b6 18 March \u25b6 6am \u2022 Laps 58 Lap length 3.30 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 grandprix.com.au \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 2pm Expert view Lewis Hamilton  Most drivers on the grid will know Albert Park as the track where they started their Formula One careers \u2013 that&apos;s true for me and I&apos;ve had some great races here. It&apos;s probably the best place in the world to kick off a new season: the people are friendly and passionate, the weather is fantastic and the track always seems to produce eventful racing. The best part of the circuit is probably the S-bend section at the end of the back straight: it&apos;s super-fast and requires real precision to get it just right.  Behind the BBC mic David Coulthard  Not a classic from a driver challenge point of view but it&apos;s a tricky little place and it gets your attention in the middle sector because, if you make a mistake, you&apos;re in a wall. That&apos;s the sort of street part of the track. A nice place to start the season.  Malaysia \u25b6 Sepang \u25b6 25 March \u25b6 9am \u2022 Laps 56 Lap length 3.44 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 malaysiangp.com.my \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 2.45pm Expert view Sebastian Vettel  Malaysia is the first real track we go to, as Australia is a semi-street circuit. It&apos;s hot and rains every day but the question is when and how much? It will be a tricky one. Circuit-wise you&apos;ve got everything in there; Turn 14 requires you to brake the car while you&apos;re still turning into the corner, which makes it quite challenging. Generally the overseas races are special, as you go there a few days earlier than usual, so you get to see different things.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  A great challenge for the drivers \u2013 not only a demanding track with the humidity and temperature but on a par with Barcelona in terms of challenging the car at low, medium and high speed. It&apos;s also right by the airport, so it&apos;s a piece of piss to get in and out on a Sunday.  China \u25b6 Shanghai \u25b6 15 April \u25b6 8am \u2022 Laps 56 Lap length 3.39 miles 2011 winner L Hamilton \u2022 f1.f1china.com.cn \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Lewis Hamilton  I&apos;ve won in China twice and last year&apos;s victory was one of my favourites because it was so touch-and-go whether I&apos;d even get on to the grid after we suffered a fuel leak in the garage. Shanghai&apos;s a good circuit for racing because there&apos;s a 1km straight followed by a first-gear hairpin, so you can really be late on the brakes and pass somebody; with Kers and now DRS it&apos;s even more exciting. The city itself is pretty incredible, too. It&apos;s huge and pulsating, like something out of a sci-fi movie.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  I think they designed the first corner to show a Chinese character for yin and yang and any circuit that features a corner based on looking like a Chinese character, that&apos;s got to be going at it the wrong way. So the opening corner is not at all in balance, it&apos;s crap.  Bahrain \u25b6 Sakhir \u25b6 22 April \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 57 Lap length 3.36 miles 2010 winner F Alonso \u2022 bahraingp.com \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 5.30pm Expert view Heikki Kovalainen  Bahrain holds great memories for our team as it was our first race back in 2010 where we got both cars across the finish line. The track surface is pretty sandy as it&apos;s not used a lot, so the Friday sessions are always a waiting game while the track is cleaned up. The heat isn&apos;t an issue. I train hard to be able to cope with all the conditions and, as it&apos;s a dry heat, it&apos;s not a tough race physically. But it is one of the longer lap times on the calendar, so you have to make sure you keep pushing the whole way round.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  It&apos;s not a classic grand prix track in terms of any single corners standing out as being a real yahoo for the drivers but unfortunately the Bahrain Grand Prix is now more about the political statement than it is about the race. Personally I think that is a shame.  Spain \u25b6 Barcelona \u25b6 13 May \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 66 Lap length 2.87 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 circuitcat.com \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Mark Webber  The circuit is great; the surface and layout are both very good for driving an F1 car on the limit. The last sector used to be very, very quick and now, for the last few years, we&apos;ve had a slow chicane which breaks the rhythm of the lap up a bit, but I enjoy driving the car on this track. It&apos;s one of the best races of the season in terms of atmosphere because of the support Fernando gets. I love the drivers&apos; parade when we see the fireworks in the crowd going off and they sing songs, too. It is always entertaining.   David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Great. Physically demanding and the benchmark in F1 for all-round car and driver performance. But it doesn&apos;t always offer the best racing, for sure, not helped by recent changes when they put a chicane into the last two corners because of the need to slow the cars down.  Monaco \u25b6 Monte Carlo \u25b6 27 May \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 78 Lap length 2.08 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 formula1monaco.com \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Sebastian Vettel  It&apos;s remarkable to drive an F1 car around Monaco. It&apos;s a unique track and a unique challenge for the driver. In Monaco you have to push as hard as you do on a usual race track but the smallest mistake can bring a big penalty. Grid position is very important there and can determine your race as, traditionally, overtaking in Monaco is very tricky. Managing the traffic during qualifying in Monaco is also a big challenge. As an event it&apos;s one of the highlights of the year.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  The ultimate challenge for a grand prix. If you took someone there today and said: &quot;We&apos;d like to do a grand prix around the streets of this principality,&quot; they&apos;d think you&apos;d gone mad. Blink at the wrong time and you crash the car and you&apos;re out. It is fantastic.  Canada \u25b6 Montreal \u25b6 10 June \u25b6 7pm \u2022 Laps 70 Lap length 2.71 miles 2011 winner J Button \u2022 circuitgillesvilleneuve.ca \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 10.30pm Expert view Jenson Button  Even before I won here last year this was one of my favourite events. Montreal is one of the nicest, most relaxed cities we visit and the early-summer date always seems perfect. The circuit is really old-school \u2013 it&apos;s penned by concrete barriers and there&apos;s little room to make mistakes. The nature of the track really sparks unpredictable and exciting racing, whether it&apos;s wet or dry. Taking the lead on the last lap last year will remain one of the greatest moments of my F1 career.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Another great track because it has a street-circuit feel, with the skyline of Montreal in the background. A unique challenge because of its low downforce, high speeds and tight chicanes. Braking from 200mph gets your attention. Trust me.  Europe \u25b6 Valencia \u25b6 24 June \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 57 Lap length 3.37 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 valenciastreetcircuit.com \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Lewis Hamilton  People tend to overlook Valencia but make no mistake: this is a tough venue. The track itself is one long series of corners \u2013 you never really get a chance for a break \u2013 so it&apos;s extremely tiring in the cockpit. Add in the searing summer temperatures and you have all the ingredients for a really exhausting weekend \u2013 it&apos;s a race that requires special preparation. It&apos;s a difficult place for passing, so qualifying is all-important. Then it&apos;s all about hanging in there on Sunday afternoon.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Valencia is a city leveraging the attraction of F1, its media and positive publicity, as a priority rather than creating a grand prix track that will be challenging or interesting for the drivers and teams. Not an interesting racetrack. Lovely city, though.  Britain \u25b6 Silverstone \u25b6 8 July \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 52 Lap length 3.66 miles 2011 winner F Alonso \u2022 silverstone.co.uk \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Sebastian Vettel  One of my favourite tracks and not just because it&apos;s 30km from our factory. The fans in Britain are special. They support their own people, of course, but they really know so much about our sport and are really fair about acknowledging performance and achievement. The extreme bend combinations on the track make it a real pleasure for the drivers. There are fast corners and often we have to react to the tricky weather conditions. Copse, Maggots, Becketts and Chapel are four of the best corners in Formula One.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Has retained, through all the changes, its high-speed essence. Scored a bit of an own goal by putting in a pitlane that&apos;s lower than the pit wall, so people can&apos;t see in. That said, Silverstone has been created anew and drivers love it because it&apos;s all high-speed, yahoo stuff.  Germany \u25b6 Hockenheim \u25b6 22 July \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 67 Lap length 2.84 miles 2010 winner F Alonso \u2022 hockenheimring.net \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 5.30pm Expert view Heikki Kovalainen  Germany&apos;s always a good race. Hockenheim&apos;s usually hot and the fans make sure there&apos;s a great atmosphere. For the drivers it&apos;s cool; we can see all the fans packed into the stands and it looks pretty hardcore. The circuit itself is good. You can overtake at the end of the long straight at the hairpin but there aren&apos;t many other places where you can get past. It&apos;s relatively hard on tyres and in the past the heat has made the tyres blister but that won&apos;t be an issue this year; it&apos;ll be about managing the degradation.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  A shadow of its former glory \u2013 the old Hockenheim was a great challenge. Nonetheless the stadium section is like an amphitheatre. You get 80-odd thousand drunken Germans blowing the klaxons and drinking beer. Not a classic for lots of overtaking but deserves its place.  Hungary \u25b6 Budapest \u25b6 29 July \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 70 Lap length 2.72 miles 2011 winner J Button \u2022 hungaroring.hu \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 5.30pm Expert view Sebastian Vettel  One of the hardest races. It can get very hot in the cockpit, which means we lose a lot of body fluid. There are a lot of bumps on the track and, because it has hardly any straights, you have almost no chance to &apos;rest&apos;. There are three extremely slow corners and it&apos;s hard to overtake there while on the start and finish lines we reach a top speed of 315kph [195mph]. We get a good shaking through the first corner due to the bumps; it&apos;s really the only place where you can overtake.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Great track because it&apos;s just relentless. It&apos;s corner, corner, corner \u2013 like Monaco without the armco barriers. Physically tough, mentally tough, difficult to overtake but that just puts a premium on the drivers in qualifying. Good crowd, lots of Finns, lots of Poles.  Belgium \u25b6 Spa \u25b6 2 September \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 44 Lap length 4.35 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 spa-francorchamps.be \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Jenson Button  Every driver loves coming to Spa. It&apos;s one of the few truly historic venues we visit and a place that commands the respect of every person in Formula One. There&apos;s so much about the place to love: Eau Rouge and Pouhon are two of the best corners on the calendar but the whole track just flows beautifully from one corner to the next. The weather is unique: one side of the circuit can be dry while the other is pouring with rain \u2013 so winning here is a special achievement.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Great track. Drivers, of course, love it. Very challenging: high speed, uphill, downhill, unpredictable weather. It just has your heart pumping and your adrenaline absolutely off the scale. That&apos;s all there is to it. Great track.  Italy \u25b6 Monza \u25b6 9 September \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 53 Lap length 3.60 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 monzanet.it \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 5.30pm Expert view Sebastian Vettel  Monza holds incredibly special memories for me, as it&apos;s where I scored my first-ever F1 win, with Toro Rosso in 2008. The circuit is one of the most challenging. It includes long straights where we reach more than 320kph, making it the fastest track. It is not physically demanding but it is not easy. Because of the straights we drive with less rear wing, so the car can be more unstable; accelerating out of Parabolica is a balancing act and the smallest mistake could mean the car slipping into the gravel trap.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  When you disappear out the back and see the old banking it gives you a sense of its historic place in F1. The Italian crowd is incredible \u2013 the passion and the energy \u2013 and, although it doesn&apos;t always get the best racing, with DRS on the long straights it was better last year.  Singapore \u25b6 Marina Bay \u25b6 23 Sep \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 61 Lap length 3.15 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 singaporegp.sg \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Lewis Hamilton  I think the idea of racing grand prix cars at night is absolutely fantastic \u2013 and the organisers in Singapore have done an incredible job in just a couple of years to make their race one of the most famous, iconic and desirable venues on the F1 calendar. This is another tough track: the heat and humidity are intense, even in the relative cool of the night, and the track never stops turning. It&apos;s incredibly bumpy too, so your body gets rattled for two solid hours. It&apos;s a great challenge \u2013 I love it.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Wonderful. Incredible backdrop, works well as a night-time venue. Physically tough - I know the drivers of late have asked for the race to be shortened, which obviously the FIA haven&apos;t done, and I&apos;m glad they haven&apos;t because grand prix racing should be demanding.  Japan \u25b6 Suzuka \u25b6 7 October \u25b6 7am \u2022 Laps 53 Lap length 3.61 miles 2011 winner J Button \u2022 mobilityland.co.jp/english/suzuka \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 2pm Expert view Jenson Button  Suzuka is one of the few legendary venues on the Formula One calendar. There&apos;s a lot of history to the place: it&apos;s where Senna and Prost had some brilliant battles and it&apos;s a track where you can really feel the ghosts of the past. The barriers are very close to the track in some places and the corners are tricky \u2013 get it wrong and you can easily crash and destroy a corner of the car. Japan feels like my second home, so winning there in 2011 was a special moment for me.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Absolutely fantastic. Any driver that goes there for the first time, their eyes are out on stalks. The sequence behind the pits \u2013 fast, narrow. Watch Senna&apos;s qualifying lap in the McLaren. Incredible. Lots of history. Middle of nowhere, pain in the arse to get to but just brilliant.  Korea \u25b6 Yeongam \u25b6 14 October \u25b6 7am \u2022 Laps 55 Lap length 3.49 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 koreangp.kr \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Sebastian Vettel  The circuit is very demanding and quite tight, especially at the pitlane entry. You actually drive almost blind along the wall and, if the car in front of you drives into the pit, you have to get out of the way quickly. It is effectively made up of three parts: the first reminds me of Turkey, the second stretch has long straights like Monza and the third has tight corners like a town track. It&apos;s important to find a rhythm. I find corner 11, which has two apexes, the most interesting.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Another exercise in ticking an advertising box. More to do with attracting media exposure than it is about the circuit. The location&apos;s not great and, although the drivers talk fondly about it, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to go down as a classic grand prix track.  India \u25b6 Delhi \u25b6 28 October \u25b6 9.30am \u2022 Laps 60 Lap length 3.19 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 jaypeesports.com \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 2pm Expert view Jenson Button  The Buddh International track felt like more an old, undiscovered track from F1&apos;s past when we raced there for the first time last year. It&apos;s fast, flowing and really satisfying \u2013 a bit like Spa but with all the facilities of a 21st-century venue \u2013 and, uniquely, features huge, wide-open approaches to the hairpins, which makes defending from another car particularly tricky. It&apos;s a good idea and works well. India&apos;s an amazing place \u2013 I loved the race last year \u2013 and I really hope the sport gains support.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Drivers speak favourably of the track. They put a bit of undulation in there, which gives a different feeling in the car. The venue looks a bit pieced together, although it does work; it&apos;s nice to be in India. I think the drivers like it which is always a good thing. You can&apos;t fake that.  Abu Dhabi \u25b6 Yas Marina \u25b6 4 Nov \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 55 Lap length 3.45 miles 2011 winner L Hamilton \u2022 yasmarinacircuit.ae \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Sebastian Vettel  The track in Abu Dhabi is special. The race starts at dusk and finishes at night, which means we have to drive with special helmet visors. The other factor is that we drive anti-clockwise. The track&apos;s a bit like Singapore from the speed but the asphalt is smoother. There are two special features \u2013 one is the passage under the Yas Hotel, as where else can you drive under your room? The second is the pitlane exit. It&apos;s partly underground and feels like you&apos;re coming out of an underground parking garage.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  The racetrack&apos;s not the best but in terms of a venue for a sporting event and people moving around, for the teams and for the drivers, it works on many levels. But it will never be a classic grand prix track. That said, we&apos;ve had some interesting battles there.  USA \u25b6 Austin \u25b6 18 November \u25b6 7pm \u2022 Laps 56 Lap length 3.43 miles \u2022 circuitoftheamericas.com \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 10.30pm Expert view David Coulthard  The guys involved have come at it the right way. It&apos;s built on the side of a hill so there is natural undulation to try to replicate some of the classic corners from around the world. The Becketts sequence at Silverstone, Turn 8 in Turkey, a rise up to Turn 1 a bit like the old \u00d6sterreichring \u2013 they&apos;ve put in some incredible sections. Austin&apos;s a great town, young vibe. It&apos;s close to South America so it taps into support for P\u00e9rez and Maldonado. And, in case it&apos;s of interest, three of the last five playmates of the year have come from Austin.

She\u00a0was the daughter of Clive Brook, a pillar of the so-called Hollywood Raj, the British acting community that settled in Los Angeles in the 1930s. He appeared opposite Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express. Even if she was never a star on the scale of her father, Faith enjoyed a rich and productive career in theatre, film and television on both sides of the Atlantic. She was born in York and moved with Clive and her mother, Mildred, to\u00a0California, where her father had already put down roots. Her brother, Lyndon, was born four years after Faith and also became a successful actor. She was educated in Los Angeles, London and Gstaad, Switzerland. She made her stage debut in Santa Barbara in September 1941 in Enid Bagnold&apos;s Lottie Dundass and a few months later appeared on the New York stage. She returned to Britain in the middle of\u00a0the second world war, serving with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and joining the Stars in Battledress unit that brought drama to the troops. Among the roles she played was that of the anguished wife, Patricia, who forsakes her film-star lover for her fighter-pilot husband in Terence Rattigan&apos;s intensely moving Flare Path. In 1946 Brook joined the Bristol Old Vic, which shared with Birmingham Rep premier league status among regional theatres and offered all the benefits of a permanent company. In one season alone, she played Dorinda in George Farquhar&apos;s The Beaux&apos; Stratagem, Olivia in Twelfth Night and Pauline in Jenny Villiers. Back in London, she joined the Old Vic company at the New theatre. She was much praised, once again, for her aristocratic Olivia in a Twelfth Night directed by Alec Guinness; for her flirtatious Millamant in William Congreve&apos;s The Way of the World; and for her performance as the eccentric governess Charlotta in an exquisite revival of The Cherry Orchard, starring Edith Evans and Cedric Hardwicke. Had she chosen, Brook might have become a leading classical player in\u00a0the Peggy Ashcroft mould. But her American upbringing enabled her to\u00a0appear freely in the US, where she spent much of the early 1950s. She took over the role of the martyred missionary Celia Coplestone, crucified &quot;very near an ant-hill&quot;, in the Broadway production of TS Eliot&apos;s The Cocktail Party. She also played Shaw and Shakespeare in\u00a0summer stock, was the scissor-wielding Sheila in Frederick Knott&apos;s Dial\u00a0M for Murder and had a leading role in an American TV series, Claudia: The\u00a0Story of a Marriage. But a slight mystery remains as to why, with her looks and talent, she did not seize the moment to become a dominant force in\u00a0British theatre. Instead, she continued to commute between New York and the West End, where she appeared in a great variety of plays: sometimes challenging stuff such as Sartre&apos;s Vicious Circle or Charles Morgan&apos;s The Burning Glass, at other times quilted divertissements such as Roar Like a Dove or Licence to Murder. Occasionally she vouchsafed glimpses of something remarkable. She was Dalila opposite Michael Redgrave&apos;s towering Samson in a revival of Milton&apos;s Samson Agonistes that opened the Yvonne Arnaud theatre, Guildford, in 1965. She was also a memorably sensuous and drink-fuddled Gertrude to Ian McKellen&apos;s Hamlet in a revival that came to the Cambridge theatre in\u00a0London in 1971. And she was excellent playing opposite Guinness, her old friend, in\u00a01975 in Alan Bennett&apos;s The Old Country, about a public-school Marxist living in Russian exile. In her 80s, she returned to York to perform an extended monologue, The Colour of Poppies, based on a novel by No\u00eblle Ch\u00e2telet. Alongside her stage work, Brook appeared in a great number of films, starting with Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Suspicion (1941) and including The 39 Steps (1959), To Sir, With Love (1967) and Eileen Atkins&apos;s version of Mrs Dalloway (1997). She appeared in many classic TV series such as the BBC&apos;s War and Peace (1972-74) and Channel 4&apos;s The Irish RM (1983-84). In private, she was a longtime member of the British Humanist Society. While it may be ungrateful to wish that she had spent more time conquering the commanding heights of the classic repertory, she brought class, style, vocal clarity and an enduring beauty to everything she did. She was married twice: first to Charles Moffett and then to Michael Horowitz, with whom she had a son, Brook. Both marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her son. \u2022 Faith Brook, actor, born 16 February 1922; died 11 March 2012", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Stage", "Television", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-14T12:56:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/15/jackie-chan-1911-revolution", "sentences": ["In his English-language output, especially, he can&apos;t help but be endearing \u2013 something that led him down some dark alleys in the last decade, as Rush Hour gave way to Shanghai Noon, which gave way to Shanghai Knights and Around the World in 80 Days and, God help us all, The Tuxedo."], "title": "Jackie Chan's 1911: Revolution puts him at 100 not out", "article": "Jackie Chan&apos;s 100th film is, by anybody&apos;s standards, not a good one. A vanity project of the worst kind, 1911: Revolution is his version of Kevin Costner&apos;s The Postman. Even at 93 minutes, it feels about half an hour too long. What begins as something sober and sumptuous, 1911: Revolution quickly becomes stilted and po-faced. It&apos;s ostensibly about the Xinhai revolution, in which China&apos;s last imperial dynasty was overthrown, but whatever dramatic potential that offers quickly gets lost in the endless explanatory text and the meandering subplots about railway finances. The toe-curlingly awkward tracts of English-language sequences don&apos;t help (at one point an American character exclaims: &quot;Chinese revolution is the only thing that can make exciting history!&quot;) as does the fact that Jackie Chan keeps dying and springing back to life with such regularity that you can barely keep count. Its 9% Rotten Tomatoes rating is entirely justified. And as star, executive producer and co-director, it&apos;s hard to lay the blame with anyone but Chan. This is a shame, because 1911: Revolution should have been his victory lap. He has made a century of films \u2013 many of them funny and breathless and dizzying and kinetic \u2013 and yet 1911: Revolution is a reflection of none of them. Admittedly, he&apos;s 57 now, so it might be unfair to expect him to ping off walls with the same lovable abandon he first showed 34 years ago in Drunken Master. The thing that set Chan apart from his kung-fu contemporaries was his lightness of touch. Bruce Lee was defined by his laser focus, and Chuck Norris by all the jokes about his beard, but Chan was happy to play the amiable goofball. In his English-language output, especially, he can&apos;t help but be endearing \u2013 something that led him down some dark alleys in the last decade, as Rush Hour gave way to Shanghai Noon, which gave way to Shanghai Knights and Around the World in 80 Days and, God help us all, The Tuxedo.            But this was a side effect \u2013 albeit a blazingly lucrative one \u2013 of Chan&apos;s ability to lend a human face to films that were quite often defined by their elaborate stunt work. He has been doing this since the 70s, in everything from Snake in the Eagle&apos;s Shadow to Rumble in the Bronx, and there&apos;s genuinely nobody better in the world at it. Take a look at the incredible, balletic climax to the first Police Story film if you want proof. In one nine-minute sequence, Chan kicks and leaps and smacks his way through an entire army of baddies in a shopping centre with such berserk speed and inventiveness that it&apos;s hard not to be completely struck dumb by its brilliance. Some stars may be as funny as Chan is in Police Story. Others may be (almost) as acrobatic. But only Chan can combine the two so effortlessly. Let&apos;s hope he&apos;ll be back to what he does best in his next film. Then again, according to IMDb, that&apos;ll be a project entitled Chinese Zodiac. Like 1911: Revolution, Chan will once more star and direct. But this time he&apos;s also written the script. And he&apos;s hired Kenny G. As an actor.

State news agency Xinhua announced Bo Xilai&apos;s removal as Chongqing party secretary in a one-sentence statement on Thursday morning, hours after premier Wen Jiabao took a thinly veiled swipe at him. Bo, a complex and divisive figure, had been tipped to join China&apos;s top political body in this autumn&apos;s power transition, until a scandal broke involving his former ally and police chief, Wang Lijun, who visited the US consulate in Chengdu last month, amid rumours he wished to defect after a rift with Bo. &quot;After Wang Lijun&apos;s case, Bo should have resigned himself. But he didn&apos;t want to and instead fought back with a high profile,&quot; said political scientist Zhang Ming of Renmin University. &quot;Considering Bo&apos;s attitude, it&apos;s possible that the transition would have difficulties [without his removal]\u00a0\u2026It shows there are still people supporting him, but Wang Lijun&apos;s case makes them unable to say anything.&quot; In the end, the party knifed the charismatic politician on the Ides of March. &quot;Bo was really the only politician since 1978 to trumpet his own movement independently of the party centre. That must have alarmed other senior figures in the party, suggesting he was someone who could upset the political equilibrium,&quot; said Victor Shih, an expert on elite politics at Northwestern University. &quot;Certainly, this is the biggest sign of political conflict we have seen since the removal of Chen Liangyu as party secretary of Shanghai [in 2006].&quot; Xi Jinping will almost certainly become general secretary this autumn \u2013 and then president of China \u2013 while Li Keqiang is expected to become premier. But Cheng Li of the Brookings Institute said the prospect of Bo rising to the Politburo standing committee had still caused alarm. &quot;China is ruled by collective leadership and Xi Jinping is only first among equals. To some extent, if the standing committee see a crisis in the country and the top leaders cannot handle it, other leaders will seize the moment. Bo Xilai&apos;s ambitions would not stop at the standing committee,&quot; he said. Bo earned a reputation as an ambitious and effective leader in Dalian, northern China. Once promoted to the Chongqing post, he launched &quot;sing red and strike black&quot; campaigns, promoting &quot;red culture&quot; and cracking down on organised crime, which grabbed national attention. Many applauded the anti-crime drive for making the city safer, but others complained it trampled over the law. &quot;There are two groups of people who really don&apos;t like him: the political elite, for various reasons, and liberal intellectuals, because of the cultural revolution style elements of his movement,&quot; said Li. Many suspected political manoeuvring was behind Wang&apos;s apparent flight. He is under investigation and Xinhua confirmed he was no longer vice-mayor of Chongqing. Bo fought back last week in a press conference at the annual session of the National People&apos;s Congress, China&apos;s rubber stamp parliament, saying Wang&apos;s was an isolated case and adding that he was not under investigation himself. But the premier used his annual press conference on Wednesday to chide Bo, saying the Chongqing party leadership needed to learn lessons from the case. Vice-premier Zhang Dejiang, who, like Bo is a &quot;princeling&quot; \u2013 the son of a key party figure \u2013 will replace Bo and keep his current portfolio. Zhang has enjoyed the patronage of former president Jiang Zemin. Shih said the choice of Zhang suggested a major investigation into Bo was unlikely, adding: &quot;I suspect Bo Xilai still has considerable support in the party and more importantly the military so opponents are not able to go their way.&quot; Independent Beijing-based journalist Li Datong said Bo&apos;s political life was over, adding: &quot;He will probably be granted some idle position, like deputy chairman of the Chinese People&apos;s Political Consultative Conference or the NPC.&quot; But Cheng Li, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the decision to make the announcement immediately after the NPC suggested a Beijing-based inquiry might be under way already, albeit perhaps for a minor offence such as poor judgement in personnel. &quot;There is a possibility he might not return to Chongqing because he may be under investigation in Beijing,&quot; said Li. Bo&apos;s political demise has been played out in strikingly public fashion in a system that relies on censorship to conceal differences and protect its image of unity. The widespread discussion of the Wang Lijun incident and its fallout on Sina&apos;s Weibo microblog suggested that at least some senior figures were happy to see Bo&apos;s problems aired. Rumours of his firing began circulating on Weibo more than an hour before the official announcement. By Thursday night, Weibo searches for the name of his wife, Gu Kailai, returned a message saying results could not be shown due to regulations. It was not clear why searches for Gu, a prominent lawyer and the daughter of another Communist veteran, should be sensitive. During his press conference last week, Bo complained that critics had &quot;poured filth&quot; on him and his family. There was a mix of celebration and lamentation among microbloggers at Bo&apos;s fall. &quot;Haha, Bo Xilai is finally down \u00a0\u2026 Support Wen, support the reformists. The cultural revolution should not be restored,&quot; wrote one user. But a staunch defender wrote: &quot;The victim of political struggles! The Communist party of China is the largest gangster in the world.&quot; David Kelly, of research and information consultancy China Policy, noted that the &quot;Chongqing model&quot; was more complex than the attention-grabbing campaigns suggested, with a focus on social justice, but added that it existed before Bo&apos;s arrival. &quot;He was brought in to break a deadlock, since the innovations were not going very well because of local resistance ... He is a high risk-taker,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;The lesson would be not to take risks. And that&apos;s not really what was hoped for, because you do need a circuit-breaker.&quot; &quot;We can only say goodbye to Uncle Bo, the one that Chongqing people support!&quot; noted another.", "tags": ["China", "Wen Jiabao", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Bo Xilai"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-15T19:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/15/bo-xilai-china-analysis", "sentences": ["Bringing Bo down has implications for those top leaders from privileged backgrounds like Bo, known popularly as the princelings, who enjoy support from former general secretary Jiang Zemin, head of the old &quot;Shanghai faction&quot;."], "title": "China's leaders in a sweat over downfall of princeling Bo Xilai | Professor Steve Tsang", "article": "Bo Xilai is down, but is he out? No one outside the inner core of the Chinese Communist party leadership knows for sure. Perhaps even those inside do not yet know. The future of Bo, until Thursday the powerful party secretary of Chongqing, is still being decided. He has not lost membership of the politburo and is not officially under arrest \u2013 at least not yet. But why is his downfall, or at least his disgrace, being played out in slow motion? It is all about the political system and the nature of politics in the People&apos;s Republic, which is consultative Leninist in nature. To bring someone as senior and powerful as Bo down is highly painful for the party, which is the establishment in China. Factional divisions and interest groups within the party mean that delicate negotiation and balancing need to be undertaken before the fate of someone like Bo can be decided. It is not up to General Secretary Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, while the general public can only be spectators. We knew Bo was in trouble when his former key lieutenant and security chief, Wang Lijun, sought asylum in the US consulate in Chengdu last month and was taken to Beijing \u2013 against the wishes of Bo. That his trouble continued was confirmed when he failed to appear for a day at the National People&apos;s Congress last week. We further know that either a deal was made or he fought back when he then hosted a press conference in Beijing. We also know that it was not over when Premier Wen specifically warned the Party faithful on Wednesday that if political reforms (ie the Hu-Wen approach) were not faithfully implemented, the risk of a new Cultural Revolution would re-emerge. Bo is the only truly charismatic top-level leader China has had since Deng Xiaoping died in 1997. Only a powerful figure like him would have any chance of launching something like a Cultural Revolution, which was about utilising and mobilising the general public to seize power from the Communist party. By mentioning the Cultural Revolution explicitly, as he did on Wednesday, Wen was warning others in the Party of the potential damage Bo could bring if he were allowed to stay in power. This was the signal to get Bo. But Hu and Wen cannot just sack Bo from all top offices. It would have implications for the balancing of different factions and vested interests in the party. Bringing Bo down has implications for those top leaders from privileged backgrounds like Bo, known popularly as the princelings, who enjoy support from former general secretary Jiang Zemin, head of the old &quot;Shanghai faction&quot;. The choice of another princeling, Zhang Dejiang, to replace Bo as party secretary in Chongqing is undoubtedly part of this balancing. The future of Bo has not yet been decided, as the party leadership needs to do more horse-trading. It will probably be settled in the next few weeks. However, this will not be the end of the matter. What is involved here is much more than the fate of Bo. It is about the jockeying for position in the leadership succession schedule for the party congress in the autumn. Until then, there will be plenty of manoeuvring by those holding top positions and those hoping to get a seat at the standing committee of the politburo. Bo&apos;s standing committee dream is over, but how his fate will be decided will affect the prospect of others \u2013 and with it how China will be managed in the next decade. \u2022 Steve Tsang is director of the China Policy Institute and professor of contemporary Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Bo Xilai"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-15T19:47:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/blog/2012/mar/20/frugal-innovation-social-entrepreneurs-india", "sentences": ["In his keynote speech to the 2011 Conservative party conference, David Cameron, the prime minister, called for the same &quot;drive to succeed&quot; that is seen in Delhi, Shanghai or Lagos."], "title": "Frugal innovation: learning from social entrepreneurs in India", "article": "Over the past 60 years, innovation and improvements in India&apos;s public services have frequently emerged in the absence of state intervention or involvement. Social enterprises have stepped in to address the challenges where the government has failed. As a consequence, radical new perspectives have developed that might not have emerged if governments had imposed top-down initiatives adopted from the West. &quot;Frugal innovation&quot; is the idiom applied to this sweeping revolution in public service design and delivery. The term is used in India and other developing economies to describe innovation that minimises costs by creating frugal solutions to deliver improved or previously non-existent public services. Frugal innovation has given more people access to a wider range of services. Western governments today seek to manage large public deficits while striving to serve the rising expectations of citizens. There is a buzz emanating from emerging economies that has caught the imagination of Western leaders in their bid to deliver growth in sluggish fiscal environments. In his keynote speech to the 2011 Conservative party conference, David Cameron, the prime minister, called for the same &quot;drive to succeed&quot; that is seen in Delhi, Shanghai or Lagos. Yet the incentives to succeed in the different geographies are divergent, as businessman Harjeet Johal, who has run large retail companies in the UK and India, points out: &quot;David Cameron wants some Delhi &apos;drive&apos;. In his conference speech, he called for Britain to find its inner energy and to start a national fight back, with all the fire of those in the developing world. But having lived and run companies in India, I know that this fight is going to be a knock-out with us on the canvas, as we British lack the reason to be driven&quot;. Although the social and economic challenges of India are of a different order to the fiscal crises currently faced largely by Western developed countries, India could provide the UK with useful insight into how solutions developed from the bottom up in some of the most challenging public service environments can better meet the needs of citizens.  This report investigates a range of new perspectives applied to services by over 40 social enterprises in India. It challenges the notion that uniformity in delivering public services driven by a top-down centralist ideology translates into good value for money. Though many specific models of practice may not be suitable to be adopted by Western public service providers, these examples from India are illustrative of the underlying principles and practices that have led to innovation and drive in the first place. This report demonstrates how social enterprises have leveraged the freedoms that exist at local community levels to develop new solutions, unconstrained as they are by centralist legacy systems and services. This has stimulated innovation in a way that has ensured equality of access and delivered cost-effective solutions. The social entrepreneur&apos;s journey to transform ideas into insights of how to commercialise innovations and create sustainable businesses is, however, arduous and pushes at the boundaries of dedication and plain hard work. Social enterprises in the UK have already achieved a great deal, but to unleash the domestic entrepreneurial drive that can deliver otherwise unobtainable outcomes, the government needs to do more to strip away any remaining obstacles and liberate the potential that lies within.

Many of the figureheads are more than 200 years old, and their hard life, stuck out in front of the ships and lashed by every wave and storm, shows in rotting timbers, corroding bolts and nails holding apparently solid hunks of oak together, and layer upon layer of whatever paint was available when they urgently needed some makeup before heading into port. Some must have been repainted at sea, many crudely, as if with a mop, and rough as a cheese-grater from embedded sand and grit. The team at Richard Rogers Conservation in Surrey, who have spent months working on them, are carefully preserving every scrap of original paint or historic repair, no matter how horrible. Jessica Lewis, curator of the Cutty Sark, said the number with missing arms was partly because many were made with detachable limbs, which were removed while at sea to protect them and only replaced when the ship was returning to harbour. The assemblage includes a sad pile of disembodied heads, hands and feet, including one hand clutching a purse of sovereigns that came into the collection with a tattered label stating it was all that survived of a ship wrecked at Ayr in Scotland. Many figures ended up as gaudy as carousel horses, but General Havelock \u2013 also commemorated in a far more pompous bronze in Trafalgar Square \u2013 still has his original subtle paint finish, all that was holding the rotten wood together. Most of the figures are buxom, red-cheeked blonde or brunette women, but there are also soldiers, sailors, politicians including Pitt, Gladstone and Disraeli, and a splendidly carved little dog from a ship called Sirius. One of the most imposing is Thermopylae, a magnificently moustachioed and helmeted classical warrior. To the disappointment of the Cutty Sark crew, the carving proved to be from a late-19th-century steam ship, not the clipper Thermopylae, which in 1872 raced the Cutty Sark from Shanghai to London with a cargo of tea \u2013 and won by seven days after Cutty Sark lost her rudder. The Cutty Sark later beat Thermopylae on a wool race back from Australia. All the figureheads were collected by Sydney Cumbers, known as Long John Silver after he took to wearing an eyepatch to cover an eye lost in a childhood accident.

He gave the collection to the Cutty Sark in 1953, in memory of Britain&apos;s merchant seamen and the Little Ships that went to the rescue of the army at Dunkirk in the second world war.

Sales of JLR&apos;s sleek saloons and powerful SUVs in China have boomed in recent years as luxury cars remain in demand, even as the overall market cools. China is JLR&apos;s third largest market after the UK and US. One in six Land Rovers, Range Rovers and Jaguars built last year were shipped to China, where sales grew to 42,000, an increase of more than 60% in a year. In 2000, China produced more than 2m cars. In 2011, that figure had risen to about\u00a018.5m. Chery and JLR are understood to be seeking regulatory approval for the $2.8bn (\u00a31.8bn) venture to manufacture and sell luxury cars in China, although that could be only weeks away. Wednesday&apos;s agreement is a boost for JLR, which is owned by India&apos;s Tata Motors and is Britain&apos;s biggest employer within the industry with a workforce of more than 21,000. Sales in China contributed 17.2% of JLR&apos;s revenue in the quarter to the end of December, more than the UK, the birthplace of the two brands. A push into emerging markets such as China and Russia has been one of the key factors in the turnaround in JLR&apos;s fortunes since Tata bought the brands in 2008. The China tie-up, if approved, would give JLR a much sought-after production base in a market where global luxury carmakers, including BMW and Daimler AG&apos;s Mercedes-Benz, are reaping benefits from the growing ranks of wealthy Chinese. JLR and Chery will look to share research and development, technology and manufacturing knowledge across the joint venture, the companies said. They added: &quot;Demand for Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles continues to increase significantly in China, and we believe that JLR and Chery can jointly realise the potential of these iconic brands.&quot; The venture, to be located near Shanghai in Changshu city, will initially make Land Rover SUVs, followed by Jaguars in the second phase. &quot;This is an important step for JLR and Tata Motors,&quot; Vineet Hetamasaria, auto analyst at PINC Research in Mumbai, told Reuters. &quot;This is only an agreement, and it will be some time before we see the results.&quot; A new, jointly owned company will be formed, with a view to establishing a research and development facility. It will aim to develop and manufacture new models, as well as set up engine manufacturing operations and create a sales network in China. Both firms said they wished to &quot;leverage&quot; their respective strengths.

Uniquely covering corporate as well as project finance, the guidelines are mandatory and establish the basis for oversight of the financial sector&apos;s handling of environmental issues, explicitly linked to licensing arrangements. Implementation will undoubtedly be a slow and challenging process, but let no one doubt the seriousness of this move. A report I co-authored about corporate responsibility in China: Corporate Responsibility and Sustainable Economic Development in China, is launched today. The report&apos;s core target audience is an international community unclear as to how best to understand and respond to the changing Chinese narrative on sustainability and responsibility. Should China&apos;s visible embrace of what it domestically refers to as &quot;corporate social responsibility&quot; be interpreted as &quot;grand greenwash&quot;, or at best a side activity of marginal relevance to business behaviour and China&apos;s development. Or might the rhetoric be part of a substantive strategy to move China towards becoming the world&apos;s leading green and inclusive economy. The report concludes that whilst there are inevitably examples of the former, broadly comparable to international experience, it is the latter option that best describes current developments. Responsible, green business practice is a pre-condition for China&apos;s domestic stability, its moral mandate as an emerging super-power, and hopes for a more sustainable global economy that is currently in environmental freefall. An ambitious plan China&apos;s 12th five year plan sets out ambitious intentions for advancing a more balanced domestic economy, framed by out-going premier Wen Jiabao&apos;s characterisation of the current economic model as &quot;unbalanced, unstable, uncoordinated, and unsustainable&quot;. Evidence of the seriousness of China&apos;s stance includes its commitment over the plan period to invest in environmental protection to the tune of US$450 billion, and to put an extra US$450 billion into renewable energy and US$600 billion into smart grids. Ambitiously, it has recently announced plans to pilot seven domestic carbon markets in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Hubei and Guangdong, covering hundreds of million of people, and hundreds of thousands of companies. Alongside macroeconomic and fiscal measures, the Chinese Government has steadily raised the regulatory stakes in what it expects from business. In 2006, new company law stated, &quot;Corporations in their business operation must abide by the laws, regulation, social and business morality and good faith rules, must accept supervision by government and the public, and must undertake social responsibilities.&quot; In 2007, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) issued the circular on enhancing environmental surveillance on exporting enterprises to restrict socially irresponsible enterprises from conducting foreign trade. In 2008, the state-owned assets supervision and administration commission of the state council published the guidelines on CSR fulfilment by central-level enterprises. These guidelines (which are, in effect, mandatory) present CSR as the way for state-owned enterprises to contribute to China&apos;s national development goals. Growing numbers of best practice Internationally, China as a member of the UN Human Rights Council recently, and perhaps to some unexpectedly, endorsed the UN guidelines on business and human rights, which provides a framework of principles on the state duty to protect human rights, the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, and the need for remedy when corporate-related abuses have occurred. Despite China&apos;s caution toward international standards, it eventually signed-off on ISO&apos;s new CSR framework, ISO 26000, and plans to adopt it as a national standard. Other selected international standards have also made inroads. The Forest Stewardship Council, set up in China in 2007, had by 2011 certified 2 million hectares of China&apos;s forests as sustainably managed, and is issuing new certification to companies using forest products at a rate of one new company every three days. Practice is of course not always aligned to policy. Rhetorically, it is developing from its early roots in philanthropy and compliance into a strategic concern addressing the efficiency and security of supply chains, development of new products and services, the competition for talent, and the reputation and other gains from credible governance and accountability. And there is no doubt that there are growing numbers of good practice cases. A recent World Economic Forum report, emerging best practices of Chinese globalisers, provides more than a dozen vignettes of responsible business practices of Chinese companies, especially in their international operations. At least 60 major Chinese companies use the international Global Reporting Initiative guidelines, with the state-owned, China Overseas Shipping Company securing the GRI&apos;s most stringent &quot;A+&quot; level rating for its sustainability report. The China Entrepreneur&apos;s Club, an alliance of CEOs and presidents leading private companies publishes an increasingly robust annual green rating, as do several other groups including the state-sponsored Chinese Academy of Social Science&apos;s CSR Unit. A long way to go Certainly there is anecdotal evidence of poor, often very poor, social and environmental practice, including amongst self-declared sustainability leaders. Internationally visible cases include most recently the abysmal working conditions in Apple&apos;s main supplier, Foxconn, and the ghastly case of Sanlu Dairy, whose chief executive was sentenced to death for knowingly selling tainted milk that killed several children and sickened thousands more. China scores 3.6 out of a best possible score of 10 on Transparency International&apos;s Corruption Perceptions Index, wedged between the other BRICS, above India and Russia and below Brazil and South Africa. The Chinese economy is certainly no sustainability paradise by any measure. Yet equally, there is growing push back against health and safety failures from citizen action. Tens of thousands of students and white-collar workers of the affluent coastal city of Dalian demonstrated last year successfully against the Fujia factory that produces paraxylene, a mildly toxic chemical used in plastics. And while there is arguably less success in rural and working class remonstrations against corporate irresponsibility, this is also likely to change given the increasingly vocal portion of China&apos;s 81 million bloggers drawn from a community of 340 million internet users. The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs reported that, as of 2008, China had around 400,000 registered NGOs. Unofficial estimates put the figure closer to 3 million. Environmental NGOs are increasingly active in raising public awareness, evidenced by their role in catalysing recent public debate about the health hazards of urban pollution. Transforming the economy China&apos;s success, indeed very survival, depends on these fragmented developments cohering into a powerful transformation of its economy. State policy will be crucial in driving forward more responsible business behaviour and the greening of investment and global value chains. Civil regulation, the internationally familiar nexus of sustainability standards, citizen action and business engagement, will become increasingly important in delivering credible sustainability outcomes. This will be true internationally as China&apos;s burgeoning outward investment seeks legitimacy, access and success. But it will also be true domestically, as the state allows for, and seeks to harness, the forces of civil regulation. Directionally, there is a vision and a plan. But the challenges of transforming so huge, complex and dynamic a system in real-time makes blueprint-style planning impossible and increasingly unhelpful. Classical approaches to industrial and economic planning are already declining in providing effective policy focus and impact, especially in technologically dynamic spheres of economy. Practical experience is therefore increasingly valued in policy formation. Evidence based, effective practice that can be scaled has growing currency in Chinese policy development and planning. That in turn opens greater opportunities for non-state actors, including international business and non-profit organisations, to have a growing voice in advancing China&apos;s policy and practice towards sustainability.

Tattered now, black and white, slightly out of focus. He&apos;s lucky, he says, to have even those: cameras weren&apos;t plentiful in Guilin, southern China, when he was a small boy in the 1970s, a three-day, four-night train journey from Beijing. He saw one only rarely, when his father \u2013 a soldier in the People&apos;s Army propaganda unit \u2013 managed to borrow one. As Li&apos;s dad could come home for only one or two days each month, and as he didn&apos;t often manage to borrow a camera, five photos is what there are. But stacked against the walls in his studio, a cavernous former garage in a grimy Paris suburb, are some of the works those photographs inspired: huge, compelling canvases that have made Li one of the most critically acclaimed Chinese-born artists of his\u00a0generation. Rendered in the stark, monochrome\u00a0detail of an old photograph, some splashed blue, red or green, others clutching unnaturally bright toys, books or bags, are children. Staring wide-eyed, deadpan they appear detached, waif-like. And above\u00a0all \u2013 though each picture may contain several children \u2013 they seem alone. These paintings are part of a semi-biographical series that has occupied Li for the best part of five years. They are an artist&apos;s attempt to recapture and reimagine what he can of his own childhood, and to explore the human consequences of perhaps the most controversial and far-reaching social policy China has decreed: the one-child rule. &quot;My generation,&quot; says Li, serving green tea in a porcelain cup the size of a large thimble, &quot;is unique, in China and in the world. We were the first not to fully know the meaning of the words &apos;brother&apos; and &apos;sister&apos;.&quot; The one-child policy was introduced in 1979, when Li was five years old, and is expected to continue for at least another decade. Li&apos;s father, in the army, and mother, a high-school literature teacher, were both part of the state apparatus, so did not dare contravene it. &quot;My mother was studying when I was born, so they waited to have their second child,&quot; Li says. &quot;By the time they were ready, it was too late.&quot; The policy formally restricts married couples living in urban areas to having only one child, and is reported to have prevented as many as 400m births. For Li, it mainly meant a lonely childhood. &quot;I had just one toy,&quot; he says, &quot;a wooden pistol. When I lost it, my father was upset. I read what I could, but it was difficult to get books. I spent\u00a0a lot of time dreaming, imagining, but always on my own. Or with imaginary friends. That&apos;s why I started painting, I think, because I was bored. I painted everywhere. In the neighbourhood, they used to say to my mother: &apos;If you can&apos;t find your son, follow the graffiti!&apos;&quot; It wasn&apos;t, though, necessarily a sad childhood: &quot;Sadness is something you feel for other people. Children adapt very easily. They have their reality and that&apos;s it; they don&apos;t look beyond. And they usually find some way to amuse themselves. For me, that was art. Art was my lifeline.&quot; And he was good at it; his paintings,\u00a0in traditional Chinese ink-on-paper, were selected by the authorities for exhibition abroad, in Japan and Europe. When he was 10, his mother gave him a book by a celebrated Chinese artist, Xu Beihong,\u00a0who studied in Paris in the early 20th century and returned to Beijing to found the city&apos;s Academy of Fine Arts. Li dreamed of studying in Paris too, but it seemed &quot;a surreal idea. China in the mid-80s was like North Korea now. You couldn&apos;t get out.&quot; Barely a decade later, though, he did: after spending four years studying international relations and languages in Beijing and refusing a government job back in Guilin welcoming foreign visitors, Li applied to study art in France. Li spent barely six months studying art theory at the University of Paris XIII before being accepted into the prestigious \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, from where he graduated in 2002 with the highest possible honours. Then for a while, he says, he was &quot;a bit lost. I didn&apos;t really have a direction. I tried lots of different styles.&quot; In 2006, he began working on a self-portrait from his childhood. Like his\u00a0five photographs, it was in black and white, and Li was all alone. &quot;Slowly,&quot; he says, &quot;I began to add other children. The brothers and sisters and friends I never had. My invented friends.&quot; Looking back now, it&apos;s clear he was searching for his roots. &quot;Perhaps because I was very far from home. And because my memories were fading; all I had were those photographs. And because not just the memories, but also the real, concrete world of my childhood in China was disappearing, being rubbed out by the unbelievable pace of construction.&quot; But Li&apos;s paintings of children were not just a recreation of his own childhood identity, but an exploration of what was happening in China. The one-child policy, he says, has had unimagined consequences. &quot;There are the hidden children,&quot; he says. &quot;They can&apos;t go to school, because they don&apos;t officially exist. In the big cities, there&apos;s a market. Children can be bought and sold. They disappear.&quot; Li still finds it surprising in France, he says, &quot;when a child goes missing, and it&apos;s in the newspapers and a poster goes up, and stays for months! In China, nothing like that happens.&quot; Fines and punishments for having a second child are harsh: &quot;You will be denied promotion. You may have a 20% pay cut. Your apartment can be taken away from you, your benefits cut. In the private sector, the fines can go up to six years of salary.&quot; The longer-term economic consequences, Li says, are dramatic. &quot;Traditionally, the Chinese have at least two children to provide for them in old age. But by 2030 in China \u2013 the third generation of the one-child policy \u2013 every young couple will have 12 old people to provide for. The whole thing will just explode.&quot; Emotionally, too, it&apos;s difficult, even in families that manage to obey the rule. &quot;I can&apos;t talk about it with my parents,&quot; says Li. &quot;They know my work is about this, they see it; I&apos;ve taken them to exhibitions of my paintings in Shanghai, Hong Kong. But\u00a0we can&apos;t address the topic. It&apos;s really very sensitive, very painful, for lots of people.&quot; Li, though, is fortunate. He has a son of 18 months with his partner, a sculptor \u2013 and a second child on the way. &quot;Having just one child changed everything for me already,&quot; he says. &quot;My son resembles me \u2013 he&apos;s like a living model, he&apos;s in constant movement. Compared to those five frozen, out-of-focus photos of my own childhood \u2026 It&apos;s miraculous.&quot; Being able to choose to have a second is, he says, a huge privilege. &quot;My parents couldn&apos;t choose. In China, that choice is not open. There are a few exemptions, like if both parents are themselves only children. But for most people, the possibility is just not there. I feel like I have won a prize, being able to have a second child.&quot; Of late, a whole industry has grown up, particularly in the US, to cater for Chinese couples who want a second child. &quot;People can go abroad, have their baby, and come back to China with American papers for their child,&quot; Li says. &quot;That&apos;s OK; the rule doesn&apos;t apply to foreigners. The baby is American; it doesn&apos;t count. But that&apos;s obviously only for the rich.&quot; He considers himself fortunate, too, to be able to spend time with his son. &quot;When I think of my father, he never had that choice either. He saw me so rarely. I see it now, whenever I visit. I feel his emotion. It&apos;s in the little things he does: he makes my bed. He&apos;s compensating for the lack of time together, before.&quot; Indeed the whole notion of family, as lived and understood in the west, means something rather different in China. &quot;For so long now,&quot; says Li, &quot;the collectivity has been more important than the family, than the needs of parents and children. &quot;It&apos;s completely normal for parents to live miles apart most of the time, as mine did; to see each other one or two days a month, for 20 years. Lots of my friends at school were in that same situation. My grandfather was an architect; he was sent to a faraway town to build bridges for 30 years. When he came back, he was retired.&quot; Still, he would have loved a brother or sister. &quot;You always regret what you&apos;ve never had,&quot; he says. &quot;As a child, of course it would have been lovely. But now my father is not well; I am thousands of miles away. In our culture, it is important to look after one&apos;s parents when they are elderly. I\u00a0can&apos;t, and there&apos;s no other child to do\u00a0it.&quot; But having children of his own \u2013 a family with whom he actually lives \u2013 is, gradually, starting to influence his work. His sad, wide-eyed childhood self may still take centre-stage in many\u00a0paintings, but the imaginary children are starting to look happier, less lost. There is the occasional smile. And other themes are emerging: modern issues in China like galloping commercialisation, the increasing difficulty of finding factory workers. &quot;Increasingly now, I think I&apos;m using the children more as a symbol, as a medium to explore and talk about what else is happening in China today,&quot; he says. &quot;My work is perhaps less, now, about the one-child policy. But it will always be there. An artist must, after all, speak of his own experience.&quot; \u2022 An exhibition of Li Tianbing&apos;s work can be seen at the Stephen Friedman Gallery, 25-28 Old Burlington Street, London W1, until 21 April, stephenfriedman.com China&apos;s old-child policy China&apos;s one-child policy was introduced in 1979 in an effort to alleviate the problems caused by having the world&apos;s biggest population. It applies to urban couples but exempts rural families and also parents who don&apos;t have any siblings themselves. Official figures state that 35.9% of China&apos;s population is subject to the restriction with fines imposed on those who ignore it. Since its inception, it has been estimated that the policy has prevented 400 million births, but a cultural bias towards male children means that it has also been implicated in an increase in female infanticide, forced abortions and under-reporting of births. The resulting gender imbalance means that 117 boys are born for every 100 girls. It was reported in 2010 that since 1985, Yicheng County in Shanxi Province has been experimenting with a two-child policy, resulting in no excessive population growth and a gender ratio within international norms (103-107 boys for every 100 girls). Those who have a second child often register them as someone else&apos;s, or simply don&apos;t register tham at all, leading to a whole class of people who don&apos;t officially exist. The 1990s saw the emergence of the &quot;little emperor&quot; syndrome \u2013 mainly a product of Chinese media fearful that single children have been pampered and over-indulged.", "tags": ["Family", "China", "Art", "Art and design", "Parents and parenting", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-24T00:04:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/25/secretive-huawei-joins-technology-race", "sentences": ["Gary Liu, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says Ren&apos;s determination to find a successor from within his family stems from 2000 when his then second-in-command, Li Yinan, left to start a rival company, Harbour."], "title": "Huawei moves out of the shadows to join the technology race", "article": "The security guard&apos;s mirrored sunglasses reflect Barcelona&apos;s pale winter sunshine. His job is to keep the crowds attending the sprawling trade fair at bay. Behind him, a pavilion the size of a bus garage houses the latest technology produced by China&apos;s Huawei. Those without a meeting to attend are told they cannot enter, and cameras are banned inside. Huawei is China&apos;s biggest exporter, and its equipment helps run the BT broadband network, but the brand is unknown to most UK households. Regarded as a secretive organisation even within the people&apos;s republic, Huawei is headed by a former Red Army engineer, Ren Zhengfei. Unlike other Chinese IT firms, such as the PC maker Lenovo and telecoms group ZTE, Huawei is not listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. A private company owned entirely by its founders and employees, the names of its board members were only published for the first time last year. But it is also a flagbearer for China&apos;s &quot;going out&quot; policy of encouraging the first generation of corporations created by economic liberalisation in the 1980s to compete on the world stage. Entrepreneurial and unbureaucratic, it has prospered without having the state as a shareholder. It sells everything from mobile mast radios to software, data-centres and laptop dongles. Founded in 1987, Huawei only began exporting in earnest in 2000, but already over 65% of its revenues are from abroad. Last year, they totalled 185.2bn yuan (\u00a318.51bn), just half a billion pounds less than the world&apos;s largest telecoms equipment group, Ericsson. Now Huawei is preparing to step out of the shadows. While its governance remains veiled, the company is pushing its brand to the fore. It wants to place its products in the hands of millions of western consumers, and become the fourth largest manufacturer of smartphones by the end of this year. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, Huawei&apos;s devices chairman Richard Yu said that by the end of 2012 he hoped to have sold 60m smartphones, up from 17m last year. Hitting that target would vault the firm into the big league, behind Apple, Samsung and Nokia, and ahead of BlackBerry maker RIM and Taiwan&apos;s HTC. To succeed, it will have to redefine what &quot;Made in China&quot; stands for. While Huawei&apos;s hometown of Shenzhen is the electronics workshop of the world, churning out iPhones for Apple and PCs for Dell, its produce usually bears the stamp of a foreign company. Aside from PC maker Lenovo, it is hard to name a Chinese brand known to European and American shoppers. &quot;Consumer perception is that a Chinese product is cheap and looks cheap because the quality is no good,&quot; says Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at research firm IDC. &quot;Huawei needs to change that perception.&quot; Jeronimo believes Huawei products have the quality to compete, but says it will need to raise its public profile. The charge will be led from the UK, where no expense has been spared in recruiting British executives and an advisory board to help find friends in high places. Former Sunday Telegraph editor Patience Wheatcroft is an adviser, as is Amazon&apos;s ex-UK boss Brian McBride, and Sir Andrew Cahn, once chief of staff for Neil Kinnock and recently chief executive of UK Trade &amp; Investment, the government trade promotion body. To promote the smartphones, Bartle Bogle Hegarty, ad agency to Google and BA, will create a global campaign from London. &quot;It&apos;s imperative we are seen as a global brand and not a Chinese brand,&quot; says Mark Mitchinson, a Samsung veteran running Huawei&apos;s UK devices arm. His newest stock are phones and tablet computers running Google&apos;s Android interface, which house computer chips that have four rather than the now usual two processors, allowing them to handle multiple instructions at the same time. They are fast, particularly when it comes to downloading video. While most phone makers prefer to leave chips to specialists like Intel, Huawei, whose name stands for &quot;China can&quot; and &quot;splendid act&quot;, designed its quad core processors in house and has become known in recent years for innovating. Some 62,000 of its 140,000 staff work in research and development, and there are 23 R&amp;D centres around the world. Without a recognised brand, Huawei&apos;s phones will sell on price. Its mission will be to mop up those mobile subscribers who don&apos;t yet own a smartphone, rather than trying to poach Apple&apos;s customers. With BlackBerry caught napping and now adjusting to a new chief executive, and Nokia yet to prove its adoption of Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone interface can turn business around, Huawei is seizing a window of its own. &quot;There are certain manufacturers that have dropped the ball over recent years and others can pick up that ball and run with it,&quot; says Mitchinson. Samsung has shown it can be done. The Korean company moved from fifth to second spot globally in smartphone sales last year, the only one in the top five to grow in the face of the unstoppable iPhone. There are those who wonder why Huawei is so keen to risk its hard-earned yuans by chasing capricious mobile phone customers. The answer is that this is a high-growth market. Even in an early adopter nation like the UK, only half of us have a smartphone. And the handset market has the attraction of being a less politically sensitive one than infrastructure. Huawei is already big in Europe, having last year won a breakthrough contract to overhaul the network of the UK&apos;s largest operator, Everything Everywhere. But an offer to donate \u00a350m of equipment to bring a mobile signal into the London Underground in time for the Olympics was never taken up. MP Patrick Mercer described the possibility of detonating bombs with phones on trains as &quot;the answer to terrorists&apos; prayers&quot;. A spokesman for Huawei says the deal fell apart not because of security fears, but because commercial agreement could not be reached between all the various players involved. The culture within Huawei is often described as militaristic. Information is shared on a need-to know basis, with one employee complaining anonymously on recruitment website Glassdoor: &quot;Don&apos;t expect to get the information or documentation to be able to carry out the job you are employed to do.&quot; Others who have worked there, like former UK mobile chief Jeremy Sheehan, says this comes from a desire to &quot;protect client confidentiality&quot;. Bengt Nordstr\u00f6m, a strategic adviser to European mobile networks, says Huawei has succeeded because of its ability to learn fast. While Chinese employees even in the UK still put their heads down on their desk for a nap after lunch, managers study for MBAs, and are offered crash courses in Western culture. &quot;Ten years ago they were really only selling on low prices,&quot; says Nordstr\u00f6m. &quot;It was hard to find people that could speak English well enough to conduct a business discussion. But for every quotation they produced, their quality increased. Customer relations is an area where Ericsson is stronger than any other vendor but Huawei have learnt that game.&quot; Backed by a $30bn credit line from the China Development Bank, the pattern of Huawei&apos;s international expansion has followed its philosophy, borrowed from Chairman Mao, of encircling the cities by winning the countryside. Beginning in Africa and Russia, it has moved successfully west. Only America has blocked its advance. Efforts to expand have been repeatedly neutralised by Washington. Offers to acquire Motorola&apos;s wireless division and a broadband software group were quashed after the sellers were informed that regulatory approval would not be forthcoming. A contract to modernise mobile operator Sprint Nextel&apos;s network was kyboshed, and the US commerce department last autumn barred Huawei from an emergency services contract. A British executive whose company buys from Huawei says US politicians are using espionage as a scare tactic to protect domestic businesses from foreign competitors. &quot;You&apos;ve got to remember the most protectionist country of the developed world is America. Rupert Murdoch had to become American to buy Fox. What the Americans are really trying to do is stop Huawei getting the business they know they could get if they opened up their equipment market to them.&quot; Huawei&apos;s stated ambition is to become as big as Cisco or IBM, with annual revenues of $100bn in 10 years. Nordstr\u00f6m says this is unlikely without conquering America: &quot;This is an industry where you need to be truly global to have a future.&quot; Observers say the most serious threat to Huawei&apos;s ambitions comes from within. As Ren approaches his 68th birthday in October, the company he founded is facing a succession crisis. In her letter published in last year&apos;s annual report, Huawei&apos;s charismatic chairwoman, Sun Yafang, thanked the staff for re-electing her, saying: &quot;I am sincerely grateful to our employees&apos; trust and confidence in me.&quot; It was a short statement that masked an internal power struggle. While Ren, who does not give interviews, has been criticised in the Chinese press for a lack of transparency, Sun is increasingly being seen as Huawei&apos;s public face, a networker who was among corporate China&apos;s most senior representatives at Davos this year. But in October 2010, a report in Meiri Jingi Xinwen (Daily Economic News) suggested Sun had been offered 1bn\u00a0yuan to leave Huawei so that Ren could prepare the ground for the appointment to the 13-member board of his son, Meng Ping, who is customer relationship management director and is said to have spent time in the US. The company denies this. Whatever the truth, Sun survived in a post she has held since 1999 and Meng did not join the board. But the Ren dynasty holds sway at Huawei; Ren&apos;s daughter Meng Wanzhou is chief financial officer. Meanwhile, Ren Shulu, the founder&apos;s younger brother, is a member of the five-strong supervisory board that oversees the directors. Both boards are elected every five years, by 51 staff representatives who are in turn elected by Huawei&apos;s 60,000 shareholding staff. Gary Liu, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says Ren&apos;s determination to find a successor from within his family stems from 2000 when his then second-in-command, Li Yinan, left to start a rival company, Harbour. Ren fought and eventually bought Harbour, but the experience, says Liu, destroyed his trust in non-family members. Succession is not just an issue at Huawei. China&apos;s first generation of entrepreneurs at Lenovo and white goods maker Haier are also nearing retirement. &quot;These companies&apos; futures hinge on how effectively the incumbents manage leadership transitions. Indeed, the choices the founder CEOs make may well reshape their companies as well as the Chinese economy,&quot; says Liu. Ren has resisted a stock exchange listing, but ownership could help shed light on the business and build trust. Huawei may have to open its own doors before America decides to do the same.", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Business", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Nokia", "BlackBerry"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-25T00:06:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/26/ipad-smugglers-apple-far-east", "sentences": ["A 16Gb iPad bought in San Francisco for $499 \u2013 about $540 including tax \u2013 can be sold for more than $1,000 in Shanghai the next day."], "title": "iPad smugglers face fresh pressures", "article": "Early on the morning of 16 March, Wong Tat joined a line of about 100 people waiting for the launch of the new iPad in a chilly rain outside an Apple store on the outskirts of San Francisco.

After about two dozen of the neatly boxed iPads had been put in the trunk, the 4x4 sped to a nearby run-down hair salon and massage parlour. There, the haul of tablets, costing about $12,000, was transferred to red, white and blue wholesale bags, which Wong then spirited out the back door into another car. &quot;They&apos;re headed for China,&quot; said Amy, a thirtysomething hair stylist at the salon who had joined in the pre-dawn operation outside the Apple store. She would not divulge her last name. The iPads had embarked on the first leg of a journey that would ironically return them to the country where they were assembled in the first place. They may have been stuffed into suitcases and taken by passengers on a flight to China, or possibly flown by courier to the duty-free territory of Hong Kong and smuggled in students&apos; backpacks across the border onto the mainland. Demand for Apple products, coupled with severe constraints on local supply, has created a thriving black market. A 16Gb iPad bought in San Francisco for $499 \u2013 about $540 including tax \u2013 can be sold for more than $1,000 in Shanghai the next day. Apple says it sold more than 3m of the devices \u2013 which now come 4G-ready with a sharper &quot;retina&quot; display \u2013 in its first weekend. &quot;You can pretty much determine when the first iPad arrives in China by monitoring the first flight out from the US on launch day,&quot; said an Apple employee who was not authorised to speak on behalf of the company. The same process happens in other cities: on the same day that Wong was at work in San Francisco, the London Evening Standard reported that &quot;black market gangs&quot; had hijacked the launch, with buyers leaving the Apple Store in Westfield with the standard two iPads and then handing them, still in their shrinkwrapped boxes, over to eastern European men. It quoted Martin, 33, one of the people who queued to go into the Apple Store in Covent Garden again and again, and who explained: &quot;I hope to get around 70 iPads today. I will be sending them on to India. The guys who are queuing get paid \u00a310 or \u00a320 for a day&apos;s work. I know them from my community centre, word gets round that this job has to be done.&quot; Companies that make iPad accessories, such as cases and speakers, also hire people to wait in line on launch day, a source involved in that business said. Because accessory makers do not get an early peek at Apple products, they have to scramble as soon as new iPads and iPhones hit the streets to reconfigure assembly lines and craft accessories that fit any tweaks in the design, he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nursing the husk of a new machine People like Wong, dubbed huangniu, or &quot;yellow-bull black-market operator&quot; in Chinese, have operated richly lucrative businesses. They pay people like Amy \u2013 codenamed &quot;nurses&quot; because the word &quot;hush&quot; sounds like &quot;helpers&quot; in Chinese \u2013 $20 to $30 to queue to buy an iPad or iPhone for resale on the black market. Factor in as little as $12 to ship each device via a Chinese shipping agent, and small wonder Wong and his ilk found it worth their while. But it is getting tougher and costlier to smuggle the devices into China as the Chinese customs authority has told some US-based shipping agents not to accept orders of iPads, and warned travellers to declare their gadgets at the border and pay a 10% import duty on electronics. Two small shipping companies that ship to China, BLZ Express and Global Courier Services, said they now refuse iPad shipments. BLZ, based in Fremont, California, posted a notice on its website this month saying: &quot;Our clearing warehouses have stopped receiving iPad in accordance with a recent customs authority notification.&quot; UPS and FedEx, the largest US package delivery companies, did not return requests for comment. In Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, an online report from the state-owned Guangzhou Daily \u2013 a mouthpiece of the local government \u2013 said the newest iPad was among 20 taxable goods that should be declared by travellers. &quot;I stopped carrying iPad a few months ago because now the customs at Shenzhen can be pretty strict,&quot; said a Chinese student in Hong Kong, who declined to reveal his payoff for smuggling. Meanwhile, Apple now simultaneously launches devices in multiple countries, boosting availability and depressing black market prices, although the new iPad with its higher-quality display was available in fewer countries initially than its predecessor. A key launch venue is Hong Kong, however, which was among the 10 countries for the initial launch \u2013 unlike last year, when the territory, a key channel to China, was not included in the launch day. &quot;It&apos;s getting really hard to do this compared to previous years,&quot; said Amy, who wore a dyed red streak in her hair, as she trimmed a young man&apos;s &quot;faux-hawk&quot; hair style in the San Francisco area salon. An electronics dealer in Oakland, California, said he struggled to break even this year, a far cry from previous iPad releases when he shipped upwards of 1,000 tablets and pocketed profits of $50 to $100 per device sent to his buyer in Hong Kong. This year, he had no choice but to send 250 iPads via FedEx \u2013 which quotes $110 to ship a tablet weighing about 1kg to China \u2013 hours after they hit US stores. The same-day launch of the tablet in 10 territories, notably including Hong Kong, curtailed demand. &quot;This whole game is over,&quot; the dealer complained. &quot;There&apos;s an overabundance of supply. The market&apos;s flooded.&quot; He said he visited only a couple of stores in the San Francisco bay area for tablets, with the Chinese black-market selling-price falling every day that passes. Proudly worn Despite that expansion in inventory, demand in China still outstrips supply. Online retail site Taobao.com carried iPad listings last week for as much as $1,100, though $600 to $700 price tags were more common. While iPads and iPhones have become badges of western chic and status to upwardly mobile Chinese, they are usually the last to be able to buy them directly from Apple stores. Industry sources say smugglers operate out of multiple countries, but mainly in the US because that is where stores carry the most products. Last Friday in Hong Kong, stores ran out of the newest iPad within hours. They are now sold via a daily lottery there, while they are still readily available in many US stores. The Chinese &quot;nurses&quot; are easy to spot: they stroll in, hand over a note describing the model they want and leave as soon as they get it, whereas an ordinary buyer will often take their gadget out for a test drive before leaving the store and ask sales staff numerous questions. &quot;Apple has gotten so big that they can flood the market. Before they released it, they probably had been making them for six months and had them sitting in a warehouse. Now they are selling it in Asia and Australia, and it&apos;s out 16 hours before us,&quot; said the Oakland dealer.", "tags": ["iPad", "Apple", "Computing", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-26T07:22:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/mar/26/putting-brakes-on-road-injuries", "sentences": ["The gridlocks paralysing major cities like Delhi, Sao Paolo and Shanghai are wiping out 2% to 3% of their GDP annually."], "title": "Putting the brakes on road injuries is one of development's greatest tests", "article": "This year, more than 1.3 million people will die as a result of road traffic injury. That&apos;s roughly 10 lives lost by the time you finish reading this article. Countless millions will be left with long-term injuries. More than 90% of the victims will live in developing countries. Stopping this carnage is one of the greatest development challenges of our day, yet the sheer scale of the problem is not widely recognised. For adolescents and young adults in developing countries, road traffic injury is now the single biggest cause of death. In Africa, cars and trucks kill more five- to 14-year-old children than killer diseases such as malaria and Aids. Yet the road injury epidemic has yet to register on the international development agenda. Fatality is just the tip of an iceberg. In countries lacking accessible health systems and social welfare safety nets, a road traffic injury is all too often a one-way ticket to poverty. Other costs are beyond estimation. What price do you put on the grief and trauma that comes with the loss of a child, a parent, a sister or a friend? Over the past few months I have seen some of the human tragedy behind the statistics. I&apos;ve spoken in South African townships with mothers who have been robbed of their children. In a Mumbai slum I met 23-year-old Shabir Sheikh, who six years ago was a promising secondary school student with dreams of becoming an engineer. Today, he is living with the limb-shattering injuries he sustained when he got hit by a car on the way home from school. &quot;I can&apos;t work and I can&apos;t afford medical bills: my life finished that day,&quot; he says. The global nature of the crisis is epitomised by the road linking Kenya&apos;s capital Nairobi to the port of Mombasa. Upgraded into an eight-lane superhighway with support from the World Bank and other donors, speed is up and journey times are down. Pity they forgot about the children, hundreds of whom cross the road to get from their homes in the sprawling slum of Kibera to primary school. &quot;It makes me scared every single day,&quot; Mary Kitunga, 12, told me. She had just crossed the road carrying her four-year old brother. For point of reference, try to imagine your kids crossing a motorway to get to school. However dire the situation is today, the future looks much worse. Economic growth and the rise of the middle class in developing countries are increasing demand for cars. Meanwhile, population growth and urbanisation are putting more people \u2013 especially children \u2013 in harm&apos;s way. In Britain, there is one death for every 10,000 cars on the road. In Brazil, the death ratio is seven times higher, while in China it is 15 times higher. And in India, there are 27 deaths for every 10,000 cars. The death ratio for much of Africa is off the scale. In Nigeria, there are 70 times more deaths on a per-vehicle basis than in Europe. These numbers matter. While car numbers in rich countries are static, sales are booming across Asia and Latin America and rising sharply in Africa. By 2015, India will overtake Germany as the world&apos;s fourth largest market for vehicles. According to the World Health Organisation, the number of people dying on the world&apos;s roads will rise by half a million over the next six years. It doesn&apos;t have to be like this. Design roads that separate cars, trucks and buses from people; enforce laws on helmets, seat belts, speeding and drink-driving; run campaigns that increase public awareness; invest in safe public transport. These are measures that the Commission for Global Road Safety estimates could save 5 million lives and prevent 50m injuries between now and 2020. But attitudes need to change. Bilateral donors, the World Bank and other multilateral development banks are spending billions on road infrastructure, but road safety is too often an afterthought. They should set aside 10% of their project budgets for safety. Car companies talk about road safety, but people come a distant second to profit when they spot a market opportunity. That&apos;s why major multinational companies operate one set of vehicle standards for the US and another for Brazil. Development agencies also have to ask themselves some tough questions, starting with the obvious one. Why isn&apos;t one of the great sources of poverty, human suffering and economic waste on the global campaigning agenda? Two decades ago, the first Rio summit challenged us to rethink our understanding of poverty and the environment. In June, the Rio+20 summit will provide an opportunity to set a new course on transport policy. Putting people before cars isn&apos;t just about saving lives. It&apos;s about heading off a social, ecological and economic disaster. Cars account for one-fifth of CO2 emissions (and rising). Air pollution from vehicles contributes to almost 1 million deaths annually. And just in case you think the car boom is good for growth, think again. The gridlocks paralysing major cities like Delhi, Sao Paolo and Shanghai are wiping out 2% to 3% of their GDP annually. On Monday, the governments and UN agencies planning Rio+20 will meet in New York to finalise the summit agenda. They have a chance to put road safety at the heart of a sustainable transport policy.

Britain said on Sunday that it had asked China to investigate the sudden death of Neil Heywood in Chongqing last November. The 41-year-old had ties to Bo Xilai, the city&apos;s high-profile party boss, whose dismissal two weeks ago has sent shockwaves through Chinese politics in the runup to this autumn&apos;s leadership transition. A spokesman for Hakluyt &amp; Co said Heywood worked for them on a periodical basis and had not handled any work in the south-western city for them. &quot;Neil had a long history of advising western companies on China and we were among those who sought his advice. We are greatly saddened by his death,&quot; he added. Hakluyt services include strategic intelligence and due diligence. But such work can be sensitive in China, where businesses often have powerful ties to local officials. Chongqing authorities reportedly blamed Heywood&apos;s death on excessive alcohol consumption and cremated his body without a postmortem, but people who knew him said he did not seem to be a heavy drinker. According to the Wall Street Journal, suspicions about Heywood&apos;s death \u2013 including a claim that he could have been poisoned \u2013 were raised by Wang Lijun, formerly the Chongqing police chief and a close ally of Bo, when he fled to the US consulate in Chengdu in February. After leaving the consulate he was met by central government officials from Beijing and is now under investigation. The US has declined to comment on whether he sought asylum, saying he left of his own volition. According to the Wall Street Journal, Wang claimed relations had soured with Bo after he raised concerns about Heywood&apos;s death. He is also said to have claimed that Heywood had been in a business dispute involving Bo&apos;s wife, Gu Kailai. There is no way of ascertaining the allegations and others have suggested Wang might have turned on Bo after clashing with him for other reasons. The Financial Times said a Bo family spokesman confirmed they knew Heywood but denied any business ties. However, his family in the UK appeared to dismiss any suggestion of foul play. &quot;My son died of a heart attack. I don&apos;t know why there&apos;s all these rumours. But I don&apos;t want to say anything else,&quot; his mother Ann, speaking from her home in Streatham, south London, told ITV News. Heywood also worked as a non-executive board member for an Aston Martin dealership in Beijing and described himself as a consultant helping British firms move into China. He told people he had helped Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill to promote her design services in China and photographs from 2010 show the two on a visit to a design school in Shanghai. His biography shows a strong and early interest in global affairs. After Harrow he read politics and international studies at Warwick University in the Midlands, graduating in the summer of 1992. He appears to have been one of the university&apos;s more low-key students. His tutors there have all retired. One of his acquaintances told the Wall Street Journal that Heywood, from a upper middle-class British family, took pride in Britain&apos;s traditions, history, and institutions. Friends added that they were surprised when he moved to Beijing in his early 20s, after Warwick. It is thought he studied Mandarin at the Beijing Language and Culture University. He later moved to Dalian, where he met and married a Chinese woman, before returning to the capital. The couple have two young children. China&apos;s foreign ministry and officials in Chongqing have said they have no information on Heywood&apos;s case. Given the sensitivity surrounding it \u2013 searches for his name were blocked on microblogs on Tuesday \u2013 rapid progress seems unlikely. A shakeup in the wake of Bo&apos;s ousting has seen at least two senior Chongqing officials detained in recent days, and Bo&apos;s own fate remains uncertain. The party has yet to comment on whether he will keep his seat on its 25-member Politburo; a sign, say analysts, that leaders cannot agree. Heywood appears to have met Bo in Dalian, where the politician served before promotion. He told acquaintances he had helped Gu to arrange for the couple&apos;s son Bo Guagua to attend Harrow, where Heywood himself had studied. Bo Guagua read PPE at Balliol College, Oxford \u2013 a prestigious choice of subject at one of the university&apos;s most competitive colleges. He arrived in 2006. His party-going lifestyle and failure to keep up with the academic workload led to Balliol temporarily rusticating him. But he returned to the college and completed his degree in 2010, graduating with a 2:1. He attempted a career at the Oxford Union, the debating society for wannabe politicians, and ran unsuccessfully to be librarian in 2009. He was president of the PPE society and organised a university fundraising committee for the Sichuan earthquake. His greatest social coup was arranging for film star Jackie Chan to give a lecture at the university. Heywood may also have helped him to organise a &quot;Silk Road&quot; ball there in 2008.", "tags": ["China", "UK news", "Asia Pacific", "Neil Heywood"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-27T18:29:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/mar/28/pearson-education-ftse-falls", "sentences": ["Miners were also weaker after worries about Chinese demand, with talk of copper being stuck in bonded warehouses in Shanghai."], "title": "Pearson falls on US education concerns as FTSE 100 hits three week low", "article": "As leading shares fell to a three week low, publishing group Pearson was one of the casualties with a decline of more than 1%. Worries about cutbacks in US education budgets have hovered in the background for a while, and they have now come back to the fore after news of a weaker than expected performance from US group Apollo, which provides higher education services. Analyst Ian Whittaker at Liberum Capital said the Apollo figures emphasised the difficult market for US education, which accounts for around a third of Pearson&apos;s profits. He repeated his sell recommendation and said:  Apollo [reported] weaker than expected second quarter enrolment data (1% growth year on year versus the expected 3%-4%) and weak third quarter outlook (expecting a double-digit decline year on year in enrolments). The comments suggest that US higher education enrolment in the for-profits sector remains weak, which is a negative read-across for Pearson&apos;s US higher education business, which we estimate makes up around a third of group profits. With both structural concerns (high pricing cannot be sustained, lowered barriers to entry) and weak enrolments, there is increased risk for the stock, which is expensive at a PE of 14 times 2012&apos;s estimated earnings.

Analysts at Numis said there was no reason to buy the shares until there were signs of a US interest rate rise, something Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has been hinting is some way off. Rolls-Royce dipped 0.5p to 824p despite Goldman Sachs issuing a buy note on the aero-engine maker and raising its price target from \u00a310.10 to \u00a310.50. Among the mid-caps, Ophir Energy continued its strong run despite placing 30.5m new shares at 495p each to raise around \u00a3150m. The company pleased investors this week with news that its joint venture with BG had made a major gas discovery in Tanzania. The proceeds of the placing will be used to fund its exploration programme and maintain its equity stake in the projects. Ophir shares added 5.9p to 494p, partly on suggestions it could prove attractive to a predator. Analysts at Fox-Davies said:  While past successes at the drill bit are no guarantee of future success, Ophir&apos;s recent successes in Tanzania certainly allows management to feel suitably encouraged about their future. One feels that a follow up discovery would high-grade the portfolio and attract the interest of acquisitive eyes.

He is remembered particularly for his role in the 1881 gunfight at the OK Corral. Romance      wyatt earp film still 2    Trainee lawyer Wyatt Earp (Kevin Costner) marries his sweetheart, Urilla Sutherland. Historians know almost nothing about her, so the lovey-dovey perfect marriage shown here is mostly made up. It is true that she died the following year, though the film shows her at a middling stage of pregnancy and claims typhoid fever as the cause. In real life, she was ill, but may have died in childbirth. Devastated, Earp sits on his front lawn and drinks most of a bottle of booze. Then he makes the rest into a Molotov cocktail and lobs it through his own window to burn down his lovey-dovey perfect house. The real Earp merely sold the land he and Urilla had purchased. Crime      wyatt earp film still 3    Earp staggers off into a downward spiral of drinking, fighting and crime. While, again, this has been dressed up for the screen, it is true that he was arrested for stealing horses. He washes up in Wichita, Kansas, and switches sides to become an officer of the law. According to Earp himself, who provided material just before his death for his 1931 biography, Frontier Marshal, he got the job after apprehending notorious outlaw Ben Thompson. The film steers clear of that story, described by more recent Earp biographer Allen Barra as &quot;the most colossal whopper in all of Frontier Marshal&quot;. That&apos;s some claim: there are a lot of colossal whoppers in Frontier Marshal. But the reality, according to a more reliable friend of Earp&apos;s, was that the Wichita marshal saw Earp in the street and asked him nicely to join up. That is hardly dramatic. So the film invents a shootout which has some of the features of the Thompson tale, and others from a separate incident in which Earp claimed to have arrested cattle baron Shanghai Pierce, and calls its fictional varmint Rowdy Dubbs. Of course, this attempt at a reality-legend compromise effectively creates a new legend. Details  A tremendous effort has been made with the production design of this film, and it is both gorgeous and accurate \u2013 though in one 1878 scene there&apos;s a telegram that looks suspiciously like it has been written with a ballpoint pen (first invented in 1888; not commonly available in the United States until the Biro was marketed in 1945). Unfortunately, much less attention seems to have been paid to the film&apos;s pace. At times, it feels like a minute-by-minute reenactment of Earp&apos;s entire 80-year life, complete with such a profusion of shootouts that the gunslinging action eventually becomes dull. People      wyatt earp film still 4    The excess of plot leaves little room for character. Costner&apos;s Earp is stolid and unentrancing: even Earp&apos;s whiskers have been toned down. The film invents a motive for him \u2013 he follows his father (Gene Hackman) as a patriarch, building the Earp family as he builds the west \u2013 but that&apos;s neither accurate nor engaging. It&apos;s a cliche of Wyatt Earp movies that Doc Holliday (played here by Dennis Quaid) steals the show. He tries, but the film won&apos;t give him and his resplendent floozy, Big Nose Kate (Isabella Rossellini), enough screentime. More&apos;s the pity. Violence      wyatt earp film still    In real life, the gunfight at the OK Corral is said to have lasted for just 30 seconds. The film takes that up to 42 seconds, for which it may be forgiven. What happened in that half minute or so, as well as the background to the incident, is disputed. Like many of the gunfights in Wyatt Earp, it&apos;s brilliantly staged, and the events around it have been thoughtfully researched. Had the film been an hour shorter, the audience might still have been interested enough by this point to care.

Greene takes to Twitter for ticket help One of Team GB&apos;s top gold medal hopes was this week given a helping hand by a fan after struggling to get hold of tickets for his family for this summer&apos;s games. The 400m hurdles world champion Dai Greene turned to Twitter for ideas after being allocated two tickets, like all competitors, for each of his sessions at the Games, as he was worried that his family would have to watch him race on a television at home. Matt de Monte, a fan of Greene&apos;s from London, offered to help, and within a week had brought eight tickets for Greene&apos;s semi-final and final, using \u00a31,500 of his own money to pay for them, before Greene then paid him back. The runner was ecstatic that a complete stranger would help him in such way. &quot;You don&apos;t hear of many stories like this. It&apos;s usually just doom and gloom \u2013 this is somebody going out of their way to help others,&quot; he said.

There is a reason behind the decision however, as the company are using gold from Mongolia to make all 4,700 medals for the Games. Mongolia are sending just 30 athletes to London but will be confident of going home with some medals after winning gold in judo and boxing in Beijing four years ago. Venus back on track Venus Williams&apos;s hopes of competing at London have been boosted by her form at the Sony Ericcson Open in Miami this week. According to the WTA rankings released on 19 March Venus is in 134th place \u2013 only the top 56 ranked players qualify for the Olympics. With 78 places currently standing between her and a place at the games Williams must up her game if she wishes to make it to the tournament. There are signs of a recent improval in form for the 21-time Grand Slam winner though, as she made it to the quarter-finals in Miami, only to be beaten by Agnieszka Radwanska. Liu refusing to think about rivals The former Olympic 110m hurdles champion Liu Xiang is determined to put the heartbreak of the 2008 Beijing Games behind him \u2013 when injury dashed his hopes \u2013 by focussing on his own running ahead of London. The injury Xiang sustained before Beijing four years ago kept him off the track until late in 2009, and the hurdler is confident he can overcome that disappointment with victory this summer. Liang told journalists at an event to promote the Shanghai leg of the Diamond League in May, that &quot;the main thing is that I am competing against myself. They [his opponents] have their strengths and I have mine.&quot; Recent results have shown that Xiang&apos;s new starting technique, which uses seven strides before the first hurdle as opposed to his previous eight, has been detrimental to his performance, with the former Olympic champion finishing second in the 60m hurdles at the world indoor championships in Istanbul earlier this month.

The two points dropped mean that USA are down to third in the group, and fail to qualify for the semi-finals. While USA mourn their exit, El Salvador celebrate, as their hopes of reaching the Olympics for only the second time remain alive.

If he decides to take up the option to move it would end an 11-year career at Old Trafford although it is believed that the defender, who would be approaching his 35th birthday by the close of 2012-13, has no plans to retire from playing for England and wants to continue playing for his country beyond this summer&apos;s European Championship. A move to China would prove lucrative for Ferdinand and he would follow Nicolas Anelka, who in January moved from Chelsea to Shanghai Shenhua for wages in the region of \u00a3175,000 a week. It is understood that the club who wish to sign Ferdinand are not Shenhua. If the 33-year-old is intrigued by the move Sir Alex Ferguson may face a fight to keep him despite United&apos;s manager stating in the past week that Ferdinand&apos;s experience is invaluable to the younger United players. &quot;He has taken on that role of the influential person in the dressing room. It&apos;s not easy but the longer they stay here the better the influence spreads to them and they can take over from the older players as they disappear,&quot; Ferguson said. Ferguson acknowledged how the defender appears to be winning the battle with injury and his advancing years. In November the manager said that Ferdinand could no longer rely on his pace, saying he had &quot;lost the yard he had five years ago&quot; and would have to tailor his game to fight off competition from Chris Smalling and Phil Jones who were signed by Ferguson over the past two years as eventual successors. In the buildup to last Monday&apos;s win over Fulham the Scot talked of how Ferdinand has adjusted his game: &quot;It&apos;s not surprised me in the sense that he&apos;s still young for a centre-back. In normal terms you would expect a centre-back with his athleticism to play well into their 30s anyway. But he had the back problem which we all know about. So we&apos;ve had to manage that and by managing it properly he has adapted really well to it.&quot; Ferdinand has started 21 of United&apos;s 30 league matches this campaign and he should again be in the starting lineup for Monday evening&apos;s trip to Blackburn Rovers. United won their record 19th title at Ewood Park last season and on the opposing side that day was Jones, who said that the experience helped convince him to move from Blackburn to Old Trafford in the summer. &quot;That is exactly why I left,&quot; Jones said. &quot;I had some fond memories from my time at Blackburn and there are some wonderful people at the club. But I wanted to win trophies and become part of a team with a massive background, which United have. To lift that trophy at the end of the season would be a wonderful achievement for me.&quot; The defender, who is full of respect for the way Steve Kean has turned around Rovers&apos; fortunes this season, added: &quot;It [Ewood Park] is a really tough place to go to start with, and it is Manchester United. It is a local derby and the build-up is all about pressing and how you can stop them from playing. It will be no different this week. They will be getting their tactics sorted and we need to be right at the top of our game to overcome that. They had a really tricky start to the season. Steve Kean got a lot of stick and came under a lot of pressure. But you don&apos;t hear a lot about Blackburn or their manager these days. He has turned it around and deserves a lot of credit.&quot;", "tags": ["Rio Ferdinand", "Manchester United", "England", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-30T15:55:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/mar/30/open-thread-what-films-been-watching", "sentences": ["Thesubhuman on Shanghai Gesture: An uneven tone veering between tragedy, melodrama and camp comedy, and a disjointed storyline exacerbated by severe cuts from the Hays office."], "title": "Open thread \u2013 what films have you been watching?", "article": "What films have you seen recently?

Probably the most discussed film of the past seven days has been The Hunger Games, given a four-star review by Peter Bradshaw last week:  The Hunger Games is a very enjoyable futurist adventure, presented with a compelling, beady-eyed intensity. The worry now is that with big-screen versions of the next books in Suzanne Collins&apos;s series coming down the line, the impact will be lessened, and it will become a Twilightish soap.   Here&apos;s what some @guardianfilm followers had to say about The Hunger Games on Twitter: @ryankayrd  An engrossing cross between Charlie &amp; The Choc Factory and Lord of the Flies   @jayl3a  Hunger Games is dark, cleverly combines entertainment with social criticism &amp; thus doesn&apos;t deserve Twilight comparisons. 5/5   \u200f@bskipper27  One of the better blockbusters of recent times. Some genuine shock value &amp; Lawrence is brilliant   @Cbk1026  The Hunger Games had me hungry for The Running Man or Battle Royale   @JuliaG9290  Massively overrated, illogical, annoying main characters (&amp; I like J. Lawrence usually!)  Take a look at the #gdnfilmreviews for more views on Pirates! In An Adventure with Scientists, Dogtooth, Into the Abyss and more. Meanwhile, here&apos;s a few of our favourite comments from last week&apos;s open thread: kniphofia on The Conformist: I first saw it in 1979 and was incredibly impressed when I saw it again. Stunning cinematography and great performances from the cast. I was also struck by how influential it has been. The scene of the fascist minder in the forest warming his hand to urinate outdoors is replicated exactly in the Coens&apos; Miller&apos;s Crossing. Great stuff. mike65ie on Kellys Heroes: Brian G Hutton&apos;s follow-up to Where Eagles Dare trades Alpine snow for the sunny fields and villages of Yugoslavia (standing in for western France) in this daft but highly entertaining old-school shoot &apos;em up. Part of the joy is knowing that the fakery is real. No CGI of course, but no rapid cutaways to hide miniatures, or even apparent matt shots in this one \u2013 if it&apos;s blown up, it&apos;s blown up &quot;for real&quot;. Nice hardware details (all real tanks and half-tracks) and, when inside the blown-up/burned buildings, it looks completely real. One almost wonders if whole villages were simply left to rot after WW2, and so made excellent sets 25 years later! peenum on Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon: Great stuff, but couldn&apos;t help feeling that it would have been a lot stronger with Megan Fox there to finish the trilogy. Can&apos;t see what Sam sees in the new girl. No chemistry in the air, making Sam&apos;s heroism to save her feel rather unconvincing. Thesubhuman on Shanghai Gesture: An uneven tone veering between tragedy, melodrama and camp comedy, and a disjointed storyline exacerbated by severe cuts from the Hays office. But it&apos;s great \u2013 Gene Tierney as a spoiled brat, Victor Mature (wearing a fez) as the louche flaneur/pimp Doctor Omar, gambling dens, brothels and decadence.

In his magnificent biography of Harold Wilson, Ben Pimlott gives the date when the traditional ruling class surrendered: 22 July 1965, when Sir Alec Douglas-Home resigned as leader of the Tory party. On hearing the news, Wilson performed a victory jig round the cabinet table while singing There Will Never Be Another You. Wilson had led Labour to a narrow win at the general election of October 1964, and Douglas-Home&apos;s departure appeared to set the seal on the social revolution that had occurred in British politics. Pimlott himself, writing in 1992, was in no doubt that the change was permanent: &quot;An era had finally ended. Sir Alec Douglas-Home was the fourth Conservative leader in succession either to have been drawn from, or to have married into, the aristocracy. Since his departure, with the single exception of Michael Foot, there has been no leader of a major British party who even attended an independent school.&quot; To beat Wilson, the Tories turned to Edward Heath, the most &quot;common&quot; leader they had ever had, and the first to be elected by Conservative MPs rather than chosen by a mysterious &quot;magic circle&quot; of grandees. No longer would the Etonians be running the show and choosing one of their own as front man. It seemed clear that no one from one of the old public schools would ever again lead the Tories. The future belonged to people such as Heath, who could be presented as classless meritocrats, and whose rise dramatised a radical social shift. The irony was that, despite his humble origins, he lacked the common touch. Relatively humble origins had nevertheless become a necessary qualification for leading the Tory party: he was succeeded by Margaret Thatcher, John Major, William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard, none of whom had been born with a silver spoon in his or her mouth. In retrospect, the key defeat for the traditional ruling class could be said to have taken place as long ago as 1945, when the Tories under Winston Churchill, grandson of a duke, suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Clement Attlee&apos;s thoroughly egalitarian Labour party. Voters condemned the Tories as &quot;upper-class, out of touch and uncompassionate \u2013 the party of two nations, not one&quot;, as Alistair Cooke, the Conservative party&apos;s official historian, has put it. The Tories were blamed for the dreadful unemployment of the 1930s, and after 1945 were forced to try to recover lost ground by accepting the NHS and economic policies that owed more to socialism than to the free market. Harold Macmillan, the most successful postwar Tory prime minister until Thatcher, took enormous pains to make himself look &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; \u2013 a side of him obscured in public memory by his grouse-moor image. While serving as leader of the opposition, David Cameron hung a picture of Macmillan in his office. In class terms, Cameron&apos;s election as Tory leader in 2005 was an astonishing turn of events; the party was once more led by an Etonian who had married into the aristocracy.  Cameron has also striven to show how progressive he is. Under his leadership, the Tory party has made intense and partially successful efforts to recruit more women and ethnic minority MPs. It has also accepted what for most Tories is far more objectionable: coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Unfortunately for the Tories, the Lib Dems are led by Nick Clegg, described by Boris Johnson as a &quot;cut-price edition of David Cameron hastily knocked off by a Shanghai sweatshop to satisfy unexpected market demand&quot;. The coalition is top-heavy with public schoolboys. The class war did not after all end in July 1965, but is still raging in April 2012.

It was not so much the size of the rift \u2013 about eight metres long and only a few centimetres across \u2013 more its location that caused concern. It was at the foot of the Shanghai Tower project. Due for completion in 2014, the tower will stand 632\u00a0metres high, and is just next to two other giants, the World Financial Centre and Jinmao Tower, rising, respectively, 492 and 420 metres into the air. The appearance of cracks in the ground and the publication of photographs on blogs have fuelled questions in recent weeks. &quot;The surface cracks, which were caused by a usual settlement of the foundation ditch, are in a controlled and safe state,&quot; the Shanghai Tower Construction and Development Company said in a statement to the China Daily. The problem of subsidence in Chinese cities is nevertheless very real. &quot;The pressure exerted by skyscrapers is a minor cause,&quot; says Li Qinfen, a researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Geological Survey. Excessive pumping of groundwater to service new urban developments is the key factor. The crack in the road has rekindled an old story, which claims that Shanghai is gradually sinking. The centre of China&apos;s business capital has subsided by 2.6 metres since 1921, when the first surveys were carried out. The city stands on the Yangtze river delta, which rests on a layer of sediment, consisting mainly of clay and about 300 metres thick. After studying data from various surveys Dr Jin-Chun Chai, a professor at Saga University in Japan, concluded in a scientific journal: &quot;The field data shows that there is a strong correlation between the rate of net groundwater pumping and the rate of land subsidence.&quot; Shanghai&apos;s average annual subsidence from 1921 to 1949 was 2.5cm, according to official data. With increasing depletion of groundwater reserves the rate rose to 10cm a year in 1957-61. From 1966 onwards measures to restrict underground pumping slowed this trend. But in the 1980s, as the economy was opened up, water depletion and subsidence resumed, according to Li. Last October, a hole appeared suddenly on a street near the main railway station. Then on 9 March, a 7km stretch of high-speed rail line collapsed in Hubei province. The line was due to open to passenger traffic in May and trials were already under way. A director of the provincial railway construction bureau, Wang Zujian, blamed the &quot;unique local geological structure&quot;. According to a recent study by the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, 50 fast-expanding cities are affected by this type of subsidence, mainly due to excessive use of groundwater. The rise in demand is due to people migrating to the cities, to changing patterns of consumption and industrial growth. Since the People&apos;s Republic was established in 1949, 79,000 sq km of land has subsided by more than 20cm, above all on the north China plain, in the central mining provinces (Shanxi and Shaanxi), and on the Yangtze delta, according to the authorities. A plan presented in February by the land and resources ministry aims to halt subsidence in all three critical areas by 2015 by limiting water withdrawal. The plan will be applied to the whole country in 2020. Shanghai \u2013 doomed, according to some observers, to suffer a similar fate\u00a0to Atlantis \u2013 has in fact already taken action to reverse the trend, injecting about 60,000 tonnes of water a year into its aquifers, according to the city\u00a0council.

Its dominance is not inevitable | Jonathan Fenby", "article": "China&apos;s rise is a commonplace of our times. The last major state on earth ruled by a Communist party appears set to dominate the planet, surpassing an anaemic west and owning the 21st century. After the temporary economic downturn of 2008, its growth has soared once more to make it the planet&apos;s second biggest economy. Everything about it is huge, starting with its 1.3 billion people. Its Communist party is the planet&apos;s biggest political movement; it contains 55% of the world&apos;s pigs; its people smoke 38% of the cigarettes consumed on earth. So it is very easy to be swept away by the apparent inevitability of China&apos;s dominance, especially for those who were let down by the Soviet Union&apos;s failure to get the better of the United States and now see a new champion in the east. The reality is that, as it prepares for a wholesale change of leadership starting later this year, the People&apos;s Republic faces fundamental tests which will determine if it is able to continue its upwards trajectory or will be caught by the deep flaws in its system \u2013 political, economic and social. The political scene has been enlivened this spring by drama surrounding Bo Xilai, the rock star of Chinese politics, who crashed to earth amid murky events in the mega-municipality of Chongqing, which he had made the launching pad for his ambitions. But the real challenge for the leadership goes far\u00a0deeper and starts at the very top of the system. The Communist party&apos;s monopoly position means that it and the government which comes under it dominate the economy and society as well as politics. But what is it for? Is it merely a managerial elite relying on growth for legitimacy, defending the status quo on behalf of those who have profited from economic expansion? Hu Jintao, the Chinese leader who will step down at the next party congress, probably in October, preaches the virtues of a &quot;harmonious society&quot;, evoking Confucian virtues. Yet wealth distribution is more unequal than in the west. Materialism rules, epitomised by the young woman on a television dating show who said she would rather cry in the back of a BMW than laugh on the back of a bicycle. In the opaque world of top-level Chinese politics, we have little idea of what Xi Jinping, Hu&apos;s anointed successor as party secretary, stands for. Asked how he got to the top, sources in Beijing reply that everybody is comfortable with him. We know that he belongs to the so-called &quot;princelings group&quot;, the offspring of first-generation Communist party leaders, and rose through the party ranks in booming east coast provinces before being elevated in 2007 to the standing committee of the politburo, the supreme decision-making body, in a closed-door process at the five-yearly Communist congress. We know that he has enjoyed the support of the &quot;Shanghai faction&quot;, which used to run China and is well-connected with fellow princelings and younger generals in the People&apos;s Liberation Army. But nobody knows what his policy preferences are and, I would guess, he has not decided them himself, waiting like the canny politician he is to see the balance of power in China after he takes the top job at the party conference later this year. Hardly the recipe for grappling with the major changes China needs. The economy is, as the leaders acknowledge, seriously unbalanced, with excessive dependence on investment in property construction, infrastructure and exports. In this nominally Communist state, the share of wages in national income is far lower than in developed capitalist nations; the forces of capital have been the big beneficiaries of growth, not the workers. People are registered to their place of origin and so migrant workers in cities lack the right to education, healthcare or property purchases. An effort is being made to boost blue-collar pay and thereby stimulate consumption as an economic motor, but this will be, as a party school official told me, &quot;a matter of two five-year plans&quot;. China wants to move up the technological value chain, but it is not clear that it has the skills to do so. Training takes time. Top jobs in the huge state sector are decided on political grounds as well as competence. The drive to do everything bigger and faster than anywhere else showed its limitations with the crash of a high-speed train last summer, killing 39 people. There is a huge environmental crisis. northern China is seriously short of water. Agriculture is hobbled by a multitude of small plots leased from the state that cannot support mechanisation. The &quot;demographic dividend&quot; of young workers is about to fade as the result of the falling birthrate, while improved healthcare means the number of people aged over 60 is equal to the population of Spain \u2013 that in a country without a proper pensions net and where the traditional family structure is strained. Underlying everything is a serious trust deficit. &quot;Only believe something when the government denies it,&quot; is a common saying. Corruption is endemic, accompanied by lack of accountability and weak rule of law \u2013 judges have just been told to swear a loyalty oath to the Communist party. There are recurrent food scandals; cartons of UHT milk from New Zealand sell for several times the price of domestic milk because people think it is safe. While individuals are far freer than in the days of Mao Zedong, any form of organised dissidence is ruthlessly crushed \u2013 the budget for internal security is greater than that for the armed forces. Still, there are reckoned to be 150,000 popular protests a year, some involving tens of thousands of demonstrators. Society is evolving at breakneck speed. Social media make the control ethos embedded in the party&apos;s DNA increasingly difficult to implement. Despite all these fault lines, China is not going to collapse; it is far too resilient for that. Its growth has made more people materially better off in a shorter space of time than ever before in human history and this breeds loyalty to a system. But two things are clear. It does not provide a model for the rest of the world as its admirers might wish, and the danger now is that, unless Xi Jinping and his colleagues in the new politburo undertake serious reform, China will be stuck in an increasingly outdated groove, out of tune with its needs and aspirations.

Millen the woman says she is embarrassed by the brand. But the chain she relinquished control of in 2004 has threatened legal action if she returns to business, as planned, under the brand name Karen or KM. &quot;I never wear the clothes,&quot; Millen says. &quot;I think the brand has somewhat stood still and the overall style is in danger of looking a little staid, which is reflected in their performance. Although there are one or two pieces that are strong, they become overshadowed by the majority of the collection, which I feel is too heavily branded and overpowering. Karen Millen is just a brand of clothing and does not reflect me as a person in any way\u2026 Sometimes I find it a little difficult as I have no control over what they design and at times it can be a little embarrassing.&quot; Gemma Metheringham, the current managing director of Karen Millen, says she is &quot;genuinely puzzled&quot; by Millen&apos;s comments. &quot;Even before she sold the business, I honestly think she was falling out of love with it. Of course the collection has grown and evolved significantly, so it is quite likely that it doesn&apos;t reflect her taste now.&quot; Metheringham was hired by Millen and her then husband and co-founder of the brand, Kevin Stanford, as design director in 1999. Two years later, Millen and Stanford sold half the business to Icelandic bank Kaupthing, and in 2004 lost majority control when the business was merged with Oasis (backed by another Icelandic group, Baugur) to create Mosaic Fashions. Metheringham stayed on and was made joint managing director in 2009. Millen did not cut all ties with the company. She and her family trust retained a stake of almost 7%, while Stanford held a further 3.75%, as well as owning 8% of Baugur. Both Baugur and Mosaic were casualties of the Icelandic crisis. Now Millen claims she was duped by her former co-investors, saying: &quot;I will not rest until I have my company completely restored to me.&quot; Mosaic was salvaged by a controversial pre-pack administration. The same day it that was declared bankrupt, wiping out its debts, the bulk of it was sold back to Kaupthing, which was itself in administration. Mosaic continued trading throughout, though it changed its name to Aurora Fashions after the pre-pack. Somewhat remarkably, considering the upheaval, the company did well, with Karen Millen a star performer. Then, last year, Karen Millen was spun out of Aurora, though it remains 90% owned by Kaupthing&apos;s administrators. The move prompted talk that it was being prepared for a sale \u2013 and some suggest the current publicity drive, with Metheringham taking a higher-profile role, could point to the same thing. &quot;People are always speculating about that,&quot; she says. There was talk that Millen herself might try to buy back the brand. Asked about this, Metheringham says only: &quot;I don&apos;t think that was ever a serious proposition.&quot; Sitting in her office at the top of a building occupied by all of the Aurora companies, Metheringham says the brand has not changed since it gained its independence. &quot;It&apos;s possibly not the right answer for the board downstairs but I always thought we were independent. I&apos;ve always been sitting up on the sixth floor saying, &apos;Of course we&apos;re very different from the other Aurora brands, the whole way we work is different&apos;.&quot; Instead of having buyers, Karen Millen designs all of its clothes in the UK. Unusually, it also has its own pattern cutters. These are the people that turn a design into an item of clothing. Metheringham is fiercely proud of this side of the business and eagerly gives me a tour of the pattern room \u2013 a huge light-filled workshop, littered with dummies, all draped in material, some closer to resembling finished items than others. In the same room sit the graders, who adjust each piece of a garment so that they fit a size 6 as well as they do a size 16. You can&apos;t, apparently, just shrink or expand each piece by the same amount. &quot;I think sometimes pattern cutting and technical are the unsung heroes,&quot; says Metheringham, who worries that their skills are rapidly disappearing. &quot;We are trying to do something that keeps the craft alive and it becomes more and more difficult to find people with the skills in the UK to do that.&quot; Karen Millen employs some 1,100 people in the UK, with 200 in head office and the rest in shops. The manufacturing is done abroad, about half in China and half in eastern Europe. Metheringham says this is not just for financial reasons. &quot;I think it would be difficult to find the people who were prepared to take the trouble [in the UK]. Some of the clothes we make have up to 80 pattern pieces. Somebody&apos;s really got to be prepared to put that extra bit of skill into it.&quot; With factories abroad there is, of course, always the risk of inadequate working conditions. Metheringham visits the factories, but pauses when asked about what she finds there. &quot;I think it&apos;s very difficult, isn&apos;t it? To apply what we would consider to be our life standards to other people&apos;s standards in China.&quot; Karen Millen has signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative, an alliance of companies and NGOs that has developed a code of conduct, which is generally well-received among campaigners. &quot;I think you almost need to take that very professional approach to it,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t think you ever relax about it.&quot; As the global economy shifts, China is no longer just a manufacturing base for Karen Millen. The chain is opening stores in Beijing and Shanghai this year and has plans for 65 outlets there over the next five years. It is part of a major push that has seen it open shops in markets as unlikely as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. With dresses that sell for \u00a3125 and more in the UK, and import duties that will increase prices by up to 30% abroad, it is hard to see where the brand will sit in poorer markets. Metheringham says: &quot;What you&apos;ve got around the world is an emerging middle class and within that you&apos;ve got a whole set of women who are now working and wanting to buy themselves things. The brand is still pitched in a place where it is affordable.&quot; This overseas expansion is part of a strategy to double sales to \u00a3500m by 2016. Metheringham explains that growth must come from abroad to avoid flooding the UK market &quot;so the brand doesn&apos;t become distorted and overstretched. &quot;If you are really going to be an international brand, it&apos;s very important you protect your brand image in the market you&apos;re from.&quot; Metheringham claims she is no good with dates and numbers, peering through fashionable glasses at her &quot;crib sheets&quot; for various statistics, but it is clear she is commercially minded and keeps a tight grip on the brand. She adds: &quot;I see every single sketch that goes through the studio. I think it&apos;s really important that somebody holds the brand together. I am a sort of unlikely stepmother for Karen Millen.&quot; As is so often the case, mother and stepmother seem set to clash over who rules the roost.", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business", "Kaupthing", "Banking", "Baugur", "Iceland", "Mulberry", "Life and style", "Fashion"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-07T23:01:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/apr/09/finish-school-system", "sentences": ["The overall best performer in the 2009 test was the region of Shanghai, China."], "title": "How Finnish schools shine", "article": "In 2009 the UK&apos;s education policy directors suffered a significant blow. The PISA tests (OECD Programme for International Study Assessment) results were published, ranking the UK way down the international league table in reading, maths and science.  In total 65 countries were assessed; the UK scored: 25th in reading, 28th in maths and 16th in science. The overall best performer in the 2009 test was the region of Shanghai, China. Results from PISA suggested that school autonomy in defining the curriculum and assessment methods relates positively to overall performance. Additionally, the PISA data reported that creating homogeneous schools and/or classrooms through selection is unrelated to the average performance of education systems.  As if these facts weren&apos;t enough to send policy makers and directors into a whirlwind of confusion, it was also noted that UK ranked as 8th in the table for spending per pupil, but had a 23rd position average overall \u2013 this raises the question: &quot;Who does score consistently highly and how do they approach the delivery of education in a pedagogic, political and cultural sense?&quot; One western country that has excelled in PISA ratings consistently over the years and is highly regarded across the globe as a leading education nation is Finland. Their sustained success has for many years prompted educationalists to consider how they have achieved this.  The reasons behind Finland&apos;s success are complex, not because they have one particularly incomprehensible approach to education, but instead, the evolved working parts within their system, framed within their cultural backdrop complement each other tremendously. Therefore an explanation, in my view, cannot be plucked out of their model in isolation, as each element is interdependent and inherently contingent on various other tacit and inconspicuous aspects that ultimate play a significant role within the mechanics of the model. It is this complexity that has perhaps been the source of difficulties experienced by authorities attempting to directly emulate their system.  In Finland teaching is a prestigious career. Children aspire to be doctors, lawyers, scientists and in the same breath teachers. They are respected and appreciated; they are highly qualified (requiring a Masters degree for full time employment) and job selection is a tough process with only best candidates gaining the posts.  The Finnish curriculum is far less &apos;academic&apos; than you would expect of such a high achieving nation. Finnish students do the least number of class hours per week in the developed world, yet get the best results in the long term. Students in Finland sit no mandatory exams until the age of 17-19. Teacher based assessments are used by schools to monitor progress and these are not graded, scored or compared; but instead are descriptive and utilised in a formative manner to inform feedback and assessment for learning. Great emphasis is put on pupil and teacher trust and well-being. Outdoor, practical learning opportunities and healthy related physical activity sessions are a regular feature in the curriculum: helping to maintain a healthy body and mind.  Finnish schools receive full autonomy, with head teachers and teachers experiencing considerable independence when developing and delivering their own individual curricula: suited to their setting. Combinations of alternative pedagogic approaches, rather than mere instructional methods are utilised by the teachers. The pedagogical freedom experienced facilitates greater creativity, pro-activity and innovation. This naturally allows a greater degree of individual emotional well being, that no doubt plays a role in fostering positive learning role models and environments: positively shaping the minds of teachers and pupils alike.  Finland&apos;s Ministry of Education&apos;s philosophy has been to trust the professionals, parents and communities to guide their own policy: and it would appear that their investment has paid off. From this secure base, in which high quality teachers are appreciated and trusted to do their job effectively as they see fit and political agendas are deflected, there emerges an impressive education system to be proud of that serves its students, communities and country very well. All students in Finland receive a free education from when they start at seven years of age until they complete their university studies. During their educational journey all pupils receive free school meals, resources and materials, transport and support services. Professional Learning Communities are integral to sharing and spreading good practice in a collaborative manner. The systematic introduction of languages is also striking and very effective. Pupils will often begin learning a third language by 11 years of age and some a fourth at 13.  A no child is left behind approach means that all classes contain a mixture of ability level pupils, with most classes containing two or more teachers who focus on those needing additional support. By having professionals working in conjunction, the needs of the pupils can be better met within a happy and familiar environment. Many teachers also stay with a single class for many years, moving with them through the school.  Many institutions are combined primary and secondary schools with no major unsettling transition stages; this also allows a consistent ethos and common language to pervade. Students address teachers by their Christian names, do not wear uniforms, and are encouraged to relax in their surroundings.  As with any system there are of course strengths, areas for development and ideological conflict. The Finnish system is aware of this and prides itself on positively evolving with the pupils&apos; needs and interests at the heart of all decisions.  The Finnish system&apos;s success is built on the idea that: &quot;less can be more&quot;. This may appear counter-intuitive to many within other educational systems in which standards and effectiveness are measured in standardised data and evidence trails. The absence of corrosive competition and an egalitarian ethos inherent in the Finnish culture has surely played a role in shaping this very impressive system. With PISA 2012 on the horizon, the outcomes are sure to provide more food for thought for all educators and policy makers around the world. \u2022 Adam Lopez is a primary school teacher at Langstone Primary School in Newport, South Wales.

The team member, who would not be named but who said his views were representative, told the Guardian: &quot;I feel very uncomfortable about going to Bahrain. If\u00a0I&apos;m brutally frank, the only way they can pull this race off without incident is to have a complete military lockdown there. And I\u00a0think that would be unacceptable, both for F1 and for Bahrain. But I don&apos;t see any other way they can do it.&quot; Until now the teams and sponsors have kept quiet, maintaining a united front and leaving the big decision to the men who rule the sport. And Jean Todt, the president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile (FIA), the sport&apos;s governing body, and Bernie Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder, have insisted that the race will go ahead. But the team principal who broke rank added: &quot;We&apos;re all hoping the FIA calls it off. From a purely legal point of view, in terms of insurance and government advice, we are clear to go. But what we find worrying is that there are issues happening every day.&quot; Last year&apos;s grand prix was cancelled after more than 40 people died, many after being tortured, following Shia-led protests against the Sunni ruling family. British MPs voiced worries at the weekend in the wake of fresh protests and the growing concern for the condition of the jailed activist Abdulhadi Alkhawaja. Last Friday, security forces fired tear gas and water cannon at thousands of Alkhawaja supporters. On Saturday his daughter Maryam described him as being ready to die. Zainab, another daughter, was also detained. &quot;We have a lot of people. Our first and foremost priority has to be our employees. And their families,&quot; the team principal told the Guardian. &quot;That&apos;s what concerns us most, even though we&apos;ve not said anything about it. It seems to me that while there has been some political progress in Bahrain they&apos;re not quite ready. The best thing would be for the race to be postponed until later in the year, or even cancelled. &quot;But that is a decision that must be made by the FIA, FOM [Formula One Management] and the commercial rights holder. I never anticipated a decision being made until the week before China. I believe Jean Todt is in China, which is interesting.&quot; The fact that this Sunday&apos;s race, in Shanghai, and the Bahrain GP are scheduled back-to-back has complicated travel arrangements, with many half expecting the Bahrain event to be put back. Some teams have reportedly been issued with two return tickets, one home via Bahrain and the other directly home. Last week, in the Guardian, the former F1 world champion Damon Hill, a Sky Sports commentator who had spoken out in favour of the race taking place earlier in the year, called for a rethink by the FIA. Hill, who last year called for the race not to be rescheduled following its cancellation for safety reasons, added at the weekend: &quot;F1&apos;s chiefs must not act like they do not care. I think at the moment it is hotting up, which is not a good state of affairs to be wanting to go to Bahrain, when it is actually getting more inflamed.&quot; The protest campaign in Bahrain has been intensifying around Sunday&apos;s (8\u00a0April) first anniversary of Alkhawaja&apos;s arrest. He is now on his 60th day of hunger strike and reportedly close to death. He has spent the past year in prison after receiving a life sentence in a Bahraini security court on a charge of &quot;plotting to overthrow the monarchy&quot; \u2014 supporters say on the basis of a confession obtained under duress. On Sunday Bahrain rejected a request from the Danish government to transfer Alkhawaja, 52, to Denmark, where he also has citizenship. John Yates, former assistant commissioner in the London Metropolitan Police Service who is advising the Gulf kingdom&apos;s interior ministry, told the Associated Press: &quot;It is very much hoped that the policing [of the grand prix] will be low key and discreet. But if there are problems, they \u2026 must be able to escalate their response if need be.&quot; He said he expected some protests would be allowed but warned that anyone trying to shut down the race would be treated harshly. &quot;If people want to protest lawfully and give proper notice, as they have to, then they will be allowed to protest,&quot; Yates said. &quot;But you can&apos;t have a protest that shuts off every road and doesn&apos;t allow people to get to the grand prix circuit. That would be absurd. They can be allowed to protest in certain places where it doesn&apos;t cause huge disruptions and their message can get across.&quot; Hosting the grand prix is an issue of enormous prestige for the Manama government, which was dismayed at the blow to its carefully nurtured reputation for stability when it was cancelled last year because of the unrest. Bahrain is seen in the Middle East as the most striking failure of the uprisings of the Arab spring, where the protests in February and March 2011 were crushed by the western-backed monarchy with the help of an armed intervention force led by Saudi Arabia. The US and Britain have been accused of hypocrisy in turning a blind eye to repression though both governments have urged King Hamad to follow the recommendations of a officially appointed Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, which found that his government was guilty of &quot;excessive force&quot; in its crackdown against protesters. According to official figures the UK government approved the sale of military equipment valued at more than \u00a31m in the months following the violent crackdown.

Bahrain has got problems, too. The Bahrain International Circuit is one of 20 venues for F1&apos;s travelling and very noisy circus in 2012. There are worries about a number of the other countries included in the sport&apos;s calendar as well. Human rights in China, the home of this Sunday&apos;s race in Shanghai, has long been a topic of heated debate, as have conditions in oil-rich Abu Dhabi, which will host the 18th event in November. Then there is the next race in Texas two weeks later, the state with the worst record on capital punishment in the United States, while the areas that stage the Indian and South Korean races are infamous for their poverty and have attracted allegations of corruption. Formula One can argue rather convincingly it is not the planet&apos;s moral guardian. The Bahrain Grand Prix, however, is different. For this is the race that galvanised public opinion last year and it is doing so again. Forget the decibel-fest in Shanghai on Sunday, it is Bahrain the\u00a0following week that everyone is talking about. This race was cancelled last year and, unless there has been a fundamental improvement in the political situation, it seems likely that it will be called off again, albeit for safety rather than moral reasons. But no one is openly talking about it. That is because those who govern the sport want to go to Bahrain with a sense of unity. Without that the whole enterprise is hopeless. And even now teams are afraid of falling out with the FIA, the sport&apos;s governing body, or Bernie Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder who will be 82 this year but who still holds the sport in his gnarled grip. It has been that way for almost four decades. Ecclestone may be out of date but he remains, even in old age, one of the most remarkable negotiators in all sport and there is probably not a single team in the paddock which is not indebted to him, both personally and collectively. In recent years some team principals have muttered, privately, that it is time to move on. They concede that while Ecclestone did a great job is positioning the sport where it is now, through the 1980s and 1990s, he knows little of the modern world or perhaps how best to market the beast that he created. But Formula One, self-obsessed and even solipsistic, continues to thrive, viewing figures are still going up and Ecclestone still manages to pull off unlikely deals, such as the current one that sees coverage shared between Sky Sports and the BBC. It is, it seems, his special genius to appeal to the vanity of leaders in the Far East and Middle East, to persuade them they need to stage a Formula One grand prix and that they need to build yet another white elephant of a circuit in the desert even though few people will turn up to watch the show. Formula One was, a few years ago, a mostly European experience. But this year 12 of the 20 races will be long-haul events \u2013 or fly-aways as they are referred to in the paddock, placing even greater stress on already over-worked teams. A year ago the old ringmaster Ecclestone&apos;s days seemed numbered. Then, as he attempted to reschedule the cancelled Bahrain Grand Prix, there was speculation that Rupert Murdoch&apos;s media conglomerate would bid to purchase F1 from CVC, the private equity firm. Ecclestone also had to deal with an investigation by German authorities into alleged bribes in connection with the sport&apos;s previous change of ownership, in 2005, although he only ever appeared as a witness in the case and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on his part. Formula One has always had the ability to self-harm, as if deafened to the outside world by the awful din it creates. Bahrain, which first staged a race in 2004, is damaging the sport this year, just as it did last. But Ecclestone will probably still be standing, even if he has to back down in the end to the clamour of public opinion.", "tags": ["Formula One 2012", "Formula One", "Bernie Ecclestone", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-09T20:33:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/10/bahrain-tension-doubt-grand-prix", "sentences": ["Commercially they have to go, but whether they decide to or not is up to them.&quot; Ecclestone said he would meet the teams and Jean Todt, the director of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile (FIA), the sport&apos;s governing body, during preparations for this weekend&apos;s grand prix in Shanghai."], "title": "Bahrain Grand Prix in doubt amid tension over hunger striker", "article": "A hunger striker who is feared to be close to death and a bomb blast that injured seven policemen have increased tensions over next weekend&apos;s planned Bahrain Grand Prix. Formula One supremo, Bernie Ecclestone, said on Tuesday that the racing teams would have the final say over whether the event goes ahead in the troubled Gulf state. Family and supporters of Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, an imprisoned anti-government activist who has been on hunger strike for more than 60 days, are growing increasingly concerned for his health after being denied contact with him since Sunday, when a judicial panel in Bahrain refused Denmark&apos;s request to take custody of Khawaja, who is a Danish citizen. On Monday, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, urged Bahrain to consider reversing that decision on humanitarian grounds. The Bahrain interior ministry reported that seven policemen were injured, three seriously, after protesters against Khawaja&apos;s continued imprisonment detonated a homemade bomb during clashes with police on Monday night in Eker, a village outside the capital, Manama. Protesters threw petrol bombs at riot police to lure officers before the explosion was set off, the spokesman said. The government said it considered the bombing, thought to be the first of its kind, &quot;an act of terrorism&quot;. Speaking after the blast, which local observers said signalled a possible worsening in the security situation in the country following a year of unarmed struggle, Ecclestone said there were commercial reasons why teams should take part in Sunday&apos;s race but admitted he could not force them to participate. &quot;We&apos;ve no way we can force people to go there,&quot; he told the Press Association. &quot;We can&apos;t say &apos;you&apos;ve got to go&apos; \u2013 although they would be in breach of their agreement with us if they didn&apos;t go \u2013 but it doesn&apos;t help. Commercially they have to go, but whether they decide to or not is up to them.&quot; Ecclestone said he would meet the teams and Jean Todt, the director of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile (FIA), the sport&apos;s governing body, during preparations for this weekend&apos;s grand prix in Shanghai. Ecclestone added that no team had told him it wanted to pull out, but one team has told the Guardian the race should not go ahead because the only way it could be held safely would be with a &quot;complete military lockdown&quot;, which would not be acceptable to the sport or Bahrain. Khawaja&apos;s lawyer, Mohammed al-Jeshi, told news agencies on Monday that his family feared he had died as a result of the lack of contact since Sunday. &quot;Authorities have been refusing since yesterday all requests, made by myself and by his family, to visit or contact al-Khawaja,&quot; Jeshi told AFP. &quot;We fear that he might have passed away as there is no excuse for them to prevent us from visiting or contacting him&quot;. But on Tuesday, the government said that since Khawaja had been moved to the military hospital last week, he had been accepting fluids orally and intravenously and receiving medication to increase his potassium level. It said that after a medical review of his condition on Sunday and Monday by two medical experts &quot;he seemed well and was co-operative, quite coherent, well oriented in time, place and person. He was able to move around and stand normally for some time and able to read and write.&quot; It said &quot;he has not been continuously on a total fast&quot;, but added that the fat tissue beneath his skin had disappeared, his liver was fatty and he was susceptible to infection because of his low white blood cell count. &quot;If he continues [on] hunger strike and does not allow any medical interference his life will be in serious danger.&quot; Khawaja&apos;s death would be likely to be met by widespread protests, with some anti-government activists said to be prepared to set aside their peaceful approach to direct more aggressive protests at police and the grand prix. A leading opposition activist, Ala&apos;a Shehabi, said Ecclestone told her in a phone call on Tuesday morning that he wanted to host a press conference during the grand prix for opposition leaders to give them a voice, telling her: &quot;I want dialogue.&quot; &quot;He told me he was very concerned with the situation and that he had spoken with the crown prince about Khawaja&apos;s health and had been reassured that he was receiving nutrition,&quot; said Shehabi. She said she told him that their information was different and he may have been force fed, and that it would be impossible to hold any press conference at the track because of its control by the government. But she urged him to organise an alternative facility that could give the opposition a formal platform at the event. &quot;Bernie Ecclestone could become a facilitator for dialogue between the government and the opposition,&quot; she said. &quot;He could twist their arm with Formula 1 [by urging the release of Khawaja].

Hitler had used the murder of a minor official in the German embassy in Paris by a Polish Jew protesting against the expulsion of his parents from Germany as an excuse for the pogrom. The stormtroopers were fuelled by anger as well as by alcohol, their antisemitic passions inflamed by lurid accounts of the killing in Goebbels&apos;s propaganda press. As the destruction proceeded, Jewish homes were broken into and the contents looted or smashed, the occupants manhandled, beaten up or, in a substantial number of cases, murdered. Hitler ordered 30,000 Jewish men to be arrested and taken to concentration camps; their release came only when they agreed to emigrate. By the outbreak of the war in September 1939 the Jewish population of Germany was half what it had been when the Nazis came to power. After their arrival in England, America, Palestine, Shanghai or some other safe haven, the Jewish emigrants found an opportunity to recount their experiences when three Harvard academics, the historian Sidney Fay, the psychologist Gordon Allport and the sociologist Edward Hartshorne, offered a monetary reward (top prize $1,000) for &quot;the best unpublished personal life histories of persons who have experienced the effects of National Socialism in Germany&quot;. The purpose, they said was &quot;purely scientific&quot;. Two hundred and sixty-three essays came in, mostly though not exclusively from Jews who had emigrated after the pogrom. Uta Gerhardt and Thomas Karlauf have selected for publication 21 of these accounts from a manuscript prepared by Hartshorne. Entitled Nazi Madness, it was never published. Hartshorne had edited his selected narratives and reorganised them to increase their impact. The testimonies recount a wide variety of experiences. For Hugo Moses, a former bank official, the behaviour of the drunken mob of stormtroopers who broke into his apartment on the night of 9 November, overturning his furniture and smashing his ornaments and pictures, while an SS man held a loaded revolver to his head, contrasted with the policemen who came to inspect the damage and told him apologetically: &quot;It&apos;s a disgrace to see all this.&quot; Public reaction in general, as reported in these memoirs, was mixed: some Germans gathered in jeering mobs, others stood by muttering disapproving comments. Nobody intervened. Sofoni Herz, a teacher at a Jewish orphanage in Dinslaken, a mining town in the Ruhr, hurriedly took 32 children outside while a gang of 50 men systematically destroyed everything in the building, &quot;shattering window panes, throwing books, chairs, beds, tables, linens, maps, valises, piano parts, etc out of the windows and doors&quot; before setting the orphanage&apos;s synagogue on fire. A Nazi official announced &quot;that we have ordered that the cow belonging to the orphanage, which is taken care of by a German farmer, will continue to be fed. Animals must not suffer on this day.&quot; The children and staff were imprisoned in a room in the city, where local policemen apologised to them: &quot;we&apos;re all still good Social Democrats or Democrats. But what can we do in times like these?&quot; Some of these reminiscences tell other stories too. A Nazi teacher persecuted Hugo Moses&apos;s nine-year-old son in the classroom, making him sit on a bench on his own, refusing to correct his work and banning him from using the school swimming pool: &quot;You are not allowed to contaminate German water.&quot; The boy later told his father he would have thrown himself under a train had this continued much longer. The head teacher, though sympathetic to the father&apos;s protests, confessed he could do nothing, because he would lose his job if he did. But almost all the memoirs focus on the events of 9-10 November 1938. Particularly harrowing are the stories of what happened to the Jewish men arrested and taken off to the camps. The shopkeeper Karl Schwabe endured &quot;a series of endless physical and mental sufferings&quot; at Buchenwald. In the first days they were deprived of food and drink \u2013 &quot;our mouths dried out completely, our throats burned&quot;. They were forced to stand outside in rows for hours, with the SS mercilessly hitting and kicking anyone who fell over. Many were beaten to death; others, unable to bear the torture, ran into the electrified barbed wire fences. Elderly men were forced to do squats until they dropped from exhaustion. &quot;The sanitary conditions&quot;, Schwabe wrote, &quot;defy description.&quot; Karl Rosenthal, a reform rabbi in Berlin, recounted the repeated humiliations to which prisoners were subjected, as they were forced under blows to chant &quot;we are the destroyers of German culture!&quot; Social envy was behind many of the insults. &quot;Your profession?&quot; an SS man asked one of the prisoners. &quot;Former lawyer.&quot; &quot;Bullshit, you&apos;re a pimp! Repeat it!&quot; Psychological torture accompanied the beatings, as the men were lined up and told &quot;tonight 3,000 Jewish kids will be shot in Berlin&quot;. The men were released on condition they emigrated. But this was far from easy. Hertha Nathorff, head physician at a major hospital in Berlin until September 1938, related her repeated attempts to gather the funds, documents and permissions to go with her husband to Cuba and thence to the US: bribery and extortion were part of the process, and by New Year&apos;s Eve 1938 she still had not got away: &quot;I&apos;m just counting the days until we can get out of this hell.&quot; The value of these testimonies lies above all in their detail and immediacy. Mostly they confirm the picture we already have from other sources, though few are as vivid as these. Collecting the testimonies was, despite the assurances of the Harvard professors, by no means a &quot;purely scientific&quot; exercise. For Hartshorne in particular, the Third Reich was an abomination. In the mid-1930s he had lived in Berlin gathering material for his PhD on the destruction of the universities by National Socialism. Later, he urged the neutral US to mobilise against what he regarded as the rule of a criminal clique in Germany. Nazi Madness was to have been a contribution to his campaign against American isolationism. It remained unpublished because Hartshorne was drafted into government service once the US entered the war, and lacked the time to see it through the press. In 1945 he was put in charge first of re-establishing German universities, and then of denazification in Bavaria, with further heavy demands on his time. Hartshorne&apos;s anti-Nazi convictions aroused the hostility of the US military government&apos;s Counter-Intelligence Corps, the CIC, which was smuggling Nazi war criminals out of Soviet-occupied Austria and eastern Europe to Italy and thence South America, to be questioned about their knowledge of the Soviets for use in the looming cold war. Informed of these activities, Hartshorne was outraged and passed on information about this &quot;ratline&quot; to Moscow. He had become a serious inconvenience to the CIC. On 28 August 1946, on the Munich-to-Erlangen autobahn, his car was overtaken by a Jeep, which suddenly slowed down in front of him, forcing him to overtake it in turn. As he passed, a single shot was fired from the jeep, hitting him in the head. He died two days later. The murderer was never identified. \u2022 Richard J Evans&apos;s The Third Reich at War is published by Penguin.", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "History", "Holocaust", "Kristallnacht"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-11T08:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/11/f1-bahrain-grand-prix-ecclestone", "sentences": ["I have little doubt that the Bahraini authorities will do everything they can to ensure that the grand prix goes off smoothly.&quot; With the teams now in Shanghai for Sunday&apos;s Chinese Grand Prix, further discussions are likely to take place and a decision could be reached over the weekend although it may, as was the case last year, result only in a postponement of the date of the race."], "title": "F1 teams insist any decision on Bahrain Grand Prix rests with the FIA", "article": "The Formula One Teams&apos; Association (Fota) has responded to comments by Bernie Ecclestone, implying that it was up to the teams to decide whether to attend the Bahrain Grand Prix, by unequivocally stating that it was a decision for motor sport&apos;s governing body, the FIA. The statement from Fota read: &quot;There&apos;s been some media speculation recently to the effect the teams may seek to cancel this year&apos;s Bahrain Grand Prix. That wouldn&apos;t be possible. Teams are unable to cancel grands prix. &quot;We race in an international series called the FIA Formula One world championship, and it is therefore for the FIA to offer the teams guidance on these issues.&quot; There was also reaction to the concentrated effort by the Bahrain authorities to counter the huge volume of negative publicity that has surrounded the race for the second year running. The Bahrain International Circuit (BIC) had issued a statement in which they quoted various sources in a bid to prove the venue was safe for the teams. One was a report by two representatives of the Lotus team who had recently visited Bahrain to assess the situation and implied that it was safe for the race to take place. Lotus responded by distancing themselves from the BIC and reiterating that it was a decision for the FIA, referring to the quotes which were private and only distributed to the other team managers, as &quot;part of a full internal and confidential working document, that was also sent on a confidential basis to all F1 team managers last week&quot;. They added: &quot;Lotus F1 Team is one of 12 contestants of the Formula One world championship and we would never try to substitute ourselves for the FIA, which is the only party entitled to determine if a grand prix should go ahead or not, and we endorse the Fota statement that was issued earlier to this effect.&quot; That the team had commissioned a report into potential danger and that it was distributed among all the teams suggests they are all fully aware that the only way they can pull out without incurring huge financial costs is on a safety basis. However, officials from the BIC also backed up the report from Lotus with a letter from the British ambassador to Bahrain, Iain Lindsay, from the 27 March. The diplomat, who would be responsible for any British citizens visiting Bahrain, stated: &quot;There are some who favour direct action on the streets. I believe they are wrong, and have little doubt that they represent a small minority of their own community and an even smaller minority of the Bahraini population. &quot;Incidents have been mainly confined to particular districts, away from the city centre and areas frequented by visitors. I have little doubt that the Bahraini authorities will do everything they can to ensure that the grand prix goes off smoothly.&quot; With the teams now in Shanghai for Sunday&apos;s Chinese Grand Prix, further discussions are likely to take place and a decision could be reached over the weekend although it may, as was the case last year, result only in a postponement of the date of the race. Meanwhile, the reaction from Fota and Lotus will have increased the pressure on the FIA, which has remained uninvolved in the debate, to take a position. Bahrain&apos;s Sheikh Abdullah bin Isa al-Khalifa is one of the 26 members of the FIA&apos;s World Motor Sport Council, which caused considerable anger last year when voting unanimously to persevere with attempting to reschedule the race despite widespread public opposition. Although ultimately the race was still not held, the FIA will still be anxious to avoid a repeat of the condemnation it received in the wake of last year&apos;s decision but may be unable to view the case in isolation \u2013 the organisation has also already scheduled a round of its new World Endurance Championship for Bahrain in September.", "tags": ["Formula One 2012", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-11T09:59:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/apr/11/china-epublishing-revolution-freedom", "sentences": ["I was in Shanghai in 2005, and this was my introduction to the Chinese blogosphere, where stringent censorship can be evaded if you know how."], "title": "China's e-publishing revolution puts writers on a fast track to freedom", "article": "The middle-aged man was introduced to me simply as &quot;Old Field&quot;. He had given up his teaching job, my informant told me gleefully, and now travelled around rural China, blogging about poverty, corruption and civil conflicts. I was in Shanghai in 2005, and this was my introduction to the Chinese blogosphere, where stringent censorship can be evaded if you know how. The Chinese have never lagged behind us in creative uses of the internet. Fast forward to 2012, and the internet in China has changed almost beyond recognition. Alongside 70 million bloggers, and an estimated 250 million microbloggers who use Sina.com&apos;s Twitter-equivalent weibo, there is a new phenomenon \u2013 fiction published exclusively online. E-publishing is very big business in China and is a hugely popular way for young writers to get read. They post stories in instalments on original fiction websites and the lucky few even earn substantial download fees and have their books snapped up by the games market and for TV serialisation. Most of these e-novels are &quot;pure entertainment, written, downloaded, read and deleted all at top speed \u2026&quot; but e\u2013publishing attracts serious writers as well, for a rather different reason: it offers a smidgen of freedom from censorship regulations which hamstring conventional publishers. One very successful internet author is Murong Xuecun. In 2002, he put his first novel Leave Me Alone: A Novel of Chengdu online. It caused enough of a stir to be taken up by a publisher, subsequently won prizes and has been translated. Murong has been, and continues to be, an outspoken critic of the Chinese system, which he calls &quot;rotten&quot; and &quot;corrupt&quot;, and he continues to publish his criticisms online. However, serious authors are unlikely to limit themselves to e-publishing. Print books pay better, or at least more reliably, and have lost none of their prestige. (Almost all literary prizes are awarded only to printed books, with the exception of the prestigious Mao Dun Literature prize which admitted e-published novels for the first time in 2011; of an overall 178 entries, none of the eight e-novels won an award.) So Murong successfully straddles these two worlds: he publishes a full version online, and his publisher brings out a bowdlerised edition. Censorship is less of a concern for western writers, of course, but does China&apos;s recent experience of e-publishing have anything else to tell us about the future of the printed book? Booksellers and publishers are gloomy, but perhaps the enthusiasm for ebooks among young people in China offers a ray of hope, an indication that e-publishing could give young readers a lifelong book-reading habit? Sadly, if straw polls on Chinese trains are anything to go by (Me: Who is your favourite author? Fellow traveller: I don&apos;t have time to read), there&apos;s not much grounds for hope there either. The pressures of work and raising a family are probably even greater in 21st-century China than in the west.", "tags": ["Chinese literature", "Ebooks", "Books", "Culture", "Publishing", "Technology", "Internet", "Blogging", "Newspapers & magazines", "Digital media", "Self-publishing", "China"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-11T15:29:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/11/bahrain-grand-prix-broadcast-boycott-call", "sentences": ["The teams are due to meet Ecclestone in Shanghai at the Chinese Grand Prix this weekend."], "title": "Bahrain activists call on BBC and Sky to boycott Formula One race", "article": "  Activists are calling on broadcasters, including the BBC and Sky, to boycott the Bahrain Grand Prix as organisers face mounting pressure over the Formula One race due to be staged in the troubled Gulf state on 22 April. Prominent human rights campaigners said they wanted broadcasters organisations not to air the race, if it went ahead, given recent events in the country. The call comes as sources told BBC Sport that a number of teams have indicated they expect the race to be called off amid safety concerns following a recent spike in violence in Bahrain over calls for democratic reform. Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone said on Tuesday that no teams had expressed concerns to him, but added it would be a breach of contract if any team did pull out. But the Formula One Teams&apos; Association (Fota) has said the decision over whether or not to cancel is one for the sport&apos;s governing body, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile (FIA). The teams are due to meet Ecclestone in Shanghai at the Chinese Grand Prix this weekend. Concerns over the fate of an imprisoned anti-government activist, as well as continued demands for reforms from Bahrain&apos;s Shia majority from its Sunni monarchy, have led to calls for the race to be cancelled. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, 52, has been on hunger strike for 63 days. His daughter Zainab al-Khawaja, told the Guardian: &quot;If the Formula One does come to Bahrain, despite calls from the Bahraini people and activists for it to be cancelled, then we would like to see that there are people supporting our cause, and who would not broadcast this race. &quot;Bringing Formula One, putting all these ads everywhere, celebration, celebration, celebration, while people are suffocating in their villages from teargas, while a marcher dies just two weeks ago and while my father is dying in a military hospital is just sending the message to the people of Bahrain that nothing has changed.&quot; Dr Ala&apos;a Shehabi, an activist who has been in communication with Ecclestone over the race&apos;s future, said she was writing to the BBC and Sky. &quot;Formula One is all about advertising, marketing, it&apos;s more about the commercial side than the actual sport itself. &quot;So we know that in broadcasting, you&apos;re encouraging all of the commercial interests in the sport which puts finance over human rights. That is what the major moral issue is here. If we can target the broadcasters, we can at least cut some of the possibility of profits made from advertising, at least \u2026 We will be asking them [the broadcasters] to examine their endorsement of Formula One. If they stay unquestioned, they won&apos;t think twice about broadcasting.&quot; The BBC, which shares broadcast rights in the UK with Sky until 2018, said in a statement: &quot;As the race had been officially sanctioned by the FIA we would expect to cover the events as part of our contractual obligations. However, we are in regular communication with the FIA and will be monitoring the situation closely.&quot; Sky had no comment. Bahrain has a contract until 2016 to stage the grand prix, but rules state that any race cancelled two years running cannot be put back on the calender. The authorities, which cancelled the race in 2011 owing to political unrest during the Arab spring, show no indication of doing so this year. Bahrain&apos;s interior ministry said seven policemen were injured by a homemade bomb on Monday in Eker, a village outside the capital, Manama. The government blamed protesters calling for Khawaja&apos;s release, and described the bombing as &quot;an act of terrorism&quot;. On Wednesday, the Associated Press\u00a0reported that mobs with iron rods and sticks ransacked a supermarket belonging to a major Shia-owned business group. The agency said the attack appeared linked to a series of reprisals and intimidation by suspected Sunni groups angered by the 14-month-old uprising. Fears for the health of Khawaja, a Bahrain-Danish human rights activist and co-founder of the Bahrain Human Rights Centre who was imprisoned a year ago, grew after his family and lawyer said they had been denied contact for three days earlier this week. Amnesty International has called for his release, and UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, has urged Bahrain to re-consider its refusal to allow Denmark to take custody of him. His daughter said she &quot;got a very short call&quot; from her father on Wednesday, after he agreed to &quot;drink some water&quot; if they allowed him to &quot;let us know he was still alive&quot;. &quot;He sounded very weak. We are happy we heard his voice, but we don&apos;t know where it is going to go from here.

In what will amount to a charm offensive, the commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone will speak to the team officials on the eve of the Chinese Grand Prix and attempt to reassure them, as well as reminding them of their contractual commitments. A centrepiece of Todt&apos;s evidence is a letter he received on Wednesdayfrom John Yates, the senior police adviser to Bahrain&apos;s ministry of interior, even though Yates warns that the current violence is placing &quot;innocent members of the public in significant danger&quot;. He goes on to describe recent reports of the situation in Bahrain as &quot;distorted&quot; and &quot;inaccurate&quot; before adding: &quot;From what I have seen and witnessed, the willingness to reform is real and is being led from the highest level of government. Numerous and significant, tangible changes have already been made, particularly in relation to human rights.&quot; Describing the current protests, Yates added: &quot;These are not lawful protests, which are permitted, but violent conduct by a very small minority \u2013 often groups of 15-20 young men. These are criminal acts being perpetrated against an unarmed police force who, in the face of such attacks, are acting with remarkable restraint. These people are intent on causing harm to the police and the communities in which they live.&quot; However, in another passage of the letter, which may be seized upon by those who say the race should not take place, Yates said: &quot;This is not to dismiss the fact that some troubles do still exist. The almost nightly skirmishes that take place in certain villages are a potential block on progress and are putting those involved in their policing and innocent members of the public in significant danger.&quot; One protest this week was followed by a bomb attack that wounded seven policemen. Earlier this week Ecclestone, tongue firmly in cheek, told the teams that he could not force them to go to Bahrain, and that the decision was up to them. But on Tuesday the teams replied through the Formula One Teams Association that the onus was on the FIA to make the Bahrain call. That is what, finally, the FIA is now doing, as teams struggle to juggle with next week&apos;s travel arrangements as well as preparing for this Sunday&apos;s Chinese Grand Prix in almost surreal circumstances. Todt will also reassure the teams that the jailed Bahraini-Danish activist, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who has been on hunger strike for two months and whose condition has been reported as increasingly frail, is being &quot;fed lightly&quot;. The FIA confirmedon Wednesday that &quot;not one team&quot; has made an official approach asking for the race to be called off, or at least postponed. However, it is believed that most team principals do not want to go to Bahrain next week. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian this week, a team chief who asked not to be named but claimed his views were representative of most of the teams, said: &quot;I feel very uncomfortable about going to Bahrain. &quot;If I&apos;m frank, the only way they can pull this race off without incident is to have a complete military lock-down there. And I think that would be unacceptable, both for F1 and for Bahrain.

We coast along a three-lane highway, scanning a distant mix of farms and low-rise offices. Suddenly breaking out of the vast horizontal is a huge advertising hoarding oriented towards the international traffic streaming past. Its high-resolution image shows a bare landscape that rhymes with its real setting, save the rugged mountains in its background. Thundering into the picture, bearing down on the viewer at many times life size, is a woman on horseback. She is naked except for a\u00a0pair of expensive-looking handbags slung over her shoulder. It&apos;s the first of many experiences over the coming days, that seem reminiscent of Star Trek, as UK journalists are introduced to Chinese writers, publishers and academics ahead of the London book fair, of which China is the focus. Because while much of the Chinese city and literary life I see is a\u00a0part of the globalised 21st-century world, too familiar to fully notice, there is also an unmistakable sense that I\u00a0have landed on another planet. I&apos;m not exactly going where no reader has gone before, but as a relative newcomer to Chinese writing, I am indeed about to discover a strange new world. As China busies itself buying up Africa, cornering world markets in consumer products and vital mineral resources, and propping up the US dollar, it strikes an odd note when senior government minister Wu Shulin tells our party repeatedly that we must make allowances for China being &quot;a\u00a0developing country&quot;. And it&apos;s true of course that in China&apos;s interior there remains a peasant class barely scraping a subsistence. But down the road in Shanghai there is a four-storey Comme des Gar\u00e7ons superstore, and I see one woman struggling so hard to spend all her money that she is walking a brace of poodles in matching red jumpers and Burberry miniskirts. The books world, too, is a discombobulating mix of the familiar and the odd. The internet is a common spectre at all our meetings \u2013 it has meant the closure, as in the west, of independent bookshops, and has eaten into profits from sales and copyright, but also provides a fillip to the trade, and an initial platform for new writers. The web was little monitored until the mid-noughties, and writers could express themselves without the bowdlerisation that would likely have killed their chance of being conventionally published. Even now, it offers a way to publish opinions that can reach millions before the authorities have a chance to silence them. And while print runs for many books are suffering the kind of decline that western writers lament \u2013 a literary success might sell 40,000 copies, not great for a market comprising 20% of humanity \u2013 some of the internet&apos;s writers have secured enormous audiences on paper. They include Han Han, whose first novel, Triple Door, first published in 2000, is an impassioned satire on education, and has sold 2m copies, helped by his early embrace of blogging as a forum for unbuttoned criticism of political corruption, labour exploitation and other such &quot;sensitive&quot; areas. These days, the party is paying close attention to what gets written on the internet. Consider the obvious case of Liu Xiaobo, the poet and essayist awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2010, and currently serving an 11-year prison sentence for &quot;subverting state power&quot; while his wife remains under house arrest. The government now has software apparatus that will zap any mention of him anywhere in Chinese cyberspace, emails included. However, this did not stop Han Han adding a\u00a0piece of theatrically blank irony to his blog in response to the Nobel award \u2013 a pair of opening and closing quotation marks. (If Xiaobo is an important dissident, Han Han&apos;s caustic commentaries \u2013 which are read by a giddying third of all Chinese web users \u2013 leave him free to pursue parallel careers as a racing driver and singer without undue interruption from the authorities.) Having been warned that to address the Liu Xiaobo question with a writer would be tantamount to shutting down the interview, I decide to raise it at a\u00a0meeting with Wu Shulin, who is eager to emphasise books as &quot;a bridge&quot; for the kind of &quot;foreign exchange&quot; that China seeks. When I suggest that this will carry less credibility with western readers while Liu Xiaobo remains behind bars, the minister becomes audibly fiercer, though the words have a studied moderation: &quot;I told the Norwegian culture minister that in China we have a lot of good writers who have produced a lot of excellent works, and if you award [the Nobel] to Liu Xiaobo you are sending a strong signal that this is a political award and the Chinese people will not recognise it \u2026 China will follow our own path.&quot; He adds: &quot;On the one hand we should protect the people&apos;s rights to express their views; on the other, we have to ensure social stability in our laws.&quot; Yet if anyone from the west is inclined to doubt China&apos;s new commitment to literary culture, the figures for its Rural Reading Room programme give one serious pause: China has 630,000 villages, and this 18.5bn yuan (\u00a31.84bn) programme aims to provide every one of them with a Reading Room. The smaller ones, says Wu Shulin, have only 1,500 books and 100 periodicals; larger, more prosperous places have 50,000 books. In the past 10 years, 500,000 of these small public libraries have been completed, &quot;to ensure&quot;, the minister says, &quot;the citizens&apos; rights to know and to read&quot;. What&apos;s most startling when I talk to writers on my trip is how familiar our conversations seem, at least at first: I hear a lot about the importance of following one&apos;s imagination, the usefulness of grants and creative writing tuition, the prominence of Ian McEwan and Paulo Coelho, sequels to classic Chinese novels and the artistic cheapness of popular &quot;office&quot; and &quot;grave raider&quot; novels. My initial expectation was that Chinese writers would either look hunted, or they would be transparent government stooges: the situation is naturally more complicated. What&apos;s more, it becomes all too clear that there are, not surprisingly, an awful lot of very good Chinese writers that are so far known only to the vanishingly small English-language readership here. A Yi, for instance, is barely known even in China, but his quality as a\u00a0morally unsparing writer \u2013 a\u00a0kind of Chinese cousin to Camus, unafraid to depict corruption and toxic working lives \u2013 has interested the best translators of Chinese fiction such as Julia Lovell, who translated his stark fable of farming villagers dwarfed by huge forces of globalisation, The Curse. Many of A Yi&apos;s novels are modelled on his experiences as a younger man, when he was a policeman, and share some of the concern with precision and impersonality of a judicious crime report. Cat and Mouse, for example, is based on a true story about a young man who committed a\u00a0murder with the intention of attracting the glamorising attention of the media. A Yi says he was unhappy that the confused reasoning behind the crime was too clearly expressed in\u00a0the book; he plans to revise it, long after its publication and reviews, and make it truer. Bi Feiyu, who cuts a much smoother profile than A Yi&apos;s introspective hunch, is one of the few Chinese writers adventurous English readers may already know. His novel Three Sisters, an epic portrayal of one family&apos;s journey through the flattened public life of the Cultural Revolution, won the 2010 Man Asian literary prize. He talks wearily of being described as a great writer about women: &quot;I hate it, but I have to pretend to like it,&quot; he says, partly because \u2013 something most Booker authors don&apos;t need to worry about \u2013 his stories are popular with women&apos;s magazines. &quot;I&apos;m not the best Chinese writer about women. Actually, the gender balance in my stories is about 50/50 \u2026 I hate the label, but I&apos;ve been wearing this hat for 10 years now. &quot;Portraying characters,&quot; he says, &quot;is the most fundamental task of the writer.&quot; And the careful, nuanced realism of his storytelling does not seem at all alien to an English reader, though he stresses that this kind of realism is not mainstream in China. Both A Yi and Bi Feiyu talk about how their earlier work included more modernist formal experiments, though, as A Yi explains it, they eventually decided that &quot;the water was more important than the cup&quot;. Han Dong, a noteworthy poet, is also a sly and beguiling novelist who tells somewhat fabulist, Murakami-esque tales of life under the Cultural Revolution. The events of the 1960s and 1970s are something he says the government is happy to see criticised by writers these days, partly to avoid making such writers martyrs, and partly because the marginal status of most serious novelists means the authorities don&apos;t need to worry too much about what they say. Han Dong&apos;s work draws on his own \u2013 unusually happy \u2013 experience of being banished with his family to the countryside during a period when any schooling was an empty formality and he could concentrate on having fun. It is in stark contrast to the earlier generation of &quot;invisible writers&quot;, whose work had to remain secret during the Cultural Revolution but is now being published, often posthumously. His novel Screwed! looks at the ramifications of a joke between two teenage boys also assigned to the farming interior. When they say they&apos;ll take out their sexual frustrations on an ox, it is taken seriously by local police. The cow&apos;s supposedly violated rights become a focus of outrage, while the boys are tethered in a cowshed. Sheng Keyi, meanwhile, turns a\u00a0mercilessly ironic eye on modern Chinese life, particularly the difficulties faced by women in a\u00a0hypersexualised culture and the insecure economic life of migrant workers. She seems a poised, self-contained individual, but tells us that while she is writing she frightens her friends by becoming a raging monster. Her 2004 novel Northern Girls, whose central character, Qian Xiao Hong, finds her tough destiny driven by the accident of having unusually large breasts, is set to be published by Penguin Australia in May. There are numberless more, equally impressive writers at work in China today; I trust publishers at the London book fair will boldly go and discover, as enthusiastically as I did, this complex and rich new literary world. \u2022 Many of the authors will be appearing at the London book fair&apos;s Market Focus Cultural Programme, partnered by the British Council, 16-18 April.", "tags": ["Chinese literature", "Books", "Culture", "Festivals", "China", "Fiction", "Poetry"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-12T12:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/12/china-internet-users-foreign-websites", "sentences": ["The &quot;great firewall&quot; already blocks many sites hosted from other countries, but users in Beijing, Shanghai and other parts of China reported that they could not reach any foreign sites whatsoever on Thursday morning \u2013 although it was not clear whether the problems were universal."], "title": "China's internet users temporarily blocked from foreign websites", "article": "China&apos;s internet users have been cut off from accessing all foreign websites for around an hour in an unexplained incident that sparked speculation the country&apos;s censorship system was being tested or further tightened.

As drivers began filtering into the paddock on Thursday morning, talk focused not on what might happen this Sunday but on the potential repercussions of holding a race in Bahrain seven days later. Only one of those drivers was willing to grapple with the subject of whether the race should take place in a kingdom riven by civil unrest. When the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was cancelled and then temporarily reinstated before finally being dropped, Mark Webber stood as a lone voice of reason among the drivers. &quot;F1 should have taken a much firmer stance earlier this year, rather than constantly delaying its decision in hope of being able to reschedule the race,&quot; he said. &quot;It would have sent a very clear message about its position on something as fundamental as human rights.&quot; The Red Bull driver was lucid on the issue again on Thursday, if a touch less forthright. &quot;I&apos;ve tried to watch the news to get a balanced view of the Bahrain situation,&quot; he said, &quot;but I know only as much as anyone else, really. I want to race but you can&apos;t ignore what&apos;s going on and we all hope things go smoothly. &quot;It&apos;s a difficult decision, because it&apos;s only a week away, but ultimately it&apos;s only a car race. A hell of a lot of people in the world have no idea that Bahrain is scheduled to host a grand prix, so we don&apos;t want to overstate its importance. Things can be cancelled in a flash, but what&apos;s changed since January to make that decision any easier? There will be added security, but not everybody can have that and it doesn&apos;t make me feel comfortable.&quot; It is no secret that Formula One attracts financial support from the Middle East \u2013 Mumtalakat, Bahrain&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, holds a significant stake in McLaren \u2013 and beyond Webber even the most articulate drivers seem obliged to temper their thoughts with commercial discretion. &quot;I don&apos;t have an opinion,&quot; said Jenson Button, who won this season&apos;s opening race for McLaren. &quot;I can&apos;t have one and you know that. I am not speaking as a person, am I? I am sitting here as a McLaren racing driver and trust Bernie [Ecclestone] and [governing body] the FIA will make the right call, whatever that is. &quot;The problem is, and I am sure everyone will say the same thing, if one team goes, every other team has to follow because there are 25 points available. That&apos;s the reality, isn&apos;t it? You can&apos;t give away one twentieth of the season. We are a circus. We go around together and do everything together. That is the way it should be, whether we race or not.&quot; Despite months of doubt about the wisdom of staging a race in Bahrain, the sport&apos;s ringmaster, Ecclestone, has continued to insist the race will go ahead. &quot;It is on the calendar,&quot; he said again on Thursday. &quot;Unless it gets withdrawn by the country&apos;s national sporting authority, we will be there. I don&apos;t see any difference between China and Bahrain. They&apos;re the same. It&apos;s another race on the calendar. When we enter a country in the normal way, we don&apos;t deal with religion or politics. We will go there. If it was a pop singer, they would be there and they would sing.&quot; Ecclestone is due to meet team principals on Friday and acknowledged that Bahrain would be discussed, but insisted it would not be top of the agenda. Jean Todt, the president of motorsport&apos;s governing body the FIA, is also expected in Shanghai, albeit not until Saturday. Trouble was also brewing off the track this weekend. However, the four-man panel of FIA stewards has dismissed Lotus&apos; protest against the eligibility of their rival Mercedes&apos;s rear wing, which they alleged breached Article 3.18 of Formula One&apos;s sporting regulations: &quot;any car system, device or procedure that uses driver movement as a means of altering a car&apos;s aerodynamic characteristics is prohibited&quot;. When the Mercedes drivers activate their drag reduction system, which legitimately trims the rear wing to boost straight-line speed, Lotus believed the team&apos;s front wing also benefited and that this contravened the regulations.

Schumacher and his team-mate, Nico Rosberg, have been cleared to continue using a controversial rear wing, which some rivals felt infringed the regulations, after a formal protest from the Lotus team was rejected by FIA stewards on Thursday evening. Last year&apos;s winner, Lewis Hamilton, was second fastest for McLaren, only 0.177 slower than Schumacher. The Englishman has taken pole position for the opening two races of the campaign, but if he is fastest again in qualifying he will line up only sixth, having been handed a five-position grid penalty in the wake of an unscheduled gearbox swap. The Red Bulls of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber were third and fourth respectively, ahead of Rosberg and Jenson Button in the second McLaren. If the race proceeds without climatic interruption of the kind that turned the Malaysian Grand Prix on its head three weeks ago, Red Bull and McLaren are expected to resume their duel at the head of the field. So far this season the Mercedes drivers have been fleet of foot over a single lap, but have struggled to maintain that pace in race time because their car has a greater appetite for tyres than most. Kamui Kobayashi was seventh for Sauber, just ahead of Paul di Resta. The Scot did not run during the morning after handing his car to the Force India reserve, Jules Bianchi, the highly rated Frenchman who forms part of Ferrari&apos;s young driver development programme.

Not content with selling houses and everything that goes in them, the Swedish homeware behemoth is now building a whole new neighbourhood in London. Ikea subsidiary LandProp recently submitted plans to redevelop 26 hectares of Stratford, close to the 2012 Olympic site (or Westfield Stratford City, depending on your outlook). It won&apos;t look like a scaled-up Billy bookcase, we&apos;re assured. Instead, Strand East, as it&apos;ll be known, will be a place &quot;where mews-style townhouses sit comfortably alongside creative commercial space. Where beautiful public courtyards open up to piazzas.

The 1,200 homes will not be built according to Ikea&apos;s BokLok concept \u2013 as seen in Gateshead. Nor will it only be possible to find your way around the development by following a continuous line on the floor until you arrive at your destination. If you want proper retailer-led post-Olympic redevelopment, though, you&apos;re better off heading to nearby Bromley-by-Bow, where Tesco is attempting to build its own neighbourhood, including 450 homes, a school, library and other amenities, all centred on its superstore, of course. Why not throw in a self-checkout hospital while they&apos;re at it? The scheme, inevitably dubbed &quot;Tesco Town&quot;, is one of four the supermarket is trying to get off the ground in Britain, but was heavily criticised by Cabe at its last attempt. Or for a snazzier east London address (or at least name), why not try the International Quarter, Stratford City, a huge, \u00a31.3bn scheme due to rise next door to the Olympic Park and the Athletes&apos; Village.

Interesting new building of the week must be Fielden Clegg Bradley&apos;s new Hive, in Worcester. It&apos;s a library, in case that wasn&apos;t obvious from either the name, the jaunty roofline, or the ostentatious gold cladding. Gold seems to be the current thing for jazzing up historic towns, after Hugh Broughton&apos;s Maidstone Museum a couple of weeks ago, and Vinoly&apos;s Firstsite in Colchester. The building at least calms down inside, where it&apos;s a serene series of spaces in pale concrete and ash, lit by generous skylights (hence the jaunty roofline). It&apos;s also a local history centre, a university library and &quot;one-stop shop&quot; for the local authority \u2013 a new building type that could point the way to salvation for Britain&apos;s endangered public libraries.     Ushida Findlay and Visitor Studio's window for Banana Republic Regent Street 'captures a frozen moment in time'     Back to London, and Regent Street has invited nine up-and-coming architects to do up its shop windows for the third year running. The idea smacks of uncomfortable commercialism on the one hand, but then again, perhaps it&apos;s an apt recession strategy for putting out your architectural wares.

After the sport&apos;s governing body confirmed on Friday that the race would go ahead, despite safety fears in the country, the attention turned to how teams would protect themselves against protesters or any possible attacks. John Booth, the Marussia team principal, said: &quot;For Bahrain we&apos;ve told staff to stick together and not to travel to the circuit in team kit. Usually, that&apos;s a precaution we&apos;d implement only in Brazil, but in the circumstances it seems sensible in Bahrain, too. &quot;The drivers will be taken to and from the track by a chauffeur fully trained in the art of defensive driving, somebody who recognises potentially awkward situations and knows how to avoid them. &quot;We&apos;ll take care to make sure all our systems are in place and that everybody remains vigilant.

Meanwhile in the villages police have combatted petrol bombs with water cannons, tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets. Some teams have talked about escaping trouble by basing themselves as far away as possible. Booth added: &quot;There are lots of safe havens within about 40 minutes by air, so I&apos;m confident we&apos;d have no problem getting everybody out, should that be necessary.&quot; Others already had different security measures in place for Bahrain. Paul Hembery, Pirelli&apos;s motorsport director, said: &quot;We&apos;ve not taken any extra measures, simply because it is company policy to have a set of security measures in place for every race, based on different countries&apos; status. That applies to Silverstone or Melbourne just as much as it does to Bahrain. The FIA has access to far more information about the Bahraini situation than we do and we&apos;re happy to follow their guidance.&quot; The owners of the Bahrain International Circuit described the security situation as &quot;suitable&quot; for racing, while the FIA insisted that &quot;all the proper security measures&quot; were in place to ensure the drivers and teams safety. &quot;This assessment has been provided by experienced figures, from both inside and outside the Bahraini government, to motor racing entities which have travelled to Bahrain to do their own research,&quot; the BIC claimed in a statement. &quot;The certainty of those assessments have meant the BIC has been able to prepare as usual for the staging of the F1 grand prix and is therefore wholly confident the event will be organised with the efficiency that has been the hallmark of the BIC in the past.&quot; But there were plenty of long faces in Shanghai, ahead of this weekend&apos;s Chinese Grand Prix, when it was confirmed by the FIA that the race would go ahead. Most teams are unhappy with the decision, or at\u00a0least have serious misgivings. Others are just relieved that the uncertainty is\u00a0over. Christian Horner, Red Bull&apos;s team principal, said: &quot;Based on the current information the FIA has at this stage, it is satisfied that all the proper security measures are in place for the running of a Formula One World Championship event in Bahrain. &quot;We&apos;ve had the statement, it&apos;s very clear. The confusing thing has been the uncertainty.&quot; But when asked whether he was happy or not with the decision he did not give a reply. He added: &quot;We&apos;ll do our best to ensure that all our guys and girls are in a secure environment, but I don&apos;t doubt that for a moment.&quot; But the 1996 world champion, Damon Hill, has given his full support to the decision to go to Bahrain. Although last week Hill told The Guardian that there should be a rethink over the race, today he said: &quot;I am now 100% behind the FIA decision to race in Bahrain. &quot;All the arguments have been made for and against. Human rights organisations have had their cases heard. No one is under any illusions about the situation. &quot;But the less vocal majority of Bahrainis also have a right to get on with their lives and we also have a responsibility to our F1 fans in the region.

The FIA, the sport&apos;s governing authority, confirmed that it would go ahead, with beefed-up security, after receiving reassurances. John Yates, the former assistant commissioner of the Met who is in Bahrain advising on police reform, wrote to the FIA president, Jean Todt, to say he felt safer living in Bahrain &quot;than I have often felt in London&quot;. Bernie Ecclestone, 81, the F1 supremo, speaking at the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, said of Bahrain: &quot;I know people who live there, and it&apos;s all very quiet and peaceful.&quot; The comments provoked a storm on social media sites as local activists said there were fears of a clampdown on protesters to prevent disruption to the event. Pictures emerged of Ecclestone&apos;s image being burned in Bahrain posted on a Facebook page called &quot;Pearl Family Circle \u2013 Martyrs&apos; Square&quot;. Protests by members of the majority Shia against the Sunni government of the Al-Khalifa royal family take place on an almost daily basis, mostly confined to villages away from the capital where groups have clashed with police using water cannon, teargas, stun grenades and plastic bullets. Activists say there have been more than 70 deaths, 20 from teargas suffocation, since February 2011, when the Bahrain uprising began, with an estimated 600 &quot;political prisoners&quot; currently detained. Civil unrest has escalated in recent weeks, in part due to concerns for the health of imprisoned activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, now 65 days into a hunger strike, being held in a military hospital. On Monday, seven policemen were wounded by a homemade bomb outside the capital in what the interior ministry called an &quot;act of terrorism&quot;, and an explosion in Manama on Thursday night damaged two cars. The funeral of Ahmed Ismaeel, 22, described as a citizen journalist by activists, who was shot by a drive-by gunman, was reportedly attended by thousands. A planned protest outside the British embassy today by a group calling itself the February 14 Youth Coalition, named after the date of the beginning of the uprising, may also raise tensions. A BCHR report said an average of 15 villages were teargassed as collective punishment every night as the Shia majority continue to oppose the Sunni monarchy and call for the implementation of reforms &quot;We are very concerned for our safety. The FIA have got security companies and bullet-proof cars for their drivers and F1 teams,&quot; said Dr Ala&apos;a Shehabi, a British-born Bahraini academic and activist. &quot;Who&apos;s going to be protecting the Bahrainis who are going to be locked up in their villages, and prevented from protesting, given that they are going to be extremely angry and provoked by the F1? &quot;There&apos;s going to be popping champagne corks, live concerts and parties, in the middle of the island, which is a huge provocation to the families of victims who have been killed, and those of hundreds of political prisoners.&quot; She said the comments by Yates had made people very angry. &quot;To say everything is fine and dandy. Of course it is. The guy&apos;s living in his compound, earning a salary that&apos;s more than he ever used to dream of in the UK, loving the weather and thinking: &apos;This is great, why are people even on the streets protesting?&quot; &quot;And I&apos;m even more surprised at Ecclestone&apos;s remark.

They are protesting against the F1, and the government wants to hide that from the media,&quot; said Rajab. &quot;That&apos;s the reality of Bahrain now.&quot; The Guardian was unable to verify Rajab&apos;s claims. There have been reprisals by groups loyal to the ruling royal family. A video posted on YouTube purports to show Bahraini police officers doing nothing as a Shia-owned supermarket was looted earlier this week, and was condemned by the human rights group Bahrainwatch as demonstrating &quot;the continuing culture of impunity among the country&apos;s security forces, despite claims of reform by the government&quot;.

Although Mercedes was the team to beat today, its one-lap pace has been a feature of the season to date. So far, though, its drivers have struggled to make their tyres last in a race. Usual suspects McLaren and Red Bull have a bit of work to do to haul themselves on to the Mercedes&apos; tails, however. Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi underlined that Sauber&apos;s second place last time out was no flash in the pan, with a strong run to fourth, while recent returnee Kimi Raikkonen (Lotus) joins him on the second row, ahead of Jenson Button (McLaren) and Mark Webber (Red Bull). &quot;It&apos;s a great feeling to be on pole,&quot; said Rosberg, who did only one lap in the final phase of qualifying before climbing out to watch rivals try - and fail - to beat his time.

The jewel in its crown is the race in Monaco, where yachts the size of houses shimmer beside a plutocrats&apos; playground. The exotica of its locations is one of the sports defining characteristics. If, indeed, we are talking about a sport at all. For many, it is little more than a trade fair, with its best drivers, Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, nothing more than car salesmen, albeit the best paid in the business. That argument is confounded by the emergence of the truly great driver, such as Jim Clark and Ayrton Senna, men whose courage, gifts and intelligence deserve to be placed alongside the finest of all sportsmen. But this weekend, as F1 adopts a brace position prior to its departure for the troubled land of Bahrain, profound questions are being asked about the essence of the sport, as well as the quality of those men who decide its destiny. The decision to run next Sunday&apos;s race has everything to do with business and nothing to do with the celebration of sport, which should not take place in the uneasy environment that still exists in the Gulf kingdom. It will be an interesting week for Bernie Ecclestone, the sport&apos;s supremo who, speaking in Shanghai the other day, described the situation in Bahrain as &quot;very quiet and peaceful&quot;. Maybe it&apos;s not the money at all, but the sport&apos;s cacophony that deafens the ears of its participants to the realities of the world. As Ecclestone spoke there were still reports of police using teargas, water cannons, stun grenades and plastic bullets against the pro\u2011democracy demonstrators in their regular protests against the Sunni\u00a0government. This is an even more pivotal time for Jean Todt, the president of the FIA whose call this essentially was. Just hours after Todt&apos;s decision that the race should go ahead was announced there were fresh reports of violence following the funeral of the activist Ahmed Ismail, who was shot dead last month. According to Nabeel Rajab, from the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights: &quot;We might see people killed in the coming days because of the F1.&quot; Todt, 66, was sporting director at Ferrari when Michael Schumacher won five world championships on the spin. When Todt departed the famous black horse stopped prancing, but success has been more elusive for him since he succeeded the more extrovert Max Mosley at the FIA. If the Frenchman has got this wrong his position will no longer be tenable. And, remember, Todt and the FIA used the flimsiest of evidence before giving the go-ahead to last year&apos;s race, which was ultimately cancelled by the Bahrain government itself on safety rather than moral grounds, of course. In the past year there appears to have been genuine advances made in that country. But Bahrain remains, essentially, work in progress. It is not yet ready to stage a grand prix, for all the money it pours into F1. Every sport has its history, its nostalgia. But Formula One is the only one whose past comes wrapped in wreaths, with every race a memorial service for the gone ones, not just the dead days but the dead people. Death on the track, commonplace just three and four decades ago, has been eradicated, with Senna&apos;s death the last, in 1994. The FIA has played its part in the extreme vigilance which now oversees the racing. Whether that body&apos;s advice on safety measures away from the track is equally reliable remains to be seen.

Having lapped the Shanghai International Circuit more than half a second quicker than his rivals, Nico Rosberg climbed from his Mercedes and stood in one of the pit garages, watching the final minutes of Formula One qualifying unfold. The rationale, though, was tactical. &quot;It felt quite difficult,&quot; the German said, &quot;because I wanted to be out there, driving, but the team and I took a decision not to use another set of fresh tyres. Even if I hadn&apos;t been fastest, I&apos;d have done the\u00a0same thing. It seemed like a better strategy for the race.&quot; As it transpired, nobody else got close. He remained 0.5sec clear of his adversaries on a day when a similar margin covered second to sixth places. Not only\u00a0was it the maiden pole position of Rosberg&apos;s F1 career, it was also the first for a Mercedes chassis since Italy 1955, when\u00a0Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss annexed the front row of the grid. Rosberg will be joined by his team-mate, too, with Michael Schumacher promoted to second at the expense of Lewis Hamilton, who has been docked five positions\u00a0in the wake of an unscheduled gearbox change. Mercedes have scored only one championship point this season \u2013 courtesy of Schumacher in Malaysia \u2013 but their qualifying performances have been strong, and this was the best yet. Previously, the team&apos;s performances have faded on Sundays, along with its cars&apos; rear tyres, but the team principal, Ross Brawn, did not rule out a possible victory \u2013 particularly with pre-race favourites McLaren and Red Bull having their\u00a0best-placed cars, those of Jenson Button and Mark Webber, on row three, behind Kamui Kobayashi (Sauber) and Kimi Raikkonen (Lotus). Hamilton was seventh and the world champion Sebastian Vettel way back in 11th on the grid, the first time since Brazil 2009 that he has failed to crack the top 10. &quot;One of the interesting things,&quot; said Brawn, &quot;is the narrow window the current Pirelli tyres have in terms of their optimum working range. If we hit that sweet spot then we could have a good race, but things can be quite difficult if you don&apos;t get it right \u2013 as we saw with Sebastian. We&apos;ve made a fair commitment this weekend to getting the car in the best shape we can for the race, so qualifying was a secondary consideration. If we carry on what we saw with our high fuel running in practice, we can be confident of having a better race this weekend. &quot;We&apos;re not overlooking the cars right behind, though. Sauber and Lotus look like they are doing well and we can&apos;t underestimate the competition they will\u00a0provide.&quot; Pole represents a fillip for Rosberg, who has long been tipped as a future star without ever quite proving it. He made his F1 debut in 2006, with Williams, when he showed flashes of promise, although he was usually second-best to the established Webber. It was not until Schumacher returned to the sport in 2010, though, that he came up against another team-mate of proven calibre. It has taken time, too, for Schumacher to get even remotely close to the form that earned him seven world titles between 1994 and 2006. By the middle of last season, however, the older German was starting to gain the upper hand in races \u2013 and this year he has previously been quicker in qualifying, too. Brawn, though, was full of praise for Rosberg&apos;s response to disappointing weekends in Australia and Malaysia. &quot;It was a great lap,&quot; he said, &quot;and his middle sector was pretty impressive, because that&apos;s not necessarily where the car has been at its best. If I&apos;m honest it&apos;s the Nico we got used to last year \u2013 he was always able to pull something out in qualifying, but this season we&apos;ve not previously given him the car to do that. Today we did and he demonstrated what he can do.&quot; He hinted, too, that Schumacher \u2013 now in the final year of his three-season comeback contract \u2013 could easily drive himself into a new deal. &quot;Everything is open,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s too early to speculate, but if it feels right for him and feels right for us, why would we want to stop?&quot; Chinese Grand Prix (Shanghai) Leading grid: 1 N Rosberg (Ger) Mercedes 1min 35.121sec; 2 M Schumacher (Ger) Mercedes 1:35.691; 3 K Kobayashi (Jpn) Sauber 1:35.784; 4 K Raikkonen (Fin) Lotus 1:35.898; 5 J Button (GB) McLaren 1:36.191; 6 M Webber (Aus) Red Bull 1:36.290; 7 L Hamilton* (GB) McLaren 1:35.6268; 8 S Perez (Mex) Sauber 1:36.524; 9 F Alonso (Sp) Ferrari 1:36.622; 10 R Grosjean (Swi) Lotus 1:35.903, 11 S Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 1:36.031; 12 F Massa (Bra) Ferrari 1:36.255 *Incurred a five-place grid penalty due to replacement gearbox.", "tags": ["Nico Rosberg", "Formula One 2012", "Mercedes GP", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-14T16:24:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/apr/15/chinese-grand-prix-thrilling-f1", "sentences": ["But he looked a contented man in Shanghai, which is not something that could have been said last year.", "With the strategy we managed to kind of come back.&quot; It was a nightmare for the strategists on the pit-wall in Shanghai."], "title": "Brilliant Chinese Grand Prix promises a thrilling F1 season | Paul Weaver", "article": "For a couple of hours or so we were given respite from the topic which presides menacingly over Formula One like a thunder cloud, which is Bahrain and the abject folly of the decision to race there next Sunday. In this period of remission we were reminded of the fact that Nico Rosberg is a driver capable of sustaining a combination of speed and precision over\u00a056\u00a0laps. And, even more importantly, we were nudged further towards the happy suspicion that this could be one of the vintage seasons in F1, with the world championship unlikely to be dominated by any one driver, as was the case with Sebastian Vettel last year. The three races so far have been won by three different drivers and three different teams. McLaren may lead both world championships but they are not permitted to swagger just yet, certainly\u00a0not before Barcelona next month when all cars will be upgraded in varying degrees. Mercedes have looked good in qualifying in all the events, only to fluff their lines on Sunday afternoon. But here they established themselves as serious players. And it was not all because of that refined F-duct. Rosberg \u2013 who had already proved himself to be quicker than his team-mate Michael Schumacher over a single lap \u2013 is fast, and so is his car, without any controversial additives. Mercedes spent the winter recruiting\u00a0extravagantly. We already knew that Ross Brawn was one of the great team leaders. But now, just behind him, he has Bob Bell, Geoff Willis and Aldo Costa. The only concern was that too many chefs might spoil the banquet. But that does not appear to be the case and the new WO3 model will not be content to be a distant fourth, which was the case with the team last year. After two disappointing seasons the Silver Arrow is back. But what has most impressed in this still embryonic season\u00a0is the midfield, which looks as good as Barcelona&apos;s. Lotus, Sauber, and Williams have all caught the eye and on Sunday the Williams pair of Bruno Senna and Pastor Maldonado both finished in the top eight. The competition between Paul\u00a0Di\u00a0Resta and Nico H\u00fclkenberg at Force India could also be a minor classic in the months ahead. Apart from the winner, the two drivers most enjoyable to watch were Lewis Hamilton and Vettel. I have never seen Hamilton so happy to finish third, for he is dedicated to winning. It might have something to do with\u00a0the fact that he leads the championship. And he has a good car. But he looked a contented man in Shanghai, which is not something that could have been said last year. He even managed to pass Felipe Massa without clattering into him. While Rosberg continued on his serene course to the chequered flag Hamilton appeared to relish in the cut and thrust of the fight behind the leader.\u00a0&quot;There was a serious train of cars out there,&quot; he said afterwards, grinning, with pure enthusiasm. Hamilton, remember, was awarded a\u00a0five-place grid penalty before the race.\u00a0It wasn&apos;t his fault \u2013 it was because he needed a new gearbox \u2013 but it still would have been enough to make him sulk last year. I enjoyed watching Vettel even more than his compatriot, Rosberg. Because this was a Vettel we have not seen much of before, harrying and hustling, fighting off Hamilton for a while and then, after being overtaken, trying to get\u00a0his position back, even though he knew his car lacked power in a straight line and that his tyres were spent. This was a double world champion showing his pedigree. &quot;We were generally too slow on the straights,&quot; he said. &quot;We were losing a lot of time there. That made it extremely difficult to pass, to be honest.&quot; Vettel started in 11th position and quickly went backwards. He admitted: &quot;I think I missed out a little bit on the start. I was a bit too late. I wasn&apos;t entirely happy finding the revs and I was\u00a0a bit confused. Usually I&apos;m pretty quick when the lights go off, but today I think I was one of the last ones. I didn&apos;t wake up enough. &quot;Then I was behind the Williams and at Turn 1 they crashed into each other a little bit and I had to hit the brakes and I didn&apos;t know what was going to happen. Then I lost another couple of positions \u2013 I nearly lost a position to Heikki Kovalainen in the Caterham so I think it was a really bad stage on the first lap. With the strategy we managed to kind of come back.&quot; It was a nightmare for the strategists on the pit-wall in Shanghai.

Stuff that&apos;s not there: it&apos;s just so hot right now. First of all of course there was the spectacle of the &quot;ghost foul&quot; that caused tiny frail Victorian consumptive urchin Ashley Young to topple over in such alarming fashion inside the Aston Villa penalty area yesterday, a misfortune that was at least, in the scheme of cosmic justice, rewarded with a penalty kick. The Fiver must also object at this point as many have referred to Young&apos;s fall as a &quot;dive&quot;, and thereby an act of falsification. This seems not entirely accurate given that Young&apos;s fall was instead simply an annoyingly dramatic exaggeration, a piece of ham acting up there with being forced to watch Al Pacino trying to top up his Oyster card in the newsagent while prancing around using his shoutiest voice and doing loads of high-end shrugging and grimacing. Then, of course, there was the &quot;ghost goal&quot; credited to Chelsea in the semi-final of the FA Cup, although here again the Fiver must object as technically the description &quot;ghost goal&quot; would suggest a goal that you could almost see: a shimmery, ethereal goal dressed in Victorian costume standing at the end of your bed wreathed in hollow-eyed otherworldliness. But this was in fact more of a &quot;poltergeist goal&quot;: a goal nobody actually saw but which was suddenly there among us, making a lot of noise, causing plates to be hurled across kitchens, doors to slam and radio phone-in switchboards to become &quot;jammed&quot; with disembodied irate taxi North London driver voices. If you&apos;re thinking to yourself this seems like a piece of unnecessarily pedantic obfuscation, the Fiver would point out (a) that thinking to yourself is in fact a tautology and you really should come primed and ready and armed with a machine gun if you want to take the Fiver on when it comes to pernickety thought-waffle; and (b) that this is in fact the Fiver&apos;s specialist subject. Things that don&apos;t actually exist at all: this is an area the Fiver can speak on with some authority. Jokes that aren&apos;t really there. Or often jokes that are there but aren&apos;t really jokes. Vanished self-esteem. Deceased ambition. Careers in proper journalism that were supposed to be careers in proper journalism but have instead remained a business sneering accusation conducted from within the cobwebbed crawlspace in the eaves of New Guardian Towers. This is the Fiver&apos;s special world, a world of not-quite and almost, that seems, for once, to have coincided for a moment with the world of elite football. Welcome to our place. No, it&apos;s always like that. So it is that the Fiver was disturbed to learn this morning of Fifa&apos;s announcement that the final phase of goalline technology tests (tagline: stop this kind of thing now) will begin later this month. A final decision is due to be announced in July following an exhaustive final round of buffet lunches and mob-handed working cheese fondue breakfasts. &quot;The latest planning meeting for test phase two was held on Friday and the second phase of tests will commence before the end of April,&quot; Fifa said yesterday in a dalek-voiced statement that is basically just a lot of jargon and dates. Meanwhile even Sir &quot;Alex&quot; Ferguson has raised an empurpled brow at Young&apos;s latest tumble, descrying Saturday&apos;s antics - the least convincing accident at work since Man Falling Off A Stepladder in the ambulancechasers4u.com adverts - as &quot;a dramatic fall&quot;. Of Genesis-like proportions, the Fiver might add. And so for now football looks like retreating, until the next time, from the Fiver&apos;s own shadow-world of never-weres and would-have-beens. Come back soon. Don&apos;t be a stranger. It gets dark. It gets lonely. Shuttered up in among the old storage crates of jokes that don&apos;t zing, barbs that don&apos;t stick and humorous email tea-time story closing sentences that feel like they should conclude with a resounding and no doubt self-referencing one-line zinger but which instead just ramble on a bit verbosely with no apparent direction before, without any warning suddenly, ending.

Bidding had reached the tidy sum of $320,000 and Kevin Ching, the company&apos;s CEO, was on the phone to a client on the mainland. All of a sudden his client made a much higher bid. Ching checked there was no mistake then passed it on to the auctioneer. &quot;It&apos;s part of the process. The Chinese are growing up and getting rich,&quot; says this former corporate lawyer. He adds: &quot;We have exuberant customers. They can be very impatient. Even at an auction, they don&apos;t want to waste time.&quot; In this field, as in others, the Chinese are redrawing the maps. According to Artprice, a specialist in art market information, the volume of sales, just for fine art, at public auctions in mainland China has rocketed in barely 10 years to reach 41% of the global market in 2011: the biggest share in the world. When a sale of Chinese art is held in Hong Kong, London or Paris the room is full of Chinese buyers. They are taking a keen interest in watches, jewellery and wine, too. A revolution is in progress. &quot;It&apos;s the biggest thing in the art world in 20 years. We have moved from a standoff between the United States and Europe, to a three-cornered confrontation, making it a truly global market,&quot; says Guillaume Cerutti, head of Sotheby&apos;s France. In 2011, two Chinese artists topped the annual ranking of auction revenue established by Artprice, with about $530m for Zhang Daqian (1899-1983), a traditionalist painter and a very gifted forger who spent much of his life in exile, and $465m for Qi Baishi (1864-1957), who was favoured by the Communist leadership. Andy Warhol was relegated to third place. Turning to the 10 most expensive works by living artists in 2011, we find three Chinese alongside Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons. A recent work by traditionalist painter Cui Ruzhuo fetched $16m at Christie&apos;s Hong Kong. Hot on his heels come two contemporary art stars, Zhang Xiaogang and Zeng Fanzhi. The main reason the art market in China is booming is because there are more and more dollar millionaires \u2013 1.1 million in 2011, according to the Boston Consulting Group. But this poses a challenge for Christie&apos;s and Sotheby&apos;s, which have dominated the world market for years. It is a godsend too. The two auction houses are not allowed to organise sales in the People&apos;s Republic, but they have cornered the Hong Kong market, a key centre for Chinese art. Buyers from the mainland now account for 40% of sales by Sotheby&apos;s Asia, up from 4% barely five years ago. The two companies pride themselves on their expertise, which enables them to control &quot;all the top quality Chinese art&quot;, says Ching. Although they cannot sell in mainland China, the two companies can exhibit in leading hotels in Beijing and Shanghai, tempting buyers to attend auctions elsewhere. Sotheby&apos;s has just staged its first show in Chengdu and now produces its websites and print catalogues in Mandarin Chinese, as does Christie&apos;s. &quot;For the past two years we have had a Chinese concierge and staff who speak the language to take care of Chinese clients visiting London or New York,&quot; says Fran\u00e7ois Curiel, head of Christie&apos;s Hong Kong. The new interest in their art displayed by prosperous Chinese has introduced them to other fields. &quot;There is a huge reserve of collectors, and therefore buyers,&quot; Curiel adds. &quot;On their travels they learn about people like the Rothschilds or Rockefellers, and the museums and foundations they founded. They will follow suit, developing an eye for art, taking an interest in art nouveau, photography, furniture and ultimately contemporary European and US art.&quot; A few rich Chinese artists have been among the first to buy western art. One of them recently contacted French galleries with the idea of building up a collection to explain the development of western painting from the 19th century to cubism. In Hangzhou, south-west of Shanghai, the China Academy of Art is preparing to host a permanent collection of objects and drawings from Germany&apos;s Bauhaus, acquired in Germany last year for $72m. The market for Chinese art is so huge and diverse that in China it is attracting investors disappointed by other sectors such as the stock market or property investments. Seven of the world&apos;s largest auction houses are in China. Poly International, the largest rival to Sotheby&apos;s or Christie&apos;s, started trading in 2005. The oldest one, Guardian Auctions, based in Beijing, opened in 1993. A year later CEO Wang Yannan travelled to New York in search of foreign buyers, only to realise that its clients were closer to home. &quot;We still travel abroad, but to find works to take home,&quot; she says. Last autumn there was a dip in prices fetched at auction. &quot;It&apos;s a good sign,&quot; Wang says. &quot;Things were going too fast. For the past five years profits have doubled annually.&quot;  This article originally appeared in Le Monde", "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "China", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-17T13:03:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/17/iron-man-3-collaboration-china", "sentences": ["Disney rival DreamWorks Animation&apos;s Shanghai-based studio is due to release its first films in 2016.", "The studio behind the Shrek franchise struck a deal earlier this year with two Chinese media companies and the Shanghai municipal government to bring DreamWorks products to a Chinese audience."], "title": "Iron Man's next adventure to shoot in China", "article": "Iron Man is flying to China after Disney subsidiary Marvel announced that the metallic Avenger&apos;s next stand-alone adventure will be co-produced by Chinese company DMG Entertainment.

He only started track training at the start of February, which leaves him little time to get in shape for the US trials in June The next 100 days? Gay has announced that he will only run the 100m this year because he is worried his body won&apos;t be able to take the strain of doubling it up with the 200m.

Bronze Asafa Powell, Jamaica Form guide Powell ran his first indoor race in eight years at the Aviva Grand Prix in Birmingham in February, but he was underwhelming. His time of 6.5secs left him in third behind his two compatriots Nesta Carter and Lerone Clarke. Those two both got picked ahead of him for the World Indoor Championships The next 100 days? Powell&apos;s next race will be over 400m, as he tries to improve his strength conditioning.

No medal Dwain Chambers, Great Britain Form guide Chambers did not run anything quicker than 6.58secs over 60m in the winter, which is well short of his personal best of 6.41secs. But he still won a bronze at the World Indoors. What he has lost in speed he has gained in experience and understanding, though that wasn&apos;t enough to stop him being disqualified for a false start in the World Championships in Daegu last year The next 100 days? Chambers doesn&apos;t even know if he&apos;ll be eligible for the Olympics yet.

A surprise runner-up at the US trials last summer the former world and Olympic champion may have failed to make it past the semi-finals at the world championships but this year he triumphed at the world indoors over 60m in 6.46secs, the exact same time of his previous victory in 2003 The next 100 days?

At the British trials this spring she looked better still in winning both events: Her 400m time of 4min 2.35sec puts her second in the world rankings this year. Her 800m form is even better, and she tops the world rankings this year by a distance The next 100 days? She was reluctant to ink in her diary until she had secured her place on the team, but now says she will swim in two competitions before the Olympics \u2013 the Mare Nostrum in Barcelona in early June, and the second set of British Olympic trials in Sheffield later that same month. She won&apos;t be resting for either of them but will fit them into her training schedule Main rival? Federica Pellegrini (Italy) The first woman in history to break the four-minute barrier in the 400m, Pellegrini is incredibly glamorous having posed naked and spray-painted gold in the pages of Italian Vogue. She is also stupendously talented. Won the 200m/400m double at both of the last two World Championships, is world record holder at both distances, and is the reigning 200m Olympic champion What&apos;s being said? &quot;It all depends on the Olympics and what happens whether I carry on swimming or retire.

Gold Ellen Gandy Swimming, butterfly Form guide At the World Championships in 2011 she finished second in the 200m butterfly, and was only 0.04sec away from going one better. This year she won the 100m and 200m double at the New South Wales state championships in Australia, and then repeated the feat in the Olympic trials. Her new British record in the 100m fly puts her second in the world rankings The next 100 days? Gandy has just flown back to her home in Melbourne, where she&apos;ll resume training alongside Olympic 100m breaststroke champion Leisel Jones under coach Rohan Taylor. Gandy believes it was her poor turn that cost her the gold medal in Shanghai, and she plans to work on her technique there before she comes back to Britain later in the summer Main rival? Jiao Liuyang (China) Liuyang is only seven days older than Gandy, but has a lot more experience. She was only 14 when she won the senior Asian Championships in 2006. She followed that with silver in the 200m fly in Beijing, behind her compatriot Liu Zige. Since then Liuyang has got better. She beat Gandy by a fingertip in Shanghai to become world champion What&apos;s being said?  &quot;I like being in Australia because I get to race the best that they have on a regular basis. It&apos;s really great to be around them and race against them because when it comes to racing at the majors I&apos;m ready. I know I can match them&quot; Ellen Gandy How ready are they? Silver Tom Daley Diving, 10m platform Form guide Concern grew earlier this year when he was criticised by GB&apos;s performance director Alexei Evangulov. Since then Daley has started to come good, winning an individual silver medal in the World Cup in Dubai, another in the synchro with Pete Waterfield in Beijing the following week and a third solo silver in Moscow means he has had three straight podium finishes across the two events The next 100 days? Evangulov says that he and Daley have hatched &quot;a cunning plan&quot; for the Olympics. Whatever they have cooked up, it is unlikely to involve much more media work if the coach has his way. Daley will dive in Mexico in the final World Cup event at the end of this month, and again at the British Championships in Sheffield in June Main rival? Qiu Bo (China) Bo is so talented that, if he is on form, everyone else will be competing for silver. Daley&apos;s coach Andy Banks says he has never seen a diver &quot;with such consistency and strength&quot;. He is the current world champion. Daley&apos;s only consolation is that Bo has twice cracked under pressure in major finals - at the Beijing Olympics, and again at the 2009 World Championships What&apos;s being said? &quot;It reminds me of the situation in Russia with Anna Kournikova. She looked pretty and made a promising start to her career but the media exposure meant she never got to be the best. She is still in the celebrity news but she never achieved her full potential&quot; GB performance director Alexei Evangulov How ready are they? Bronze Jessica Ennis Athletics, heptathlon Form guide The last seven months have been challenging. After an undefeated run of two years, collecting world and European titles, Britain&apos;s golden girl has now lost both her titles to long-time rivals Tatyana Chernova and Nataliya Dobrynska, finishing second in her last two major championships. The coming months will prove critical to discovering whether she has the physical and mental capabilities to bounce back The next 100 days? Opening her season with a 100m run at the Great City Games, Manchester, followed by a trip to Gotzis, Austria, where the world&apos;s best heptathletes annually assemble for the Hypo Meeting. Ennis is also likely to compete in one or two Diamond League fixtures to perfect individual events Main rival? Tatyana Chernova (Russia) Stole Ennis&apos;s world title in Daegu with a personal best 57 points clear of the Briton&apos;s own best. At 6&apos;2&quot; the Olympic bronze medallist towers over Ennis and excels in two of Ennis&apos;s weakest events \u2013 long jump and javelin. Chernova edges her in the 800m which could make the final event of the Olympic heptathlon very tense. Defending champion Nataliya Dobrynska is also a threat What&apos;s being said? &quot;Obviously there&apos;s disappointment at what happened in Istanbul. But you learn so much from events that don&apos;t go exactly as planned. And remember, I came away having done three PBs and a national record. I&apos;m in much better shape than I was last year&quot; Jessica Ennis How ready are they? Silver Mo Farah Athletics, 5,000m/10,000m Form guide After winning gold and silver at the 2011 World Championships, Farah&apos;s 2012 campaign began with a bump. The 29-year-old lost four races in a row during the indoor season, finishing fourth over 3,000m in Istanbul. How he responds in the outdoor season will be revealing to his Olympic medal chances The next 100 days? Currently training at his base in Portland, Oregon, Farah&apos;s first race of the season will be the Bupa London 10km on 27 May Main rival? Kenenisa Bekele (Ethiopa) If the Ethiopian, who has been struggling with injury since 2009, defends his Olympic titles \u2013 he holds both 5,000m and 10,000m and is also the world record holder over both distances \u2013 he will be Farah&apos;s big threat. Other Ethiopians will also have Farah&apos;s card marked, including Ibrahim Jeilan, as well as the USA&apos;s Bernard Lagat What&apos;s being said? &quot;Sometimes when you experience disappointment then you start to do even better because it makes you more hungry. My confidence is still high and I&apos;m hungry. I&apos;m a lot more up for it now. You can&apos;t keep winning. You have to lose sometimes and this shows you can&apos;t switch off for more than half a second&quot; Mo Farah, after finishing 4th in Istanbul How ready are they? Silver Dai Greene Athletics, 400m hurdles Form guide The Welshman has been in sensational form, winning back-to-back titles over the last two years; he is the current World, European and Commonwealth champion and the second fastest ever Briton over the 400m hurdles. Greene may not be the fastest on the circuit \u2013 his personal best of 47.88secs is around half a second slower than his US rivals \u2013 but he has a knack for dominating championship races The next 100 days? Currently training under Malcolm Arnold at his Bath base \u2013 the coach who guided Colin Jackson to two world titles - Greene has hinted that he may open his outdoor season at the Rome Diamond League meet as he did last year Main rival? Louis Jacob van Zyl (South Africa) Topped the rankings last year and finished third in Daegu, but the South African lost speed, the early start to his season making the year too long. Defending Olympic champion Angelo Taylor and his US compatriots Bershawn Jackson and Jeshua Anderson will make London 2012 a very competitive field What&apos;s being said? &quot;I think Dai will be the man to beat [in London]. Of all the athletes I have ever encountered, Dai is the toughest mentally. I&apos;ve known people like Linford Christie, athletes who have been really successful, but nobody&apos;s been as assured and confident as Dai&quot; Fellow Welshman, sprinter Christian Malcolm How ready are they? Gold Phillips Idowu Athletics, triple jump Form guide The 33-year-old has had his share of frustrations, losing his world title to a young American who posted a new personal best of 17.96m, a whopping 15cm further than the Briton&apos;s own record. If he is to dominate the event again Idowu will need to keep up with the competition, his young rivals pushing distances the likes of which we have not seen since the days of world record holder Jonathan Edwards at 17.90m-plus The next 100 days? Currently training in Birmingham with coach Aston Moore, Idowu plans to attend a warm weather training camp in Portugal next month before opening his season at a meet still to be confirmed Main rival? Christian Taylor (USA) The newest names on the scene are Americans Christian Taylor, 21, \u2013 who won the world title last year - and Will Claye, 20, who won the world indoor title in March. Better known is Teddy Tamgho, the 23-year-old who posted the biggest jump in a decade, recording 17.98m What&apos;s being said? &quot;This is what I&apos;m going to win the Olympics in&quot; Phillips Idowu, after trying on the new Stella McCartney 2012 Olympic kit How ready are they? Silver Sir Chris Hoy Cycling, track Form guide Dipped slightly before the world championships but still better than adequate, given that he took a gold in the keirin and bronze in the match sprint. That reflects a winter in which Hoy has moved up a notch, winning the British national sprint title and showing dominant form at the World Cup The next 100 days? Hoy took a short break in Dubai after the world championship and returned to training in Manchester this week. In between sessions in Manchester he and the other GB sprinters have camps in Majorca, for road training, and on the track in Cottbus, Germany, but crucially, no racing before the holding camp at Newport Main rival? Gregory Bauge (France) Hoy has three Olympic titles to defend. No obvious rival has emerged in the keirin, but in the match sprint he faces stiff competition for his GB team place from Jason Kenny, who beat him in the worlds. Whoever gets the nod has an uphill task against the Frenchman Gregory Bauge, gold medallist in Melbourne without dropping a match What&apos;s being said? &quot;I&apos;m not far away from my best and it&apos;s going to take that last bit of motivation, this is the light at the end of the tunnel and it&apos;s an exciting opportunity. When I&apos;m really on form I can beat anybody in the world in the sprint and anybody in the world in the keirin&quot; Sir Chris Hoy How ready are they? Gold Bradley Wiggins Cycling, time trial Form guide Couldn&apos;t be better. Wiggins had a perfect winter, with no injuries or illness, began winning at his first outing in the Tour of Algarve and dominated his first major goal, the Paris-Nice in early March. He pulled out of the Tour of Catalonia, but that was precautionary due to apocalyptic weather conditions The next 100 days? Has just completed first altitude training camp of the year in Tenerife, and will return to racing in the Tour of Romandie alongside Cavendish. That leads into a second altitude camp, followed by his fifth stage race of the year, the Dauphine Libere from 3-11 June. That takes him to the Tour de France; finishing that should leave him at a peak for London Main rival? Fabian Cancellara There are only two better time triallists on paper and both have come a cropper this spring. Cancellara of Switzerland is recovering from a broken collarbone sustained in the Tour of Flanders, while the current world champion Tony Martin of Germany was unlucky to be hit by a car out training and is getting over facial injuries plus a broken shoulder blade What&apos;s being said? &quot;Phase one of my buildup to the Tour de France consisted of getting a really good winter under my belt, and hitting my early season targets. The next step is preparing towards the Tour. [Winning Paris-Nice] leaves me well and truly on track&quot; Bradley Wiggins How ready are they? Gold Mark Cavendish Cycling, road race Form guide Worked hard over the winter but had a difficult spring with bouts of illness and a heavy crash, all of which clearly affected his chances in his two major goals of the early season: Milan-San Remo, where he did not finish, and Ghent-Wevelgem, where he missed the key split. Four wins to date, but he will not be satisfied The next 100 days? Having just become a father, Cavendish is taking a mid-season break before returning to racing at the Tour of Romandie on 24 April. After that he races the Giro d&apos;Italia and Tour of Switzerland to build into the Tour de France, his final warmup for the Olympics, and he will visit the Olympic road race circuit for at least one &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; over the Box Hill circuit Main rival? Tom Boonen Two threats have emerged over the spring and Cavendish will have to watch them closely in August: the Belgian Tom Boonen, who has dominated the one-day classics, and the Slovak Peter Sagan, who is better suited to the London course than Boonen, and has four top-five finishes in one-day races this year What&apos;s being said? &quot;He finished the classics in good shape, he&apos;s trained hard this week and is about where we would expect him to be.

John Yates, the former assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police who is employed by the Bahrain government to advise on police reform, told the Guardian: &quot;People say can we guarantee security. Of course we can&apos;t guarantee security. I&apos;d be a fool to sit here and say that. &quot;Is it possible there might be an incursion on the track? Of course there is. It&apos;s an open event. Can you stop some idiot running onto the track? There have been other incidents of track incursions.&quot; Yates also said police would retaliate with live rounds if necessary: &quot;The police will have all the options you would expect. If the opposition started firing live ammunition, the police would respond with live,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;But I don&apos;t think that&apos;s likely.&quot; The British policeman, known universally as &quot;Yates of the Yard&quot;, went to Bahrain on a six-month contract four months ago. He led the cash-for-honours investigation, but resigned last year following criticism of the police investigation into the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. &quot;There will be protests over the weekend. But we want to make this a sporting event not a security event. The man who is heading the security said he wanted security to be felt but not seen. And I applaud that. &quot;I judge it more likely there will be protests on the route and protests around the villages. I just hope it&apos;s a good event and I hope it goes off without too much trouble.&quot; Yates made his comments as protesters stepped up their activity with a demonstration in middle of he capital, Manama, which had to be broken up with stun grenades, and promises of 15 further demonstrations overnight, compared with seven on Tuesday night. The controversial Bahrain Grand Prix has been foisted on the reluctant F1 teams only after they were give assurances that they would be safe following meetings in Shanghai last week with Bernie Ecclestone, the sport&apos;s commercial rights holder, and a statement from FIA, the governing body. Formula One has refused to get involved in the political and moral row which has engulfed Bahrain and has concentrated purely on the security aspect. The sport will be dismayed by the comments from Yates, who also said the police needed their own human rights. &quot;What some of the police are facing it&apos;s horrific. I saw four or five cops with life-changing injuries, faces taken off, ingested flames and lungs damaged. Where are their human rights? The cops have taken some heavy, heavy injuries.&quot; Yates dismissed much of the reported violence as &quot;malicious propaganda&quot;. He added: &quot;There will be incidents when police have not acted appropriately. You saw that in a supermarket recently, and that&apos;s being investigated.&quot; He also played down allegations that the police are making preemptive strikes in the villages surrounding the capital. He said: &quot;There&apos;s allegations that people are arrested and not taken to the police station but go to these holding sites where allegedly terrible things happen. But that would be on YouTube. That would be posted.&quot; Following an independent inquiry into the bloodshed in Bahrain last year, Yates said that what happened in the country was &quot;tragic&quot; and &quot;appalling&quot;. He added on Wednesday: &quot;But the will is there to move on and make the changes. I&apos;ve seen a of changes in the four months I&apos;ve been here.

Chinese bureaucrats may have a grey image but their ability to amass \u2013 and spend \u2013 ill-gotten gains is eye-opening. The extraordinary political scandal unfolding at the top of the party \u2013 the suspected murder of the Briton Neil Heywood by the wife of the top leader Bo Xilai \u2013 is unprecedented. But the allegations of &quot;serious disciplinary violations&quot; by Bo himself, and of attempts by his spouse, Gu Kailai, to shift money overseas, have put an instantly recognisable and very powerful face on an endemic problem. Corrupt officials smuggled 800bn yuan (\u00a380bn) out of the country and around 17,000 people fled abroad between the mid-1990s and 2008, according to a report that China&apos;s central bank released last year, apparently unintentionally. &quot;[Bo&apos;s arrest] isn&apos;t a typical case of graft. Nevertheless, it illustrates the irrefutable truth that unchecked power leads to corruption,&quot; warned the gutsy business magazine Caixin. Columbia University&apos;s Xiaobo Lu, an expert on official abuses of power, said the affair was a &quot;huge challenge&quot; for the regime. &quot;Bo&apos;s case has revealed how closely power and money are married. In China, the corruption problem has been clearly recognised as a legitimacy-threatening problem.&quot; The party is spinning the case as proof of its determination to keep cadres clean, with state media saying it shows that no one is above the rules and treating it as an isolated case. How many believe that is another matter. Corruption has long been a major public concern. The party has repeatedly pledged to crack down and there is certainly no shortage of cases. Disciplinary inspection agencies handled almost 140,000 in 2010 and more than 145,000 people were punished. Some say the massive sums now involved largely reflect the growth of the Chinese economy, while others think the problems are spreading and becoming more entrenched as political and economic power grow ever closer. &quot;Once people get into office they are part of the system and that makes it difficult to be clean. People who are not [clean] put pressure on you and see you as an undesirable element,&quot; said Sidney Rittenberg, who spent 35 years working alongside Chinese leaders as an ardent communist. Back in the 60s, he said, one official at his work unit was fired for merely accepting gifts of food. Deng Xiaogang, an expert on corruption at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said: &quot;When you are in power you don&apos;t need to do anything. People come and beg to give you favours.&quot; No one can be sure precisely what allegations Bo may face \u2013 and given that he and his wife have vanished into custody, they have no way of challenging them. In most cases involving very senior figures \u2013 such as the former Shanghai party secretary Chen Liangyu, now serving 18 years for corruption \u2013 there has been no suggestion they funnelled money overseas. But last week a pointed article in the official party newspaper, the People&apos;s Daily, said corrupt officials had been secretly using children, wives, friends and even mistresses to move and hide illicitly obtained wealth overseas. Investigators are also said to believe that Gu killed Heywood because he threatened to expose her overseas investments. Corruption concerns have increasingly focused on &quot;naked officials&quot; who send their spouses and children overseas \u2013 usually followed, say critics, by sizable fortunes. Strict capital controls of $50,000 (\u00a330,000) a year per person have done little to prevent the flow of cash. The railway ministry&apos;s former chief engineer Zhang Shuguang, who is still under investigation, stashed $2.8bn of assets in the US and Switzerland, according to the state broadcaster. Other reports said the assets included a spacious Los Angeles property bought for $825,000 at a time when Zhang, then a much lower ranking figure, was earning just 2,200 yuan ($350) a month. The central bank report identified eight ways that officials moved money overseas. Some simply carried suitcases of money across the border themselves or used human &quot;mules&quot;; others used credit cards to buy large amounts of luxury goods overseas, repaying the fees with embezzled money or bribes. In some cases, people accepted money overseas and bought property cash down, or had money put directly into overseas accounts. In more complicated schemes they set up offshore companies in places such as the British Virgin Islands, buying materials from them at an above-market rate and selling them goods at a below-market rate. The domestic company would go bankrupt and the offshore one would take it over. Another popular avenue for money-laundering has been Macau&apos;s casinos. Because of currency controls, junket operators allow mainlanders to put down renminbi on the mainland and then advance them credit in Macau \u2013 often a figure many times the original deposit. Winnings can be paid out in Hong Kong dollars and funnelled to another location, though sometimes officials get carried away: Ma Xiangdong, deputy mayor of Shenyang, reportedly gambled away $4.8m of embezzled funds in Macau before he was brought down. Ma was executed but such tough penalties have done little to deter cadres. &quot;People with vested interests have no fear,&quot; said Ma&apos;s former secretary Wang Xiaofang, now a novelist who writes about official intrigues. He Jiahong, an expert on corruption investigations at Renmin University, said greater accountability was needed. &quot;[Anti-corruption] policies rely on severe punishment \u2013 we say we executed one and deterred 100. But this policy has not worked well. Effective investigation is better than punishment, and prevention is better than investigation.&quot; The party has repeatedly pledged to make senior officials publicly declare their own assets and those of their relatives \u2013 but has yet to do so. And the higher up the tree officials climb, the harder it is to challenge them. &quot;These guys get so drunk on power they think they can get away with anything,&quot; said Rittenberg. &quot;When the big guys are caught, usually it has something to do with their political stand. It is a political weapon and they saw Bo as a political menace.&quot;", "tags": ["Bo Xilai", "Neil Heywood", "China", "World news", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-19T14:06:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/apr/19/roberto-di-matteo-chelsea", "sentences": ["Drogba may have beaten Barcelona but is expected to start the summer under Nicolas Anelka at Shanghai Shenhua, and his will not be the only high-profile exit."], "title": "Why Roberto Di Matteo may be right man at wrong time for Chelsea | Dominic Fifield", "article": "Have Chelsea stumbled upon the answer? A year ago, Roberto Di Matteo was spending his time visiting clubs around the continent, furthering his coaching education on the quiet. Sacked by West Bromwich Albion after enduring a horrible mid-season slump that had yielded one win in nine league games, he was seeking to rebuild his reputation. Having initially returned to Stamford Bridge as a familiar face, he is now proving the perfect antidote to Chelsea&apos;s peaky campaign. Di Matteo is revelling as the caretaker. After 13 games, his record is identical to that of Guus Hiddink \u2013 won 10, drawn two, lost one \u2013 after the experienced Dutchman took over in a similar capacity from Luiz Felipe Scolari in 2009. Hiddink, too, confronted Barcelona in the last four of the Champions League and reached an FA Cup final, and was unbeaten in his remaining nine matches before returning to full-time employment with the Russian Football Federation. There is a sense of deja vu at present. This group of players has a history of uniting, and rallying, once a manager who has not convinced all in the dressing room has been ousted. The difference between Hiddink and Di Matteo, the former&apos;s vast experience aside, is the Italian will be available to take up the position full-time. The veteran Dutchman had always been destined to return to Moscow, with even Roman Abramovich unable to convince him or a federation over which he exerts considerable influence that he should be released from his duties with the national team. Di Matteo, on the other hand, is out of contract at the club in the summer and will recognise this as an opportunity to make himself a long-term fixture. After all, the chance to coach a Champions League contender comes round very rarely. So what has he done that has been so successful? Di Matteo&apos;s has been a study in common-sense management. He was thrust into the interim first-team coach role with Chelsea fifth in the Premier League, facing an awkward fifth-round FA Cup replay at Birmingham, and well adrift in their Champions League last-16 tie against Napoli. Senior players were disillusioned having been marginalised by Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. The stand-in was charged with securing a top-four place; progress in cup competitions would be considered a bonus. Faced with that scenario, with no time in a crammed schedule to instigate radical change and no transfer window to introduce new faces, the pragmatist in Di Matteo clicked in. Chelsea&apos;s squad had consistently qualified for the Champions League playing a style of football that suited them, so he allowed them to express themselves the way they knew best. Out went his predecessor&apos;s desire for patient, possession football and in came the urgency and strength of old. All the long-term planning this club had hoped to put in place through Villas-Boas was simply put on hold. Most of the players have delighted in the familiar routine. Even the in-house doubters \u2013 and there were plenty initially who were unconvinced by the 41-year-old&apos;s pedigree \u2013 have been won over by the manager&apos;s simple willingness to communicate. One of the principal criticisms of Villas-Boas was a lack of dialogue from the top, but virtually every assessment of his replacement has included an acknowledgement that there is clarity these days in everything asked of them. He made peace with those who were disaffected. There has been a maturity to his approach throughout. And it has had an effect on the pitch The stand-in has proved tactically assured to date while also sensibly shifting his resources to ensure a hefty fixture schedule does not drain momentum from the campaign. Senior players have been more readily willing to accept life on the fringes when clear reasoning has been offered, and effectively with guarantees that all will play some part in the weeks ahead. Approaching matches game by game, concentrating on who is fit, in form and may best impose himself on immediate opponents, was a simple, practical philosophy. Players such as Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou are edging towards the end of their contracts, and lucrative summer moves away, but the need to look short-term rather than further into the club&apos;s future has allowed Di Matteo to rely upon all-comers. Training has been tweaked rather than completely remodelled. The players, content in a winning side, have been convinced, recognising perhaps that this represents \u2013 for some \u2013 a last hurrah on this stage. And, with less anxiety creeping into their play, Chelsea under Di Matteo have benefited from better fortune than they did under Villas-Boas. The Portuguese&apos;s results were undermined by profligacy, yet now Chelsea feel ruthless again. The Barcelona game was an extreme example of that \u2013 one shot on target, one goal \u2013 but the victory against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday was another, a 5-1 success that combined a dose of luck with some devastating finishing. But is he the man to instigate the changes still required? While Di Matteo has flourished to date in what was always a salvage mission, the longer-term issues that so flummoxed Villas-Boas still have to be addressed. This squad still requires an injection of new blood if they are to challenge in the Premier League \u2013 they are 25 points behind Manchester United at the top at present, which feels unacceptable \u2013 and the owner will still cherish a team playing the slick, forward-thinking football Bar\u00e7a tend to muster. After all, he had enjoyed the style with silverware Villas-Boas had instigated at Porto. The summer still promises to be one of change. Players will leave regardless of whether this squad reaches \u2013 or even wins \u2013 the Champions League in Munich. Drogba may have beaten Barcelona but is expected to start the summer under Nicolas Anelka at Shanghai Shenhua, and his will not be the only high-profile exit. Replacements will be required, and the team&apos;s approach adapted to accommodate the new faces. Di Matteo would relish the opportunity to oversee such a transformation, but that task was considered too much for Carlo Ancelotti, a two-time European Cup winning manager, and quickly overwhelmed Villas-Boas, the brightest young coach of the moment upon his appointment last summer. Would Abramovich be willing to ask the stand-in to take it on? Results achieved with the old guard are one thing, but a long term-vision is something else. The Italian must convince the oligarch, and most immediately his eyes and ears at Cobham \u2013 the technical director, Michael Emenalo \u2013 that he warrants inclusion high on the shortlist for the long-term position. Who else would be available? The reality is that the club will be tempted to scrutinise the market over the summer, with the hierarchy perhaps wary of acting with haste on an appointment. Avram Grant, with a team rallying around strong characters, lost only two league games in charge of the team after taking over from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in the autumn of 2007, as well as reaching finals in the Champions League and Carling Cup, though the three-and-a-half-year contract awarded the Israeli always felt injudicious. He was ultimately sacked nine months into the deal. Chelsea may not be the only side seeking changes at the top in the summer, and there could be candidates aplenty. The focus invariably fixes upon Pep Guardiola \u2013 yet to sign a contract extension at Bar\u00e7a, but inclined to take a sabbatical if he does leave the Camp Nou \u2013 and Mourinho, whose future at Real Madrid could also be in question. But there are others who may be considered: Everton&apos;s David Moyes; the France coach, Laurent Blanc; Marseille&apos;s Didier Deschamps; and Marcelo Bielsa at Athletic Bilbao. Indeed, a number of prominent coaches could be on the market after Euro 2012, keen to restore Chelsea as Premier League contenders. Di Matteo can point to his results as evidence of his ability. He will hope that counts for plenty.", "tags": ["Roberto Di Matteo", "Chelsea", "Champions League 2011-12", "Champions League", "Barcelona", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-19T15:36:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/india-missile-china-agni-v", "sentences": ["Security and foreign affairs experts describing the launch of the Agni-V, which could strike Beijing or Shanghai, played down its immediate impact."], "title": "India's missile fails to rattle China", "article": "The successful launch of India&apos;s first intercontinental ballistic missile sparked predictably excited rhetoric in Asia&apos;s two biggest powers. Indian commentators hailed the nation&apos;s membership of the elite club of nations possessing such weapons and TV channels looped footage of the test off the country&apos;s eastern seaboard. &quot;It will be a quantum leap in India&apos;s strategic capability,&quot; said Ravi Gupta, spokesman for India&apos;s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the government agency which built the missile. &quot;Agni-V is a game-changer and a technological marvel,&quot; VK Saraswat, scientific adviser to the defence minister, was quoted as telling the Hindu newspaper. In Beijing, the state-run Global Times grumbled that &quot;India [was] being swept up by missile delusion&quot; and warned China&apos;s neighbour could never hope to win an &quot;overall arms race&quot;. Gaps between macho public rhetoric in the two emerging powers and reality is nothing new. India&apos;s chaotic and colourful media are always quick to seize on evidence of aggressive Chinese intentions, whether that be a new alleged border incursion, a new aid initiative to a neighbour or some undiplomatic language. Listening to some TV pundits as you fix your masala chai, eggs and paratha in the morning you would be forgiven for thinking that war was imminent. India and China have of course fought before, in 1962. Then Delhi&apos;s forces, ill-equipped, unprepared and badly led came off much the worse. This has left its scars, as have the three more or less victorious wars India has fought on its other frontier against Pakistan. The result is something of a siege mentality which could be considered odd in a country of 1.2 billion with a $1.5tn (\u00a3930bn) economy that dwarfs all but one of its neighbours. Security and foreign affairs experts describing the launch of the Agni-V, which could strike Beijing or Shanghai, played down its immediate impact. Not only was trade between China and India booming, predicted to be worth $100bn within two years, but leaders in both countries, after a rough patch at the end of the last decade, appeared to have taken deliberate decisions to build a stable, secure partnership, said Dr C Raja Mohan, of Delhi&apos;s Observer research Foundation. &quot;India is now getting the full panoply of what it means to be a nuclear power. It is a deterrent to China but it does not mean that the relationship with China will go bad,&quot; he said. Rukmani Gupta, associate fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis in Delhi, said India was neither expecting a conflict with China nor seeking to change the balance of power as &quot;Indian-Chinese relations are extremely stable&quot;. It will be many years before the missile can actually be used in anger \u2013 and even more before a submarine-launched version could be introduced. &quot;There&apos;s a lot more testing to do. The [Agni-V] may only be deployed by the end of the decade. A lot of the commentary has been over the top,&quot; said Manoj Joshi, a security expert and analyst. The launch is part of a giant modernisation programme of India&apos;s military capability that will eventually cost hundreds of billions of dollars over many decades. Joshi pointed out that the missiles were being developed by the Defence Research Development Organisation without much oversight from policymakers. &quot;It&apos;s worrying that government scientists can issue press releases and make statements that could have an impact on policy,&quot; Joshi said. In a country where technological wizards and soldiers are hugely respected locally, military scientists are heroes. The former president was an aerospace engineer who worked on the Agni-V&apos;s predecessors. Another reason for the celebration in India is that currently only the permanent members of the UN security council have missiles of such capability. India has long demanded a seat on the council and, despite the ostensible support of countries such as the US and the UK, is unlikely to receive one soon.

Bar\u00e7a suits feel the Tottenham man will integrate nicely into the club&apos;s system \u2013 what with the shared love of hair gel and all \u2013 and will make their move this summer provided their curmudgeonly head honcho Pep Guardiola approves the deal. Having proved that he can still hack it at the highest level with his performance against Barcelona, Didier Drogba will promptly leave the highest level at the next available opportunity to join Shanghai Shenhua on a \u00a36.7m a year deal. That&apos;s \u00a36.7m folks. Drogba may not be the only one on his way out of Stamford Bridge. Juventus are keen on signing reluctant hero Salomon Kalou and Popeye impersonator Raul Meireles.

Martin O&apos;Neill has lifted his Woody Allen glasses and made some glistening glances towards Gabby Agbonlahor but Aston Villa will tell their former manager to back off unless he can come up with 12 million quid for the striker. Arsenal will throw \u00a37m at Montpellier in exchange for defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, while Roberto Mart\u00ednez has told Victor Moses he is not ready to leave Wigan.

I&apos;m in Liverpool today to cover the mayoral election campaign and I&apos;ll be speaking to the favourite, Labour&apos;s Joe Anderson (currently leader of the council) and some of his rivals. If Travers is right, you&apos;ll be hearing a lot more about Liverpool&apos;s mayor after May. As my colleague Martin Wainwright wrote recently in a blog about the contest, the winner will be &quot;the first really big city mayor outside London&quot;. Today I want to learn about the candidates. But I also want to find out whether Travers really is right. The government is strongly promoting directly elected mayors and on Thursday 3 May Salford will also be electing one for the first time, while another 10 cities will be holding referendums on whether or not to adopt the directly elected mayoral model. As a London-based journalist, I know what the mayoral system has done for the capital. But what are mayoral campaigns like outside London? Are they really going to revive interest in local democracy and usher in a new generation of dynamic, accountable leaders? Or is it just the same old local government politics under a new name? Liverpool seems a good place to pose the question. If you&apos;ve got thoughts on any of this, whether you live in Liverpool or not, please post them below. I&apos;ll be in the city all day, attending a campaign event, interviewing candidates and talking to voters, and I&apos;ll be posting updates as I go along. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I&apos;m on @AndrewSparrow. And, if you&apos;re a hard-core fan, you can follow @gdnpoliticslive. It&apos;s an automated feed that tweets the start of every new post that I put on the blog.  7.55am: Before we get going, here&apos;s a short reading list about directly elected mayors. \u2022 A report from the Institute for Government called What can elected mayors do for our cities? (pdf)\u2022 A report from the Warwick Commission on elected mayors \u2022 A blog from Michael White on the Warwick Commission report  In a session on the important, but much-ignored, question of local democracy and directly elected local mayors, it&apos;s hard not to warm to a speaker who starts by contrasting the Anglo-Saxon model of decentralism with the rival inheritance of the Norman yoke, which tried to run a conquered England from Westminster. But that was what Keith Grint, professor of public leadership and management at Warwick University&apos;s business school, did yesterday in launching the latest in a series of Warwick Commissions, this one on the pros and cons of the mayoral option for major English cities.  \u2022 A column from John Harris casting doubt on the benefits of directly elected mayors  Liverpool, though, has decided to jump straight in, and nominations closed last week. By way of heralding a fresh start, all 12 candidates are white men, the frontrunner is the current leader of the city&apos;s Labour council, and as if to decisively push things into the 21st century, the field also includes Tony Mulhearn, whose had his last turn on the national stage when he and Derek Hatton were pioneering municipal Trotksyism. How any of this is meant to get Liverpool going is anyone&apos;s guess.  \u2022 A column from Simon Jenkins praising directly elected mayors  [Ken] Livingstone in 2000 transformed leadership in the capital from a closed party mafia (including himself) to a personality on a par with other world cities. The impact was immediate. The London mandate secured more cash for police and transport and spattered central London with lofty towers. In the past four years his successor, Boris Johnson, has subsidised cycling and dug up every road. Like them or loathe them, these men have put city politics on the map. Hustings are packed. London&apos;s civic life has never been so vibrant.   8.07am: Back to Liverpool. For the record, here are the 12 candidates standing in the mayoral election. Joe Anderson \u2013 LabourJeff Berman \u2013 Liverpool Independent partyTony Caldeira \u2013 ConservativeJohn Coyne \u2013 GreenLiam Fogarty - Independent Adam Heatherington \u2013 UkipRichard Kemp \u2013 Lib DemTony Mulhearn \u2013 Trade Union and Socialist CoalitionPeter Quiggins \u2013 National FrontSteve Radford \u2013 Liberal partyPaul Rimmer \u2013 English DemocratsMike Whitby \u2013 BNP You can read the official election booklet, with statements from all the candidates, here (pdf).  8.23am: Alert readers will have noticed something obvious about the people on the list of candidates. None of them are women. This is something that has alarmed some people in the city. This is what Flo Clucas, a former deputy leader of the council, told the Liverpool Post.  I think it&apos;s a terrible shame there are no women there. Mayor elections are dominated by men wherever they happen in the world.  And this is what Richard Kemp, the Lib Dem mayoral candidate, wrote about the subject on his blog.  I am not surprised by this. There have been 21 people who have been elected mayors in England. Only two of them have been women and only one, Mayor Thornhill in Watford, has been around for any length of time.  Does anyone know if it is true that mayoral elections are always dominated by men around the world (compared to other elections)? I haven&apos;t seen any figures on this, but it certainly sounds plausible. Why? For the same reason cited by a report from the Hansard Society last year which said that, although women were just as likely to sign petitions as men, they were far less likely to get involved in other political activities like blogging.  The evidence for online politics suggests that the more an activity involves self-promotion, the more likely there is to be a male dominance.  In London, as we know, mayoral politics involves self-promotion on an Olympic scale. Is it the same in Liverpool? I&apos;ll have a better idea by this afternoon.  8.31am: I&apos;m off to an event now where I&apos;ll be meeting Joe Anderson, the Labour candidate. I probably won&apos;t be posting again until around 11am.  10.55am: What can you learn from a vox pop with just a dozen or so voters? Not much, but more than you will learn from not talking to them. I&apos;m in a pavilion at Stanley Park where it&apos;s exceedingly noisy because it&apos;s full of schoolchildren. They were here to see the Sea Odyssey spectacular, a street theatre event with an enormous puppet of child and dog. I was here to see Joe Anderson, the Labour mayoral candidate and leader of the council. But more of him later. While I was waiting to speak to Anderson, I interviewed people in the crowd. If you speak to a random section of people anywhere in the UK and ask them about a forthcoming local election, most of them will tell you they know very little about it. The same thing happened to me just now. But I did gain some impressions that may be pertinent. Here goes.\u2022 The fact that this is a mayoral election, rather than a standard local election, does not seem to have raised interest levels very much. Of the 13 people I spoke properly, eight of them told me they were frankly not interested at all in the campaign. &quot;I&apos;m not taking any notice, to be perfectly honest,&quot; was a typical comment. The others did express some interest, but not because it was a mayoral observation. That might be related to my second, entirely unscientific observation. \u2022 Moving to a mayoral system does not seem to be popular. Two people told me they thought the council should have left things as they are. &quot;Why have an elected mayor and pay more money?&quot; asked Brian Corcoran, an unemployed 55-year-old. The one person who told me the mayoral system would be an improvement said she was in favour of change because it was better to have a mayor than &quot;the same old council leaders&quot;. She did not seem to realise that one of &quot;the same old council leaders&quot; was likely to win. \u2022 Liverpudlians don&apos;t seem to want a Boris or a Ken. Two people told me that they specifically did not want a celebrity mayor. &quot;I&apos;m in favour of a mayor as long as it&apos;s not the same as in London,&quot; Wally Parry, 70, said. &quot;A mayor should be in the shadows, rather than in the forefront.&quot; \u2022 Anderson is on course to win. Of those voters who did express an interest, they all said they would be voting for Anderson. Several said they were particularly impressed by the fact that he has struck a deal that will allow cruise liners to disembark in the city. As for what Anderson had to say, I&apos;m going to have to wait until I can unload my notebook. Now I&apos;m off to meet Richard Kemp, the Lib Dem candidate.  12.57pm: Earlier I said Labour&apos;s Joe Anderson was likely to win. But that doesn&apos;t quite tell the whole story. According to the bookies, he&apos;s a virtual dead cert. William Hill have him as the 1/6 odds on favourite.  The Lib Dems&apos; Richard Kemp comes next, at 7/2, followed by John Coyne, the Green candidate, at 10/1 and Tony Caldeira, the Conservative, at 16/1. After that, all the other candidates are given odds of 100/1, or longer. I&apos;ve finished my interview with Kemp. We met at his house, which is just off the famous Penny Lane. I&apos;ve now set up HQ in the Penny Lane wine bar where I&apos;m going to write up my notes. I&apos;ve also got quite a few other calls to make. The blog has been fairly quite this morning, and my laptop is in action now and I should be posting much more frequently this afternoon.  1.28pm: Why is Liverpool having a mayoral election anyway? Time for some background. David Cameron is keen on directly-elected mayors, just as Tony Blair was. Not surprisingly, charismatic leaders tend to think that the solution to every problem in local government is charismatic leadership. Nick Clegg (perhaps because he is a different type of leader) is more skeptical. But the Tories led the way on this and the coalition agreement said the government would &quot;create directly-elected mayors in the 12 largest English cities, subject to confirmatory referendums&quot;. Ten of those referendums are going ahead in May. Clegg may not be enthusiastic about elected mayors, but he does want to devolve power to cities and in December last year he published a document called Unlocking Growth in the Cities which said that the government would strike a series of tailor-made &quot;city deals&quot; with England&apos;s leading cities. In return for demonstrating &quot;strong, visible and accountable leadership&quot;, city councils can obtain more economic power. Liverpool was the first authority to agree a &quot;city deal&quot; and the mayoral job is a direct consequence. The ruling Labour group on Liverpool council were originally sceptical about having a directly-elected mayor. But the city deal is worth \u00a3130m to the city and, when ministers made it clear that the best way for Liverpool to meet the &quot;strong, visible and accountable leadership&quot; test would be to have a directly elected mayor, Joe Anderson, the council leader, agreed to cut a deal. Some people in the city thought that there should be a referendum. But, under the Local Government Act, councils can go to a directly-elected mayor system without a referendum provided there&apos;s a two-thirds majority vote in council. Anderson argued that it would be best to move quickly, to unlock the \u00a3130m, and in February the council voted for the mayoral model by 62 votes to 3. Here&apos;s some background reading about the decision. \u2022 The Liverpool Echo story about the deal.\u2022 A written ministerial statement from Greg Clark, the cities minister, about the Liverpool city deal.\u2022 A statement from Liverpool council about the deal.\u2022 A blog from Richard Kemp, the Lib Dem candidate, criticising the deal.  1.40pm: Earlier I asked if mayoral elections are always dominated by men. Apparently they are. The Centre for Women and Democracy have done some work on this and here&apos;s an extract from a briefing note they did about the mayoral contests last year (pdf)  21% of candidates for the five mayoral posts being contested on 5 May are women.This represents a slight increase on 2010, but continues the underlying pattern of mayoral elections attracting fewer women candidates than council elections, in which around 30% of candidates are usually women. 21% of candidates for the five mayoral posts being contested on 5 May are women.   2.38pm: &quot;If George Galloway can win in Bradford West, then I can win in Liverpool.&quot; That was Tony Caldeira, the Conservative candidate, who just been speaking to me on the phone. Caldeira is the only person I&apos;ve spoken to so far who claims that there is any real excitement in Liverpool about the mayoral contest. I&apos;m sceptical, and his chances in a city where no Conservative councillor has been elected for ages must be minimal. But he points out that the mayoral system means that voters won&apos;t just judge him by his party label. &quot;I&apos;m not your standard Old Etonian,&quot; he says. &quot;I have lived in a council house with a single mum and been on free school meals and I have worked my way out of poverty.&quot; He now runs a company making cushions that employs 250 people around the world. We did not speak for long, but he was upbeat and friendly. He&apos;s not going anywhere here, of course, but he is now on the Tory candidates&apos; list and I suspect we may be hearing from him again. My interviews with Joe Anderson and Richard Kemp are more extensive. I&apos;ll be posting them soon.  3.24pm: Joe Anderson, the Labour candidate for mayor, left school at 16 (although he subsequently went to university as a mature student) and he worked as a merchant seaman and a social worker before becoming a full-time politician. He leads a Labour council in a city famous for its hostility to the Conservatives at a time when government spending cuts are causing real hardship. And yet his election manifesto (pdf) is relentlessly positive, and pro-business to a degree that would do Peter Mandelson proud. The first line reads: &quot;This is an exciting time for Liverpool.&quot; And one of his five pledges is to &quot;transform Liverpool into one of the most business and enterprise friendly cities in the UK.&quot; When I spoke to him this morning, I was keen to discover if he thought that having a mayoral election, instead of a standard council election, would change politics in the city. He seems cautiously optimistic that it will. Here are the main points. \u2022 Anderson said that he accepted that there was not a great deal of enthusiasm for a mayoral contest. I was speaking to him after my vox pop (see 10.55am) and I told him people did not seem swept away with excitement. &quot;It is hard for people to get their head around it,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s the first time. But people will start to come round to the whole concept when they start to read the letter that is going out and some of the stories that are in the papers.&quot;\u2022 He confirmed that the \u00a3130m on offer from the government&apos;s &quot;city deal&quot; (see 1.28pm) was the decisive factor in persuading the council to go for an elected mayor. He said that he was originally sceptical about Liverpool having a directly elected city mayor because he thought it would be better to have an elected mayor covering the whole city region. But this became impossible because some of the other Liverpool authorities objected. Anderson then pushed ahead with the city deal with the government. &quot;Once it became a question of do you allow [the other authorities] to stop the city of Liverpool, I took the decision that they should not hold us back,&quot; he said. \u2022 But he also claimed that having a directly elected mayor would make Liverpool more democratic.  Having a mayor gives us the opportunity open up the city and participation in democracy. Choosing a leader of the city used to be a decision taken by a group of councillors in a room in secret. This is different. It means the south, the north, the east and the west of the city gets an opportunity to elect a leader.  \u2022 He said that that, as an elected mayor, he would be able to lobby on behalf of the city internationally more effectively.  When I went to Shanghai \u2013 we were the only city outside of the capital to have an exhibition there \u2013 people could not get their head around the fact that I was leader of the council and that we also had a lord mayor. They could not understand the difference between the mayor of Shanghai and a lord mayor [a ceremonial figure in local authorities, with no political power]. They were confused by it all. Only after a great deal of explanation did they understand it.  Anderson also said the city would benefit from having a figurehead &quot;who can go out and guarantee that something will happen when he says it will happen&quot;. \u2022 He said he was not interested in being a celebrity figure. When I said to him that mayoral elections in London have favoured candidates who do well on programmes like Have I Got News for You, he left me in no doubt that this was not his style of politics.   I have got no intention of appearing on TV, whether it&apos;s Have I Got News For You or any other programme. My ambitions are about helping Liverpool make the most of the opportunities that exist. It is not about me personally.   \u2022 He said that he wanted more private sector involvement in the city. When I asked him if he would like to see the private sector account for a larger slice of the local economy, he replied: &quot;Of course, absolutely. We want private sector development.&quot; He said that, in economic terms, the old days were over.  One of the things that is very clear to me is that the future for local authorities and cities is never going to be the same again. They are going to have to do things differently. We have to be enterprising, and work with the private sector to encourage growth, create jobs and create new business as a way of securing our cities future.  There&apos;s a reason why Anderson&apos;s manifesto (pdf) is so positive. Yesterday I read it shortly before I read the ministerial statement from Greg Clark, the cities minister, on Liverpool&apos;s city deal. Anderson is promising a mayoral development corporation and five mayoral development zones. These ideas are also at the heart of the city deal, which Anderson negotiated personally with Clark. (Anderson also had meetings with Nick Clegg and George Osborne, but most of the work was done with Clark.) It&apos;s a joint project which guarantees Liverpool its \u00a3130m. But it means that, in this election, it is almost as if the Labour candidate is running on a manifesto jointly written by the Department for Communities.  If you want to read more about Anderson, here&apos;s a short reading list. Here&apos;s some more information about Joe Anderson. \u2022 Anderson&apos;s application to Labour explaining why he should be the party&apos;s candidate for mayor\u2022 A profile of Anderson in the Liverpool Echo\u2022 His Wikipedia entry\u2022 An interview with Community Care in which he talks about his background as a social worker.  4.04pm: There&apos;s a twitter feed devoted to news from the Liverpool mayoral contest - @LplMayorWatch.  4.43pm: Richard Kemp, the Lib Dem candidate for mayor and someone for whom the term &quot;veteran&quot; seems a bit of an understatement \u2013 he was first elected to Liverpool council in 1975 and his long career in local government has included a stint as vice chair of the Local Government Association \u2013 is skeptical about mayors. As we talked in his book-lined living room off Penny Lane, I read him the quote from the John Harris Guardian column I quoted earlier.  Liverpool, though, has decided to jump straight in, and nominations closed last week. By way of heralding a fresh start, all 12 candidates are white men, the frontrunner is the current leader of the city&apos;s Labour council, and as if to decisively push things into the 21st century, the field also includes Tony Mulhearn, whose had his last turn on the national stage when he and Derek Hatton were pioneering municipal Trotksyism. How any of this is meant to get Liverpool going is anyone&apos;s guess.  Did he agree? &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he replied. Kemp said that a directly elected city mayor was &quot;the answer to the wrong problem&quot;. Manchester and Leeds both received city deals worth more than \u00a31bn because they were negotiating as city regions (meaning their money will be shared amongst several authorities). Kemp said Liverpool needed a body with the clout to take decisions on behalf of all 1.65m people living in the Liverpool conurbation, not just the 430,000 people living in the city. Such a body could be led by a mayor for the city region of the kind Joe Anderson originally favoured (see 3.24pm) \u2013 a job sometimes described as a &quot;metro mayor&quot;. But Kemp said he did not like the mayoral model generally. But Liverpool has got one, and Kemp is the candidate. How does he see the contest? Here are the main points he had to make. \u2022 Kemp predicted that turnout would be lower than the 38% it was in last year&apos;s local elections in Liverpool (which he described as &quot;not a local election but a national referendum on the government&quot;) but more than the 30% it is in normal Liverpool local elections. He said the first mayoral election tends to increase turnout by 4 percentage points. After that it does down, he said.\u2022 He said Joe Anderson \u00a3130m was really only worth \u00a3100m, because Liverpool would have got \u00a330m of that anyway for academies.  \u2022 He said he was opposed to mayors because they led to &quot;testosterone-charged politics&quot;. He also said that where the mayoral system works, it does not work better than existing arrangements. And where it fail, as in Doncaster and Stoke, &quot;it fails spectacularly&quot;. \u2022 He said he expected the Lib Dems to lose about three of the 20 seats they hold on the council in the council elections. But he expected their share of the vote to be higher than it was last year. &quot;We are more confident this year,&quot; he said. &quot;We are more united. We are happier. Our canvass returns are better.&quot;\u2022 He claimed that Anderson&apos;s chances of winning the mayoral contest on first preference voters were &quot;minimal&quot;. There were too many candidates for that, he said. The mayor is elected by the supplementary vote, which means second preferences are taken into account. \u2022 Kemp said he was confident that he was in second place in the mayoral contest. &quot;I&apos;m clear that I&apos;m in second place because our canvass returns are picking up negligible returns for other people,&quot; he said. If you want to read more, here&apos;s a statement from Kemp explaining why he&apos;s standing for mayor.  4.48pm: Tony Mulhearn, one of the many candidates I have not been able to speak to, has sent me a statement about why he&apos;s standing for the Trade Union and Socialist Coalition.   I am standing for mayor because none of the other candidates represent the working class. All the other candidates are quite prepared to make huge cuts to jobs and services and this will have a devastating affect on the city of Liverpool. I stand in total opposition to cuts and am campaigning for a fight back in this city against the cuts to the childrens centres, to stop and reverse privitisation, to bring back EMA for 6th form and college students at the full \u00a330 and to organise a city wide referendum on the disasterous NHS Act.  I did manage a quick phone conversation with John Coyne, the Green candidate, who said that in some respects a mayoral contest is good for his party, because they get a platform at hustings, but that in other respects it posed problems, because at a lively hustings it was difficult &quot;to get complex ideas across in soundbites&quot;. There were no easy answers to the problems the city faced, he said. But there were some hard answers. He was dying to tell me about them, and he was very understanding when I explained that I just did not have the time.  4.54pm: The Lib Dems are a bit touchy about my post at 1.28pm. A party official has sent me an email saying that Nick Clegg wrote to councillors in January saying that no city deal, including Liverpool&apos;s, was dependent on the city adopting an elected mayor. That&apos;s true. Clegg said this:  The appropriate governance structure may be different for each city, depending on its individual circumstances and it is therefore important to clarify that no City Deal, including Liverpool&apos;s proposal, is contingent on having an elected mayor.  But ministers were saying that having an elected mayor would be a jolly good way of making sure that the city did meet the stronger governance requirements. This is what the Department for Communities said in a document.  Where cities want to take on significant new powers and funding streams, they will need to demonstrate strong, accountable leadership, an ambitious agenda for the economic future of their area, effective decision-making structures, and private sector involvement and leadership (cities with a directly elected mayor will meet this requirement).  I was not following this closely at the time, but one journalist colleague who was told me that he thought the way Liverpool was strong-armed into having an elected mayor was a serious setback for Clegg because he did not want it to happen.  5.03pm: At the start of the day (see 7.30am) I quoted Tony Travers as saying that the man who becomes mayor of Liverpool will become a well-known figure nationally. It takes a brave man to contradict Tony Travers on a local government matter, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s right. Joe Anderson shows no sign of wanting to be a national figure. Which is a shame, because it&apos;s not as if our national politics is over-populated with serious, credible working-class Labour figures from the north who are resolutely pro-business and pro-enterprise. When David Cameron said before the election that he wanted the private sector to account for a greater share of the economy in the north, Labour protested (because that was seen as code for public sector cuts) and I think it made the front page of the Guardian. When I asked Anderson if he wanted a bigger private sector, he looked at me as if I were mad and said of course.  Yet you would not call him New Labour. &quot;I&apos;m neither Old Labour or New Labour. I&apos;m Joe Anderson Labour,&quot; he said. On the broader question of whether mayoral election campaigns will revive local politics, I have say that I&apos;m not a great deal wiser.

Sandbag&apos;s new report into the emergence of emissions trading in China shows the speed and extent to which things are changing and we argue that Europe must now increase its own ambitions. All too often China&apos;s size and rapid development leads people to the conclusion that no action is being taken on climate change, that it is a polluting behemoth whose addiction to coal undermines all global efforts to avoid the worst effects of climate change. It is certainly true that in terms of addressing climate change few countries matter as much as China. A report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that in 2009 China and the US alone accounted for 41%, or 12Gt, of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions. Yet China must be understood in context. It is a rapidly developing superpower with a bewilderingly large population, facing increasing social tension fuelled by, among other things, its environmental limitations. Over the past 30 years, China has experienced unprecedented economic growth. Its ability to provide cheap goods for western export markets, coupled with the opening up of domestic markets has transformed the country. Yet a reliance on low-skilled labour coupled with high resource use is bringing with it increasingly unwelcome social, environmental and political tensions. Chinese authorities are acutely aware that environmental pressures can overflow into social unrest. The recent protest in Haining due to the pollution from a solar panel factory, the furious public reaction over Conoco Phillips&apos; slow response to the oil spillage in China&apos;s Bohai Sea, and the escalating demands for more transparency of air quality data in Beijing are recent examples of rising public sensitivity towards environmental issues. China is also increasingly conscious that its ability to deal with escalating environmental concerns through traditional command and control measures is becoming increasingly inadequate. China&apos;s economy has become too sophisticated to be managed in a traditional style. In 2010, to meet the energy efficiency targets set out in the 11th five-year plan (FYP), old and inefficient factories were ordered to close. Nevertheless the target was narrowly missed. China has realised that alongside command and control measures, attitudes need to be changed fundamentally to embrace innovation and sustainability. This has caused China, through the adoption of the 12th five-year plan, to pursue a more sustainable economic model, focusing on qualitative economic and social development. The newly adopted plan runs till 2015 and includes prominent energy efficiency and carbon intensity targets. Touted as the greenest FYP ever, it introduces emission trading as one of the innovative new policy tools to be tested. China has already announced pilot projects to be implemented in five municipal areas \u2013 Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin \u2013 and two provinces \u2013 Guangdong and Hubei \u2013 from 2013. The location for these seven projects has been well thought out. Each has been selected carefully to reflect the different levels of economic development and wealth of the country. They will allow China to test various emissions trading models, allowing for experience to be gathered on a municipal and provincial level before any such scheme is implemented on the national level in 2016. China is drawing on lessons learned from the existing emissions trading schemes around the world. The EU has a wealth of experience in pricing carbon, it&apos;s emissions trading scheme \u2013 the largest in the world \u2013 provides valuable insight into how to, and arguably, how not to, set about implementing an emissions trading scheme. But the Chinese are not only looking to the EU, they are rightly learning from other countries and regions including Australia, New Zealand and California. As details steadily emerge it is clear that they have embraced the need to set absolute caps on emissions and that there are likely to be parallel markets established for upstream, direct emitters and downstream users of energy. China is advancing rapidly. Many challenges remain but the speed of advancement and the ambition of it&apos;s emissions trading plans are remarkable. Europe needs to realise that its position as the world leader in carbon pricing will not remain so for long particularly if it fails to act to revive its own ailing scheme. \u2022 Rob Elsworth is policy officer at the Sandbag climate campaign", "tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Emissions trading", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon offsetting", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Sustainable development", "The future of development", "Social protection"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-24T11:18:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/apr/25/chelsea-selection-champions-league-final", "sentences": ["The Ivorian is expected to move to Shanghai Shenhua in the summer."], "title": "Injury and suspension give Roberto Di Matteo Champions League headache | Dominic Fifield", "article": "Roberto Di Matteo strode calmly through Gatwick airport&apos;s south terminal in the small hours of Wednesday whistling to himself and giving the impression he was without a care in the world, though Chelsea&apos;s interim coach will already be contemplating his selection options for the weeks ahead. The west Londoners have four Premier League games, an FA Cup final and a Champions League showpiece to contemplate within the next month with injuries and suspensions finally starting to take a toll on the squad. A quartet of players will be banned for the final in Munich, with this an initial impression of his selection possibilities for the Allianz Arena. Goalkeeper Petr CechThe Czech has been outstanding in recent weeks, with Chelsea&apos;s assault on three fronts bringing the best out of the veteran. Defenders Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa, Gary Cahill, David Luiz, Ashley ColeThe suspension of Branislav Ivanovic and John Terry for the final represents a considerable blow, prolonging the captain&apos;s frustration in this competition in particular. Indeed, it is at centre-half where Chelsea feel most vulnerable at present. Luiz was able to jog around the pitch at Camp Nou in training on Monday night, but is clearly not quite ready to return from the hamstring injury sustained while chasing Emmanuel Adebayor at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Di Matteo will hope the Brazilian will be fit enough to feature in the weeks ahead \u2013 the schedule is conjuring significant games virtually every three days \u2013 though he must also anxiously await scans on Cahill&apos;s similar injury, sustained early at Barcelona. The former Bolton defender will be desperate to feature. There will be issues on Sunday against Queens Park Rangers, when Ivanovic also serves the final game of his three-match suspension, with the likes of Paulo Ferreira, Bosingwa, Oriol Romeu \u2013 who has played that role previously with Barcelona \u2013 John Mikel Obi, Michael Essien or even Sam Hutchinson potential stand-ins alongside Terry in the middle if required. In Munich, depending upon fitness, they should at least be able to partner together two regular centre-halves. At full-back, even in Ivanovic&apos;s absence, there is greater depth, particularly since the emergence of Ryan Bertrand as a viable back-up to Cole. Deeper lying midfielders Frank Lampard, John Mikel ObiRaul Meireles can expect regular domestic games given his unavailability in Munich, allowing Di Matteo potentially to rest others with the European Cup final in mind. Essien and Romeu are also fit and available to stand in, with Lampard and Mikel Obi now feeling established as this team&apos;s first-choice deep-lying pairing. Attacking midfielders Salomon Kalou, Juan Mata, Florent MaloudaWhile Terry&apos;s absence will be keenly felt at the back, it is Ramires who could be missed most of all. The Brazilian offers this side so much industry and tireless energy \u2013 his burst up-field and wonderful lobbed finish at Camp Nou was an indication of his quality \u2013 with the midfielder arguably the club&apos;s player of the season. It seems cruel that, after his efforts, he will be missing in Munich. Without him, Di Matteo may turn to Kalou&apos;s more slippery qualities and predatory abilities in the six-yard box \u2013 as he did at Benfica \u2013 and rely upon Malouda&apos;s bustling presence for a one-off occasion. It might end up as his last appearance for this club, but the experienced France international has the quality to make an impact when called upon. His chances have been limited this term; this could prove an unexpected if welcome opportunity before a potential summer move to the Middle East. Daniel Sturridge offers a goalscoring alternative from the bench. Striker Didier DrogbaFernando Torres had an impact at Camp Nou, but it was Drogba who made the real impression on the tie.

Sold in China tells you everything about the next. Recent output figures from China were greeted with concern after the country reported its lowest GDP growth for three years, although, at 8.1%, it&apos;s magnificent compared to the UK&apos;s double-dip recession. Still, there is much talk among economists about a &quot;hard landing&quot;, a &quot;property bubble&quot; and &quot;bankrupt banks&quot;. But there is one key fact to remember about the economy in China. It&apos;s that the minimum wage is going up 15% a year, every year, for the next five years. Take a billion workers and give them a 100% pay rise. It changes everything. Within a generation, China is likely to displace the US as the biggest consumer market in the world. At Tianjin Port, the world&apos;s fifth biggest, container ships used to export Chinese goods to the rest of the world but come back empty. Now they return with the finished and semi-finished goods from the rest of the world to satisfy a ravenous consumer appetite. In Tianjin&apos;s vast factory zone, (across the road from a Foxconn plant making the next wave of Apple iPhones), the Master Kong factory makes more pot noodles than anywhere else in the world. The huge automated production lines, with machine tools imported from Japan and Germany, churn out five billion noodle packets a year \u2013 enough to reach to the moon and back. All the raw materials come from China, all of the finished product is consumed in China. It&apos;s just one of 23 Master Kong plants on the mainland. Further south in the &quot;groundscraper&quot; (and weirdly Hogwarts-esque) Shanghai offices of Ping An, China&apos;s second biggest insurer, 12,000 commission-led telesales agents make one million sales calls every day. It is the largest telemarketing operation on the planet, feeding on the explosive growth of domestic car sales. Last year 14.5m cars were sold in China \u2013 or 2m more than in the US, previously the world&apos;s biggest auto market. Nine in 10 were to people who had never bought a car before. Ping An now insures 32m private cars, raking in premiums of \u00a32.2bn (22.3bn renminbi) a year. Four years ago, that revenue was below \u00a3100m. As the Beijing auto show opened (it has replaced Detroit as the barometer of the industry), Ford said it was pressing ahead with its fifth giant factory in the country, and Volkswagen its seventh. Industry experts say sales will rise to 40m a year by 2020 \u2013 or 20 times the size of the UK market. In a country where air quality is staggeringly bad, the environmental consequences are terrifying. So is the outlook for the price of petrol, which sells in China for about half the price in Britain. If the country reaches US levels of car ownership, China alone will need to import more oil than is currently produced from every well in the world. It doesn&apos;t appear to concern the 4S showroom in Beijing, the biggest BMW dealership in Asia. Sales of luxury cars were up 30% in the first quarter of this year, and after signing a deal to distribute Range Rovers, they are selling every (Merseyside-made) Evoque they can get their hands on. The waiting list stretches for months. China&apos;s industrial revolution has created hundreds of thousands of dollar millionaires, and more than 400 billionaires, second only to the US. That translates into extraordinary sales of luxury goods, although much of that is in Hong Kong as wealthy consumers skirt import tariffs that make prices in Shanghai 40% higher than abroad. The vulgar display of new wealth is beginning to worry the communist (in name) leaders. Income inequality is among the world&apos;s worst. Median wages for rural workers were, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, just \u00a3608 last year, and \u00a31,877 for workers in the cities. Yet Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Bottega Veneta stores dominate shopping malls. Last year authorities banned the use of the word &quot;luxury&quot; in advertisements, but to little effect. Sales surged, with revenue at Burberry shops up 30% in 2011. The millions of migrant workers flooding into the cities, their only possessions stuffed into a battered suitcase, are greeted by the sight of a \u00a33,000 monogrammed Louis Vuitton bag in a shop window. Discontent is rising: in Guangdong, a coastal industrial province where, on paper, earnings are among the highest in China, riots in June last year continued for three days. Clashes erupted over unpaid wages, but behind the violence lies the fact that a huge underclass has gained little from the new China they built, mostly with their own hands. At the Master Kong factory in Tianjin production line workers, we are told, earn \u00a3300 a month. But they have to work six days a week, receive just one week&apos;s holiday a year, and sleep in a factory-controlled dorm. And this is one of the plants where management is happy to receive foreign visitors (but we were banned from taking photographs). In Shanghai, the glitziest and richest city in China, with 23 million residents, factory workers rarely take home more than \u00a3200 a month. Worried Chinese leaders have put spreading the country&apos;s wealth at the heart of the latest &quot;five-year plan&quot;. It&apos;s this that mandates the coming 15% a year increase in the minimum wage, although how much of that will be eaten by price inflation is a moot point. Westerners who mock the concept of the five-year plans lamentably misunderstand China, says William Fung of Li &amp; Fung. It is a company virtually unknown in the west, but is the biggest supplier of clothes to Europe and America, with Walmart and Marks &amp; Spencer among its customers. &quot;You report the five-year plan in the west as a one-day wonder ... then people are surprised that growth is falling to 7.5%. But it&apos;s in the plan. All the time we are told that China is old and complex to understand. But it is the easiest country in the world to understand. &quot;They tell you what they are going to do. Every official knows the five-year plan. The plan calls for slower growth, but a 15% per annum increase in domestic consumption. All the evidence is there that we are going to grow consumption,&quot; says Fung. His company, whose clothing and toy exports are so vast it is regarded as the bellwether of the global economy, will continue selling huge quantities overseas, but sees the home consumer as perhaps its greatest opportunity. Just off outer ring road five in Beijing, a mundane average-income district, the Wu Mart hypermarket is perhaps an early indicator of how domestic consumption will grow. The store bears more resemblance to a Lidl than a Tesco but, unlike the oddly deserted luxury shops in the city centre, it is teeming. It&apos;s instantly apparent that mid-range western brands are phenomenally popular with middle-income Chinese consumers. Shelf after shelf stocks the likes of Colgate toothpaste, Nivea, Quaker Oats and Snickers bars. Whole aisles are devoted to disposable nappies. China&apos;s one-child policy, rigorously enforced, means that spending on a sole child is proportionately huge. Hong Kong babies use 50% more diapers than those in the west, and mainland China is heading the same way. Want to invest in China? Maybe buy Procter &amp; Gamble (Pampers) or Kimberly-Clark (Huggies) instead. Back in Shanghai we meet Ji Qi, another entrepreneurial billionaire. He opened an Ibis-style budget hotel in 2002, called Home Inns, for the country&apos;s emerging business and leisure market, and built it to a chain of more than 1,000. After a bust-up with his co-founder he&apos;s set up Hanting Inns, has 639 hotels, and is opening a 140-bed inn every two days. Room rates range from \u00a310 to \u00a340 a night. He confidently expects Hanting to overtake Accor (Ibis, Mercure, Novotel and Sofitel) this year, and become, perhaps, the world&apos;s biggest hotel chain by 2020. He is the epitome of the ambition, drive and vision in China that is in such stark contrast to the miserable business outlook in Britain. But do investors who buy the China story ever actually make any money? One of the remarkable facts is that its stock markets (the big exchanges are in Shanghai and Shenzhen) are a great way of turning a large fortune into a small one. Over the past five years the benchmark Shanghai Composite index has fallen by 41.4%. The Shenzhen market has been falling since mid-2010. For British investors, the average China unit trust has lost 17% over the past year. Critics warn that many Chinese companies regard equity investment by westerners as an interest-free loan never to be repaid. Tellingly, few of the rich put their own cash into the stock market \u2013 expanding their businesses, and investing in property (no matter how super-charged prices appear) is what they see as the future.

The analyst from Lombard Street Research says last week&apos;s China GDP figures \u2013 which revealed growth slowing to a three-year low \u2013 are an early warning signal of the hard landing to come. Dig deep into the data, she says, and you&apos;ll find that Chinese exports are falling. All that is propping up the economy is gargantuan investment in infrastructure financed by state- directed banks that look more and more like Western banks just before the collapse of 2008. Except they are bigger and badder. Choyleva radiates a pessimism that is almost unique among Hong Kong&apos;s investment professionals. Westerners, she says, are so awed by the China dream they can&apos;t see the coming China-geddon. The excesses that drove the West into a financial crisis and, in Europe, an economic depression, are gripping the Chinese economy, too. &quot;It&apos;s just that they have become bigger,&quot; she says. The country&apos;s vast pool of savings is being squandered on dead-end infrastructure projects that make Japan&apos;s roads to nowhere look like prudent planning. &quot;China&apos;s miracle growth is over,&quot; she proclaims, saying that if Chinese policy makers get it right they might, just, see the country&apos;s growth halve to 5% or below. Get it wrong, and the consequences could be devastating not just for China but for the rest of the world, too. &quot;Building those roads to nowhere can go on for a long time, but ultimately financing it will become unbearable,&quot; warns Choyleva. As long as US and European consumers were accumulating colossal amounts of debt, much of it to pay for goods made in China, the merry-go-round worked just fine. But as western economies deleverage, the driver for growth has been extinguished. &quot;The financial crisis has changed everything,&quot; she says. &quot;It can no longer rely on abroad to buy its excess production. The US will consume less, and produce more. The years of current account surpluses are over, rendering the growth model obsolete.&quot; Meanwhile, the banks that have been the lynchpin of growth are insolvent, and their mountain of bad loans will eventually lead to a liquidity crisis. But Choyleva&apos;s is a lone voice. At brokerage CLSA, one of the region&apos;s biggest investment banks, China macro strategist Andy Rothman, a former US diplomat, says the wall of worry comes from a fundamental misunderstanding. The first myth to explode, he says, is that it is an export economy. It&apos;s not. It assembles the likes of iPads (they are all made in China), but the value remains, mostly, in the US. Even Korean firms make more money from the iPad than China. Over the last decade, while it has enjoyed GDP growth of 10% per annum, only 1% of that was from exports. What we haven&apos;t woken up to is that China is a domestic growth story. It&apos;s not an unbalanced export-only economy \u2013 instead, it&apos;s the world&apos;s best domestic consumption story, claims Rothman. It is being driven by &quot;phenomenal&quot; increases in wages for average workers; incomes are up 173% over the past 11 years. That also puts the so-called property bubble into perspective. The price per-square-foot of an apartment in a major Chinese city has leaped by nearly 10% a year, for many years. But as incomes are rising even faster \u2013 by around 13% a year \u2013 it&apos;s not the issue it became in the west. Better still, it&apos;s not on the never-never. Mortgages are still in their infancy in China. One in five first-time buyers purchase entirely with cash. The average downpayment is 30% \u2013 a long way from the 100% loans that became common in the US and the UK. &quot;Even if prices fall by a third, almost no one will actually be underwater,&quot; says Rothman.

In recent years, Chinese stocks have disappointed, with mainland shares falling in value heavily since 2010. But there&apos;s lots of different ways to participate - from buying China-focused investment trusts through to shares in the multinational corporations that will benefit from the rise of Chinese middle class spenders. Or maybe oil and commodities are the way to play China, as the country snaps up the world&apos;s resources. Here&apos;s where to start: Buying shares directly So-called &quot;A&quot; shares traded on the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges can only be bought by mainland Chinese citizens. Foreigners are allowed to buy &quot;H&quot; shares and &quot;red chips&quot;, which are private, or partially state-owned, companies incorporated on the mainland but listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Big names include China Mobile, Bank of China and PetroChina. You can buy most international shares through any ordinary stockbroking account in exactly the same way as those traded in London. But beware the usual risks: individual shares are hugely volatile, and when you buy in an overseas currency, you can lose twice over \u2013 from share price and currency movements. China stock market index trackers There&apos;s not much to choose from. There are just a few exchange traded funds (ETFs), which trade like shares but mirror the price of an index (and are free from stamp duty), such as the iShares Xinhua China 25. You can buy ETFs through a broker in the same way that you buy shares. A general emerging-markets index tracker may be a better bet. Both Vanguard and Legal &amp; General offer low-charge global emerging markets index funds (\u00a3500 minimum). Vanguard&apos;s fund is currently 17.5% invested in China. China unit trusts There are 31 funds in the China sector, according to Trustnet.com. Top performer over three years is GAM Star China Equity (up 81%) while the worst is HSBC China Equity (up 12%). Typical minimum investment is \u00a3500-\u00a31,000, or \u00a350 per month. Avoid high initial charges by buying through a discount broker, such as Hargreaves Lansdown. China investment trusts There are only two China-only investment trusts: Fidelity China Special Situations and JP Morgan Chinese. The Fidelity fund is much the biggest for UK investors. Fidelity is down 32% over the past year, while JP Morgan has fallen 21%. Investment trusts can be bought through stockbrokers or financial advisers. They generally have lower fees than unit trusts, but suffer from swings in their value (called the &quot;premium&quot; or &quot;discount&quot;) when the trust is either worth more than its underlying shares, or less. Global multinationals Funds such as Morgan Stanley Global Brands, Rathbone Global Opportunities and Fundsmith Equity have enjoyed strong performance by investing in global household names, but few have been able to withstand the drop in confidence resulting from the Euro crisis. Fundsmith Equity&apos;s big holdings include L&apos;Oreal, which has grabbed a 15% slice of the China cosmetics market. Oil and commodities As its roads are flooded with cars, is the oil price the way to play the Chinese economy? ETF Securities offers the ETFS Brent Crude index, but there are also more adventurous options, such as leveraged and futures trading, though this is probably best left to experts. Commodities sought by China \u2013 such as copper and iron ore \u2013 are another play on the growing demand. But last week investment bank Citigroup warned that the &quot;super cycle&quot; of commodity price rises \u2013 a basket of 24 raw materials has increased four-fold since 2001 \u2013 may be coming to an end as growth moderates and new sources of supply come forward. There are investment trusts specialising in metals and commodities, such as BlackRock World Mining. After a huge 122% gain in 2009, it fell 22% in 2011. Or you can buy shares in oil companies such as BP or Shell, although interestingly these tend not to correlate very closely with the oil price.

But in China, leasehold is everywhere; one of the last relics of the communist system is that all property remains in public hands. Proudhon would be proud. But in a room of potential British property investors, the gasps were audible. Er, what? Do you expect us to invest in a property company that doesn&apos;t actually own any freeholds? It turns out the Chinese government grants leases of only 40 years on commercial properties, and 70 years on residential homes. Some of the early leases granted soon after the &quot;open door&quot; to the west now have less than 20 years to run. After that, it all reverts to the Chinese state, the world&apos;s biggest freeholder. But our hosts were unfazed. The Party, they assure us, will at some point change the law and you&apos;ll be allowed to keep your property, maybe with a small extra tax. Given that one of our hosts is a senior apparatchik in the Chinese Communist party, we should probably take his word for it. It&apos;s the fact that he&apos;s also a managing director of Morgan Stanley, that most blue-blooded and waspish of Wall Street investment banks, that is perhaps more puzzling. \u2022 BXL is on everyone&apos;s lips. Or B.X.L. or B...X...L. It stands for Bo Xilai, and it&apos;s how Chinese people skirt the censors to talk and report news on Weibo, the Twitter-meets-Facebook app that dominates social media in China. Censorship has turned into a cat and mouse game: the colossal machinery of state repression that still exists in China has run up against the 300 million users of Weibo. The site is less than three years old and is probably the biggest and fastest-growing internet sensation in the world. Ultimately the state can simply switch Weibo off, so the company itself is as keen as the censors to keep BXL off the site. But a consequence of the one-child-only policy is that young Chinese are addicted to social media. When no one has a brother or sister, Weibo fills the gap. Switch Weibo off and you&apos;re guaranteed to provoke a riot \u2013 as the infuriated Chinese authorities are already keenly aware. \u2022 It&apos;s Yao Chen v Lady Gaga. In the English-speaking world, Lady Gaga has the most followers on Twitter, at 25 million. In the Chinese-speaking world, it&apos;s Yao Chen, with 16 million followers (on Weibo), but growing faster. The 32-year-old actress was first spotted by Chinese studio bosses in An Lian Tao Hua Yuan (Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land) and was, I guess, unmissable in Culinary School Story. Given China&apos;s population of 1.4 billion, she&apos;s probably the most famous person on the planet. Hu Jintao, China&apos;s president, is concerned that the country&apos;s social and cultural power doesn&apos;t match its economic might. Expect to hear more from the likes of Ms Chen. \u2022 In 25 years of financial journalism I have lunched two, possibly three, dollar billionaires (they never taste good). There are believed to be 33 in the UK and 115 in China, but my guess is that it&apos;s a lot higher. In Beijing and Shanghai I met four in four days. One even served me lunch, thankfully not spotting the noodle soup I spilt on her Bottega Veneta bag. Pan Wei started Ajisen, a Japanese-themed budget restaurant chain in Hong Kong 18 years ago. Now she has 670 restaurants, and like all the billionaires I met, still retains nearly 50% ownership of her company. The winner-takes-all capitalism that funnels the rewards of globalisation up to the 1% is as demented in China as it is in the west. But unlike Russia&apos;s billionaires, whose fortunes were pocketed largely through the theft of state assets, many of China&apos;s are entrepreneurial. Strikingly, they are also female. In Beijing I met Zhang Xin, a self-made billionairess \u2013 she started as a factory worker in a garment sweatshop in Hong Kong at the age of 15 \u2013 who is to China what Richard Branson is to Britain. You might wonder why these global billionaires were queuing up to dine with the editor of a personal finance section. They weren&apos;t. It had more to do with who sat next to them at lunch; not me, but Anthony Bolton, president, investments, of Fidelity International (the world&apos;s biggest investment management group), who invited us hacks to China. Like the rich everywhere, it&apos;s money they talk to, not the Money section. \u2022 In public, Chinese policymakers have put tackling corruption at the top of the agenda. In private, it remains endemic. Often the form it takes is called guanxi, which roughly translates as &quot;connections&quot; and &quot;relationships&quot;. I met one woman who owned a large factory in the interior. To obtain the required building permissions and grants, she pays for the daughter of the city&apos;s mayor to attend a private school in Australia. This form of petty corruption is, I&apos;m told, so widespread in the country it&apos;s barely seen as worth reporting on. \u2022 Is China a place where the west hides what it no longer wants closer to home? The road from Tianjin to its airport is unforgiving in its industrial desolation. A flat, grey, horrifically polluted landscape of giant factories. One of the biggest? With cruel irony, it&apos;s a Vestas plant, assembling wind turbines and blades that we in the west think will tackle climate change. Meanwhile, on the edge of Shanghai is the global centre of animal testing. The boss of Wuxi Pharma Tech almost gleefully tells us of the thousands of dogs and monkeys it slaughters in the name of drug research. All the major western pharmaceutical companies now outsource testing to Wuxi (&quot;We do it 50% cheaper than the UK!&quot; he exclaims), which probably wasn&apos;t the outcome protesters against Huntingdon Life Sciences had in mind. The boss laughs about protestors. &quot;If you do that here, I&apos;m putting you in jail right now.&quot; Patrick Collinson was a guest on a trip organised by Fidelity Investments.

She smiles, recalling the replies to requests for work experience at Formula One teams sent as a motorsport-obsessed teen. Well she might. Last year Gade became the first female race engineer to win the world&apos;s greatest sports car race, the Le Mans 24 Hours. She did so for the Audi Sport Factory team and this year she will race engineer one of the manufacturer&apos;s new hybrid cars at both the 24 and all of the World Endurance Championship (WEC), the second round of which takes place at Spa next Saturday. It is an extraordinary achievement in an industry dominated by men. From knockbacks as a teen Gade is now at 36 one of the most senior women at the sharp end of motor racing in the world. It is a fiercely competitive end, too. The Le Mans prototype cars she engineers are, in performance and complexity, closely equivalent to those of F1 and her role as race engineer is comparable to that of Christian Horner or Martin Whitmarsh. She is on the pit wall and calls the strategy, manages the drivers, the fuel and tyres, as well as monitoring all the technical information coming out of the car. Except, where in F1 this role lasts but an hour and a half, Gade runs the show for races that cover six, 12 and 24 hours. These are classic meetings, such as the six hours of Spa and Silverstone; the 12 Hours of Sebring (which hosted the opening round of the WEC in March where Audi took a one-two victory) and Le Mans. They are the pinnacles of long-distance endurance racing and it has been a long journey for Gade to reach them. Of Indian descent, she grew up in England but became interested in engineering when the family briefly returned to live in India. &quot;We used to pull stuff apart when we were kids,&quot; she says. &quot;When they would turn the electricity off, you couldn&apos;t have the fans and stuff on, so we would pull the radio apart and put it back together.&quot; The seed had been sown. She and sister Teena, also a succesful race engineer in rallying, took to motorsport in a big way on their return to England. &quot;We got into it properly through 1990 and 1991. We watched Senna win, watched Mansell do his thing in &apos;92. It was basically Murray Walker and James Hunt&apos;s commentary that got us hooked. Anyone watching F1 at that time would have been taken in by them,&quot; she says. But it was not the popular trappings of F1 that seduced the girls. &quot;The glamour was never there,&quot; she explains. &quot;It was purely what the machines could do. We thought: &apos;Well actually there must be something clever under there.&apos;&quot; From then on there was little time for anything else. &quot;It was obsessive, probably a bit like a religion,&quot; she says. &quot;We never missed a single race.&quot; A degree in aerospace engineering followed and the family were hugely supportive but her experience was instructive as to why there are so few women in the sport. &quot;I nearly quit in the first week of my degree because I went from a girls school to being in a class full of men,&quot; she says. &quot;I learned that I had to be one of the boys, I had to have the same level of banter, of crudeness, you had to mess around like they did purely to break down the barrier of them seeing you as a girl.&quot; There were only five girls among the 95 students on her course, and only two by the end. Gaining experience afterwards also proved difficult, one F3 team manager telling her: &quot;The thing is you&apos;re not going to make it as a mechanic if you&apos;re a girl.&quot; But she persevered, learning hands-on, often unpaid at races, and it worked. Time with Formula BMW, A1GP, GT racing and Le Mans with the Chamberlain Synergy team helped build her reputation, until she was offered the chance to join Audi in 2007. That year, alongside Howden Haynes, the team&apos;s No1 engineer, she helped take Britain&apos;s Allan McNish to the American Le Mans Series championship title. It was a vindication of all the hard work and convinced Gade that endurance racing was the future for her: &quot;A test of the people as much as the machines,&quot; she says. While she went on to become a head engineer in her own right, entering the sport remains as difficult as ever. &quot;I think it&apos;s tough to get into,&quot; she says. &quot;You have to have a personality to go through all of that.&quot; A steely determination was on display at Sebring, bringing her car home despite mechanical problems, but was perhaps most evident at Le Mans last year. After two sister Audis crashed out of the race \u2013 the second, for a short period of time as the race continued around it, for unknown reasons \u2013 Gade, in charge of the final car, was in the eye of the storm. Her role was one beyond making decisions; crucially she was presenting them. The whole team look to her and they do not see a woman, they see the boss. &quot;Those two hours in that race were tough,&quot; she recalls. &quot;You have to keep it together for the driver in the car who is thinking: &apos;Was it a failure? Is it going to happen to me?&apos;&apos;&apos; It was not and they went on to win. &quot;The next thing that went through my head was: &apos;I hope I&apos;m not a one-hit wonder,&apos;&quot; she admits. &quot;I&apos;ve got to go back and have another two or three wins and add a world championship title to our crew&apos;s name.&quot; WEC 2012 remaining races 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium: 5 May 24 Hours of Le Mans, France: 16-17 June 6 Hours of Silverstone, GB: 26 August 6 Hours of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil: 15 September 6 Hours of Bahrain: 29 September 6 Hours of Fuji, Japan: 14 October 6 Hours of Shanghai, China: 27 October", "tags": ["World Endurance Championship", "Le Mans Series", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-28T22:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/03/transfer-rumours-chelsea-david-luiz-barcelona", "sentences": ["The Shanghai Shenhua coach is desperate to reunite the glorious Liverpool team of 2002 and is planning swoops for Owen, Vladimir Smicer, Djimi Traor\u00e9, Abel Xavier and G\u00e9rard Houllier."], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Chelsea's David Luiz to Barcelona?", "article": "Having seen how well promoting the No2 has worked for Blackburn Rovers and Wolves, Barcelona followed their example last week by giving Pep Guardiola&apos;s job to Tito Vilanova.

For the dealers and the collectors it&apos;s too soon to tell \u2013 Frieze opens on Friday after a collectors&apos; preview on Thursday. But this is a far better fair than might have been expected the first time out, though compared with its old world cousin this is a safer affair, with little grit and lots of gloss. The best news: Amanda Sharp and Matthew Slotover made the right call by holding Frieze on Randall&apos;s Island, a park in the East river usually frequented only by little-league baseball players. New Yorkers had been sceptical \u2013 it is hard enough to get us to cross Manhattan, let alone take a ferry (or limousine) across the water. But on the island, Frieze has enough space for a sinuous white tent, designed by the young Brooklyn architectural duo SO-IL, which curves along the waterfront. The tent offers continuous vistas up and down the fair \u2013 handsomer than other events&apos; gridded chicken coops, though a bit intimidating as well. There are 180 galleries here, but nowhere to hide. The original Frieze art fair, for all its wealth, remains closer to its scruffy east London roots than the old-money fairs in Basel or Maastricht. But there&apos;s no mistaking that Frieze New York is all business, and provocations of the type London audiences have come to expect \u2013 wrecked booths, disruptive performances, installations that mock art market absurdities \u2013 are not in evidence. Maccarone, an often confrontational gallery, is showing a sculpture by the brothers Oscar Tuazon and Eli Hansen, incorporating a tree from an Alaskan island where they lived for weeks \u2013 but also a 12-metre abstract striped painting by Ann Craven, elegant but benign. Even Gavin Brown, a once reliably provocative Anglo-American dealer, has mounted a beautiful but extremely safe booth, focused on seven achingly delicate paintings by Laura Owens, all linked together by a wooden mesh. The biggest galleries have taken few chances. Need a monochrome Anish Kapoor disc to decorate your third home? Pick up a giant yellow one or a slightly smaller version in tasteful bronze \u2013 or else just wait until you and your 1% friends meet later this spring in Hong Kong or Basel, where you can try again. It&apos;s more rewarding to spend time in the single-artist installations by younger galleries, which Sharp and Slotover have placed smack in the centre of the fair. Among the lessons you&apos;ll learn: New York is over and all the cool American kids have moved to LA. At Redling Fine Art, Liz Glynn has made papier-mache replicas of gold jewellery from pawn shops across the City of Angels. Money comes and goes, she reminds us, and there&apos;s a market for everything. And there are strong showings from galleries outside the standard art circuit, from Rio to Beirut. Stevenson, an impressive South African gallery, has given its entire booth over to a sculpture by the Johannesburg-based Nicholas Hlobo: a riotous agglomeration of rubber, string and rainbow streamers covering two gallery walls and much of the floor. It looks like the detritus of a carnival or a mutant biological form that has vomited out the entire colour spectrum. This first Frieze New York also incorporates a non-commercial section of art commissioned by the fair organisers, and after the procession of art-as-asset-class booths these projects are even more welcome than usual. The most exciting is a reinstallation of a 1979 sculpture series by John Ahearn: painted wax casts of the heads of his friends, other artists and patients from a methadone clinic near his Bronx studio. Ahearn himself is here, producing new works on site: it&apos;ll cost you, but as so often in New York, the hard part is not spending the money but getting the appointment. Other works are scattered outside the tent. In the waterlogged grass near the entrance, with the Brooklyn-Queens expressway rumbling above, the Moroccan artist Latifa Echakhch has strewn dozens of tumbleweeds, the sort you might see roll through a one-horse town in some B-movie western. If they&apos;re meant to suggest that New York is more provincial than we natives realise, nobody told the Botoxed VIPs tearing through the preview with chequebook in hand. Frieze timed its arrival in New York to coincide with the massive sales at Christie&apos;s and Sotheby&apos;s, with its $120m sale of a version of Munch&apos;s The Scream \u2013 but this week has also seen the May Day resurgence of Occupy Wall Street, and outside the fair, protesting unions blared their horns so loudly that you could hear them throughout the tent. Even at this decidedly commercial affair, the voice of the 99% has slipped through. At Paris&apos;s Galerie Chantal Crousel, the New York collective Reena Spaulings has produced a series of monochrome paintings on pizza boxes, which turn out to have come from Zuccotti Park at the height of last autumn&apos;s anti-capitalist protests: fast food transubstantiated into high art, the demonstrators sneaking their way into the tent of their opponents. (Though for what it&apos;s worth, Frieze will be presenting two programmes this weekend on art&apos;s relationship to Occupy, including one entitled Art Isn&apos;t Fair: Collecting for the 99%.) And by the East river, amid a dozen sculptures soon to decorate the gardens of Aspen or East Hampton, the Swiss artist Christoph B\u00fcchel has placed a shopping trolley full of newspapers, plastic bags and other debris, all wrapped up in a blue tarpaulin and covered in duct tape. There was no text to indicate it was an artwork, and no mention of it in the official fair map. Nor did anyone pay much attention to a second B\u00fcchel, a collapsible upright trolley stuffed with rubbish, the sort you see pushed by older women far from the network of art fairs stretching from here to Shanghai.

Sources close to the Shanghai-based buyer, Bright Food, said China&apos;s second biggest food company had its sights set on taking over a string of household names. &quot;They won&apos;t stop here,&quot; one source said. &quot;I&apos;d be very surprised if this was the last British brand they take over.&quot; One City analyst suggested the cereal deal underlined the &quot;global power shift from the west to the east&quot;. Bright Food has already splashed out on a 75% stake in Australia&apos;s Manassen Food for more than $500m and a 51% stake in New Zealand dairy producer Synlait. Last year it offered more than \u00a31.2bn for United Biscuits, the name behind British snacks such as Hula Hoops, Twiglets and Jaffa Cakes. It has also attempted to take over French yoghurt group Yoplait and been linked with Campbell&apos;s Soups and Premier Foods, the company behind Mr Kipling cakes, Bisto gravy and Loyd Grossman sauces. Jones, who admitted to eating Weetabix for breakfast every other day \u2013 alternating with porridge \u2013 said he had &quot;no problem&quot; with China gobbling up great British brands, but just wished that they would be &quot;similarly open to British investment in China&quot;. Bright Foods&apos; chairman, Zongnan Wang, who sealed the deal with a couple of celebratory Weetabix, said in a statement that he was &quot;excited&quot; about bringing the 80-year-old wheat biscuits to breakfast tables across China and Asia, where western eating habits are slowly catching on as wealthier citizens begin to shun traditional rice and steamed bread. Despite Weetabix being derided by a head chef at the Savoy as &quot;cakes that you give to dogs&quot;, Weetabix&apos;s chief executive, Giles Turrell, said he believed there were &quot;substantial opportunities to further grow the business internationally, in North America, Asia and beyond&quot;. Industry experts warned that Weetabix may find breaking into the Chinese market difficult because of high levels of lactose intolerance among the population. However, Marcia Mogelonsky, an expert on food and drink at the market researcher Mintel, said there was &quot;huge growth potential&quot; for breakfast cereals in China, where just $665m was spent on them last year, compared with $2.3bn in the UK. Mogelonsky said Bright Foods, which makes a huge range of products including canned meats, alcohol and sweets and even runs a taxi firm in Shanghai, had an &quot;endless pot of money&quot; to fund other takeovers. But she expected the company to be selective over which brands it poaches next. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be like Supermarket Sweep with them stripping the shelves of everything in a hurry.&quot; She said Weetabix would give the Chinese a &quot;toehold in the UK, which will open up western Europe, which will in turn open up eastern Europe and then the world,&quot; she said. &quot;There&apos;s a whole bunch more out there they can go after.&quot; Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said the acquisition of 60% of Weetabix was &quot;just one example&quot; of the &quot;global power shift from the west to the east. It&apos;s similar to how the bourgeoisie took over from the aristocracy 200 years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;Asia and Latin America have got capital but lack experience and gravitas of brands \u2013 that new money is looking for old wealth. I think we&apos;re going to see a lot more of it as the old world continues to get poorer and the new gets richer.&quot; Weetabix, which also makes Alpen and Ready brek, left British control nine years ago when Sir Richard George, whose family had run it since before the second world war, sold the family firm to the flamboyant venture capitalist Lyndon Lea for \u00a3642m. Lea, the 41-year-old son of a Lancashire hairdresser and engineer who is known for hosting parties featuring Cirque de Soleil dancers and sushi served off the bodies of near-naked women at his Californian beach house, was blas\u00e9 about the fivefold return his private equity firm made on the deal. &quot;It&apos;s been a good return for us,&quot; he said. Lea&apos;s Lion Capital firm will retain a 40% stake in the company. Bright Foods has committed itself to safeguarding production at the Weetabix factories in Burton Latimer and Corby, Northamptonshire, where 2,000 workers are employed. The deal came on the same day as a Chinese retailer sealed the acquisition of Gieves &amp; Hawkes from a Hong Kong company, which bought the Savile Row tailor from its British shareholders in 2002 for about \u00a310m.

In 2010, the Chinese retail dairy market totalled \u00a323bn, and it is expected to grow by 80% by 2016. China can&apos;t produce enough milk to keep up with demand, and imports of dairy products have more than doubled in the past five years, even though milk is not traditionally part of Chinese diets. Though chocolate barely existed in China 20 years ago, in 2011 the total market was worth \u00a34.7bn, and is rising by 20% each year. Shopping habits are shifting, too.

Spurs manager &apos;Arry Redknapp has denied that the club will sell Gareth Bale to Manchester City. &quot;If we go backwards we&apos;re going nowhere basically are we?&quot; he said, in a message that will confound orienteers and grammar fans alike. Shanghai Shenhua boss Zhu Jun has hastily denied that he is hoping to make L&apos;il Mickey Owen a &quot;marquee signing&quot; for the club. &quot;Who&apos;s making such irresponsible statements?&quot; Jun said, resisting the urge to point out Owen would be more of a one man pup tent acquisition these days. Nasty Leeds have signed Portsmouth defender Jason Pearce and not the Spiritualized frontman Jason Pierce, as some Fiver writers mistakenly thought earlier today. Fabio Capello has warned Premier League clubs he&apos;s looking for a last hurrah, potentially in England. &quot;I know very well the teams and the players,&quot; he said, in a statement which will come as news to both the teams and the players. And ex-Fiorentina coach Delio Rossi has revealed what a fantastic father he is while apologising for thumping Adem Ljajic. &quot;My gesture was ugly, disgraceful and I am very saddened,&quot; he parped. &quot;I have never said that I am a saint but you can ask the children and all the players that I have coached in the past what type of person I am.

After China&apos;s state-owned Bright Food bought Weetabix on Thursday, on Friday another Chinese group was linked with the potential purchase of Horizon Nuclear Power. Horizon had been planning to invest more than \u00a310bn in new atomic plants in Gloucestershire and north Wales. State-owned China Guangdong Nuclear Power is said to be working on developing a consortium with Toshiba of Japan, through that company&apos;s subsidiary Westinghouse, the nuclear engineering business, to bid for Horizon. Another Chinese group, the State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation, is also linked to the Westinghouse consortium, according to the Financial Times. &quot;China is an obvious potential buyer,&quot; one British nuclear industry executive told the Guardian. &quot;It has deep pockets and the ambition to make something like this work.&quot; China plans to construct a huge number of new nuclear plants on its own territory, to replace some of its old and heavily polluting coal plants. The state-owned Chinese companies are flush with cash and the government has been keen to invest in a wide group of markets while prices are depressed and long-term returns look steady. The speculation follows indications that a Russian state nuclear company might be interested in Horizon. It will ring alarm bells in Whitehall about the wisdom of selling off strategic energy assets to nations considered to mix commercial and political ambitions overseas. George Osborne, the chancellor, has been keen to attract Chinese investment in infrastructure projects, while Shanghai-based Bright Food agreed to pay \u00a3720m for a 60% stake in Weetabix and is thought to be eyeing other food operations, such as Premier Foods, the makers of Mr Kipling cakes, and Loyd Grossman sauces. China Guangdong Nuclear Power recently took over London-based uranium miner Kalahari Minerals, while PetroChina invested last year in the huge Scottish oil refinery complex at Grangemouth. The Horizon holding is being disposed of by German utilities E.ON and RWE npower which have been discouraged from going ahead with new plants at Oldbury-on-Severn and Wylfa because of the rising cost of building nuclear in Britain at a time when their home country has decided to phase out atomic plants in reaction to the Fukushima disaster. The vendors have signed up the London-based arm of Japanese finance house Nomura to find a buyer as quickly as possible in the hope that Horizon can stick to its target of building new reactors by 2020. The decision by E.ON and RWE in March to pull out of Horizon was a blow to the British government which is keen to ensure a new generation of power plants can take over from ones nearing the end of their lives. Last week GDF Suez, a French company, warned ministers that it needed better incentives if it was going to proceed with plans to build a new reactor at Sellafield in Cumbria. An exit by GDF and Horizon would risk leaving EDF, the largely French state-owned power group, as the only one committed to new plants. EDF&apos;s British partner, Centrica, is considering its options over nuclear while the French group itself could be driven off course by an expected change of president in its home country. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the socialist candidate and likely winner of this weekend&apos;s elections for the Elys\u00e9e Palace, is committed to a dramatic contraction of the country&apos;s nuclear industry which could land EDF with a costly decommissioning and closure bill. The government and the power companies are in crucial talks to decide the price at which they can sell electricity from non-fossil fuel sources. Once a level has been agreed, the companies are guaranteed a subsidy from the Government if energy prices slump. However, if prices soar and they make big profits, they must pay back the difference. In either case, power companies need the certainty of regular revenue to make the initial investment.", "tags": ["Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment", "Energy industry", "Business", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-04T17:11:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/writing-britain-blake-morrison", "sentences": ["But living in Shepperton (just off the M3) was as much a spur to his imagination as growing up in Shanghai."], "title": "Writing Britain: the nation and the landscape", "article": "Can Britlit be said to exist? Britart is an accepted term, and Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Gillian Wearing et al were happy to be known as YBAs, if only for the publicity it brought them. But YBWs? Or OBWs? Or even M-ABWs? They&apos;re harder to imagine. Writers living in northern and western parts of our archipelago identify themselves as Scottish or Welsh (or Cornish), not British. The term is also unacceptable to Catholics in or from Northern Ireland: &quot;British, no, the name&apos;s not right,&quot; Seamus Heaney politely demurred, when Andrew Motion and I included him in The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry 30 years ago. Most English writers, meanwhile, use the word British at best half-heartedly: it sounds inclusive \u2013 free of master-race arrogance, antagonism towards Celts or National Front jingoism \u2013 but it doesn&apos;t describe what we think we are or where we come from. Britishness, in short, is a troublesome concept. But for a couple of weeks this summer, any troubles will be packed up in a red, white and blue kit bag as athletes from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland smilingly compete under a common flag. Alongside the events in the sporting arena, there&apos;ll also be the Cultural Olympiad, with a range of plays, concerts, exhibitions and readings. Until 1948, cultural olympiads used to be competitive, with poets, musicians, artists and architects vying for gold (in that year Finland topped the medals table). Nowadays the emphasis is on global togetherness. Still, attention inevitably focuses on the host nation&apos;s artistic achievement. For the next few months we&apos;re under the spotlight. What do we amount to? And what makes our culture quintessentially British? If the Hockney and Hirst exhibitions are the British art world&apos;s contribution to 2012, in literature it&apos;s the exhibition being mounted at the British Library. Writing Britain: Wastelands to Wonderlands will display 150 works spanning 1,000 years \u2013 books, manuscripts, letters, sound recordings, videos, photos, maps, drawings. The exhibition doesn&apos;t pretend to be linear or completist \u2013 150 items in a single room cannot allow for a comprehensive history of our literature. But the hope is that the show will allow visitors &quot;to read between the lines of great works of English literature, discovering the secrets and stories surrounding the works&apos; creation&quot;. There&apos;s already a little slippage there, with &quot;English literature&quot; used as a synonym for writing from Britain. But the curators, headed by Jamie Andrews, are pretty relaxed about this. National boundaries and ethnic origins aren&apos;t the point. There&apos;s room for Yeats, Joyce and Heaney here, as well as for Conrad, Verne, Poe and TS\u00a0Eliot. The focus is on writing in English from or about these islands that evokes a sense of place: the literature of landscape. By putting writers from different eras in surprising conjunction, the exhibition highlights some revealing continuities in how our islands have been portrayed. When politicians come up with quotes that effuse patriotic sentiment, they invariably cut them short, so as to lose the sting in the tail. The dying John O&apos;Gaunt in Shakespeare&apos;s Richard II is one of their favourites: This royal throne of kings, this scepter&apos;d isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, This other Eden, demi-paradise, This fortress built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war,This happy breed of men, this little world, This precious stone set in the silver sea, Which serves it in the office of a wall, Or as a moat defensive to a house, Against the envy of less happier lands,This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England \u2026 Stirring stuff. But what Gaunt goes on to say is often forgotten \u2013 that this glorious England &quot;is now leas&apos;d out \u2026 like to a tenement or pelting farm&quot; and &quot;bound in with shame, / with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds&quot;. In Dickens&apos;s Our Mutual Friend, xenophobic triumphalism is similarly undermined through the figure of Podsnap. &quot;No Other Country is so Favoured as This Country,&quot; he boasts to a Frenchman. &quot;This Island was Blest, Sir, to the Direct Exclusion of such Other Countries as \u2013 as there may happen to be.&quot; Podsnap is an absurd figure, whose blindness to the failings of his country affords Dickens a lot of fun. Angela Carter hankered &quot;to live in a place that does not now, nor ever has had, the consciousness that it has been singled out for a special fate&quot;. But she was right to suspect that such a place doesn&apos;t exist. Every country has its myth of exceptionalism, and national character is one way of locating it. Podsnap talks of &quot;a modesty, an independence, a responsibility, a repose&quot;, Orwell of &quot;decency&quot;, others of civility and fair play. Others again mention our gentle, stoic defeatedness: &quot;Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way,&quot; as Larkin might have put it if Pink Floyd hadn&apos;t got there first. But the British can also be bellicose \u2013 John Bullish \u2013 and other far from flattering qualities have been assigned to the national character (&quot;a gluttonous race \u2026 lumbering about in pot-bellied equanimity&quot;, said Carlyle). We&apos;re one thing but also the opposite. Uncertainty about what it means to be British is part of what Britishness means. On the face of it, landscape is a less contentious means of definition, since our islands have distinct and indisputable features. But as well as large differences in climate and geography, there are politico-economic divisions too: Hull and Halifax have no more in common with the Highlands than they do with the Home Counties. When, in 1938, Orwell returned from Spain to the south of England (&quot;probably the sleekest landscape in the world&quot;), he was both moved by and contemptuous of the prettiness: &quot;The industrial towns were far away, a smudge of smoke and misery hidden by the curve of the earth&apos;s surface. Down here it was still the England I had known in my childhood: the railway cuttings smothered in wild flowers, the deep meadows where great shining horses browse and meditate, the slow-moving streams bordered by willows, the green bosoms of the elms, the larkspurs in the cottage gardens.&quot; Only bombs could shatter &quot;the deep, deep sleep of England&quot;, he thought, and shortly afterwards they did. Orwell tries to resist the English pastoral idyll because he thinks it unfair to the rest of the country. John Clare feels no such awkwardness, only delight: &quot;I love to peep out on a summer&apos;s morn / Just as the scouting rabbit seeks her shed&quot;. Edward Thomas delights in pastoralism too: when his express train pulls up at Adlestrop, he sees willows, willowherb and grass, and hears all the birds of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire sing \u2013 a transcendent moment before the train moves on. &quot;Lovely the woods, waters, meadows, combes, vales, / All the air things wear that build this world of Wales,&quot; sings Gerard Manley Hopkins, whose poems in praise of the &quot;sweet especial rural scene&quot; urge us to enjoy it while we can:\u00a0&quot;Have, get, before it cloy, / Before it cloud&quot;. The British invariably perceive the countryside as being under threat, whether from bombs, developers, tourism, climate change or the passage of time. This makes our literature nostalgic \u2013 a land of lost content. There are legends of Arcadian plenitude \u2013 of Albion, Mercia, Elmet; of life under the greenwood tree, or in the highlands before the clearances, or in green valleys before the coming of industry; of shepherds piping to their flocks and milkmaids dancing in the dew; of Sir Gawain, King Arthur, John Barleycorn, Robin Hood, Rob Roy and (from the Welsh Mabinogion) Math, son of Mathonwy, who liked to rest his feet in the lap of a virgin. The gods of the earth seem to be extinct but then pop up again, rudely healthy and full of folk wisdom. Edward Thomas meets one such man at hawthorn time in Wiltshire and is told his many different names: The man you saw \u2013 Lob-lie-by-the- fire, Jack Cade,Jack Smith, Jack Moon, poor Jack of every trade,Young Jack, or old Jack, or Jack What-d&apos;ye-call,Jack-in-the-hedge, or Robin-run-by- the-wall,Robin Hood, Ragged Robin, lazy Bob,One of the lords of No Man&apos;s Land, good Lob, \u2013Although he was seen dying at Waterloo,Hastings, Agincourt, and Sedgemoor too,Lives yet. He never will admit he is dead. He still won&apos;t admit it: in his latest incarnation he appears as the charismatic Johnny (Rooster) Byron in Jez Butterworth&apos;s play Jerusalem. The question for William Blake was whether Jerusalem could be built among dark satanic mills. The challenge for Rooster is how to stop the local council removing his caravan from its sylvan shade. Rural dwellers are always up against it, and so are rural writers, who by setting their work in the countryside are suspected of being out of touch with the realities of modern life. Books set on farms face a particularly stern test: anyone who has read Stella Gibbons&apos;s Cold Comfort Farm may feel a giggle coming on. But Ted Hughes&apos;s Moortown Diary contains some of his best work. And Nell Leyshon&apos;s forthcoming novel, The Colour of Milk, narrated by a farmer&apos;s daughter in the 19th century, shows there&apos;s life in the genre still. One landscape all four British nations have in common (as landlocked nations don&apos;t) is the seaside. Writing Britain gives it a fair showing, with Jane Austen, Matthew Arnold, Alan Bennett, John Fowles, Graham Greene, Ian McEwan and Daljit Nagra (Look We Have Coming to Dover!). Rivers meander through as well \u2013 George Eliot&apos;s Floss, Alice Oswald&apos;s Dart, everybody&apos;s Thames \u2013 and in the mountains there are glimpses of the Romantic sublime. But the literature of towns and cities looms largest, which reflects where the majority of the population has lived for the last two centuries. Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, Arnold Bennett, DH Lawrence, Alan Sillitoe: this is gritlit as much as it is Britlit, the blackened faces of miners, chimney sweeps and factory hands stirring writers, by the fireside, to complain on their behalf. Homogenisation and ugliness in town planning \u2013 the urban equivalent of the rape of the countryside \u2013 are another source of complaint. &quot;The jail might have been the infirmary, the infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been either, or both, or anything else&quot;, Dickens writes of Coketown, and a century later Keith Waterhouse&apos;s Billy Liar is similarly dismayed by Stradhoughton, which is &quot;exactly like any other High Street in Great Britain. Woolworth&apos;s looked like Woolworth&apos;s, the Odeon looked like the Odeon, and the Stradhoughton Echo&apos;s [office] looked like a public lavatory in honest native white tile.&quot; Dismayed by the ugly advance of industry and the money-grubbing masses, Birkin, in Lawrence&apos;s The Rainbow, dreams of living &quot;in the chinks&quot;. The chinks are always there, waiting to be discovered, and one likeable and perhaps defining aspect of Britishness is a capacity to find poetry in unlikely places. The Auden generation of the 1930s found it in pylons, the Northern Irish poet Derek Mahon found it in a disused shed in Co Wexford, and his predecessor Patrick Kavanagh found it, variously, in the green waters of a canal, &quot;the functional ward / Of a chest hospital&quot; and &quot;the inexhaustible adventure of a gravelled yard&quot;. Thomas Gray got there before all of them with his elegy in a country churchyard, which speaks from an out-of-the-way spot in praise of overlooked lives. The out-of-the-way and overlooked are the subject of Paul Farley and Michael Symmons Roberts&apos;s book of last year, Edgelands, which escapes &quot;the duality of rural and urban landscape writing, to explore [the] unobserved parts of our shaped landscape&quot; \u2013 by which they mean (among other things) landfill sites, container yards, sewage works, power stations and radio masts. The notion of edgelands has left its mark on the British Library exhibition. So have the journeys, on foot, that Iain Sinclair, Robert Macfarlane and Will Self (among others) have undertaken to places where people aren&apos;t expected to walk \u2013 in Sinclair&apos;s case, for his book London Orbital, round the M25. The French situationist Guy Debord is said to be the father of psychogeography, but the BL exhibits put the art of walking in a context that&apos;s earlier and closer to home, one that stretches from John Gay and William Blake to Virginia Woolf, whose little-known book Street Haunting describes an ambling journey through London undertaken on the flimsy pretext of buying a pencil. Woolf would probably have denied that her ambling, or indeed anything else she did, was connected to her being British. &quot;As a woman, I have no country,&quot; she once said. &quot;As a woman I want no country. As a woman, my country is the whole world.&quot; But even the most global-minded of writers are sentimentally attached to particular places. And nowhere is quite as anonymous as it first seems. That&apos;s true, especially, of the suburbs, traditionally caricatured as a non-place for non-U people \u2013 anodyne, featureless, lowbrow, conformist \u2013 but now recognised as somewhere writers can live without feeling that they&apos;ve sold out. Actually, writers have always lived in the suburbs, and the BL exhibition mounts a strong team, from The Smiths of Surbiton to the Grossmiths of Upper Holloway, from Betjeman&apos;s Metroland to Ballard&apos;s Shepperton, and from Galsworthy and Chesterton to Hanif Kureishi. In Ballard&apos;s later fiction, the terrain is more post-modern than suburban, consisting of shopping malls, flyovers, gated communities, airport terminals and underpasses. But living in Shepperton (just off the M3) was as much a spur to his imagination as growing up in Shanghai. One of the prize exhibits in the BL exhibition is the manuscript of Crash. The opening page is an angry mess of loops, scrawls, arrows, additions, crossings out and &quot;STET&quot;s, with only the first sentence and one later phrase (&quot;the erotic tenderness of a long-separated lover&quot;) surviving intact. If you didn&apos;t know that the novel was about carnage and disjecta membra, you might guess. Ballard liked Shepperton because no one invaded his space. Larkin, similarly, said the advantage of living in Hull was that when American research students looked at train timetables and realised how difficult it was to get there, they decided to bother some other poet instead. But literary pilgrims aren&apos;t easily discouraged. And a writer doesn&apos;t have to be dead to become part of the heritage industry. Ted Hughes&apos;s privacy was invaded by Plath fans, who&apos;d gawp into his garden in Devon. Wordsworth suffered similarly at Rydal Mount: on holiday in the Lakes, the 11-year-old John Ruskin and his parents went to chapel in Rydal so as to catch a glimpse of the great man. This was one reason why Wordsworth opposed the building of the Kendal and Windermere Railway: among the sights that the tourist hordes would have access to was him. In 1844, he wrote to Gladstone of his &quot;consternation&quot; at the proposed branch line, feeling it would &quot;destroy the staple of the Country \u2026 prove subversive of its quiet, and be highly injurious to its morals&quot;. He also wrote a poem calling on Nature to rise up and protest: Is then no nook of English ground secureFrom rash assault? \u2026 if human hearts be dead,Speak, passing winds; ye torrents, with your strongAnd constant voice, protest against the wrong. Not all writers are as nimbyist as Wordsworth. The Bront\u00eb sisters bought shares in the railways (Branwell even worked on them) and Eliot, in Middlemarch, while sympathising with the suspicion that all innovation is &quot;likely to be against the poor man&quot;, lets Caleb put the case for railways to the local rustic labour force: &quot;Somebody told you the railroad was a bad thing. That was a lie. It may do a bit of harm here and there, to this and to that; and so does the sun in heaven. But the railway&apos;s a good thing.&quot; Such arguments for and against continue to this day: high-speed rail links, third runways, new motorway links \u2013 plus \u00e7a change, or rather the one thing that never changes is the fear that change will violate the land. Every nation has its conservationists, not to be confused with Conservatives. But perhaps the fear of what might be lost by change is more pronounced in British literature because our history goes back so far: newer nations have less of a past to be protective of, just as the young have less to be elegiac about than the old. It&apos;s striking how many British writers seem to feel that some irrevocable loss \u2013 the end of history \u2013 has happened in their own lifetime. &quot;The last days of my childhood were also the last days of the village,&quot; Laurie Lee writes in the final chapter of Cider with Rosie. &quot;I belonged to that generation which saw, by chance, the end of a thousand years&apos; life.&quot; Hughes wrote something similar to the photographer Fay Godwin, describing how during his childhood in the industrial north &quot;the whole region just fell to bits, the buildings collapsed, the walls collapsed, the chapels were sold for scrap and demolished, likewise the mills \u2026 I realise now I was living in the last days of Pompeii.&quot; His hope was that her photos, along with his poems, might capture &quot;the way the primeval reality of the region is taking over again from the mills, chapels, farms, pubs, bowling greens and reservoirs&quot;. The book they collaborated on, Remains of Elmet, did just that: Everything became very quiet. The hills were commandeeredFor gravemounds. The towns and villages were sacked. Everything fell wetly to bits \u2026 Hughes regarded the first world war as a turning point in his valley, his country and its literature. Larkin said the same: &quot;Never such innocence again.&quot; Having previously described himself as &quot;\u215dWelsh&quot;, Edward Thomas told a friend on the outbreak of war &quot;I am slowly growing into a conscious Englishman&quot;. Just as the flower of the nation&apos;s youth died in the trenches, so a &quot;native line&quot; of poetry associated with Thomas perished with the arrival of modernism, whose chief practitioners came from Europe and America. Or so it was claimed in the 1950s, by a Movement generation hostile to the influx of foreigners. Today, that influx is seen as a shot in the arm for indigenous literature \u2013 a revitalisation through the absorption of otherness. Later arrivals from the Caribbean, Africa and Asia had the same positive effect, enlarging and enriching the canon. Those of black or mixed heritage are still more prevalent on playing fields than on the page but our literary landscape would be unrecognisable without them, as the British Library exhibition is careful to acknowledge. In the end, all landscapes in literature, however well known to or diligently researched by the author, are invented landscapes. Their hills and valleys may have a basis in fact, but the novelist adds his own gradients. Hardy&apos;s Wessex \u2013 &quot;a partly real, partly dream country&quot;, as he called it \u2013 is a good example. Until Far From the Madding Crowd (1874), so he claims in a later preface to the novel, &quot;it had never been heard of in fiction and current speech, if at all, and the expression &apos;a Wessex peasant&apos; or &apos;a Wessex custom&apos; would theretofore have been taken to refer to nothing later in date than the Norman conquest \u2026 The dream country has, by degrees, solidified into a utilitarian region which people can go to, take a house in, and write to the papers from. But I ask all good and idealistic readers to forget this, and to refuse steadfastly to believe that there are any inhabitants of a Victorian Wessex outside these volumes.&quot; His readers paid no heed. They still pay no heed. Hardy&apos;s Wessex is an essential part of the literary tourist trail, along with the Bront\u00ebs&apos; Haworth, Bram Stoker&apos;s Whitby, Robert Louis Stevenson&apos;s Edinburgh, Dylan Thomas&apos;s Laugharne, and platform 9\u00be at JK\u00a0Rowling&apos;s King&apos;s Cross. Three years ago, in the Observer, the critic Kate Kellaway helpfully drew up a literary map of Britain, based on the places featured in contemporary fiction. Like the psychogeographers, our novelists were going for places not generally featured in books, she found, including Peterborough (Marina Lewycka&apos;s A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian) and Swindon (Mark Haddon&apos;s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time). Sheffield (Lesley Glaister, Margaret Drabble, Philip Hensher), Birmingham (David Lodge, Jim Crace, Jonathan Coe) and Walberswick/Southwold (PD James, Julie Myerson, Esther Freud) also showed up strongly. As for London&apos;s fiction, Hampstead had ceded precedence to Highbury, Brockley, Willesden Green and other once-unfashionable areas. Now the British Library, too, is planning a literary map of our landscape, with books of all ages and genres eligible for inclusion. The map will form part of the exhibition, and also feature on a website, where readers will be invited to add to it by nominating books associated with particular places. Every town in the British Isles has its scribblers, it&apos;s often claimed. Once the little flags have been put out to map incidences of literary activity, we&apos;ll discover if that&apos;s true. Thirty years ago Angela Carter wrote a wonderful essay about how Empire Day (long gone now) used to be celebrated at her south London primary school, to the tune of &quot;There&apos;ll always be an England&quot;. This taught her, she said, that &quot;the idea of Britain was an English invention \u2026 Great Britain = Greater England. The greedy flag swallowed up its constituent parts.&quot; Soon one of those parts, Scotland, may extricate itself to become independent. Then the long-predicted break-up of Britain will finally happen and English poets can call themselves English again, as Tennyson, Housman, Sassoon, Auden and Betjeman did. In the meantime, there&apos;s the British Library exhibition to remind us what Little England and Outer Britain have in common \u2013 and what they don&apos;t.", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "British Library", "TS Eliot", "Ted Hughes", "Seamus Heaney", "Angela Carter", "John Clare", "Edward Thomas", "Gerard Manley Hopkins", "William Blake", "Jane Austen", "Alan Bennett", "John Fowles", "Graham Greene", "Ian McEwan", "Daljit Nagra", "George Eliot", "DH Lawrence", "Alan Sillitoe"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-04T21:54:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/06/liverpool-waters-review-rowan-moore", "sentences": ["Instead, from its first proposals five years ago, Peel has kept proposing essentially the same thing: a wannabe Dubai, or a Shanghai-lite, plonked carelessly next to the historic buildings."], "title": "Liverpool Waters \u2013 review", "article": "&quot;We just want to be left alone, to make our own judgments,&quot; says Joe Anderson, the forthright, newly minted, directly elected mayor of Liverpool and before that leader of the city&apos;s council. He is talking about Liverpool Waters, a development at the scale of Canary Wharf and designed like Dubai, covering 60 hectares with clusters of skyscrapers and 1.7 million sq metres of offices, homes and shopping. It will create, says Anderson, 17,000 jobs and bring in \u00a35.5bn of investment. His only problem is that the proposed development partly straddles a world heritage site, and includes within its boundary some of the mightiest docks and warehouses of the Industrial Revolution. Just outside are the Three Graces, the majestic Edwardian commercial buildings that, along with its two cathedrals, define the image of the city. Being a world heritage site means that new development has to respect and enhance what is called its &quot;outstanding universal value&quot;, something which Unesco says the development signally fails to do. English Heritage and Cabe (Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment ) have persistently objected to aspects of the scheme, despite which Liverpool city council granted it outline planning permission in March. The question now is whether Eric Pickles, as secretary of state for communities and local government, decides to hold a public inquiry. According to Unesco, the outstanding universal value of the site &quot;would be irreversibly damaged if the development goes ahead&quot;. English Heritage says that &quot;the setting of some of Liverpool&apos;s most significant historic buildings will be severely compromised, the archaeological remains of parts of the historic docks are at risk of destruction, and the city&apos;s historic urban landscape will be permanently unbalanced&quot;. It also says that the information provided by the developer, the Peel Group, and the architectural practice, Chapman Taylor, is not sufficient for an application of this importance, and that their assessments are inadequate. Cabe says that the scheme neither &quot;articulates a vision for Liverpool Waters&quot; nor demonstrates how its elements &quot;have been integrated into a coherent whole&quot;. The developer&apos;s &quot;design principles&quot; are not &quot;organised or expressed in a meaningful way&quot; and do not give confidence that they &quot;will provide a sound basis by which to control design quality&quot;. It says that the official guidance for proposing tall buildings has not been followed. It&apos;s unusual to find so much unanimity among the various bodies charged with expressing views on major projects. What they are saying, in their\u00a0measured consultee-speak, is that\u00a0it stinks. Looking at the proposals you can see their point. The development&apos;s towers would loom large behind the Three Graces and, large though they are, the old warehouses would become bits of flotsam in a sea of what, until it is proved otherwise, looks like very average commercial development. There is no sign whatsoever of an attempt to make a relationship between the new buildings and the old. Instead, from its first proposals five years ago, Peel has kept proposing essentially the same thing: a wannabe Dubai, or a Shanghai-lite, plonked carelessly next to the historic buildings. Anderson talks of reviving the pride of the city&apos;s forefathers, but there is little pride in these knock-offs of other cities. Liverpool city council and Peel jointly agreed that their aim was an &quot;aspirational scheme&quot; which will &quot;create a new sense of place&quot;, but there is nothing in the images to suggest anything other than generic blandness. Also, that it would &quot;integrate&quot; the site&apos;s heritage with &quot;exciting and sustainable new development&quot;. It doesn&apos;t. And that it would &quot;draw on the unique identity of the site and the city to\u2026 reinforce Liverpool&apos;s strong identity&quot;. Again there is absolutely no sign of this. These words are products of a busy day at the flannel factory. It&apos;s not just that the designs are not very good, but also that Peel has declined requests by Cabe and English Heritage to demonstrate fully how it would achieve the sort of architectural quality and sensitivity to the past which everyone in theory agrees is a good thing. (Nor, for that matter, would it answer a simple request for information for this article.) The planning permission it has is for an outline scheme, with detailed design to be decided later. It permits a lot of big buildings without showing the architectural genius by which it would make them beautiful. The burden of proof is with Peel to show that dense clusterings of very large buildings would not trash the surroundings, but that proof has not been supplied. Possibly because it&apos;s impossible to prove this point \u2013 that there is such a thing as too big and too tall on this site which no amount of design can massage away. There are, of course, all those jobs, and it would be a rash and heartless politician who would snatch away thousands of potential livelihoods from Liverpudlians for the sake of what Anderson has called &quot;a certificate on the wall in the town hall&quot;, by which he means the world heritage site status. Except that this is to make the large assumptions that Peel will find \u00a35.5bn of capital that it doesn&apos;t currently have, and that Liverpool will suddenly discover enough office demand to fill this massive development. A more likely outcome is that the favourable planning permission will allow the Peel Group to write up the value of the site on its balance sheets. It will have also established principles, if they can be called that, that will allow Peel to do almost whatever it wants with the site in the future. Liverpool would lose twice \u2013 the city wouldn&apos;t get all the promised jobs, and its heritage would be compromised. It is in fact possible to have both development and respect for the past. Anderson says that this is his aim, and that Liverpool Waters achieves it. That Unesco, Cabe and English Heritage, plus several other bodies, disagree with him is, he says, &quot;a matter of opinion&quot;, which ignores the fact that theirs are considered expert opinions that are in theory given weight by the planning process. It is not that they should always have the last word, but when there is such a chorus of disapproval on\u00a0such a significant site, it demands to be addressed more seriously than has so far happened. Anderson also urges me to look at Peel&apos;s original proposals to see how many concessions it has made. I do, and I see that they were even more overbearing than the present ones, but not fundamentally different. I see one of the oldest ploys in developers&apos; books: start with something more than\u00a0outrageous, with the aim of achieving the merely outrageous. Liverpool should be smart enough not to fall for that one. Pickles will be lobbied to the effect that he should encourage business and\u00a0localism and leave Liverpool Waters alone, but if ever a project demanded a public inquiry it is this. It is a site of national and international importance \u2013 as the world heritage site designation recognises \u2013 where serious and legitimate concerns have been raised, and have not been adequately dealt with by the local authority. According to the World Heritage Convention, signed by Britain, the government &quot;has\u00a0a duty to protect, conserve, present and transmit the property to future generations&quot;. Waving Peel&apos;s project through would not fulfil this duty.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-05T23:05:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/06/frank-lampard-chelsea-didier-drogba", "sentences": ["Drogba&apos;s eighth goal in eight Wembley appearances (Community Shields excluded) improved his argument to be awarded a two-year contract this summer, amid reports of a \u00a36.7m-a-year offer to join Nicolas Anelka at Shanghai Shenhua, and not the 12-month deal Chelsea consider reasonable for a 34-year-old."], "title": "Frank Lampard leads Chelsea clamour for 'unique' Didier Drogba to stay", "article": "Shirt in hand, Didier Drogba sprinted to the Chelsea fans on the final whistle but could not bring himself to throw the treasured jersey away. He then kissed the Wembley turf, and a post, in appreciation of becoming the first man to score in four FA\u00a0Cup finals. His actions looked like farewell gestures in every respect but for Frank Lampard and John Terry the performance merely reinforced Drogba&apos;s status at Stamford Bridge and the club&apos;s need to ensure their man for the grand occasion does not walk away this summer. If the voices in the Chelsea dressing room are as influential as portrayed then the interim coach Roberto Di\u00a0Matteo will not be the only key figure in the defeat of Liverpool to be handed an extended contract at the end of the season. Drogba&apos;s eighth goal in eight Wembley appearances (Community Shields excluded) improved his argument to be awarded a two-year contract this summer, amid reports of a \u00a36.7m-a-year offer to join Nicolas Anelka at Shanghai Shenhua, and not the 12-month deal Chelsea consider reasonable for a 34-year-old. Albeit no ordinary 34\u2011year\u2011old. &quot;I am desperate for him to stay,&quot; Lampard said. &quot;He is a magnificent player. He&apos;s a machine. His body is a machine when you look at him stripped down. He&apos;s lost no pace, he&apos;s lost none of his finishing instinct. But as a man I love Didier and whatever he decides to do, whether he stays or whatever, he has been a hero for this club and will go down as a legend. He is an absolutely fantastic player. The amount of important goals he has got for us in cup finals and big games throughout his career makes him an icon and historical figure at Chelsea, without a doubt.&quot; The pre-match focus had centred on Fernando Torres potentially haunting his former club but the \u00a350m striker was not required as Drogba validated Di\u00a0Matteo&apos;s faith in a forward who has consistently imposed himself on the Wembley stage. To Lampard, the Ivory Coast striker is irreplaceable. &quot;He is unique,&quot; the midfielder said. &quot;There is no\u00a0one like Didier as a player, not with the kind of bulldozer kind of thing he has got and with the sublime touch and finish that he has got. It&apos;s not easy to find that. But clubs always move on. Eventually everyone has to move on at some stage and you have to find a different player or different way of playing, but for what he has done at this club he deserves everything. He is a gentleman.&quot; Chelsea remain in talks with Drogba&apos;s representatives as the Champions League final approaches and Terry, having lifted his fourth FA\u00a0Cup in six years, believes a compromise must be found. The Chelsea captain said: &quot;I hope he&apos;ll be back. It will be such a shame because he&apos;s been incredible for this club. Throughout the world when people look at Chelsea they think of Didier and Lamps and these kind of players. They are Chelsea. Didi loves the club. We&apos;ve got a massive Champions League game in a couple of weeks and after that hopefully something can be thrashed out and he stays.&quot; Drogba would not talk about his future in the aftermath of victory but did savour his place in history. &quot;I&apos;m very proud,&quot; he said of his record haul. &quot;I&apos;m very proud of it but I have to give credit to all my team-mates. During the last six years, I&apos;ve been playing here all the finals. I&apos;m really happy and I really want to thank them because they always put me in the best conditions to score goals. &quot;We made history, not only me. The result is great for us, for the fans, for the club. Our fourth FA Cup final, fourth win, fourth trophy, so I&apos;m happy. That&apos;s why we play football, to play finals.&quot; Credit for the FA\u00a0Cup triumph was shared at both ends of the pitch, however, as Chelsea players illustrated by chasing after Drogba at the final whistle while others swarmed to Petr Cech following his breathtaking save from Andy Carroll&apos;s header eight minutes from time. Lampard said: &quot;That save is right up there. I was calling him Gordon Banks in the dressing room because from where I was, and I didn&apos;t get a great view of it, it was a goal, simple as that, once it was set up for Andy Carroll. Keepers win games and they don&apos;t maybe get the credit that goalscorers do, but Petr won that game for us with that save alone.&quot; Di\u00a0Matteo, typically, distinguished victory from his application to succeed Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas as manager on a full-time basis. &quot;Irrelevant, irrelevant,&quot; he repeated to the countless questions on that pertinent issue. The Italian has overseen a run of only two defeats in 18 matches to add an FA\u00a0Cup as manager to the two he collected as a Chelsea player and attributed the transformation to little more than restoring the confidence of a beleaguered, but not beaten, unit. &quot;First of all I started with communicating with the players and they are good players. We are all human and when things don&apos;t go your way sometimes you have some doubts and then every victory has just cemented their confidence and we rolled on from one win to the next,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t know if the problems have been overstated. We have had a very difficult season but there is a lot of quality in this team and a lot of ambition as well. &quot;In adversity it seems to come out. The players dig very deep into their reserves, and we seem to be able to face all the problems and difficulties that people throw at us. Against Liverpool, against Barcelona.&quot; David Luiz confirmed he expects to return to full training this week and should be fit for the Champions League final against Bayern Munich on 19\u00a0May, when Drogba can make amends for his petulant dismissal in the 2008 final and fill the gaping void in the Chelsea silver collection.

Whitelock&apos;s First City Luncheon Bar, originally known as the Turk&apos;s Head, is so renowned that it figures in guides to Great Bars of the World, and deservedly so. I have one which ranks it alongside the likes of the Long Bar in Shanghai&apos;s Peace Hotel or Harry&apos;s in Venice. Overseas visitors who nose their way down its narrow ginnel off Briggate, clutching such guides, are seldom disappointed. Long, narrow and full of late Victorian and Edwardian plush, the bar was made famous by John Lupton Whitelock, a flautist with the Hall\u00e9 and Leeds Symphony Orchestra, who knew how to make a drinking place distinctive. His tenure coincided with a Bohemian era in Leeds \u2013 yes really, which saw the likes of the artist Phil May, actors of the city&apos;s many theatres and music halls, and literary gents make it their main port of call. It had some of the first electricity in Leeds, which Lupton used among more practical things, for trick beer glasses in which he placed a sovereign. The greedy got, not the money, but an electric shock. Up to the present day, the bar&apos;s company has remained lively and cosmopolitan and I must declare an interest: Whitelock&apos;s is a famous haunto of local journalists. My immortal predecessor, Mike Parkin, practically lived there at a corner table.     Looking slightly as if he's just left Whitelock's - though Briggate isn't as countrified as that. Photograph: Jane Bown    Whitelock&apos;s flourished unchanged for years but there was an almighty row when the Spirit Group bought it in 2004 and tried to bring in their standard menu in place of the Yorkshire puddings, pies and plates submerged under roasts in a sea of gravy. John Betjeman, Keith Waterhouse, Peter O&apos;Toole, Willis Hall, everybody, had rhapsodised about these. Customers just weren&apos;t having it. There was a petition, a boycott, a row, a flap; Spirit backed away and sold it two years later to the Yorkshire firm Chennell &amp; Amstrong. Things improved, but the sense of unease has never wholly gone away and C&amp;A have now called it a day, not just at Whitelock&apos;s but altogether. Founded in 1817 as wine importers, they expanded into wholesale drinks and then, early in the 20th century, into the licenced trade. They&apos;ve sold their only other outlet and wound up the firm, for directors to enjoy their retirement. The sale through Quest Property has been to a new company, encouragingly called Whitelock&apos;s Ale House Ltd. It&apos;s run by Ed Mason who has a track record of owning venues in Leeds including the HiFi Club which he set up in 2000, and Art&apos;s Cafe. He currently runs the Deramore Arms in Heslington, the pretty little village almost entirely engulfed by York university, and two pubs in London \u2013 the Duke of Wellington which has won a CAMRA award, and the &apos;craft beer&apos; bar Mason and Taylor. He says:   I first started drinking at Whitelock&apos;s when I moved to Leeds in 1989 and it has always had a special place in my heart. We are committed to maintaining our Good Pub and Good Beer Guide listings, and working with the independent breweries of Yorkshire to maintain the pub&apos;s long-standing commitment to real ale.  The Whitelock family sold up in 1944 when Percy W called it a day. But Sarah Whitelock, one of the last of John&apos;s descendants who still uses the pub (but doesn&apos;t eectrify any beer), is happy with the new development.

One of them was in psychology and one of my friends who was sat next to me was like &apos;You know, you&apos;d be good at this&apos;. So I went through six weeks of intensive training and I was on the lines at the end of those six weeks.&quot; Soon afterwards she became an associate, which meant that she was qualified to go out and try to talk people down off the ledge. &quot;I have seen a couple of dead bodies here and there, because the families of a dead person need crisis counselling. &quot;For me sitting in somebody else&apos;s pain has become second nature. I know that sounds stupid but it is nice to know that in somebody&apos;s worst times I can be the person there so that they have a sound board and can let things out.&quot; Spofforth&apos;s work has taught her how to compartmentalise her emotions. &quot;It is second nature to me to put things away and pretend they are not there.&quot; So her training has helped her swimming. But it also makes her hard to counsel. &quot;I am quite a hypocrite when it comes to that because I don&apos;t allow people to listen to me. There&apos;s one or two people who work with me on the lines, and they are really good but I call them out on what they are doing, because obviously I have had the same training.&quot; As recently as last Christmas, seven months out from a competition for which she has been preparing for seven years, she was thinking about quitting her sport. &quot;Right from the beginning of my career London 2012, or even before we got\u00a0the\u00a0bid, the 2012 Olympics was always my goal.&quot; After the world championships in Shanghai last year, when Spofforth was ill and finished 17th, those doubts grew. Bad thoughts began to fester. &quot;It was very real after Shanghai. There was a lot of times then when I just thought: &apos;This is the end of my career. I can&apos;t do another year.&apos; Over Christmas it was hard because the pressure was insane.&quot; The pressure, Spofforth explains, comes from the people around her. The problem with her compartmentalisation techniques, she says, is that she &quot;can only be in control of myself, not everyone else&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s so many people making comments like &apos;after you win the gold&apos; and on and on and on, from my friends even. And it is just kind of like: &apos;Stop saying that, if you say that, then I am going to go down this route.&apos; For me it is just too much pressure. When I go to the pool I can think about that kind of thing. When I come away from the pool and I am at home I don&apos;t want to be thinking about what I have got to do at the pool.&quot; Spofforth cannot pinpoint the exact moment when she decided to carry on to the Games. &quot;It may even have been when I was on the plane back to America after Christmas. I had had a week off and it was really hard being around family, who didn&apos;t know what to say to me.&quot; There was a moment, she says, when the prospect of swimming in the London Olympics began to feel very real. &quot;It was just a day when I was like: &apos;OK, so it is the London Olympics.&apos; I had it in my mind and I had said it but actually feeling it was a different thing.&quot; That was what got her through. Two days after she qualified for the Olympic team Spofforth discovered she had also got funding for a place on a Masters course in mental health counselling. &quot;It was an amazing week for me. Everything just kind of set in place.&quot; At long last.", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Swimming", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-08T23:06:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/09/carbon-capture-storage-climate-change", "sentences": ["Brad Page, chief executive of the Global CCS Institute, said: &quot;The fastest mover in the last 12 months has been China.&quot; A large plant opened in 2011 near Shanghai, was built very rapidly.", "They will not leapfrog the rest of the world in technology.&quot; The Shanghai plant, which will pump its CO2 into fizzy drinks, was built using 20-year-old technology, he said."], "title": "Whatever happened to carbon capture in the fight against climate change?", "article": "In the cool, salty air of the Norwegian coast, a revolution in reverse is being attempted. Here, amid a mare&apos;s nest of gleaming steel pipes and flaming yellow gas flares, engineers are aiming to put back under the ground what many nations have exerted all their might for the last century to get out: carbon. If all goes to plan, the oil refinery and gas power plant at Mongstad will have millions of tonnes of its climate-warming carbon dioxide funnelled back under the North Sea. And there are plans aplenty around the world for carbon capture and storage (CCS). They carry racy names such as Goldeneye and Gorgon, promise to even suck greenhouse gases out of the air one day, and are laced with the delicious irony of having been kickstarted by climate sceptic US president George W Bush, who wanted to &quot;do something for coal&quot;. But the optimism that fuelled hopes of CCS driving deep carbon cuts has stalled. The infant industry was knocked off course by the world economic crisis that dragged urgency about global warming down with it, and made money hard to come by. This matters, says the International Energy Agency, which thinks 20% of all the carbon cuts needed to tackle global warming could come from trapping the exhausts of power stations and putting them out of harm&apos;s way. &quot;If CCS is out, we need to find other ways to get those carbon cuts and that will be very, very difficult: we have to do it,&quot; said Maria van der Hoeven, the IEA executive director, adding that almost three-quarters of all energy between now and 2050 will come from burning fossil fuels. The IEA, which recently warned current trends would lead to a catastrophic 6C of warming, says 3,000 large CCS plants will be needed by 2050, with three dozen within a decade. There are currently none on power stations. Norway&apos;s prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, who opened the Mongstad plant, told the Guardian: &quot;With nine billion people expected on the planet in 2050, there is no way we can choose between increased energy production and reduced CO2 \u2013 we have to achieve both. Without CCS, we cannot do it.&quot; The country clearly in the lead is the US. Of the 15 major CCS projects currently running or being built, which aren&apos;t attached to power stations, it has eight. The $3bn for CCS in the US stimulus bill in 2009 turbocharged the several billion the nation had already ploughed in. &quot;The former [Bush] administration wanted to do something for coal,&quot; said Jay Braitsch, senior CCS advisor at the US department of energy (DoE). He said Bush had dropped out of international climate negotiations and wanted another way to address energy concerns. &quot;That meant giving it a whole lot of money,&quot; Braitsch said. But another factor has put the US in pole position: the need for copious carbon dioxide to pump out the last dregs of oil from drained reservoirs, so-called enhanced oil recovery. All but one of the eight current US projects depend on selling CO2 for this, to make their finances add up. Canada and Australia \u2013 who also have heavy carbon footprints and a history of sceptical climate policies \u2013 are next furthest advanced in CCS. Norway, which has put $1bn of state money into the world&apos;s largest CCS test centre at Mongstad and has been burying CO2 since 1996, is also a leader, but for different reasons. Howard Herzog, a CCS expert at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: &quot;There are unique circumstances in Norway, where they care very much about climate change and have the money to actually do something about it,&quot; alluding to Norway&apos;s vast sovereign wealth fund built on oil and gas revenues.     Operational and planned CCS plants across the world, in 2012. Photograph: guardian.co.uk    But the status of China, the world&apos;s biggest polluter, divides opinion. Brad Page, chief executive of the Global CCS Institute, said: &quot;The fastest mover in the last 12 months has been China.&quot; A large plant opened in 2011 near Shanghai, was built very rapidly. But Herzog said: &quot;China&apos;s goal is not to be the innovator, but to be the low-cost supplier. They will not leapfrog the rest of the world in technology.&quot; The Shanghai plant, which will pump its CO2 into fizzy drinks, was built using 20-year-old technology, he said. Europe hosts none of the 15 frontline CCS plants, but has 21 of the 60 or so plants currently in planning. But Herzog said: &quot;The EU plan is totally on the rocks.&quot; Its plan to fund development by selling off 300m carbon pollution permits will raise far less than anticipated due to the floundering carbon price, which throws a double whammy as the plants&apos; future earnings from burying CO2 have also tanked, he said. G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the European commissioner for energy, acknowledged the problem. &quot;Most CCS projects funded by the EC face delays, due to slow investment and the low carbon price. If the EU wants to remain a leader, we have to step up.&quot; Within Europe, the UK leads with one-third of the bloc&apos;s planned projects, and has the advantage of the vast storage potential of the North Sea. One is at the UK&apos;s biggest polluter, the Drax coal-fired power station in Yorkshire, where a new \u00a31.5bn furnace is planned. It would burn wood and straw alongside coal and, as CO2 was drawn from the air as the plants grew, burying the gas would cut the level in the air. &quot;You create a giant vacuum cleaner that sucks CO2 from the atmosphere,&quot; said Charles Soothill, head of technology at Alstom, the French engineering company behind the Drax plan. &quot;It is the only industrial way of reversing climate change. I think that is very exciting.&quot; A further promise of CCS is cleaning up the vast emissions of the steel, cement and chemical industries, which contribute roughly 20% of global CO2 from energy. These energy-intensive industries have few options, and capping their pollution at source with CCS appears most promising, say experts, yet barely any current CCS projects address this issue. Another hidden issue is whether local communities will accept the burial of CO2 under the land near their homes, as campaigners have already helped halt a project in the Netherlands. The energy industry bigwigs gathered in Mongstad for the plant opening all bemoan the low value the world currently places on carbon pollution. The world&apos;s biggest carbon trading scheme, in Europe, currently charges about $9 for a tonne, contrasting with the likely $70/tonne cost of CCS. Most interested parties, including oil giant Shell for example, are betting on that price rising. &quot;It is a very cost effective technology,&quot; said Andy Brown, director for upstream international at Shell, which is involved in the Goldeneye CCS project at Peterhead, Scotland. Others are looking further ahead. Braisch said the US DoE is focusing its new research on future generations of CCS, including using fossil fuels to power plants full of fuel cells. That would result in a pure stream of CO2, he said, avoiding the two-thirds of CCS&apos;s cost, which is incurred in separating the gas. Another cost-cutter could be using the CO2 to grow algae, which is then used as animal feed. CCS has one final card: the prospect of a global high-technology industry that could bring desperately sought growth to stagnant economies. Many governments use the industrial opportunity presented by CCS to press the case for pushing ahead in the race to develop the technology. But prime minister Stoltenberg, who will sign off billions more of his taxpayers&apos; krone for a full-scale plant if testing at Mongstad is successful, claimed there was a different motivation. Maintaining Norway&apos;s position as the biggest gas exporter in the world by cleaning it up with CCS is &quot;much less important than people believe&quot;, he said, as &quot;gas will be a winner even without CCS, because it has half the carbon emissions of coal.&quot; &quot;We should not look upon efforts to develop this technology as a race between countries,&quot; Stoltenberg said, &quot;but as a race between what we do together versus global warming.&quot; \u2022 The Technology Centre Mongstad assisted with the Guardian&apos;s travel", "tags": ["Carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Coal", "Environment", "Norway", "Europe", "World news", "Energy industry", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-09T16:18:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/centre-liveable-cities-singapore-sustainable-development", "sentences": ["Already, eco-cities are springing up across Asia and sustainability proposals are pouring out of major urban centres such as Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong."], "title": "Centre for Liveable Cities Singapore: focusing on government first", "article": "Sustainability, says Cheng Hsing Yao of Singapore&apos;s Centre for Liveable Cities, is like an iceberg. Underneath the hard exterior of a city&apos;s infrastructure, such as green buildings or energy-efficient power grids, a whole host of factors from extensive master planning to urban governance support it. From the thinktank&apos;s perspective, says Cheng, governance is key. One of the fundamental roles of government is to provide a broader framework whereby the private sector can participate actively in the building of harmonious cities, where the spatial, social and environmental aspects of a city are of equal importance. &quot;The private sector wants clarity, certainty, some predictability. So, the government has to come up with the overall vision; create plans and policies that make that vision attractive to the private sector; and make those plans and policies transparent and credible,&quot; he says in an interview. In Singapore, one way the government achieves this is by opening sustainability projects to public tender, thus ensuring that such projects are benchmarked at a level feasible for private companies. A 2011 tender for the development of a major desalination plant, for example, was deliberately scoped to allow private sector participation \u2013 it was won by water management company Hyflux. Similarly, the design and development of the city-state&apos;s latest integrated resort Marina Bay Sands, which has received accolades for its eco-friendly practices, was carried out privately but according to the government&apos;s vision for the site. There is, of course, still more room for private sector participation above and beyond following the governmental lead. Cheng, an architect by profession who previously spent 13 years with Singapore&apos;s Urban Redevelopment Authority, cites green buildings, which have caught on in the city-state because developers see them as a way of selling projects. The infrastructure is widespread, but the mindset still has to catch up: there is room for improvement in the way these buildings are managed. &quot;To me, you can do good and do well at the same time,&quot; he says. &quot;It is not a bad thing to try to align private profit objectives with the greater good. When we introduce guidelines and legislation, we level the playing field and encourage the private sector to participate much more easily.&quot; The public sector must take the lead not just at the infrastructural and policy level, he adds. The next step: leaders at the city level will increasingly become more like CEOs, taking on a managing role and influencing the cities&apos; push towards sustainability. Already, eco-cities are springing up across Asia and sustainability proposals are pouring out of major urban centres such as Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. &quot;We are entering an era of cities. This is where the action is taking place, where a lot of economic and intellectual powers are concentrated. People move to cities because the opportunities are there. Urbanisation will take place at the edges of the cities \u2013 when we talk about China urbanising, for example, it&apos;s not an overall transformation but an expansion of existing cities and the growth of towns into cities.&quot; As this continues, leadership, institutional strength and the ability to think in the long term \u2013 rather than focusing solely on short-term development \u2013 will determine how sustainable a city can become. But there is also a major mindset change waiting in the wings, Cheng adds, and in the context of Asia, this is the concept of what constitutes an eco-city to begin with. Conventional models prescribe a village-like, self-sufficient ecosystem, but this cannot be applied in developing parts of the world, where policymakers at all levels face a whole suite of complex socio-economic challenges ranging from widespread poverty to resource scarcity. Instead, what is needed is a compact, high-density model that utilises economies of scale for resource and energy efficiency \u2013 such as many cities in Asia are already implementing. &quot;A lot of people would criticise Singapore as a country for being non-self-sustainable,&quot; says Cheng, who has himself been involved in the planning of one of these eco-cities, the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City. &quot;But in 2010, we proposed at the Venice Architecture Biennale that if the whole world followed Singapore&apos;s model, only 0.5% of the Earth&apos;s area would be needed to house the population.&quot; Ultimately, he says, the relevant question for public and private sector alike is not whether a city or country can achieve some benchmark. &quot;Being sustainable is about socio-economic as well as environmental development. It&apos;s almost like a journey.

The education secretary is a bright fellow who has a helpful insight into the part luck plays in most lives. Gove was adopted as a baby by a Labour-supporting Aberdeen fish merchant and his wife who knew the value of education and sent him to a famous Scots public school on a scholarship. On to Oxford, the Times and now the cabinet. Clever Michael, lucky Michael. You can read his speech here and a characteristically combative antidote (written before the speech was published, I suspect) to its analysis here. It was penned by our own George Monbiot on the grounds that he was one of the prominent public figures singled out by Gove as a product of public schooling. Judges and politicians, business and media leaders, the theatre and arts \u2013 we all know the list is a long one. So far as I can see, online readers are overwhelmingly hostile to Gove and share GM&apos;s view that he is a cynical exponent of a class-based strategy which is designed to pull up the drawbridge behind the privileged and let the rest of us rot. Apart from the fact that this is a very unhistoric take on the history of the Tory party since Disraeli, it doesn&apos;t square with Gove&apos;s own CV, let alone what he said in Thursday&apos;s speech at (private) Brighton College. So the article which caught my contrarian eye was the one sitting next to Jessica Shepherd&apos;s report of Gove&apos;s speech in the printed edition of the Guardian, in which Sir Michael Wilshaw, the government&apos;s Ofsted chief, tells teachers they have better salaries and more independence than ever and that they should stop whinging: &apos;You don&apos;t know what stress is.&apos; Teachers&apos; union leaders (not always typical teachers, I realise) were pretty cross about that and we can all see why. Teaching can be very stressful, especially in bad schools. When I was in Basildon following David Cameron and Nick Clegg on their Essex Expedition this week, the local paper was dominated by Rory Fox, the new head of Basildon Academies, appealing to parents for support in turning round these failing schools, ending swearing, restoring discipline and standards. It&apos;s a familiar agenda, not confined to Andy Coulson&apos;s home town. I guess Gove and Wilshaw \u2013 a former turnaround head himself \u2013 know all this. Gove&apos;s Brighton speech moved from his spotlight on the private sector&apos;s achievements to saying how well some state schools are doing, despite having a lot of poor pupils. &quot;We have thousands of superb state schools,&quot; he said. Some deprived kids and their schools come from behind to do better than average, despite their free school meals, he noted. In Britain the percentage doing better from behind is 24%, in Finland 45%, in the great Chinese metropolis of Shanghai it&apos;s 76% \u2013 those Tiger mothers at it again, by the sound of it. What he&apos;s trying to say is that fatalism is the wrong response. More than that, even in lopsided Britain &quot;the tide is turning&quot; \u2013 that schools are getting better with the Gove remedy. That&apos;s the one that tries to offset early disadvantage (it shows up quickly in performance) with extra attention from the age of two to three for those most at risk \u2013 but focuses mainly on greater freedoms for schools from uniformity and on standards. It&apos;s easy to pick holes in this approach, point to the spotty record of academies (and their budget windfalls caused by errors in Whitehall) and dismiss the free school movement as well-meaning but eccentric at best. I&apos;d do it myself if we were talking courtesy of the Daily Telegraph, some of whose readers cling to the comforting notion that the 7% privately educated get such a larger slice of the top jobs in life on merit alone. They don&apos;t. What they get arises from many factors over and above innate talent, from a family background which values education and ambition (money is not essential, though it helps) and nurtures hard work and discipline in their kids. Private schools are good at taking Beta-minus material and polishing it to Beta-plus standards. That&apos;s what folk pay for. What I&apos;d pitch for here then is not Monbiot&apos;s remedy to a problem that sees a lot of state school talent wasted \u2013 to the detriment of both the individuals concerned and wider society. The abolition of private education is not a very practical, let alone a proper solution, fun though it can be to frighten complacent people. What did they teach him at that school! It&apos;s also one that would destroy quite a valuable British export industry. Our great private schools (and some not so great ones) attract a lot of foreign buyers, so they must being doing something that works well in a globalised and elitist world. Even Maoist Chinese warlords send their kids here, we learned during the Bo affair. So more scholarships for clever poor kids such as Gove, more outreach to the wider community, more pressure to earn their charitable status, every little helps. But much more important is that under-performing chunks of the state sector \u2013 schools not confined to poor towns or districts \u2013 should raise both their game and the aspirations they have both for their clever pupils and the other ones. Don&apos;t take my word for it. Here&apos;s a telling report on low aspirations from the admirable Sutton Trust founded by Sir Peter Lampl, son of a refugee (like Nadhim Zahawi, the MP whose views on Shakespeare&apos;s politics were aired here on Thursday), who made a great fortune and now spends some of it promoting the kind of social mobility he enjoyed \u2013 but which has since collapsed quite badly in Britain, even more so than elsewhere. Why? Tory nostalgics think it&apos;s down to the replacement of grammar schools by the comprehensive system in most places, but Gove and David Willetts, the universities minister, are too smart for that one: grammars were brilliant in their time, far better than most public schools, which have had to raise their game. But they left too many talented young people behind. The techs didn&apos;t fill the gap as they did in Germany. Yes, class remains a major determinant, so is cash per pupil and the rest. But they are not the only ones and constantly need to be challenged \u2013 by kids, families and by schools. Brains will out, given even half a chance. Beat Eton at its own game. By chance I read Michael Apted&apos;s account (paywall) in the Times this week of ITV&apos;s 50-year Seven Up series, which has charted the fortunes of 14 children at seven-year intervals since 1964. The latest 56 Up update starts its three-part hourly run on 14 May. Old and wise (he&apos;s now 71), Apted is not naive about class and life chances. He has seen some of the 14 characters stumble and fall \u2013 but also pick themselves up again, protesting that a particular Seven Up series has shown them in too negative a light. He promises to do better and writes: &quot;What interests me is seeing how character develops. Class destiny did, on the whole, fulfil itself. The people who made a good start in life and made the most of it continued to do well. But character is what their lives are really about: how people deal with issues, whether they confront them, or avoid them; how they deal with parenting, with family life. That part of your destiny is unpredictable.&quot; That&apos;s the spirit. As I type I have Rebekah Brooks&apos;s testimony to the Leveson inquiry on my screen in the background. Unlike Rupert Murdoch or Lord Rothermere she doesn&apos;t have a privileged background: grammar school in Warrington, but no university degree, just ambition to become a journalist. She started her News of the World career as a secretary. You don&apos;t have to like her or admire her performance in the high court to figure out how she rose to where she did among the less talented, less street-smart public school crowd, all this before The Fall. Like Andy Coulson, who appeared in court 73 a day earlier, she&apos;s a meritocrat. I only wish there were more of them and that they had both deployed their talents somewhere else.

The overdue draft aviation policy is expected to be published this summer along with a call for evidence on hub airport capacity. Walsh and others, notably the airport operator BAA, have long argued that a hub airport \u2013 one sufficiently large to allow connecting passengers to fill long-haul routes \u2013 is crucial and that Heathrow, Britain&apos;s only hub, is no longer big enough to allow flights to new destinations. As the owner of British Airways and Spain&apos;s Iberia, IAG is the largest airline group at Heathrow. Walsh said: &quot;When I hear the government talking about an intelligent use of capacity at Heathrow \u2013 they have no idea what they are talking about. This is the government that cancelled the third runway. They don&apos;t know what they are talking about. I&apos;ve no confidence that this government will able to meet the challenge.&quot; Walsh questioned whether the consultation would be &quot;real&quot;, saying: &quot;If they close off options before they start, I don&apos;t see the merit in engaging with it.&quot; The coalition has ruled out a third Heathrow runway, and last week the transport secretary, Justine Greening, said &quot;mixed mode&quot; \u2013 allowing takeoffs and landings on the same runway \u2013 would also not be considered. However, Greening said the government would look at other, unspecified ways of maximising Heathrow&apos;s capacity. George Osborne, the chancellor, has said the government will explore all options for maintaining Britain&apos;s airport hub capacity with the exception of a third runway at Heathrow. Walsh said: &quot;We need to be honest and mature \u2013 if you&apos;re going to have a consultation, to say you&apos;re eliminating options before you start doesn&apos;t seem mature or really serious.&quot; Greening has promised a fast process and said she will set out a timeline for action as part of the call for evidence on hub airports, which she hoped would be &quot;a more informed debate with a little less heat and more light&quot;. Walsh said: &quot;They&apos;ve been giving that answer for two years \u2013 there isn&apos;t any credibility in this government. They should turn round and say: &apos;You know what, we don&apos;t know what we&apos;re doing.&apos; Then we&apos;d know where they stand.&quot; Walsh, who is taking a delegation of businessmen to China this weekend to explore export opportunities, said the lack of airport capacity in the UK was harming British business. &quot;China isn&apos;t just about Beijing and Shanghai but growth opportunities in cities most people don&apos;t know the names of. You can fly to them from Paris and Amsterdam and even Helsinki, and yet we&apos;re trying to convince ourselves that this is an opportunity for the UK. It&apos;s not, because we can&apos;t connect. Longer-term it&apos;s going to have real consequences for the UK.&quot; On Friday IAG announced an operating loss of \u20ac249m (\u00a3200m) for the first quarter of 2012, compared with a \u20ac102m loss for the same period last year. Walsh said the &quot;underlying performance was pretty good&quot; but there had been a massive increase in the fuel bill, up 25% to \u20ac1.4bn. He admitted that Iberia&apos;s operating performance was poor, but said long-term the Spanish airline would not drag down its merged partner British Airways. &quot;Long-term, the economic situation in Spain will be difficult but will improve, and the restructuring we&apos;re doing ourselves in Iberia will benefit the business.&quot; Walsh said arbitration should mean no imminent repeat of strikes by Iberia pilots that hit IAG profits. He anticipated that a restructured bmi, whose purchase by IAG from Lufthansa was cleared last month, would be profitable by 2014. &quot;We&apos;ve got a big job to do \u2013 the scale of losses were huge. But we know what we need to do.&quot; He held out little hope for bmibaby, however, despite ongoing talks and the sale of the other bmi airline, bmi Regional, this week. &quot;We&apos;re talking to people and actively seeking a buyer, but I&apos;m not confident of our ability to sell,&quot; Walsh said.

The company says it has produced 6m of the simple, robust and low-cost laptops since 2007. &quot;The concept of &apos;one-to-one&apos; education, where every students has a laptop or tablet that they can also take home, opens up new possibilities for classroom pedagogy in ELT, new ways to support learning with authentic language input and new ways to expand learning beyond the classroom,&quot; said Michael Carrier, director of English language development at the British Council. Japan funds universities to &apos;internationalise&apos; Universities in Japan that introduce more English language classes and encourage their students to travel abroad to study could receive over $16m each over the next five years as part of government funding aimed at internationalising higher education. Up to 40 universities are being encouraged to apply for grants if they meet criteria such as recruiting teaching staff from abroad and setting up credit transfer systems with other colleges. Shinichi Yamanaka, deputy director general at the education ministry, told the Japan Times: &quot;I believe we are entering a time to open up Japanese universities. To send more Japanese students abroad, universities need to make them more open to the global environment.&quot; This year the government increased scholarship support for Japanese students to study abroad from $24m to $39m in an attempt to reverse a decline in numbers choosing courses outside Japan. Shanghai launches plan to protect shut-out students After a string of school closures that have left students out of pocket, Shanghai city authorities have launched a deposit system to protect students from business failures. Students at private English language schools are among those who have lost pre-paid fees as a result of recent closures. From the beginning of this month education providers will be required to pay 10% of the fees they collect into supervised bank accounts, which will be used to reimburse their students in the event of closure. &quot;It is good for long-term development of the whole industry,&quot; a representative of one of the city&apos;s major English language centres told China Business News. &quot;We support policies that protect customers&apos; rights.&quot; US college and Disney to\u00a0train teachers for China The University of California Riverside, in southern California, is appealing to out-of-work teachers to sign up for an English language teaching training course leading to teaching work in China with Disney English, the education arm of the global entertainment giant. US and Canadian citizens educated to degree level and who have &quot;two years&apos; post-graduation teaching experience in an educational setting&quot; can get free training and accommodation for the 10-day course starting on 30 July. Disney is paying for all tuition and accommodation costs, but teachers must commit to a minimum 12-month contract to teach at Disney English schools across China and be ready to leave by mid-August. \u2022 The Xenos game (ELT diary 13 April) was developed not by MIT Education Arcade but by its not-for-profit spin-off Learning Games Network.

Payne became the first British athlete to qualify for London 2012 when she won the world championships in Shanghai last year , her second world title in succession. She is one of Great Britain&apos;s outstanding sportswomen, and while she doesn&apos;t yet enjoy the public profile of her great friend and teammate Rebecca Adlington, that should change this summer. will start as heavy favourite for the Games 10km title. The open water swimming at London 2012 will take place in the Serpentine at Hyde Park, which will be a rather more salubrious environment than the ones Payne and her fellow competitors are used to swimming in. &quot;The dead dogs in China were definitely the worst,&quot; Payne says with a sigh. &quot;The jellyfish in Melbourne weren&apos;t fun either. I don&apos;t think it was possible not to get stung all over \u2013 there were literally thousands of them and they were getting chopped up by the boats because there were so many boats around. And they don&apos;t stop stinging just because they&apos;re chopped up.&quot; Compared to those, Payne says, the prospect of passing a plastic bag or being pestered by a swan in the Serpentine isn&apos;t too onerous. &quot;It will be a piece of cake,&quot; she says. &quot;Believe me.&quot; She has even swum with sharks in her time. No wonder that over the course of two hours or so it takes Payne to swim 10km she deliberately fills her mind with lighter thoughts. Payne says she can sum up most of what she is thinking about during a race in two words: hamburgers and handbags. &quot;I genuinely think &apos;I can&apos;t wait to have a burger after this&apos; or something stupid like that,&quot; Payne says. &quot;I just think about what kind of treat I can have or what handbag I&apos;m going to buy next time or something like that.&quot; Payne has to occupy her mind somehow. Otherwise, out in the open water, she is overcome by ominous thoughts about what&apos;s beneath her. &quot;Everyone has their &apos;Jaws moment&apos;,&quot; she says. &quot;When you think &apos;Oh my God \u2013 no, no, no&apos;. That&apos;s it, I&apos;m not going to think about it again. Right, just carry on swimming.&quot; A little like wicketkeepers, goalies and decathletes in their respective sports, open water competitors tend to be regarded as a strange species by their fellow swimmers. &quot;I think to be an open water swimmer you have to have a certain amount of &apos;hard&apos; to you,&quot; Payne says. &quot;You just have to expect it. So many things are thrown at us on so many occasions, you just have to kind of get on with it. Because I know if I didn&apos;t do it, another 30 girls who would happily get in \u2013 maybe not happily \u2013 but they&apos;d get in and they&apos;d do it. You need to be the ruthless one.&quot;Payne does swim in pools too, and tried to make the Olympic 800m freestyle team at the British trials. But she was suffering with a kidney infection at the time, and was beaten by Adlington and Eleanor Faulkner. &quot;I&apos;m not terribly upset about it,&quot; she says, &quot;because Ellie and Becky had absolutely fantastic swims and they were the better swimmers on the day and that&apos;s just how it goes in the sport.&quot; Besides, in the pool she is just another contender, whereas in the open water she is a champion. They are a tough pack to lead. &quot;If you&apos;re in the wrong position, swimming next to the wrong person, you&apos;re pretty much guaranteed to get an elbow or a kick in the stomach or something like that ,&quot; Payne says. &quot;You&apos;re swimming with 30 girls and you&apos;re all swimming in such close proximity that there are going to be elbows flying here and there and generally nine times out of 10 it&apos;s an accident. That&apos;s why I stick out in front because I don&apos;t want to have to deal with all that kind of stuff.&quot; Her rivals have got wise to her tactics, not that it seems to makes much difference. &quot;In the last couple of years people have tried all sorts of different things and it&apos;s fair play to them if they want to give me a challenge. I know that nobody will get in front of me.&quot;", "tags": ["Keri-Anne Payne", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Swimming", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-15T22:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/may/16/tefl-update-may", "sentences": ["News: &apos;Threat to US jobs&apos; halts USAid training  Teaching programme in the Philippines suspended after two US congressmen express concerns News: 100 million Intel laptops to get pre-loaded English lessons Catch up with the latest global developments with ELT diary: British Council says its learning content will be installed on to low-cost computers as part of US computer maker&apos;s global education campaign; Japan pays its universities to &apos;internationalise&apos; with English classes on campus a priority; Shanghai launches plan to protect students shut out of failed schools; University of California and Disney collaborate to train teachers for China."], "title": "Tefl Update for May", "article": "Welcome to TEFL Update for May, a roundup of the latest ELT related news and views to appear in Learning English, the special section of the Guardian Weekly for English language teaching professionals worldwide.

And the word &apos;mad&apos; is also often attached to the word &apos;inventor.&apos;&quot; He pauses. &quot;But the things that capture people&apos;s imagination in arts or architecture or fashion are the most inventive things. The best entrepreneurs have invented new ideas for business. And for me, the art of something is very often in its invention.&quot; Heatherwick is more properly a designer than an inventor, but in the way he has put together the studio he has run for the last 18 years, where he has attempted to combine as many creative disciplines as possible, there is a least a hint of the spirit of invention. Engineers, architects, product designers, landscape designers, sculptors, photographers, stage designers and urban planners all work together. Visiting his King&apos;s Cross premises, prosaically tucked behind a Travelodge, is to encounter part hi-tech research lab, part art school campus and part, well, Wonka chocolate factory or Caractacus Potts workshop. Walking through it you weave between assemblages of twisted and shaped metal, wood, plastic and glass as well as a succession of intriguing models in various states of completion depicting putative pieces of furniture, bridges and even whole districts of Chinese cities. The sense of creative inclusiveness is something that Heatherwick has sought since his time as a student at the Royal College of Art. A 42-year-old who is infectiously evangelical about his work, he still remembers his frustration at encountering &quot;sliced-up ghettos of thought&quot; \u2013 sculpture, architecture, fashion, embroidery, metalwork, product and furniture design all in separate departments \u2013 &quot;which I don&apos;t believe are absolute. It&apos;s just the way we categorise things and the way we chose to educate people.&quot; As he says in the introduction to Making, a lavish new book about his practice, published by Thames &amp; Hudson to coincide with a retrospective exhibition of his work opening at the V&amp;A, &quot;I wanted to consider all design in three dimensions, not as multidisciplinary design, but as a single discipline: three dimensional design.&quot; The fulfilment of Heatherwick&apos;s grand, cross-pollinating ambitions has been appropriately abundant and varied. As a student he met Terence Conran, who became something of a mentor and later described Heatherwick as &quot;the Leonardo da Vinci of our times&quot;. Conran saw a Heatherwick plan for a gazebo made of two, 6m high curved stacks of birch plywood, and made its construction possible by inviting Heatherwick to work at his country home.     The East Beach Caf\u00e9 in Littlehampton. Photograph: Andy Stagg    For the 1997 London fashion week, he was asked to dress the Harvey Nichols window display. The result was a vast, insect-like ribbon of illuminated wood that snaked in between the store and the street, smashing through all 12 windows. In 2000 came a bag for French luxury goods company Longchamp, made almost entirely out of a zipper that enabled it to double in size. In 2005 he completed a futuristic, shell-like East Beach Caf\u00e9 at Littlehampton \u2013 no small venture, as the tiny kiosk it replaced sold &quot;\u00a3100,000 worth of extruded ice-cream every year&quot;. His UK pavilion for the 2007 World Expo in Shanghai was the size of a small tower block and covered inside and out in silvery hair (60,000 25-foot-long acrylic rods). His studio designed the recently re-imagined London bus, and it will be a Heatherwick cauldron that houses the London Olympic flame. While most people barely think about the design of the objects around them, for Heatherwick there was from the beginning a strongly programmed idea that things were for the making. His mother was an enameller and jeweller whose workshop was in the family home (&quot;the route to my parents&apos; bedroom was past her enamelling powders and kilns&quot;). His father was a musician and Royal Marine boxer with a fascination for futuristic housing prototypes. A grandmother started the Marks &amp; Spencer textile studio before becoming a pioneer in the field of art therapy (&quot;the idea that the visual world had an effect on people&apos;s well-being was in there somewhere&quot;). And a grandfather whose family had founded Jaeger and who also wrote about design for the 1951 Festival of Britain was obsessed with Victorian engineers. &quot;The influences on me do rather add up,&quot; he concedes. As a child he would go to what was then called the Eastway cycle track in the Lea Valley \u2013 now the site of the Olympic velodrome \u2013 to watch &quot;human-powered vehicle racing&quot;. &quot;It felt very Victorian in that people would come along with adapted devices in various stages of invention. There were bikes that you steered by leaning, and you&apos;d see a guy disappear round a corner and then hobble back into view a few moments later covered in grazes. Someone else put on a fairing in an attempt to beat a world record. It was another example of people having ideas and putting them into practice.&quot; The first time Heatherwick was paid for a project he spent his earnings on a recumbent bicycle similar to those he had seen at Eastway. He still rides it today, and bemoans the misapplication of racing geometry to modern recreational bikes, explaining how he wants both efficiency and ease of viewing position. As to how he finds design solutions, he says the process is almost the opposite of having a &quot;Eureka&quot; moment. &quot;It is more like solving a crime. The answer is there, and your job is to find it. So we go off and do bits of research that essentially eliminate suspects from the enquiry. And then you follow up leads and gradually narrow down the potential solutions. Ultimately what you&apos;re left with is the answer. Even if you&apos;d thought of it at the beginning of the process, you could never know it was right until the end.&quot;     B of the Bang, inspired by Linford Christie's comment that he always started on the B of the Bang, was dismantled amid safety concerns. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    Not that his career has been all plain sailing. His commission for a commemorative sculpture for the 2002 Commonwealth games in Manchester, B of the Bang (representing the moment sprinter Linford Christie said he tried to get out of his blocks on hearing the starting pistol) was a 56m, 180-tonne structure featuring a starburst of 180 metal spikes. Repeated technical and safety concerns eventually led to its dismantling at significant financial cost to the studio. Heatherwick points to a reluctance, especially in the UK, to get the best out of design thinking. &quot;There seems to be a linear way of looking at things in Britain. If I showed them the UK Expo pavilion they would say, &apos;hmmm, nice, but we don&apos;t need a hairy town hall or a hairy apartment building&apos;, rather than seeing that that was a specific response to an aspect of the brief and looking at the underlying thinking. It&apos;s a perception that people have a style and it is all about the application of that style. Elsewhere in the world people saw what was achieved with one brief and wondered how we would respond to another.&quot; Heatherwick&apos;s current big projects overseas include apartment buildings in Malaysia where, at the instigation of the city mayor who offered more floor space if the project benefited the whole city, they are &quot;essentially creating a piece of rainforest, to convert the site from the perception of 90% building with a few trees round the edge, to 90% rainforest&quot;. There is an even larger project to develop a half-kilometre block of Shanghai that will house the main arts district as well industrial buildings, high density housing, a park, shopping and office space. He says that, generally, the bolder the ideas, the more enthusiastic people become. &quot;When I initially proposed the Harvey Nichols project I was told that the head of building services would never allow it. No one had woven one object through the entire building. But he was actually excited to be offered something so different. People often complain that planners stop them from doing radical things. That&apos;s not my experience at all and I think people use planners as an excuse. Planners, in general, do want something special to happen.&quot;     The design for Teesside power station, Stockton-on-Tees. Photograph: Heatherwick Studio    His most notable recent UK projects have been a bio-mass power station on Teesside \u2013 currently on hold waiting for a decision as to future government energy policy \u2013 and the new London bus. He says buses have been subject to an &quot;absurd number of regulatory changes over the years and there hasn&apos;t been design thinking to balance them. We don&apos;t want to reject any of the health and safety initiatives, but we did need to recalibrate the design in light of them so that we prioritise quality of experience and also give some dignity to the experience of travelling on a bus. It sounds pompous, but that is the way that people get around.&quot; He complains about how hand poles had become nuclear warning yellow (&quot;they need a contrast level, but don&apos;t need the maximum contrast level you could humanly achieve&quot;); about the strip lighting (&quot;that&apos;s what a battery chicken farm has \u2013 kinder lighting makes people feel that little bit better about themselves&quot;); and individual bucket seats with built in crevices for accumulating crisp packets. &quot;Travelling round London in a chic convertible sports car is actually the worst way to see the city. The best is from the upstairs of a bus, which is not only very democratic, it meditatively frees you from your normal existence. You get the bigger view.&quot; All this forms part of a wider interest in what he calls &quot;public-ness. The idea of when you do, and don&apos;t, expect something to be special. When you go into an art gallery you pretty much say: hit me with something meaningful. But a power station? Probably not, even though this one will be in the heart of a community and provide something as important as hot water.&quot; On the panel of a design prize last year, Heatherwick was instrumental in giving a special award to hair stylist Vidal Sassoon, who died this month. &quot;He brought modernism to hair in an area of design that revolutionised women&apos;s lives. He gave a speech about how he had known some of the figures from Bauhaus, and how architecture had influenced what he&apos;d done. Where artistic inventiveness crops up is a moving target. There are times when that area has been painting, but it moves to many other places that need pushing forward at any point in time.&quot; Heatherwick has used the process of putting together the new book and exhibition to attempt to track that movement of inventiveness in his own work. &quot;I started keeping a journal because of the shock at how quickly the past evaporates behind you like a vapour trail. The book and the V&amp;A show have given us a chance to reflect. And while there is a risk of becoming sick of yourself when you look back at what you&apos;ve done, trying to distil it will be very useful to us in the future. Although Making is a very big book, we haven&apos;t actually built that many things. We want this process of looking back to act as inspiration for making more. It&apos;s quite a moment. We can not only say &apos;this is what we&apos;ve done&apos;, more importantly we can also ask: &apos;what&apos;s next?&apos;&quot; \u2022 Heatherwick Studio: Designing the Extraordinary is at the V&amp;A from 31 May to 30 September. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 July 2012.

The hulking centre-forward who batters and bullies but also tumbles and writhes; the ruthless and selfish goalscorer who likes to muck in defensively; the combustible competitor who is the polite and generous family man away from the field. It is a cup final curiosity, though, that preoccupies him and it forms a thick layer of his motivation for Saturday night&apos;s Champions League collision with Bayern Munich in what could well be his valedictory appearance in a Chelsea shirt. Drogba has been almost untouchable in domestic finals yet his fortunes in European and international showpieces have needed to be filed under the nightmarish. Earlier this season, in the Africa Cup of Nations that Ivory Coast were finally supposed to win, Drogba led his country to the final before imploding against Zambia. His second-half penalty ought to have settled the matter; instead he lifted the ball high over the bar. Zambia won the trophy after a penalty shoot-out, which provided Drogba with uncomfortable d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In the final of the 2006 competition Ivory Coast had lost on penalties to Egypt and Drogba missed his kick in the shoot-out. Drogba was a Uefa Cup final loser to Valencia in 2004 with Marseille and many observers felt he was lucky to avoid a red card. Already on a booking, he kicked out in the 89th minute and was spared only by the leniency of the referee, Pierluigi Collina. Yet there was no such charity on the night that traumatised everybody connected to Chelsea in 2008. Drogba was sent off in the Champions League final defeat by Manchester United for a petulant slap at Nemanja Vidic in extra-time and everyone knows what happened next. The tremors from John Terry&apos;s missed penalty in the shoot-out that deprived Chelsea of the ultimate high have never truly dissipated, although Drogba and some of the survivors from the chaos in Moscow now have the opportunity to realign their karma. &quot;That was a difficult moment for me and the club,&quot; said Drogba. &quot;It&apos;s one memory I cannot forget. It was an experience, a first Champions League final for Chelsea, and I think we&apos;ve learned from it. I hope that this final is going to be great for us. We&apos;ve been waiting four years to be in this situation.&quot; It has been inevitable that the defeat by United has exerted an influence over the Chelsea camp in the countdown to kickoff at the Allianz Arena, yet it was notable, too, to hear the Bayern players discuss it. The Bavarian club know a thing or two about Champions League final heartbreak at the hands of United and there is a wariness that Drogba &amp; Co might resemble wounded animals. &quot;Those players who were in Moscow for the final will have the extra motivation,&quot; said the midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. &quot;They will be the most dangerous. They know maybe that it is their last chance to try and win the title they unfortunately lost there. I&apos;m talking about Drogba, [Frank] Lampard, Ashley Cole and [Michael] Essien. Drogba is a player who can get a goal out of nothing. He is probably the most dangerous.&quot; The respect and admiration for Drogba within Bayern ranks is palpable, even if it has been undercut in some quarters by an acknowledgment of his darker arts. Together with the rest of Europe, the Bayern squad watched Drogba score the only goal of Chelsea&apos;s semi-final first leg against Barcelona but spend an inordinate amount of time on the ground. &quot;Sometimes he overdoes it a bit; sometimes he is an outstanding actor on the pitch,&quot; said the Bayern manager, Jupp Heynckes. &quot;But for many years Drogba has been one of the top strikers in the Premiership and he is definitely dangerous. He can score at any moment, although it would be remiss to concentrate solely on one player.&quot; The goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said: &quot;Drogba is a total professional and a real danger to us. He gives everything and I have seen him helping out in defence, when Chelsea have been under pressure, while we know what he can do at the other end.&quot; Drogba has done it all domestically with Chelsea and his record in English cup finals marks him as a legend ahead of his time. He has won four out of four in the FA Cup, most recently against Liverpool two weeks ago, and two out of three in the Carling Cup \u2013 the blot being the 2008 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur. He has scored in all seven finals, with two coming in the 2007 Carling Cup defeat of Arsenal. Since his return from the Africa Cup of Nations in February the 34-year-old has summoned some colossal performances in the biggest games, with arguably the best coming in the Champions League last 16 second leg against Napoli and the FA Cup semi-final success over Tottenham. It is tempting to wonder why, if he remains the man for the grand occasion through the sheer force of his personality, Chelsea have not tied him to a new contract. Roberto Di Matteo, the interim coach, said he had seen nothing to suggest Drogba could not reprise such form next season. &quot;It&apos;s not a question of age,&quot; Di Matteo said. Chelsea, though, appear ready to wave him off on a Bosman free transfer, possibly to Nicolas Anelka&apos;s Shanghai Shenhua, to leave him striding to the bar at the last chance saloon. With Drogba and Chelsea the Champions League has tended to end in red cards, red mists, missed penalties and recrimination. From Liverpool&apos;s &apos;Ghost goal&apos; to Drogba&apos;s infamous meltdown after Barcelona&apos;s smash-and-grab at Stamford Bridge, the bottom line has been depressingly consistent. It surely has to change one day and Drogba intends it to be now. The tears of sorrow and rage would make victory taste implausibly sweet. Drogba stands to take his leave with the triumph to complete him.", "tags": ["Didier Drogba", "Chelsea", "Bayern Munich", "Champions League 2011-12", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-18T17:53:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/20/chinese-middle-class-snap-up-western-goods", "sentences": ["British favourites such as baked beans and cream of mushroom soup have proved an unlikely hit with Chinese shoppers at Marks &amp; Spencer&apos;s flagship store in downtown Shanghai.", "Its team in Shanghai has conducted a thorough feasibility study, following consumers in and out of shops and traditional markets.", "M&amp;S has four fashion-and-food stores in Shanghai after opening the first one, measuring 5,000 sq metres, in 2008, as well as three others in the smaller cities of Ningbo, Changzhou and Wuhan.", "It got off to a rocky start but intends to focus on Shanghai, where a rapidly growing new strata of Chinese society \u2013 the urban rich \u2013 has developed a taste for western brands from Prada to Gucci, along with French wine, Spanish olive oil and British biscuits and beer.", "Shanghai is the world&apos;s fastest-growing city economy, with a population of more than 20 million.", "Chinese food importer Gorden Wei, chairman of Shanghai Ted Enterprises and vice-president of the Shanghai Import Food Enterprises Association, says Chinese consumers are &quot;quite conceptual&quot;.", "But this does not worry Rayfield at M&amp;S, who has seen &quot;made in Britain&quot; food and drink fly off the shelves in the six months he has been in Shanghai.", "Similarly, in the City Shop adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Shanghai \u2013 part of a local supermarket chain \u2013 a box of Dorset Cereals muesli is priced at 104\u00a0yuan \u2013 roughly \u00a310.", "This shop caters mainly for expats, but a new, bigger City Shop has now opened in downtown Shanghai to lure in Chinese shoppers.", "For example, Chinese customers found Cadbury&apos;s chocolate too sweet initially, recounts Elina Wen, purchasing director at importer Pinlive (Shanghai) Foods.", "Tyrrells crisps, made on a farm in Herefordshire, have also found their way to China through a big Shanghai-based distributor, Sinodis, which also distributes Weetabix, Haribo and Dr Oetker."], "title": "From M&S to whisky \u2013 China's middle class snap up western goods", "article": "British favourites such as baked beans and cream of mushroom soup have proved an unlikely hit with Chinese shoppers at Marks &amp; Spencer&apos;s flagship store in downtown Shanghai.

At a time when British brands such as Weetabix are being gobbled up by Chinese companies, a growing number of UK businesses hope to grab their own slice of the booming Chinese grocery market. They have the full support of the UK government. As part of David Cameron&apos;s &quot;march of the makers&quot;, the government in January announced a drive to boost British food and drink exports to countries like China. Agriculture and food minister Jim Paice flew to Dubai to tout British produce the following month, and is now touring China. Food and drink is one of the biggest sub-sectors of Britain&apos;s manufacturing industry, which makes up a tenth of the economy. &quot;In so many cases the Chinese have taken over our manufacturing base, but with British food they can&apos;t do that,&quot; says Lance Forman of H Forman &amp; Sons, the last smokery still operating in east London. The firm, founded by a Jewish immigrant from Russia at the start of the last century, has been exporting smoked salmon to Hong Kong for the last 30\u00a0years and now wants to break into China. &quot;One hundred years of history \u2013 the Chinese can&apos;t copy that,&quot; he adds. Chinese eating habits have started to mimic those in the west \u2013 the growing middle class has started having cereal for breakfast rather than rice; chocolate, crisps and biscuits as special treats; and using teabags rather than traditional leaf tea. This brings mixed blessings: nutrition experts warn that obesity is already growing among the younger generation in big cities. China recently overtook the US to become the world&apos;s biggest market for grocery shopping, underpinned by an expanding population, a shift to more expensive foods and strong economic growth. It is predicted to grow twice as fast as the US to be worth almost \u00a3950bn by 2015 \u2013 from \u00a3609bn at the end of 2011 \u2013 according to industry researchers\u00a0IGD. Tesco already has more than 100 stores in China, and Sainsbury&apos;s is believed to be in talks with a potential partner about entering the Chinese market. Its team in Shanghai has conducted a thorough feasibility study, following consumers in and out of shops and traditional markets. A spokesman said: &quot;We do not see international expansion as part of our short-term plans but we are exploring other possibilities for growth in the medium to long term.&quot; Sainsbury&apos;s is still smarting from its disastrous foray into Egypt in 1999. It pulled out in 2001 after running up losses of more than \u00a3100m in just two years in the country, which had no tradition of supermarket shopping. Sainsbury&apos;s then chairman, Sir Peter Davis, admitted the company had gone in &quot;too far, too fast&quot;. M&amp;S has four fashion-and-food stores in Shanghai after opening the first one, measuring 5,000 sq metres, in 2008, as well as three others in the smaller cities of Ningbo, Changzhou and Wuhan. It got off to a rocky start but intends to focus on Shanghai, where a rapidly growing new strata of Chinese society \u2013 the urban rich \u2013 has developed a taste for western brands from Prada to Gucci, along with French wine, Spanish olive oil and British biscuits and beer. Shanghai is the world&apos;s fastest-growing city economy, with a population of more than 20 million. Chinese food importer Gorden Wei, chairman of Shanghai Ted Enterprises and vice-president of the Shanghai Import Food Enterprises Association, says Chinese consumers are &quot;quite conceptual&quot;. That is to say, they associate wine with France (in particular Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild from the Bordeaux region), chocolate with Belgium and whisky with Scotland. He worries that Chinese shoppers are not sophisticated enough to remember more than a handful of western brands. &quot;We&apos;re doing a missionary job; we&apos;re educating people about other brands,&quot; says Wei. He also warns British exporters not to expect to sell in big volumes, arguing that goods such as Campbells Shortbread are regarded as a &quot;high-end product&quot; in China. But this does not worry Rayfield at M&amp;S, who has seen &quot;made in Britain&quot; food and drink fly off the shelves in the six months he has been in Shanghai. Some 17,000 packs of crisps and nuts were sold in the last quarter, more than double the level a year ago, as well as 35,000 pieces of frozen fish, up 26%. Much of the western food available, such as biscuits and chocolate, is bought by consumers as gifts for others or treats for themselves. &quot;We&apos;re at the top end of the market,&quot; says Rayfield. &quot;The Chinese customer sees us for that as well. They come in to top up, to buy a treat from us. We&apos;re not going to be an everyday supermarket.&quot; That doesn&apos;t come as a big surprise after a quick look at the high price tag. Similarly, in the City Shop adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Shanghai \u2013 part of a local supermarket chain \u2013 a box of Dorset Cereals muesli is priced at 104\u00a0yuan \u2013 roughly \u00a310. A pack of PG Tips is 78 yuan. This shop caters mainly for expats, but a new, bigger City Shop has now opened in downtown Shanghai to lure in Chinese shoppers. Different taste buds are another challenge. For example, Chinese customers found Cadbury&apos;s chocolate too sweet initially, recounts Elina Wen, purchasing director at importer Pinlive (Shanghai) Foods. As in other countries, Tesco has adapted its ranges to cater for local tastes. For example, it stocks lots of bulk rice, many different types of live fish and has a dim sum counter. It also offers a wide range of baby products \u2013 formula milk, disposable nappies, strollers and bikes \u2013 because China&apos;s one-child policy means that families spend a lot of money on their only child. Tesco has opened more than 100 \u00a0hypermarkets along the Chinese east coast since its launch there in 2004. It has also developed its own shopping malls, branded &quot;Lifespace&quot;, which are anchored by a Tesco store. At last count sales in the country had reached \u00a31.3bn. Tyrrells crisps, made on a farm in Herefordshire, have also found their way to China through a big Shanghai-based distributor, Sinodis, which also distributes Weetabix, Haribo and Dr Oetker. &quot;If you want a little bit of England, Tyrrells is for you,&quot; says the firm&apos;s marketing director, Oliver Rudgard. &quot;The Chinese market is very similar to India: it has not reached its full potential. The large retail brands only have tens of outlets. As they grow, we grow with them.&quot;", "tags": ["Food & drink industry", "Business", "China", "Marks & Spencer", "Retail industry", "Tesco", "Supermarkets", "J Sainsbury"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-19T23:06:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/20/catherine-bennett-steve-hilton-shabby-dresser", "sentences": ["How worrying is it that, in Shanghai, prior to the 2010 World Expo, its traditionally pyjama-wearing citizens proved remarkably resistant to dedicated nightwear police and signs saying: &quot;Pyjamas don&apos;t go out of the door&quot;?"], "title": "There's power dressing and then there's Steve Hilton | Catherine Bennett", "article": "Ridiculously, the search engine for the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies retrieves nothing about local dress codes. All that can be assumed from related images is that scholars within this prestigious research centre, part of Stanford University in California, favour dark suits and ties for formal occasions, open-necked pale blue shirts for seminars, accessorised with a pair of trousers and, one gathers, shoes. Steve Hilton, whose arrival at the institute is expected any time, has been celebrated, throughout his residency in Downing Street for coming to the office in a T-shirt, shorts and plimsolls, the latter removed on arrival. There is a hint of the man&apos;s daring, perhaps, in the FSI&apos;s announcement of its new asset, in which he is introduced to unsuspecting suits as &quot;Cameron&apos;s top adviser&quot;. His academic function is to &quot;focus on innovation in government, public services and communities around the world&quot;. But omitted from this encomium is what must surely pass for Hilton&apos;s greatest contribution yet to modern international relations: wearing socks to meet President Obama. In The Language of Clothes, Alison Lurie claimed dress as a means of communication, albeit one which can be a bit one-sided. &quot;Even if we are never introduced,&quot; she explains, &quot;clothes tell about class status, age, family origin, personal opinion, taste, current mood or even give information about erotic interest and sexual status.&quot; So: Steve Hilton. What have his clothes been telling us or, more specifically, the prime minister and the US president? Not forgetting those bureaucrats who have been treated, these past two years, to his lectures on the uselessness of bureaucrats? Sometimes, given that a Hilton T-shirt might say &quot;Big Society&quot;, the message was necessarily incomprehensible. But was there meaningful content, too, in his Bart Simpson-wear? In the Downing Street context \u2013 one in which, like many offices, people are expected to dress formally or pay the price \u2013 Mr Hilton&apos;s creased shorts seem, at their most polite, to have been a permanent reminder to colleagues that he was/is different, to wit, a dashing free spirit, young beyond his years and endowed with creative talents on a scale that liberate him to move on any time his plans for trashing the state should cease to be appreciated by the resident dullards, including the neatly pressed prime minister. His determination to affirm this specialness to Barack Obama through the ancient language of socks is slightly less easy to read and may even have been a miscalculation, given that sock-wearing can mean, in some cultures, &quot;I&apos;m a complete git&quot;. Was it wise, now that Hilton has transferred his mission to the States, to advertise his intellectual superiority to the White House&apos;s dapper, highly polished black shoe-wearer? Even Hilton&apos;s greatest rival for in-your-face sartorial insolence, Facebook&apos;s Mark Zuckerberg, wore a jacket, tie \u2013 and shoes \u2013 to meet the president. Definitely indecipherable, to those of us communicating at a distance with Mr Hilton&apos;s clothes, has been their level of hygiene. Now, thanks to the political writer Sue Cameron, who chose the week of Hilton&apos;s departure to record a story about his arrival at a policy meeting in shorts and shoe-less, with a plastic bag of oranges, we can experience his clothing in Sensurround. &quot;Mr Hilton started inexpertly peeling an orange,&quot; she says. &quot;There was juice everywhere, not least over the crotch of his brushed cotton shorts. Unabashed, he went off to his next meeting \u2013 with some military top brass.&quot; Compared with this, Boris Johnson&apos;s trademark I&apos;m-too-clever-for-my-shorts state of dishevelment is actively ingratiating. Hilton&apos;s power stains were a clear &quot;fuck you&quot; to passing dignitaries, more akin to Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s historic visit in pyjamas to a venture capital firm called Sequoia, which had previously sacked his partner. David Kirkpatrick, his biographer, quotes Zuckerberg saying he now regrets the insult: &quot;I assume we really offended them and now I feel really bad about that.&quot; But Zuckerberg has, of course, stuck doggedly to his old, Harvard genius outfit of hoodie and jeans, Silicon Valley&apos;s answer to ermine. &quot;He&apos;s actually showing investors he doesn&apos;t care that much; he&apos;s going to be him,&quot; a suited analyst, Michael Pachter, complained to Bloomberg TV recently, having received, accurately, Zuckerberg&apos;s message of unshakable entrepreneurial confidence. &quot;I think that&apos;s a mark of immaturity,&quot; he added, usefully enhancing the young Facebook brand at the same time that he condemned Zuckerberg to a lifetime in formal slobwear. In fact, thanks to Zuckerberg and The Social Network, it could be many years before any other technological visionary gains access to venture capital without being dressed in whatever would get a normal person banned from Tesco. Perhaps this modern adaptation of sumptuary laws, whereby only the very richest and most powerful enjoy a licence to dress like losers, helps account for a reported tendency for Oxford students to arrive in their pyjamas for breakfast in college halls where, since the catering staff are presumably washed and dressed, their disarray can be read as a crass assertion of privilege. Unless, as some disgusted comment assumes, far from being inspired by brainy iconoclasts, the students are simply replicating the habits of that other, growing section of the British population that has taken to staying in pyjamas and slippers for the rather different reason that, like depressives, they see no point in getting dressed. Alternatively, now that leading designers have, inevitably, attempted their own dismal take on outdoor pyjamas, the students may merely attest to the terrifying reach of fashion&apos;s Stella McCartney. Whatever the reason, public confusion around the language of pyjamas suggests enough lingering interest in dress codes to make public nightwear a risky choice outside Wall Street. With their hypersensitivity about appearances, our Olympic authorities will naturally be wondering how to raise standards. What will the world make of our pyjamas? Our mayor? Will it be enough to clear the litter, exile Hilton and tie a large label reading &quot;English eccentric&quot; to Johnson&apos;s ear? How worrying is it that, in Shanghai, prior to the 2010 World Expo, its traditionally pyjama-wearing citizens proved remarkably resistant to dedicated nightwear police and signs saying: &quot;Pyjamas don&apos;t go out of the door&quot;? As so often, President Obama has something sensible to say on the matter. Asked about another clothing nuisance mysteriously overlooked by Tesco \u2013 that of visible underpants and low-slung jeans \u2013 he rejected official action. &quot;Having said that, brothers should pull up their pants. You are walking by your mother, your grandmother, your underwear is showing. There are some issues that we face, that you don&apos;t have to pass a law, but that doesn&apos;t mean folks can&apos;t have some sense and some respect for other people and, you know, some people might not want to see your underwear \u2013 I&apos;m one of them.&quot; Bear in mind, however: this was the liberalism of a brother who had never seen Steve Hilton with orange stains all over his crotch.

Click here to view trailer The first trailer for Skyfall, the 23rd James Bond movie, has a curious role to fulfil. On one hand, as the first Bond outing for four years, it has to meet a certain amount of expectation. Then again, since Quantum of Solace was so unapologetically woeful, the Skyfall trailer could simply consist of Daniel Craig clattering into the side of a shed again and again and it&apos;d invariably be seen as an improvement. Until now, the only information we&apos;ve had has come in the form of promotional images (teaching us that Bond&apos;s penchant for horrible swimwear has now been augmented by a fondness for creepy leather gloves) and a poster (telling us that Bond still likes to dress up in his Sunday best to shoot people in tunnels). However, the Skyfall trailer is now with us, which means we now know more than ever about what the film holds in store. The trailer opens with an awkward, po-faced game of Mallett&apos;s Mallet between Daniel Craig and an unidentified government psychologist behind a two-way mirror. &quot;Country?&quot; the psychologist asks. &quot;England,&quot; replies Bond. Then &quot;Gun?&quot; &quot;Shot.&quot; Then, as we catch our first glimpse of Bond without a top on: &quot;Agent?&quot; &quot;Provocateur.&quot; For a moment, you suspect that Skyfall might in fact be a terrible James Bond/Rocky Horror cross-dressing hybrid. But then Bond is asked &quot;Skyfall?&quot; and one of his eyes momentarily narrows, making him look like Thom Yorke if Thom Yorke was a nightclub bouncer. Just as the psychologist is about to smack him across the head with an oversized foam hammer, Bond gets his act together and replies: &quot;Done.&quot; The question of the trailer, then, is: what is Skyfall? A place? An operation? The rest of the trailer commits itself to offering clues. We cut to Shanghai, where a woman in a nice dress is gazing at the Bund. Then Bond walking into a room firing a gun. Then some coffins. Then a fiery river parade. Could Skyfall be Chinese? Before we have time to figure it out, we see Naomie Harris tenderly shaving Bond&apos;s face \u2013 perhaps because he&apos;s been crying in the shower fully dressed again, as he&apos;s done an awful lot since Daniel Craig started playing him. A few quick impressionist shots of helicopters and men falling into water later and \u2013 because this is a trailer for a film to be released in 2012 \u2013 the dubstep kicks in. There&apos;s a tube crash. Another fall. A shot of Bond and Judi Dench peering at a hill. And then a man in silhouette \u2013 presumably Javier Bardem&apos;s villain \u2013 doing his best Joker impression as he strolls away from a fire. The Skyfall trailer ends with Bond intoning, &quot;Some men are coming to kill us. We&apos;re going to kill them first,&quot; before we&apos;re hit by a final barrage of explosions and gunfire and more dubstep and some Volkswagens being smashed up. And that&apos;s all there is, at least until the next trailer comes along to offer us a little more in the way of exposition. So what is Skyfall? On the basis of this trailer, it might be Asian in origin. Or it could just as easily be Scottish. Or the name of a particularly hard-to-find Skrillrex remix. There&apos;s honestly no way of knowing at this point. Still, at least James Bond is finally back.

Box-office figures in China are growing rapidly as more and more screens are opened, but cinemas in the US are having a tougher time. AMC lost $73m (\u00a346m) in the fourth quarter of 2011.

The new owner&apos;s chairman, the Beijing-based real estate developer and billionaire Wang Jianlin, said he wanted to see AMC grow in both the US and abroad. The current trend for Sino-US co-operation has also seen Hollywood increasingly looking east, encouraged by the recent relaxation of the quota on foreign films allowed into China and the popularity of American-made but China-based international blockbusters such as Kung Fu Panda 2.

The 41-year-old claimed the club&apos;s first European Cup, along with the FA Cup, to transform a traumatic campaign into arguably the most successful in the club&apos;s history, generating a groundswell of support among the players and supporters for Di Matteo&apos;s position to be made permanent. Yet the owner, who flew back with the team on Sunday morning and will spend the week in London, is unlikely to be swayed by public opinion when it comes to appointing a permanent successor for Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. The job spec has arguably changed dramatically from that of 4 March, when Di Matteo was installed as caretaker charged with salvaging a season. His contract is due to expire on 30 June and, while he could be offered terms to remain on the coaching staff if he is not chosen as manager, his instinct would be to seek a No1 role. Ideally that would be at Chelsea, though his reputation has been hugely enhanced over the last 11 weeks. He will not want for offers. Regardless, whoever takes over will find his in-tray already cluttered. Ensure he takes the diplomatic route The Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, has suggested this will be another summer of evolution at Stamford Bridge with &quot;one or two in, and one or two out&quot;, meaning plenty of those perceived as the old guard will still be at the club next season. With that in mind, whoever takes over permanently must learn from the mistakes made by Villas-Boas during his fractious nine-month spell in charge, and from the manner in which Di Matteo coaxed more familiar form from experienced personnel. Villas-Boas lacked diplomacy dealing with influential members of the squad. Too many senior players felt marginalised \u2013 Frank Lampard went public with his complaints over the lack of dialogue \u2013 as they spent time on the fringes and struggled to adapt to the systems and style demanded by the management. Di Matteo brought simplicity, clarity of communication and some common sense to proceedings, as well as his own shrewd tactical eye, and those who had been labouring duly flourished. The Italian&apos;s role was crisis management which demanded he had everyone onside, and that scenario is very different now. Even so, given strong characters will remain, the manager must pick his arguments carefully. Appease those squad players who could be left grumbling on the fringes A decision may have to be made on those who have slipped from first-team regulars to squad players in recent years. Does Salomon Kalou warrant a new deal? Florent Malouda and Paulo Ferreira still have a year to run on their current contracts, while Michael Essien is not the dynamic player he once was, his impact nullified by knee injuries: can they be satisfied with life as bit-part players, or would this be an apt time for a parting of the ways? Likewise, is Raul Meireles, a favourite of Villas-Boas, to be integral from now on in? Others who fell out of favour when Chelsea clicked into &quot;Save Our Season&quot; mode include the youngsters Daniel Sturridge and Oriol Romeu, while Josh McEachran and Romelu Lukaku hardly saw the first team. All will be seeking more regular involvement from now on in. Prove there is life after Didier Drogba The Ivorian has confirmed he will be leaving the club, his last kick having delivered the European Cup, with Shanghai Shenhua expected to secure his services on lavish wages. Drogba has been central to so much Chelsea have achieved over the last eight years \u2013 in terms of the goals he has scored but also as a focal point for the team&apos;s style and approach \u2013 and his muscular presence and sense of timing were key to their two trophies this term. They will be diminished on the biggest stages in his absence, meaning the manager must find this team a new talisman. Or, perhaps, he can hope he will inherit one \u2026 Solve the Fernando Torres conundrum This used to mean working out how to conjure form from the \u00a350m forward, but it now signifies making the Spaniard feel wanted. Torres&apos; outburst within three hours of the final whistle at the Allianz Arena, declaring his dismay at having only started the Champions League final on the bench, and at his absence from the initial list of penalty takers for the shoot-out (Gary Cahill, not Torres, would have taken Chelsea&apos;s sixth had it been needed), was untimely and did not impress the club&apos;s hierarchy. Victory was supposed to be about the collective, not prompt gripes from the individual. But the 28-year-old clearly yearns to be loved and does not yet feel pivotal \u2013 or even, perhaps, properly accepted \u2013 in this team. Drogba&apos;s departure might help, thrusting him higher up the pecking order, though Abramovich could easily opt to spend lavishly on a Radamel Falcao, Hulk or Edinson Cavani as a direct replacement. How would Torres react then? Find a style of play that will enthuse hierarchy and support This has been the biggest ask laid down by Abramovich so far: imitate the Barcelona style while simultaneously challenging for, and claiming, silverware. Villas-Boas had attempted to instigate the swagger of his team from Porto at Stamford Bridge and, with time, might have succeeded. Yet he had quickly determined that many of those he had inherited would not be up to the task, and results were stodgy with the football only occasionally exhilarating. Di Matteo was pragmatic and, when confronted by the might of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, eked defensive performances from experienced players to prevail. But the brief for the new coach will still be to supply prizes with panache. Claiming a European Cup against all the odds will have whetted the appetite, not satisfied it.

Drogba is expected to join the money-flushed Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua, who could offer wages of up to \u00a3250,000 a week, after telling France Football magazine that he broke down when telling his team-mates that he will be moving on. The 34-year-old said he did not &quot;envisage sitting on the bench watching others play at a time when the club is looking at putting together a new team&quot; \u2013 and it appears this fresh Chelsea will have room for Torres, who within hours of the European Cup triumph voiced exasperation at playing second fiddle to Drogba. The Spaniard claimed starting on the substitutes&apos; bench that night represented &quot;perhaps the biggest disappointment of my life&quot; and called for clarity from the club&apos;s management as to what role he is to play in the future. No meeting is planned with either Torres, who has since departed for a holiday on Ibiza ahead of linking up with the Spain squad, or his representative, though there was dismay among club officials that such a high-profile player should potentially sour the otherwise buoyant mood. Torres&apos;s comments, delivered in the mixed zone at the Allianz Arena as the players departed the stadium still digesting their victory, came with Drogba&apos;s eight-year spell at Chelsea drawing to a close. The Ivorian&apos;s contract will expire next month and he told France Football: &quot;We [he and his team-mates] will not be together next season,&quot; he said. &quot;As I have decided to leave, I wanted to tell them to their faces. &quot;They made me break down. I found it hard to admit that it was finished with me and the club. But I don&apos;t envisage sitting on the bench watching others play at a time when the club is looking at putting together a new team. So there we go, I am readying myself for a great leap into the unknown. It will be another adventure.&quot; Drogba&apos;s departure will have implications for Torres. The Spaniard, who has scored 12 goals in 67 appearances for the club, is not agitating for a move despite suggestions of interest from M\u00e1laga and will not be sanctioned for his comments. Ron Gourlay, Chelsea&apos;s chief executive, in an interview with Sky Sports News, put the outburst down to emotion. &quot;Everybody wants to play and I would be very surprised if Fernando [hadn&apos;t],&quot; said Gourlay. &quot;I&apos;m sure he wanted to play more games, and more time on the field as every professional player does. But it&apos;s the emotion of the time as well, the biggest day in our history. You&apos;ve got to take these things into account.&quot; Gourlay&apos;s most pressing task remains the appointment of a long-term successor to Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas with the interim first-team coach Roberto Di\u00a0Matteo&apos;s contract due to expire on 30 June. The Italian, who transformed the club&apos;s season over his 11-week stint in charge, will effectively be left in limbo into next week as Roman Abramovich and his board consider their next move. A list of candidates has been drawn up and is still headed by Pep Guardiola, who will leave Barcelona after the Copa del Rey final but intends to take a one-year sabbatical from the game. Fabio Capello, Laurent Blanc and Harry Redknapp would come under consideration. One option open to Abramovich is to offer Di Matteo a deal for a further year, to be reassessed next summer when Guardiola may be ready to return to football. How Di Matteo, who will attract no shortage of offers following his feats at Stamford Bridge, would react to that remains to be seen. &quot;He&apos;s done fantastically well,&quot; said Gourlay. &quot;Everybody got behind him and here we are.

The money-flushed Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua, managed by his former Chelsea team\u2011mate Nicolas Anelka, remains his most likely destination. While the London club&apos;s hierarchy had anticipated a parting of the ways this summer, the 34-year-old&apos;s decision was determined only after Bayern Munich were defeated at the weekend, with his last touch for the club proving to be the decisive penalty in the shootout at the Allianz Arena. &quot;I would have stayed if we hadn&apos;t won the Champions League,&quot; said Drogba. &quot;That was my challenge, what I wanted to achieve. It would have been very difficult to leave if we hadn&apos;t won the Champions League because we have been chasing this trophy for eight years, since I have been here, and we were always close to it. &quot;We even saw the cup in Moscow [in the 2008 final against Manchester United], walking by it, and we could not touch it. That was the challenge for the boys who were in Moscow. We wanted to go back and win it. It is important not only as a player, but as a man, to fix targets and try to achieve them. We wanted to win the Champions League.&quot; Drogba believes Fernando Torres, who has endured life in the Ivorian&apos;s shadow since his \u00a350m British record move from Liverpool 16 months ago, will now flourish in his absence as the veteran seeks his &quot;new challenge&quot;. &quot;Everybody knows Fernando is a very good player, an international player,&quot; said Drogba, whose goal against Bayern had been the first either has scored while both on the pitch as Chelsea players. &quot;He&apos;s been through difficult moments here. It happens to everyone. &quot;The good thing is he has our support and I know, next season, he will improve and he&apos;s going to be better. Now I can&apos;t complain but my first few seasons here were very difficult. It&apos;s not easy to play for Chelsea. But this club is in good hands with Fernando. Of course we will need new strikers but Torres will do the job, he will do it. He will do it, no doubt. &quot;The club tried hard enough [to keep me] but I want a new challenge. It has been a fantastic eight years. It&apos;s been a pleasure and an honour to wear the blue shirt and to achieve everything we did here, all these trophies. The best for me was to finish on a high with this Champions League final. &quot;It was the best of the best, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.

In the optimism over the nuclear talks, Iran&apos;s rail which had fallen to a record low, experiencing devaluation of more than 50% against the dollar after the west&apos;s decision on imposing an embargo against the imports of Iranian oil, has now regained a significant part of its value.  On Wednesday, one dollar could buy around 16,630 rials, in comparison to a month ago when it could buy more than 20,000. A combination of western sanctions and threats of war had sent the rial tailspinning, making dollars hard to come by and increased the price of gold significantly.  Senior officials in Iran have expressed hope that Baghdad talks would be successful in reaching a breakthrough deal in future.  &quot;The ideas fielded to us speak of the fact that the other side would like to make Baghdad a success,&quot; Iran&apos;s foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, said in a news conference in Tehran. &quot;We hope that in a day or two we can bring good news.&quot; Despite being optimistic, he warned against any pressure on Iran and criticised the US Congress&apos;s recent decision to impose further sanctions on the country.

In my opinion this is a strategic mistake.

In a message to the conference, president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad reiterated that Tehran is adamant in its opposition to acquisition and possession of nuclear weapons. &quot;Our country&apos;s explicit stance and goal is the creation of a world free from the Weapons of Mass Destruction,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the Fars semi-official news agency. &quot;The world community should ask for the trial of the US and 14 European countries for selling chemical weapons to Saddam [during the 8-year Iraqi imposed war against Iran].&quot;  Meanwhile, in the anticipation that Iranian officials might compromise in Baghdad, the head of Iran&apos;s judiciary, Ayatollah Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani, who is an influential figure among the country&apos;s clerics, warned against any retreat from the Iranian side over enriching uranium.

Pity poor Joey Barton then because after Big Sunday Paper took him to an art gallery the other day, the aesthetic feast around him forced the midfielder into a bad trip. Before he knew it, Joey thought he was England&apos;s Brave John Terry in a Big Cup semi-final and spent QPR&apos;s final game of the season booting as many innocent bystanders as he could. Either that or he&apos;s a bit of a fool. But any man that lays into Alan Shearer is worthy of the benefit of the doubt so we&apos;re labelling this one under S for Stendahl. Unfortunately Barton failed to plead temporary insanity and the FA has banned him for 12 matches. &quot;There are rules of conduct that should be adhered to, and such behaviour [waging total war on Man City] tarnishes the image of football in this country, particularly as this match was the pinnacle of the domestic season and watched by millions around the globe,&quot; droned an FA statement, pleading us all to think of the children. Especially the ones in countries who stump up loads of money for TV rights. Despite the fact that the midfielder might as well have not been there for half of QPR&apos;s games last season, Barton&apos;s lengthy absence casts doubt on his future at Loftus Road. PFA chief Gordon Taylor reckons Barton needs professional help. &quot;I&apos;m not saying I won&apos;t support him because he does need that help but it&apos;s recurring and he&apos;s getting to the later stages of his career and it does get very exasperating and frustrating,&quot; sighed Taylor, telling Barton for the hundredth time to finish his greens and tidy his room. &quot;We should be including with some of these penalties that during this period the player has to undergo anger management and look to deal with the problem that you&apos;ve had to prevent it happening in the future.&quot; A lesson there to all of you who haven&apos;t already been driven insane by the beauty of the Fiver&apos;s prose.

So clearly there has to be a fundamental change in the way that consumers consume.&quot; With that observation Jo Confino, chair of Guardian Sustainable Business, kicked off a prescient and ideas-packed debate around sustainable consumption. Joining Jo on the panel at the Guardian&apos;s London offices were: Ian Cheshire, chief executive of Kingfisher; Bruno Berthon, global managing director of sustainability services at Accenture; and Umair Haque, director at Havas Media Labs and social media expert. Peggy Liu, chairperson of The Joint US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy (JUCCCE) also joined the panel from Shanghai via telepresence. First word went to Accenture&apos;s Bruno Berthon, who spelt out a vision for a consumer model based on the notion of &quot;More with Less&quot;. Sounds good, but how realistic is it? Referring to a recent World Economic Forum report on the same topic, he identified the two big challenges ahead: &quot;Identifying the consumer that is willing to get engaged, and finding a new set of products and services.&quot; Get it right and companies could stand to tap into a market opportunity for sustainable goods and services worth an estimated $2 trillion, Berthon reckoned. Again, that&apos;s all good. Millions of dollars will move individual companies; billions will get industry as a whole on board. A similar upbeat message was streamed in from Brussels. A low-carbon, clean energy tomorrow is there for businesses to seize, assured Connie Hedegaard, European Commissioner for Climate Action. All it requires is for companies to &quot;reinvent themselves&quot;. The prize? A future characterised by sustainable jobs and sustainable growth. &quot;The right technologies are already available and the right conditions to shift to a more sustainable world are at hand. It&apos;s now up to businesses to guide consumers in their purchasing choices and help them vote with their pockets, vote with the purse, for a greener, cleaner tomorrow&quot;, Hedegaard stated. Welcome though this rosy view is from the ivory towers of policy-making, are businesses realistically in a position to just click a magic sustainability switch? And if they are poised to flood the market with green products, are consumers even that interested? The consensus throughout the debate was &apos;no&apos; in both cases. A qualified &apos;no&apos;, that is. Speaking again via satellite, the World Economic Forum&apos;s head of consumer industries, Sarita Nayyar, stressed that work has to be done on both the supply and demand side. Focusing on the latter, she pointed to the &quot;huge gap&quot; between intention and action when it comes to consumer behaviour. Around the world, the majority of people&apos;s good intentions don&apos;t translate into patterns at the till. Most consumer experts, if they&apos;re honest, don&apos;t really understand that anomaly. Nayyar&apos;s suggestion is refreshingly simple: &quot;Instead of saying, &apos;Here&apos;s a sustainable product and here&apos;s an unsustainable product, and we want you to choose the sustainable one&apos;, I think it needs to be a situation where the choices being offered to consumers do meet their needs in terms of the performance of the product, in terms of convenience and in terms of price, while also enabling it to be a level of consumption that is also sustainable.&quot; Simple to say, but much harder in practice. Accenture&apos;s head of sustainability services for Asia, Peter Lacy, gave some grounds for hope. Top of his list was Unilever, with the &quot;ambitious, transformational goals&quot; of its Sustainable Living Plan: doubling the top line, while halving its environmental impact. UK retailer M&amp;S is also nudging consumers with the offer of store vouchers in exchange for clothing donations (&apos;Shwopping&apos;). Examples like these are all well and good, but there was an unease as the debate went on that these kinds of incremental solutions don&apos;t go far enough. Is it all just tinkering around the edges? Is an overhaul of the whole system what is really needed? Step forward Havas Media Labs&apos; Umair Haque. Consuming our way out of a consumption crisis is, he suggested, logically absurd. What we need is a paradigm shift: a move from a model premised on &apos;hedonic growth&quot; to &quot;eudaimonic growth&quot;. &apos;Eudaimonic&apos;. Huh? Think Aristotelian ethics and political philosophy, he clarified after the event. &quot;Meaning a life fully well lived&quot;. Still blank? According to Haque, our consumption-soaked notion of happiness requires about $70k a year to satisfy. With average incomes hovering around $10k, we need to rethink the &quot;threshold for happiness&quot;. In short, Haque maintained, it&apos;s time to reappraise the idea that more stuff equals greater contentment: &quot;The real problem is not sustainability in terms of consuming too much, but [the problem is] consuming too much for really dumb reasons.&quot; Haque had laid down the gauntlet. Now it&apos;s little surprise that Kingfisher&apos;s Ian Cheshire didn&apos;t seize it with both hands. Cheshire may be one of the FTSE&apos;s most vocal sustainability advocates, but he still has a public company to run and investors to whom he must answer. So, no, Cheshire isn&apos;t about to slash product sales across the board in the name of sustainability. That said, he has ditched patio heaters, which he described as emblematically &quot;bad&quot;. For Cheshire, it comes down to enabling consumers to make good choices. Starting with non-toxic paints and certified timber, over 13% of B&amp;Q&apos;s 50,000 plus products are now environmentally-certified. That&apos;s a revenue stream of over \u00a31billion. A tidy sum. Cheshire didn&apos;t show himself to be totally closed to radical thinking, though. Might there be alternatives to all-out ownership, for example? Leasing was a theme touched on several times through the discussion. WhipCar, for instance, the new neighbour-to-neighbour car-sharing programme, was the kind of disruptive idea that he welcomed. In the case of B&amp;Q, the company is experimenting with community-based leasing schemes, whereby local people essentially rent tools through street clubs. &quot;Power tools are used for five minutes per year. That&apos;s clearly not a sustainable model... We then make our money through micro-usage payments rather than a one-time sale margin.&quot; The nuts-and-bolts of creating business models that favour sustainable consumption can&apos;t be achieved overnight, according to Cheshire. It&apos;s a &quot;multi-year&quot; process. B&amp;Q began its sustainable timber programme 15 years ago. It&apos;s only now beginning to shout about it. Furthermore, companies &quot;don&apos;t do change very well&quot;, he confessed. That teed things up nicely for Peggy Liu, chairperson of The Joint US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy. &quot;In China, India and other emerging economies, they&apos;re used to change... In China, every five years it&apos;s practically a different country&quot;, she noted. Arguably, therefore, we might be best off looking to the dynamic markets of the developing world for answers on how to shift consumer patterns. One way Liu&apos;s organisation is doing that is using the &quot;soft power&quot; of social media platforms like Sina Weibo to tap into what&apos;s &quot;cool and hot&quot;. And what&apos;s not, too. &quot;That fat, rotund guy coming out of a Hummer&quot;, for instance. Liu has talks set up with Saatchi and Saatchi this July to try and take her &quot;visual lexicon&quot; further afield. The last big issue of the day centred on choice editing: that&apos;s to say, the idea that companies can force consumers&apos; hand by removing unsustainable options from the shelves. In China, it&apos;s simple. The government decides, and the next day it&apos;s law. That&apos;s what happened with plastic bags. Up to 24 billion went out of circulation at a single swipe. Those in more democratically-governed countries felt uncomfortable at the idea of such unilateral tactics. That said, B&amp;Q&apos;s Ian Cheshire did concede that progressive companies should lobby for political action if markets continue to fail to send the right signals. When it comes to factoring sustainability into business patterns, &quot;politicians are more scared than businessmen&quot;, he added. &quot;We need to be more demanding on the regulators and governments for more aggressive frameworks.&quot; Setting a real price on the cost of carbon or water would, he argued, be a good place to start. The final word went to the audience in London. Speaking from the floor, Solitaire Townsend, co-founder of sustainability communications firm Futerra, suggested that companies spell out two things: first, why do they want us, the consumer, to be more sustainable and second, be clear on what&apos;s in it for us. &quot;We all find behaviour change difficult. I find it hard to diet, let alone live a more sustainable lifestyle... So help me. It&apos;s really, really difficult to be green. And secondly, tell me why it&apos;s better. Am I going to get more sleep, more sex? Am I going to be thinner, fitter? Am I going to spend more time with my family? Is it going to be more fun?&quot; On that frank note, a challenging session drew to a close. Ultimately, the discussion presented more questions, than answers. That just goes to show how tricky it is to re-engineer today&apos;s consumer-driven business models. But re-engineer them we must, or we&apos;ll continue to consume ourselves into deeper and deeper trouble. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

If you said Norman Foster you&apos;d be right in one way. Last week, his practice was declared the largest in Britain for the first time, according to the Architects&apos; Journal&apos;s annual top 100 poll, which goes by the number of UK qualified architects employed. Foster now has 304 architects, 12 more than BDP Architects, which has held the top spot almost every year since the survey began. Foster continues to bag major projects abroad on an almost weekly basis. Last week it was a new museum for the display of Roman Artefacts in Narbonne, before that a new &quot;museum of the 21st century&quot; in Datong, China. But this week, another architect displayed a more subtle \u2013 perhaps even supernatural \u2013 kind of power: David Chipperfield. Not only is he directing this year&apos;s Venice Architecture Biennale , but he was nominated by AJ readers as the person they thought had made the most significant contribution to the profession. On top of that, he also appears to have the ear of the coalition government. Admittedly, it might be coincidence, but at a presentation of his Venice plans last week, he wondered aloud, &quot;what the hell happened to housing?&quot; And lamented Britain&apos;s failure to follow Europe&apos;s model of medium-density housing, use of brownfield sites, prevention of urban sprawl and generally commit to building more affordable homes. Chipperfield is by no means the first person to bemoan such matters, but next thing you know, on Wednesday Nick Clegg is promising a &quot;massive capital investment&quot; in state-backed projects including infrastructure and, yes, housing. Don&apos;t call it a Plan B, but it&apos;s the sort of thing architects have been waiting to hear, not to mention citizens already hit by housing benefit caps, soaring property and rental prices, chronic undersupply, etc. Meanwhile, over at Prime Minister&apos;s Questions, David Cameron fleetingly acknowledged the important role of construction and architecture, saying they were &quot;an area that Britain excels at&quot;. Does Chipperfield have a direct line to Downing Street we don&apos;t know about? He also suggested forming a new team to tackle social housing, comprised of politicians, advisers and developers like Stuart Lipton (current chairman of Chelsfield, for whom Chipperfield is designing a new residential scheme in London). So let&apos;s see if Clegg and Cameron follow his advice. They could call it &quot;Plan C&quot;.     West's world ... the auditorium, designed by Donda and OMA, in which Kanye West's short film was screened at the Cannes film festival. Photograph: Philippe Ruault    Then again, perhaps the future of architecture is, in fact, hip-hop. Over at the Cannes film festival this week, protean rapper-slash-design guru Kanye West unveiled his latest grandiose project: Cruel Summer, a 30-minute short film projected over seven screens. The jury is literally out on the quality of the movie (it wasn&apos;t in competition), though you can read the Guardian&apos;s verdict here. More intriguing for our purposes was the pyramidal temporary auditorium designed to screen the movie. The 200-seat structure was a collaboration between West&apos;s new Donda design collective and Dutch supremos OMA \u2013 not Rem Koolhaas this time but another partner, Shohei Shigematsu. You can see more images here. On to a more traditional end-of-the-pier show now \u2013 literally. Southend Pier, to be precise, for which Scandinavian practice White has designed a new cultural centre, working with London architects Sprunt. No concession has been made to the Victorian architecture of the world&apos;s longest pleasure pier. The main element of White&apos;s design is an angular box with glazed ends and a soaring roof, &quot;sculpted by wave and wind&quot; as they put it. It will house a cafe/restaurant and multi-purpose hall looking out over the Thames estuary, while an adjacent free-standing bank of seating creates an open-air theatre outside the building \u2013 an indication that Southend is aiming beyond the penny arcade market. White say they plan to transform the local landmark &quot;from one oblong entertainment space to an urban thoroughfare&quot;. The construction is as intriguing as the design: the steel frame of the building was prefabricated up the Thames in Tilbury Docks, then sailed down to Southend on a barge before being lifted on to the pier all in one piece, with a giant crane. That took place last week, and the building will open later this summer. Finally, two remarkable books to look out for. Next week sees the publication of Thomas Heatherwick&apos;s first monograph, simply titled Making. It&apos;s timed to coincide with the first significant retrospective of the designer, which opens at London&apos;s V&amp;A next week. It&apos;s a fitting climax to the V&amp;A&apos;s ongoing British Design exhibition \u2013 Heatherwick is surely as good an advert for the discipline as the nation could hope for, and he&apos;s already represented his country two years ago with the stunning pavilion for the Shanghai Expo. With admirable clarity, the book lays out Heatherwick&apos;s inventive body of work so far \u2013 not just his &quot;greatest hits&quot; but also some of the early works and lesser-seen experiments that led up to them. Watch out for a video interview with Heatherwick on this site next week.     Low-cost housing estate ...

Building on the previous volume, published six years ago, it&apos;s a survey of the more sustainable, responsible, community-based end of the architectural spectrum, and it&apos;s packed with inspiring projects and initiatives.

Photograph: Pasi Aalto/TYIN Tegnestue    AFH claims to have a network of 50,000 professionals around the globe, and in their 13-year existence they&apos;ve been at the forefront of a growing movement towards low-energy, low-cost but hi-tech design directed at some of the world&apos;s most pressing problems. There are ingenious designs here using cheap, basic materials such as bamboo (such as this impressive school in Bali), sandbags (like this low-cost housing estate in South Africa) or corrugated steel sheet (like this colourful primary school, whose roof doubles as a climbing wall). There are disaster-relief projects like post-Katrina reconstruction in the US and model sustainable communities like Malmo&apos;s Western Harbour. There are skateboard parks in Afghanistan, a children&apos;s community centre made out of waste concrete, a Chinese school that doubles as a bridge, plus interviews, reports, and reams of facts and figures. AFH can&apos;t take sole credit for much of the work gathered in the book \u2013 which includes higher-profile projects like New York&apos;s High Line public park and Britain&apos;s Maggie&apos;s Centre cancer care buildings \u2013 but it brings together some of the most inspiring experimental design being produced. It&apos;s the sort of stuff that gives architecture, and humanity, a good name.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Norman Foster", "David Chipperfield", "Art and design", "Culture", "Kanye West"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-25T14:35:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/26/this-weeks-new-exhibitions", "sentences": ["His designs include a spinning chair that dips backwards like a funfair ride, and his award-winning British pavilion for the 2010 Shanghai Expo, which wore a shaggy coat of light-reflecting rods so it seemed one part sea anemone, one part fibre optic lamp."], "title": "This week's new exhibitions", "article": "Tracey Emin, Margate Tracey Emin&apos;s first big show in her old home Margate must surely feel like a milestone for Britart&apos;s original bad girl. The story of underage sex and one fateful seaside dance competition, which is recounted in her brilliant Why I Never Became A Dancer, set the tone for a bittersweet relationship with the troubled seaside town which has been played out in various works over the years since. Where that early video ended in a celebratory &quot;fuck you&quot; to her past, what she offers here suggests that Emin has definitely moved on. The exhibition is dominated by Emin&apos;s scratchy, scribbly nudes, dashed off in pencil and blue watercolour, or stitched in fine, spidery thread and accompanied here and there by textual outbursts: &quot;I didn&apos;t say I couldn&apos;t love you&quot; reads one. These are paired with a choice selection of drawings by Rodin, whose intimate studies of the female form make an intriguing and stunning counterpoint to Emin&apos;s assertive vision of her own sexuality. Turner Contemporary, Sat to 23 Sep SS ON: A Re-imagining Of Blackpool Illuminations, Blackpool Anyone who considers that multimedia, site-specific installations are something culturally new should catch the Blackpool illuminations, which will be 100 years old this autumn. For many impressionable juvenile souls like myself, the lights were our first experience of art as pure amazement. They can also be seen as postmodern: a bizarre assemblage of historical samplings from cartoon teddies to giant Tiffany lamps, from ancient Greece to B-movie sci-fi. Here, artist Brian Griffiths celebrates the centenary by creating his own version of the annual spectacle inside the Grundy. Grundy Art Gallery, to 28 Jul Robert Clark Henry Moore, London The most frequent complaint levelled at Henry Moore&apos;s sculpture is how ubiquitous it is. Up to his death in 1986, his huge public commissions erupted across the world from London to Dallas, Berlin to Hong Kong. In parks, plazas, outside or atop buildings, they seem as easy to miss as streetlights. This show redresses the balance, with late works of the 1960s and 1970s brought indoors and centre stage. Working in bronze meant Moore could go big, and these smooth, prehistoric-looking sculptures, largely culled from the grounds of Much Hadham&apos;s Henry Moore Foundation, are the size of Fred Flintstone&apos;s house. They come in rippling shapes like the sea-washed bones of some primeval giant or, as with his Large Spindle Piece, horned like a rhino. Gagosian Britannia Street, WC1, Thu to 18 Aug SS Simon Fujiwara, Cork The British-Japanese artist Simon Fujiwara&apos;s Museum Of Incest is a bizarre amalgam of historical fact and dreamed-up fictions. Staged as a series of museum exhibits, complete with glass vitrine cases and carefully labelled specimens, the work appears to be an &quot;authoritative&quot; history of the human race that claims with deadpan conviction that without incest there would be no humankind. There are archaeological curios and autobiographical souvenirs, accounts of a visit to the &quot;Cradle of Mankind&quot; burial site of the earliest human ancestors in the Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania and assorted newspaper cuttings: &quot;Oldest Footprint Found&quot;; &quot;Man&apos;s Dread Of Incest A Deeply Rooted Feeling&quot;. The whole thing would be plain daft, of course, if it were not for Fujiwara&apos;s attention to detail, his precise balancing of truth and lies, and his ongoing ability to suspend disbelief through pure, persuasive cheek. Crawford Art Gallery, to 27 Jun RC Heatherwick Studio, London Thomas Heatherwick is no longer the bright upstart of British design. He&apos;s one of its major talents, as this survey of his tirelessly inventive career is set to affirm. Londoners will know him through projects like his Rolling Bridge, a hexagonal box that unfurls to cross the Grand Union canal at Paddington Basin; and most recently his revamped hop-on-hop-off Routemaster buses. Heatherwick, though, has a feel for the playful as much as the practical. His designs include a spinning chair that dips backwards like a funfair ride, and his award-winning British pavilion for the 2010 Shanghai Expo, which wore a shaggy coat of light-reflecting rods so it seemed one part sea anemone, one part fibre optic lamp. As with many designers-cum-architects, some of Heatherwick&apos;s most interesting projects are yet to be made, like his Teesside biomass-fuelled power station: a silvery, space-age volcano on a tiny island. V&amp;A, SW7, Thu to 30 Sep SS Zed Nelson, Henry Tonks, Durham A thought-provoking pairing of Zed Nelson&apos;s photography of the worldwide beauty and cosmetics industry with medical drawings by the Slade School lecturer, painter and first world war medical corps volunteer Henry Tonks. Tonks&apos;s cataloguing of the facial injuries suffered by soldiers presage Francis Bacon&apos;s paintings by some 50 years. Set against such disturbances, Nelson&apos;s beauty queens and bodybuilders \u2013 sourced from 18 countries across five continents \u2013 come across as all the more interestingly perverse. DLI Museum &amp; Durham Art Gallery, to 24 Jun RC Doris Salcedo, London Silence roars in Doris Salcedo&apos;s art, be it the untold inequality of the voiceless oppressed or the quiet of unmarked graves. As with the great, zigzagging crack in the floor of Tate Modern&apos;s Turbine Hall five years ago, she addresses the hush that descends after the violent act. Plegaria Muda, a major installation featuring pairs of reconfigured coffin-sized tables that was begun in 2004 and is shown in an amended form here, is a response to her research into life in Los Angeles ghettos as well as into the deaths of over 1,500 Colombian men, cajoled into joining the army and then murdered as reported guerrillas. The funereal furniture is paired with a new installation, A Flor de Piel, a shroud of thousands of rose petals. White Cube Mason&apos;s Yard, SW1 to 30 Jun SS Laura Bel\u00e9m, York Laura Bel\u00e9m&apos;s The Temple Of A Thousand Bells finds its perfect home in the medieval ambience of York St Mary&apos;s. Bel\u00e9m has stated she wants to touch the viewer&apos;s &quot;inner score&quot; with the work and it does strike one with a hush of silent enchantment. A thousand cast glass clapper-less bells hang by nylon threads from the church&apos;s ceiling in a kind of ghostly carillon. The muted underwater atmosphere of the piece is derived from a legend about a sailor trying to listen in to an island temple that had sunk below the ocean. Bel\u00e9m&apos;s installations depend on the precise placement of elements within sites that set the scene for a freeform lyrical reverie.

The Orange prize, which is now looking for a new sponsor, is one. Granta is another. Three years ago, the magazine&apos;s generous and public-spirited proprietor, Sigrid Rausing, propelled her journal into a new orbit, with a new\u00a0team and a bold mission statement. &quot;We cannot in good\u00a0conscience pretend,&quot; declared Granta redux, &quot;that an Anglo-American dialogue is at the heart of our cultures.&quot; Three years on, what do we find? The latest issue of Granta is titled Britain, inspired by the success of a Chicago edition in 2009. What better time to revisit the mystery of this ex-Cambridge &quot;little magazine&quot;. I went to visit Sigrid Rausing, at home in Notting Hill, for an update on her mission. It turned out to be an object lesson in the iron law of unintended consequences. First of all, this literary journal, with offices in London and New York, far from turning its back on &quot;Anglo-American dialogue&quot;, has taken it to the max. In contrast to the picayune conventions that usually bedevil transatlantic co-publishing, Rausing has consolidated both US and UK editions into a unified version for a global market. From this secure base, Granta is stealthily remodelling itself into a global brand. Rausing spoke proudly of her Spanish, Bulgarian, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish and (with Shanghai 99) even Chinese co-publications. A Greek Granta, unsurprisingly, has gone to the wall. However, for an annual fee, other foreign editions can participate in the Granta programme. This transformation has been conducted without hype or fanfare. It is, moreover, a transition that&apos;s eloquent of the opportunities for innovation in books and magazines in the digital age. A number of things stand out from Rausing&apos;s direction of her magazine. First, Granta has turned its back on the gospel of &quot;free content&quot;. In addition\u00a0to its co-editions, it sells itself\u00a0across at least four platforms: print, ebook, app and website. In the 1980s, when the magazine, edited by Bill Buford, was a must-read publication for a whole generation, print runs were\u00a0said to touch 75,000. Those halcyon days are gone. Granta now claims to sell about 50,000 copies; a mix of subscription and over-the-counter sales. The electronic\u00a0contribution, however, more than compensates for any shortfall. Second, every edition, especially in Britain, is geared to local events. &quot;Each issue becomes a kind of mini-festival,&quot; says Rausing. It&apos;s a paradox of\u00a0the digital age that a printed magazine should inspire these one-off live conjunctions of writers and readers. As with hardback books, we find that the virtual edition browsed online becomes a kind of digital trailer\u00a0for the\u00a0deeper and more satisfying experience of the text in performance and on the printed page. The marriage of e- and non-e validates the former and bankrolls the latter. It&apos;s this vision\u00a0of a global audience that, I understand, animates Kate Mosse and the fiction prize formerly sponsored by\u00a0Orange. These are said to be difficult times for the printed word. The literary community often seems to be in a demoralised funk. But I came away from my conversation with Ms Rausing in an optimistic mood. Where before there was loose talk about &quot;the cognitive friction of juxtaposition&quot;, there is now commercial clarity and basic editorial discipline. The Britain issue of Granta not only offers excellent contributions from Robert Macfarlane and Mario Vargas Llosa, it also contains\u00a0a well-designed mix of fiction and non-fiction,\u00a0poetry and photographs. All this\u00a0is available, in different formats, to\u00a0an international audience. Three years ago, Granta was complaining that the literary journals of\u00a0the past were &quot;a closed circuit, a club&quot;. Maybe so. What&apos;s not in doubt is that the IT revolution has wrenched\u00a0open the doors of the club and plugged the closed circuit into the international mains. For Orange and Granta, the voltage of a global audience, exploiting a powerful Anglo-American symbol, is the key to cultural renewal. These may be difficult times for print, but the landscape is becoming less murky and confusing. Some of the clouds have silver linings and, westwards, the land is bright. The future&apos;s bright, even if it&apos;s not Orange The book trade, predictably, has reacted with shock and horror at Orange&apos;s decision to pull out of sponsoring the international fiction prize that, for the past 17 years, has promoted its name . My view is that Orange&apos;s defection to the world of film may prove a blessing in disguise. Across the English-speaking world, &quot;Orange fiction&quot; has become a shorthand for important new novels by talented contemporary writers who might have otherwise escaped notice. Any list of winners that includes Barbara KIngsolver, Marilynne Robinson, Rose Tremain, Helen Dunmore, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Andrea Levy, Ann Patchett and Kate Grenville demonstrates how effortlessly Orange has come to challenge Man Booker and Costa in the literary prize\u00a0stakes. Furthermore, assuming Kate Mosse (co-founder) and her team secure new backers, they should be in a position to exploit the truly international ambitions of the prize and break away from the funky but slightly offbeat appeal of Orange. Plus, at a few quid shy of \u00a3500,000 per annum, taking on the prize won&apos;t break the corporate bank. I confidently predict a new sponsor very soon. Jamaica calling Calabash, the Jamaican literary festival, will celebrate 50 years of the island&apos;s independence this weekend on Treasure Beach. Justine Henzell, the co-founder, has brought together some of the biggest names on the Jamaican literary scene, including Olive Senior and Alecia McKenzie. &quot;Jubilation! 50&quot; will also showcase performances by Anis Mojgani and &quot;fifty-two living poets&quot;.

The 25-year-old migrant worker had travelled to a distant province and had medical checks. A recipient had been matched. If he pulled out now, the web of doctors and agents brokering the illegal operation would lose a lot of yuan. So the night before Hu&apos;s operation in January 2011 an agent kept watch. &quot;I saw the agent couldn&apos;t stop rubbing his waist; he was suffering,&quot; Hu says. &quot;He told me he had sold his kidney two months ago.&quot; At that moment Hu considered the enormity of what he was about to do. &quot;I tried to flee but didn&apos;t succeed; there were agents and strangers surrounding me. The next morning my phone, ID card and bank card were confiscated. That afternoon I was taken to the local hospital \u2013 it was shabby, more like a township health centre. I protested, crying. I tried to run twice more but the agents were guarding the door.&quot; Hu was stripped and put under general anaesthetic. When he woke the next morning, trembling with cold, a 10cm scar arced his torso and his left kidney was gone.     Hu Jie, 25, changed his mind about selling his kidney but it was too late. Photograph: Nicola Davison     In China there is a severe shortage of organ donors. A million people need a kidney, but just 5,253 got one in 2011, according to the national kidney transplant registry. This gives patients a 0.5% chance each year; in the UK that chance is 43%. Kidneys are the most in-demand organs in China. Two-thirds of the 1.5 million people the health ministry say needs new organs (hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys and corneas) are waiting for a kidney. In lieu of a public donor system, demand is met by harvesting organs from executed criminals, despite criticism from human rights advocates who question the degree of consent. In February, Huang Jiefu, a health minister, announced this system will be abolished within five years, in part because condemned prisoners&apos; organs are more likely to carry infections. China is also being more prudent with the death penalty. About 4,000 prisoners were executed in 2011, an estimated 50% fewer than in 2007. With dismal chances of getting a donor kidney, and high prices (kidneys cost 200,000 yuan, or \u00a320,000, in hospitals), many patients turn to the parallel economy. Buying or selling a kidney is simple: typing &quot;donate kidney receive payment&quot; into Sina Weibo, China&apos;s Twitter, reaps about 550 posts. Typically, agents arrange deals in league with corrupt doctors and hospitals. When Hu Jie woke from his operation his agents had scarpered. &quot;Three days later, I received 27,000 yuan, not the 40,000 yuan I was promised,&quot; he says. &quot;I met the patient [who received Hu&apos;s kidney] in the hospital office, he told me he paid 300,000 yuan. Most of his money was divided between these agents. The doctors had a finger in the pie too.&quot; When the Guardian contacted an agent dubbed Monk \u2013 who advertises his services with &quot;donate a kidney, buy the new iPad!&quot; on Weibo \u2013 he said the procedure could performed in 10 days for 25,000 yuan. Any blood type was acceptable, but donors must be taller than 1.65m, over 55kg and aged under 28. For Wang Wei, a 27-year-old construction worker from Shandong province, the sale of his kidney will give his daughter, who has leukemia, a chance. &quot;The reward [for my kidney] needs to be more than 180,000 yuan, as my daughter&apos;s treatment has already cost around 150,000 yuan, and the next cycle of treatment costs a great amount of money,&quot; he says. &quot;I earn 200 yuan a day, which merely covers my daughter&apos;s current medicine expenses.&quot; Sellers have differing motives. Earlier this year there was a public outcry when a 17-year-old sold his kidney for an iPad and iPhone. China&apos;s donor deficit reflects tradition, which dictates that bodies should be buried whole. &quot;It will be very difficult to solve the [organ donor] problem in the coming years as it will mean changing something fundamental in Chinese people&apos;s minds&quot;, says Liu Changqiu, a professor at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences who is working to establish organ donor laws. &quot;First, the government should encourage organ donation \u2013 there&apos;s still a lack of motivation.&quot; The health ministry and Red Cross Society of China launched a pilot scheme in 160 hospitals in 2009 to spur public donations. So far there have been 207 donors through this scheme. In the UK the NHS Organ Donor Register has almost 18 million people registered. Consequently, Mr and Mrs Zhang don&apos;t harbour much hope. Mr Zhang has suffered from renal failure for five years and is on the transplant waiting list. He visits Shanghai&apos;s People&apos;s First Hospital, the city&apos;s busiest for kidney transplants, three times a week for dialysis. &quot;My husband is over 50 now&quot;, says Mrs Zhang. &quot;Where to find a kidney? Even in the best hospital in Shanghai we don&apos;t know how long we must to wait. In 10 years or more my husband will be 70 and then it&apos;s meaningless for us&quot;. Down the corridor on the toilet doors are scrawled the characters: &quot;Kidney for sale, no agent&quot;, complete with blood type and mobile number. Hu Jie&apos;s money is now nearly spent. &quot;Some was used to pay for medicine to help me recover. I felt a gnawing pain from the wound and I couldn&apos;t stand straight when walking for months.&quot; Seeking justice, Hu reported his case to the provincial health bureau. The head nurse was charged (no agents or doctors were) and the clinic forced to suspend business &quot;to bring up standards&quot; . &quot;What makes me really angry is that they didn&apos;t even inform me when the court held the trial for my case,&quot; Hu says. &quot;When I asked the court why I didn&apos;t even receive notice of the trial the reply was: &apos;This case has no civil compensation.

For four days each month, a different writer spends time in the house boat currently perched on the top of the South Bank Centre in London as part of Artangel&apos;s year long project, A London Address. Earlier in the year we welcomed Juan Gabriel V\u00e1squez and Jeanette Winterson for webchats live from the boat. Now it&apos;s Maya&apos;s turn. Maya is professor of British and Imperial history at Harvard University. Her latest book, Liberty&apos;s Exiles: The Loss of America and the Remaking of the British Empire, (shortlisted last year for the Samuel Johnson Prize) looks at the aftermath of the American Revolution, following the fortunes of those people who supported and fought for the losing side who sought refuge across the world. If you have a question for Maya, either about her research or her time in the boat, she will be here between 1pm and 2pm (BST) on Wednesday 30 May to chat. Post your questions in the thread below and check back on Wednesday to join in the conversation. We&apos;ve posted the conversation here, to make it easier to follow. EmBrom asks: Hello Maya, what&apos;s it like being a writer in residence in A Room for London? And can you tell us about the strangest residency offer that you&apos;ve had? Maya Jasanoff replies: Hello from the Room with the best view in London! Well, let me begin by saying that this is the best residency I&apos;ve done, and probably the strangest, but I hereby welcome offers for others! I wrote portions of Liberty&apos;s Exiles in two residencies, one at the magnificent MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, the other as a visiting scholar at Thomas Jefferson&apos;s house in Virginia, Monticello. I stayed in a cottage on the neighboring farm, which had been built for the use of a very special guest: Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It was fun to write a book about pro-British loyalists under the shadow of the two Presidents on our nickels and dimes.... LaurenJM asks: Hi Maya, it must have been hard being stuck on a boat during this great weather! I think my biggest worry if I went up there would be that I would have a four-day slump and not be able to write anything... then again, in such a small space I&apos;d run out of ways to procrastinate eventually. As a historian/historical writer though, such a great view of London must have been very inspiring? Is it strange to think that some day even the (fairly) new London Eye will become a part of its history? Maya replies Tough life indeed.... It&apos;s very easy to procrastinate--but also to get inspiration for writing--because there is so much going on around me: sirens and cheering schoolchildren and Tubes and buses and bells. And so many boats of different shapes and sizes.The view extends from St. Paul&apos;s to Westminster and over to the London Eye, so it is indeed quite a sweep of British (London) history: church and state and... surveillance? When you&apos;re inside the London Eye, you&apos;re looking out at a fantastic cityscape, but when you&apos;re sitting &quot;on deck&quot; at the Room as I&apos;ve been doing, you realize that the Eye is really a great big panopticon in motion. 2011anna2011 asks: Given you have written quite extensively about the British Empire, what do you make of the Queen&apos;s Diamond Jubilee this weekend...? Maya replies: I&apos;ve been thinking about this a lot, partly because I&apos;ll be speaking at a conference on monarchy next week http://www.hrp.org.uk/monarchyconference about the relationship between the monarchy and the empire. The last Diamond Jubilee, in 1897, was an explicit celebration of Britain&apos;s Empire at its height. Now, it seems to me the timing of the Jubilee against the Olympics demonstrates a new way of thinking about the relationship of London to the world. I will be fascinated to watch the flotilla, which is meant to make us think about the older Elizabethan age. There will be a thousand boats. In Queen Elizabeth I&apos;s day, there were two thousand boats at any given time on London&apos;s stretch of the Thames, and by Queen Victoria&apos;s Diamond Jubilee, more than ten thousand boats were registered on the river. At the same time, the thousand boats also suggest resonances with the &quot;little boats&quot; at Dunkirk, a reminder that the Queen is perhaps the strongest symbolic connection between Britain today and the &quot;finest hour.&quot; AndrewLucas asks: Good afternoon, MayaI understand that slaves were offered freedom &amp; land if they fought in support of the British? Is there any truth in that? What happened to those people after the British defeat, was there a colony of former-slaves in Nova Scotia?With thanks &amp; best wishes Maya replies: Yes, this is one of those rather flattering stories that happens to be true. As early as 1775 British officials offered freedom to runaway slaves--belonging to patriots only, mind--who agreed to fight for the British. The response was instant and signficant: some 20,000 slaves all told ran to the British during the war, including, incidentally, slaves belonging to many of our founding fathers (Washington, Jefferson, etc.). At the end of the war, against loud patriot objections, the British commander-in-chief Sir Guy Carleton superintended the evacuation of some 8-10,000 slaves to Britain and British colonies. About 3000 went to Nova Scotia... for a little while at least: in 1791, 1200 of them went on again, to become the founding settlers of Freetown, Sierra Leone. lateforbreakfast asks: Hello Maya, in Liberty&apos;s Exiles you talk of Canada as a chance to see how the US would have been had the loyalists been victorious. If that&apos;s the case, do you think the USA mightn&apos;t have become such a dominant superpower if the war had gone the other way? Also - was fascinated by the story of the black loyalist immigrants to the UK who were then sent en masse to Sierra Leone? Seems we often think of Britain&apos;s black population as something that arrived in the 1950s but that story explodes that myth. Was wondering, did you uncover any stories about what became of those who didn&apos;t go to Sierra Leone? Maya replies: Very good question. I think the first thing to note is that the US didn&apos;t become a dominant superpower for a very long time... Britain was the dominant superpower throughout the 19th century and the US was decidedly provincial--as well as unstable (think: Civil War). Then there&apos;s the great &quot;what if&quot; question about what would have happened had the thirteen colonies remained part of the British Empire. We&apos;d probably have ended up with a rather different British Empire: slavery might have persisted longer, transcontinental expansion would have been slower, and Britain might not have been able to stave off the French revolutionaries (but the what-ifs begin to pile up badly here). As for the black loyalists, yes, there were thousands who came to Britain, especially London, after 1783. It&apos;s a mistake to think of Britain&apos;s black community as a 20th-century phenomenon: there was a substantial black population in Britain in the 18th century too, and slavery was effectively unenforceable here from the 1770s. kindofgirl asks: Hi Maya, At a time of heightened conflict in parts of the world, which are increasingly elevated to a global stage through the intervention of the international community, do you think we run the risk of creating a generation of &quot;international exiles&quot; once conflict is over? And how do we contend with this, and guarantee against individuals on the &quot;wrong side&quot; of conflict becoming internationally ostracised? Thanks! Rachel Maya replies: Haven&apos;t we already done so? There are so many stateless populations in the world today, displaced from so many conflicts: Palestinians are the most famous example perhaps, but then there are Burmese refugees in Thailand, Tibetans in India, Congolese refugees in neighboring countries, and so on and on and on. What&apos;s more, only those who attract western sympathies for political reasons tend to get much attention; and as Guardian readers know well, even then diplomacy doesn&apos;t always follow suit. Short of stopping conflicts altogether... I think the only way forward is to remember the importance of applying humanitarian aid in non-partisan ways. I admire the commitment of Medecins Sans Frontieres (and UN peace-keeprs) to not taking sides, however difficult this role can be in practice. littlewhite asks: Hi Maya Do you think we have moved as far from the Imperialism which Conrad explores as we have hoped to? Or are there still significant vestiges of our dark past still present in the London you see out of the window? How does the view make you feel about London&apos;s future? Maya replies: In a word, no. Empires are the most enduring and durable form of political organization in world history, and I don&apos;t see imperialism going away any time soon. These days, when we use the word &quot;imperialism&quot; we normally apply it to economic and cultural practices, as opposed to outright political domination, but even that continues in many parts of the world (we just happen to call today&apos;s empires nation-states). The view here invites comparison with another riverfront, the Bund in Shanghai. The institutions of western informal empire, from the 19th/20th centuries, line the embankment: HSBC, Jardine&apos;s, and so on. But on the other side of the river rises the astonishing new city of Pudong, utterly overshadowing--or rather, over-illuminating, with all their neon lights!--the architecture of 20th-century western investment with a strikingly 21st-century vision of Chinese growth. I can see the Shard going up from here, and a fair number of cranes on the skyline, but compared to Pudong, Canary Wharf looks very... dare I say, 20th century? Kaiteur asks: Hi Maya, greetings from Beijing. Looking at your trajectory from Edge of Empire, to Liberty&apos;s Exiles, to Conrad, I&apos;m really interested in how you are attracted as a historian to outsiders, to people who trim the edges of imperial systems. How do you understand that? Maya replies: &quot;Trim the edges&quot;: great phrase! I guess I have always been fascinated by the relationship between outsides and insides, outsiders who become insiders, and, inevitably, insiders drifting to the outside. (You must have a terrifically interesting perspective on this from Beijing--cf my last comment.) There&apos;s perhaps something particularly American about that dynamic--we&apos;re a nation of immigrants, and I&apos;m a child/grandchild of them--but it&apos;s also central to the experience of so many communities in the modern imperial and &quot;globalized&quot; world. Conrad offers a great perspective on this because at one level he is seen as the archetypal author about imperialism and imperial--racist--attitudes (as Edward Said and Chinua Achebe, among others, have stressed), but at another level he was the consummate outsider: an ethnic Pole raised in different parts of eastern Europe, who spent 20 years as a sailor and only came to Britain and writing--and the English language--as an adult. He forces us to remember that history tends to unfold in technicolor--blazing, blinding, confusing, fascinating--not in easily reducible blacks and whites. BookBeeOne asks: Hi Maya, I&apos;m currently reading Liberty&apos;s Exiles. I wonder how much of a clearly discernable &apos;American&apos; culture you think those who fled took with them? Maya replies: You can see a tendency to resist certain forms of authority, connecting this first great successful war of anti-colonial independence to later independence movements in the British Empire. But you can also see different bargains being struck around types of government and authority, whose legacies perhaps we&apos;re still wrestling with today. \u2022 Follow us on Twitter @Guardianbooks", "tags": ["A Room for London", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-29T14:26:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/29/the-fiver-euro-2012-shirts", "sentences": ["Similarly, some may fret that Ashley Cole will wear No3, which is considered an unlucky number in certain Arabic countries, while Frank Lampard will wear No8, which is considered unlucky in rural Sri Lanka, and $tevie Mbe will wear No4, which is considered unlucky in some parts of China, though not in Shanghai, where &apos;four&apos; is a synonym of fish."], "title": "The Fiver | Enough to send the entire United States of America into an epic giggle fit | Paul Doyle", "article": "GET SHIRTY The Football Association today insisted that nothing should be read into the shirt numbers assigned to England&apos;s Euro 2012 squad members. In spite of that, or perhaps because of that, much ink has been devoted to reading various meanings into the shirt numbers, with many suggesting, for example, that those wearing 1 to 11 will start the defeat to France on 11 June, which in turn suggests that the No10, Wayne Rooney, plans to stick two fingers up at his two-game ban. Those seeking spurious omens will tremble at the news that Rob Green, whose last contribution to a major tournament was to send the entire United States of America into an epic giggle fit, has been awarded No13. Similarly, some may fret that Ashley Cole will wear No3, which is considered an unlucky number in certain Arabic countries, while Frank Lampard will wear No8, which is considered unlucky in rural Sri Lanka, and $tevie Mbe will wear No4, which is considered unlucky in some parts of China, though not in Shanghai, where &apos;four&apos; is a synonym of fish. No6 will be worn by England&apos;s Brave John Terry, who is considered a harbinger of woe in many parts of England. Gary Cahill will wear No5. As you know, &apos;five&apos; is considered a bringer of joy and enlightenment everywhere. Oh. In reality, of course, all the number allocation tells us is what we already knew: that Roy Hodgson is a conservative coach. Uefa limits squad size to 23 players but \u2013 and the Fiver has not bothered checking this \u2013 does not demand that they wear numbers between 1 and 23. Hodgson could have spiced things up with an 88 here or a 69 there, or given Stewart Downing 72 in homage to the number of shots the winger had this season without scoring. But instead Hodgson stuck to convention, though was not no-nonsense enough to simply assign the numbers alphabetically. All of which means this story is at least 441 words longer than it needed to be. Elsewhere on the continent, other managers grappled with trickier problems to solve than whether to give James Milner No16. In France, for example, d-Day arrived for Laurent Blanc, who had to trim two players from his provisional squad to settle on a final 23. With a heavy heart he decided to prune Yoann Gourcuff, the gifted No10 with whom he won Ligue 1 in 2009 but who, since then, has been playing like a No2. Meanwhile, Cesare Prandelli has failed in his quest to find 23 Italian players totally untouched by mentions in the country&apos;s latest alleged match-fixing guff and so has included the under-investigation Leonardo Bonucci in his Euro 2012 squad.

Grief stricken and under heavy sedation, she was unaware that within half an hour of her baby&apos;s death a detective from the city&apos;s homicide branch had arrived at the maternity ward and had begun asking questions. While Shuai was embarking on a journey into bereavement that continues to this day, the Indianapolis authorities were also setting out, albeit along a very different path. On 14 March last year Shuai was arrested and taken into custody in the high-security Marion County prison, where she was held for the next 435 days, charged with murdering her foetus and attempted feticide. If convicted of the murder count she faces a sentence of 45 years to life. Bei Bei Shuai is at the sharp end of the creeping criminalisation of pregnancy across America. Women who lose their unborn babies \u2013 whether in cases of maternal drug addiction or in Shuai&apos;s case a failed suicide attempt \u2013 are increasingly finding themselves accused of murder. Speaking publicly for the first time, Shuai told the Guardian she is determined to defend herself as she prepares for a murder trial scheduled for December. &quot;I have a strong desire to stay in America,&quot; she said, three days after she had been released from jail on $50,000 bail. &quot;I want to stay and fight this case. I have the best legal team, and I&apos;m not afraid anymore to face the charges.&quot; On 23 December 2010 Shuai became so depressed after she had been abandoned by her boyfriend \u2013 a married Chinese man who broke his promise to set up a family with her \u2013 that she decided to end her life. She consumed rat poison, and after confessing to friends was rushed to the Methodist hospital. Doctors took steps to save her, but on 31 December there were signs that the baby, then at 33 weeks gestation, was in distress and a Caesarian was performed. On the second day of Angel&apos;s life the baby was found to have a massive brain haemorrhage and on 2 January was taken off life support. Shuai held Angel for five hours as the baby gradually faded and died. &quot;Why do they want to take my baby away?&quot; she kept asking, in between bouts of fainting. Shuai begged for her own life to be taken so that her child&apos;s might be spared. &apos;No one wins from the criminalisation of pregnant women&apos; &quot;There is no doubt that Shuai was suffering from a severe mental illness,&quot; her defence lawyer Linda Pence said. She first met the defendant when she was in the mental wing, a few days after Angel died. &quot;I personally observed a very depressed woman, a grief-stricken individual.&quot; That is not how the prosecutor saw it. For the first time in Indiana&apos;s 196-year history, the state has applied felony charges against a woman that hold Shuai criminally liable for the outcome of her pregnancy. Earlier this month the Indiana supreme court declined to hear the case, rendering a 3 December murder trial almost inevitable. Lawyers and women&apos;s advocates in Indiana were astonished by the prosecution&apos;s hard line. To attempt to take one&apos;s own life is not a crime in Indiana, so the decision to charge a pregnant woman appeared to be creating a double standard. The feticide law, introduced in Indiana in 1979, was designed with violent third parties in mind: abusive boyfriends or husbands who attacked their pregnant partners, causing them to lose their unborn babies. It was enhanced to carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in 2007 after a bank robbery in which a pregnant woman was shot in the stomach, killing her fetus but leaving her alive. &quot;From a legal standpoint, this case is absolutely frightening,&quot; said Pence, who has set up a website and fighting fund to support Shuai&apos;s defence.  Pence fears that Shuai&apos;s prosecution could set a precedent that will catch others in its trap. In the future, could women who smoke or drink during pregnancy and suffer a miscarriage be prosecuted for murder, or women with HIV who pass it on to their child in the womb? &quot;No one wins from the criminalisation of pregnant women \u2013 all this will do is persuade women to flee the state, avoid treatment or have an abortion,&quot; Pence said. &apos;I knew America as the best country in the world&apos; Shuai sees the threat now facing her from a different perspective \u2013 as the obliteration of her American dream. She was raised as a single child in Shanghai by parents she described as loving and caring. She graduated from Shanghai university as an accountant, worked for a year in a Chinese government department and then came to the US about 10 years ago as a legal immigrant with her then-husband, who was offered a job in Indianapolis as a mechanical engineer. Shuai said she was delighted to come to the US. &quot;I knew America as the best country in the world, with the best education system. People get more freedom. I really wanted to see what it was like.&quot; She found the initial arrival in her Indiana town \u2013 a tiny one compared to Shanghai \u2013 a bit of a culture shock, but over time she said she came to appreciate it more and more: &quot;Seeing all the natural trees and flowers, the fresh air.&quot; She was full of dreams \u2013 the dream of continuing her studies, the dream of forming her own family, of owning a house and car. &quot;Everybody tells me that they have their American dream, trying to make their life better. People tell me that all the time, and I am the same, I am one of them,&quot; she said. The dreams didn&apos;t work out so easily. She couldn&apos;t afford to go back to college, so instead studied under her own steam using the local library. Her marriage collapsed, and then when she did finally become pregnant it was with a married man. When he abandoned her, he left Shuai on her hands and knees in a parking lot as he drove away. Shuai is not allowed to discuss the events that led up to her suicide attempt, as that might prejudice her trial. But she can talk about the deep sense of shame she felt when she was arrested for killing her foetus. &quot;I remember the day I had to turn myself in. I felt hopeless and ashamed, for myself and my parents. I had never worn handcuffs before \u2013 when they put the cuffs on me it chilled me to my bones.&quot; Now released, her hands are free. But she is forced to wear a GPS ankle bracelet that is causing her feet to swell. Shuai&apos;s lawyers wonder whether it is coincidental that such an aggressive application of a law originally designed to protect pregnant women against violent men should first be applied against a woman who is Chinese. The question is all the more pertinent given the current spat between the US and Chinese governments over the treatment of the blind dissident Chen Guangcheng.  Lynn Paltrow, head of National Advocates for Pregnant Women that is co-counsel in Shuai&apos;s defence, said: &quot;It&apos;s an irony that the US has paid such close attention to violations of human rights in China while at the same time Indiana has absolutely deprived a woman who is a legal immigrant from China of her constitutional human rights.&quot; Prosecution is determined to push on The only hope for Shuai to avoid a murder trial is if the prosecutor, Terry Curry, decides to drop the charges. There is little chance of that, given his firm belief that he is following the correct path. &quot;It&apos;s my job to enforce the criminal code as enacted by our legislature and that&apos;s what our legislature has determined,&quot; he said. Curry pointed to a suicide note that Shuai left the former boyfriend in which she wrote that she was &quot;taking this baby with me&quot;. &quot;What we allege is that her actions were directed specifically at the unborn child. It&apos;s not that she was trying to take her own life, it was that she was trying to take the life of her foetus,&quot; Curry said. Curry&apos;s determination to press ahead to trial is matched by Shuai&apos;s determination to fight on. During her year in prison, she has improved her English language skills and now speaks fluently without a translator. Though there were dark times inside, including anxiety attacks and moments of despair, she said she has emerged stronger for it. &quot;It was a really bad experience. I thought nobody would care about me anymore, that I was a worthless person with no future,&quot; she said. &quot;But I learned a great deal. I learned that my life wasn&apos;t the worst as I thought it was. Everything that has happened has made me think that I am so blessed. I have a second family here, and that gives me hope.&quot; Shuai kept the truth about her suicide attempt and prosecution for murder from her mother back in Shanghai for almost a year. But a couple of months ago, with the help of her lawyer, she finally confessed. &quot;My mother was so wonderful and supportive. She told me you don&apos;t need to care about other people&apos;s judgment, as she knew that was what hurt me most. There&apos;s a Chinese saying: &apos;A people&apos;s mouth can be sharper than a knife.&apos;&quot; Despite her ordeal, Shuai insists she remains dogged in her intention to make a life for herself in America, a country that she still regards as the greatest on Earth. But in the last analysis her decision to stay and protest her innocence is made on behalf of only one person. &quot;I want to prove to my daughter that her mother is not a murderer, and that she has been loved.&quot;", "tags": ["Indiana", "US news", "Abortion", "China"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-30T17:36:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/may/31/released-players-life-lower-level", "sentences": ["While Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is rumoured to be contemplating a reunion with Drogba at Real Madrid, Sergio Batista, the new coach of Shanghai Shenhua, wants to pair him alongside his old friend Nicolas Anelka in China."], "title": "Released players face prospect of adapting to life at a lower level | Louise Taylor", "article": "For some it spells insecurity, uncertainty and, possibly, the end of a career. Others see it as a long planned opportunity to make some serious money while exploring exciting new horizons. Between those two polar opposites are those who simply accept they are now downwardly mobile and must cut their cloth accordingly. As the summer transfer window swings open on Friday the majority of clubs have already announced their retained and released lists for next season. All of those in the latter category will be out of contract on 30 June and this year their number includes, among many others, Michael Owen, Craig Gordon, Emile Heskey, Owen Hargreaves, Salomon Kalou and Didier Drogba. Some wily senior professionals deliberately refuse offers of new deals and run their contracts down in the hope that their status as free transfers will see an array of potential new clubs queuing up to offer them higher wages but this can be a dangerous strategy. If long-term contracts protect clubs by ensuring they will receive compensation in the form of transfer fees should key individuals depart mid-term, the players themselves run the risk of being cast adrift should they suffer serious injury during the closing stages of their soon-to-expire agreements. This dictates that the majority of names on the released lists are seen as surplus to requirements by managers newly aware of the need to comply with Uefa&apos;s new financial fair play rules. After making only four appearances for Manchester United last season Owen will not have been surprised to see his three injury-blighted years at Old Trafford brought to an end. Even so the 32-year-old former England striker, who scored 17 goals in 52 appearances for United, is determined to rage against the dying of the light. &quot;The Championship is not an option,&quot; said Owen, who last played competitively in November. &quot;I&apos;d like to think that I haven&apos;t lost the ability to score goals at the highest level.&quot; Perhaps now is the time for him to heed the advice of Kevin Keegan, briefly his manager at Newcastle United, and reinvent himself as an attacking midfielder, a position Keegan felt he was well suited to and which would prove appreciably less stressful on his body. Like Owen, Sunderland&apos;s outgoing Craig Gordon is facing the prospect of a substantial cut in remuneration and/or a pay-as-you-play deal come August. Back in 2007 Roy Keane paid Hearts \u00a39m for the Scotland international, then a British record for a goalkeeper, but two broken arms plus a serious knee injury subsequently ensured things have not run according to plan at the Stadium of Light. Displaced by Belgium&apos;s Simon Mignolet, Gordon made only one first-team appearance for Sunderland last season. At 29, youngish for a keeper, Gordon still has time on his side but it looks to be running out for Hargreaves, whose attempt to prove his fitness at Manchester City has failed. If the statistic that he played only four times for Roberto Mancini&apos;s first team last season is not off-putting enough, the fact that Hargreaves has Richard Steadman, the celebrated American knee specialist on speed dial, must serve as an additional deterrent. At 34 Didier Drogba is three years Hargreaves&apos;s senior but the Ivorian striker who did so much to win the European Cup for Chelsea has enjoyed infinitely better luck with injuries and could be spoilt for choice as he prepares to negotiate a generous weekly six-figure contract. While Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is rumoured to be contemplating a reunion with Drogba at Real Madrid, Sergio Batista, the new coach of Shanghai Shenhua, wants to pair him alongside his old friend Nicolas Anelka in China. &quot;Every coach in the world wants Drogba on their team,&quot; said Batista. &quot;I just hope we can get him.&quot; If not, the Argentinian could always turn to Emile Heskey, newly released by Aston Villa.

The figure has been brokered by facilitators working on behalf on each club and, with the Brazil international&apos;s personal terms not expected to be an obstacle, it merely remains for the directors on both sides to sign the relevant paperwork. The Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, as ever, will reserve the right to renegotiate until the last minute yet there is a confidence, not least on Hulk&apos;s part, that there will be no glitches, after what has been a lengthy process, and that he will get the move that he has craved, subject to a medical. Porto have been happy to push the line about Hulk&apos;s release clause being \u20ac100m and although the Guardian has now learned that the figure is \u20ac60m [\u00a348m], the Portuguese club have been forced to accept less, not least because only Chelsea have been willing to make a competitive offer. The release clause was never going to be binding. Porto had wanted no less than \u00a340m but Chelsea have haggled them down. The fee, however, represents an eye-watering outlay and, on the back of the \u00a332m deal that Chelsea have put into place for the Lille attacking midfielder Eden Hazard, it is a serious statement of intent from Abramovich, who still does not have a permanent manager. Roberto Di Matteo, the Champions League-winning interim coach, remains in the dark about his future, with his Stamford Bridge contract set to expire at the end of June. Abramovich has a frosty relationship with Di Matteo and it is clear that he is exploring other options, with the former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola his ideal candidate. Guardiola says that he needs a break from the game. Abramovich, with the help of his influential technical director, Michael Emenalo, is calling the shots and the Russian drove the capture of Hazard, a player who stands to inject greater fantasy into Chelsea&apos;s game. Hulk is also considered a player to excite the crowd, a powerful and clinical presence, who can play as the centre-forward or off the right, where he is likely to feature for Chelsea. Ron Gourlay, the club&apos;s chief executive, made it clear last Wednesday that Fernando Torres would start next season as the team&apos;s No9. Abramovich made it a personal mission to sign the Spain striker in January of last year from Liverpool for \u00a350m and despite Torres&apos;s poor goals return \u2013 he has 12 in 67 appearances for the club \u2013 the owner is determined to see him prosper. &quot;Fernando Torres is the man that we will go forward with and Fernando Torres will score us the goals,&quot; Gourlay said. Torres&apos;s principal competition last season came from Didier Drogba but the 34-year-old has left the club as a free agent and he is ready to sign a contract at Shanghai Shenhua that is worth \u20ac300,000 a week after tax, which would make him one of the highest paid players in world football. The current leader is the Cameroon striker Samuel Eto&apos;o, who takes home \u20ac423,000 a week after tax at Anzhi Makhachkala. John Terry, the Chelsea captain, has been banned by Uefa for three European club matches over his red card against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final. Terry had to sit out Chelsea&apos;s win in the final against Bayern Munich and will miss the Super Cup match against Europa League winners Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in August, plus Chelsea&apos;s first Champions League group-stage match in September. Chelsea&apos;s moves for Hulk and Hazard are a big part of the plan to rejuvenate a squad that lagged 25 points off the Premier League title pace. Along with Drogba, Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa and Salomon Kalou have been released while the club are open to offers for Florent Malouda and Michael Essien, both of whom have one year to run on their contracts. Chelsea have also added the young wingers Marko Marin from Werder Bremen and Kevin de Bruyne from Genk, each for \u00a37m fees. Hulk, 25, has been in Chelsea&apos;s sights all season. His record is outstanding \u2013 57 goals in 91 games in the past two seasons \u2013 and there is the belief that he can improve at Stamford Bridge. Neither Hulk nor Hazard have allowed the uncertainty over the managerial position at Chelsea to deflect them. Together with the Spaniard Juan Mata, they stand to form a potent trio behind Torres.", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Porto", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-31T23:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/01/football-transfer-rumours-gaston-ramirez-manchester-city", "sentences": ["Far from being freaked out by this prospect, Drogba is ready to give an almighty two fingers to Shanghai Shenhua and their \u00a3300,000-a-week contract in order to move to the Spanish capital."], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez off to Manchester City?", "article": "It wasn&apos;t always meant to be like this. Sure, being the Fleet Street&apos;s fourth best footballer relocator rumour ruminator has it perks \u2013 like the pulchritudinous women of Stockwell&apos;s most exclusive nightclubs projecting themselves with abandon at the pointed toe of the Mill&apos;s size-seven spats \u2013 but this was not how the Mill originally envisaged its working life. Like 11% of kids these days, it wanted popularity, it wanted plenitude, it wanted its name in the most coruscating of neon lights above the community centre in Barnsley on a Saturday night: it wanted to be a rapper. Inspired by such luminaries as Nas, the Notorious B.I.G. and Tony Mortimer&apos;s verse in Let in Rain, the Mill abandoned its youthful hours to performing in front of a suburban looking glass \u2013 adorned in a pointing-sidewards Raiders cap and a flabby, off-white vest borrowed from its Pee \u2013 hip-hopping until rosy-fingered Dawn peeped over the eastern panorama. Alas to no avail, it seems raps about soil erosion in Hemsworth just ain&apos;t what the radio wants, and so the Mill has been left with a life&apos;s labour of ceaseless transfer talk so all-consuming that these days it is lucky if it can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. But with the weekend fast approaching, the Mill is determined to get out this rut and back into the groove, just as soon as Friday&apos;s flapdoodle is done away with. So let&apos;s get it over with then, shall we? Not content with the midfield mastery of David Silva, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Samir Nasri and, er, James Milner, the Manchester City top dog Roberto Mancini is looking to strengthen his side&apos;s obvious weak spot by lavishing \u00a314m worth of dead presidents on Bologna&apos;s dynamic and dazzling midfield diamond Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez. &quot;Ram\u00edrez is a good young player, with great potential,&quot; fluttered the Italian, eyelashes hopping up and down like an albatross on a pogo stick, but he faces stiff competition from Juventus and Wolfsburg for the young man&apos;s John Hancock. On the other side of city, Sir Alex Ferguson is doing his best to convince Valencia&apos;s Jordi Alba that he would be better off in the tea-towel red and black of Manchester United rather than the dinophobia-inducing number Barcelona will be sporting come next August. The full-back will say thanks but no thanks just as soon as he stops laughing. However, in some good news for the Scot, it seems he is no longer going to be stuck sharing the bench with Dimitar Berbatov after Paris Saint-Germain decided that the 31-year-old Count von Count impersonator was just the sort of striker that could lead them to the glory. Like the Mill missing its funky time, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho misses Didier Drogba and the Special One is &quot;desperate&quot; to be reunited with his buddy of old. In truth, Mourinho has been a mess without him. He misses him so damn much. He misses being with him. He misses being near him. He misses his laugh. He misses his scent. In fact, when all the contract negotiations are done between the Ivorian striker&apos;s Mr 15% and Real Madrid, Mourinho wants the two to get an apartment together. Far from being freaked out by this prospect, Drogba is ready to give an almighty two fingers to Shanghai Shenhua and their \u00a3300,000-a-week contract in order to move to the Spanish capital. Two players who are not saying no to China, however, are the Blackburn duo of Yakubu Ayegbeni and Ga\u00ebl Givet. Meanwhile, deep in the bowels of the Britannia, Martin O&apos;Neill and David Moyes are holding their glasses to the boardroom door as they do their darndest to hear how talks between Robert Huth and cap-wearing&apos;s Tony Pulis are progressing. If there is the slightest hitch, both will burst in and offer the wall-shaped human battering ram a shiny new contract. Should Moyes get there before O&apos;Neill, the Northern Irishman will solve all of Sunderland&apos;s defensive problems by throwing money in the direction of Carlos Cu\u00e9llar.

Since we were 13, 14, we&apos;ve all been together on camps and things. We are doing well and swimming fast and it does feel like a golden era.&quot; What Halsall is too modest to say is that she is one of the brightest lights. This summer Halsall will compete in five different Olympic disciplines, and has a chance of winning a medal in each and every one. She is ranked second in the world in the 50m freestyle, third in the 100m freestyle, and fifth in the 100m butterfly. She could also be part of two relays, the 4x100m freestyle and the 4x100m medley. At the age of 22, Halsall could be on the cusp of achieving the kind of fame that will shape the rest of her life. She is a witty woman, a star waiting to be discovered. Not that she is craving the attention. &quot;When I start talking about the Olympics a lot I think about it a lot and I don&apos;t want to do that,&quot; she says. &quot;It is nice to have people want to listen to what you have to say, but when I am not around it I just go and be Fran and stroke my cats at home on my own.&quot; Halsall has two of them, a big ginger tom called Banks and a &quot;crazy, pretty little thing&quot; called Bella. She used to have a dog called Roma too, but it was packed off to live with her parents because the three beasts were causing such a ruckus. She and her boyfriend, the GB hockey player Alastair Wilson, do a better job of co-exisiting than her pets did. Though Halsall admits that she did get a little jealous when the Duchess of Cambridge turned up to one of GB hockey&apos;s training sessions. &quot;He met her, and he said she was very pretty,&quot; she says with mock indignation. &quot;I was like &apos;Oi, oi!&apos;&quot; Halsall is going to have a gruelling Games. She could find herself taking part in four events on the first day of competition. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she says with a rueful chuckle, &quot;It is going to be a tough first day but once it&apos;s out of the way, hopefully if all goes to plan I have got my 100m fly final and after that I have got two days off before my freestyle events. So I have got to get them done and recover properly in between. That&apos;s the key definitely.&quot; For a swimmer with such a heavy workload, Halsall can be unusually frail. She came down with food poisoning at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, and by her own admission she underperformed at the world championships in Shanghai last year because she made such a mess of her diet. &quot;I&apos;m all about feel,&quot; she explains. &quot;I like to feel good and high in the water. And with my events you have to feel really strong in them. The 100m and the 50m are all about power. You have to feel strong, and when we were in China and Shanghai I lost quite a lot of weight because I wasn&apos;t eating right.&quot; During those world championships Halsall&apos;s weight dropped to 58kg, whereas she usually races at 60-61kg. &quot;I just didn&apos;t eat enough, because I didn&apos;t like it,&quot; she says. &quot;It wasn&apos;t what I was used to. And I didn&apos;t eat enough of what I should have to fuel myself for my race.&quot; She will not have that problem in London, partly because her support team are putting so much effort into getting her diet plan right, and partly because the food will be a lot more familiar. Her mind is already racing ahead to what might be on offer for the athletes in the Olympic village. &quot;In China they had a duck roll stand in the village, and we were wondering whether they&apos;ll have a fish and chip stand in London. Or bangers and mash. How cool what that be? Not that I&apos;d eat it before a race,&quot; she adds quickly. It is not just the nutritionists Halsall has been working with since Shanghai. The world championships were a traumatic experience for her. She finished fourth in the 100m freestyle, despite having qualified fastest for the final. It was as close as she came to a medal there. Since then she has been talking to the psychologist Simon Middlemas about her performance. &quot;He said, &apos;Well you&apos;ve had that experience now, you know what it feels like to be put up on a pedestal to win and then not win. That&apos;s happened and nothing ridiculously bad has happened because of that so, what are you complaining about?&apos;&quot; &quot;The worst has happened,&quot; Halsall says. &quot;It&apos;s taken the scariness out of it.

Which is a shame, because if he did, they&apos;d get a much more outlandish answer. Morris is a 24-year-old psychonaut \u2013 that is to say, an explorer in the realm of psychoactive substances. Another way of putting this is that he takes drugs for a living. Resembling an even-more-attenuated member of the Horrors and talking in a distinctive, deep bass voice with long, drawled vowels that themselves sound narcotised, Morris travels the world in search of new highs. These adventures, which he undertakes with a mix of gonzo abandon and scholarly rigour, are chronicled in the vice.com video series Hamilton&apos;s Pharmacopeia. The highlight is a six-part film called Nzambi, in which Morris travels to Haiti in search of the preparation purported to induce zombification and ends up having hypnagogic hallucinations about Jean-Claude Van Damme. For Morris, the drugs themselves seem secondary to what his hero, ethnobotanist Wade Davis, terms &quot;the cultural matrix&quot;: in other words, his desire to get off his face and out of his head is bound up with the noble spirit of anthropological enquiry. &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he agrees. &quot;Absolutely. And that applies to everywhere and every single drug. I could guess you could call it ethno-chemistry.&quot; We&apos;re drinking water out of jam jars and talking amid the spectacular chaos of his Williamsburg apartment \u2013 an exploded Wunderkammer of cultural matrices that would also support anthropological investigation. Books and journals are amassed in strata so deep that they look like the floor&apos;s naturally occurring geological eructations. Curios include a taxidermy anteater, a shrine of tiny coffins, and \u2013 lying open and empty on the floor \u2013 a suitcase so small and quaintly battered that it looks like a toy or a prop. But it&apos;s neither, having accompanied Morris on missions to the Amazon (in search of the psychedelic sapo frog), the Netherlands (&quot;magic&quot; truffles) and, more recently, Shanghai (to investigate its grey market drug factories, best known for producing mephedrone). But for all the global adventuring, Morris claims that &quot;the internet is the new unexplored jungle. This is the best time ever in the history of mankind to be interested in drugs because you have virtually every botanical psychedelic that&apos;s ever been discovered available from different ethno-botanical vendors on the internet. And on the one hand, sure, it&apos;s bad that people inevitably die, but it&apos;s also amazing in terms of everything that&apos;s being learned about toxicology as a result.&quot; I must look a bit shocked because he concedes that last statement is more of a &quot;detached view of things. It&apos;s tragic that people are dying but it&apos;s also amazing what&apos;s learned as a result of \u2013 things that would never be learned if everyone acted responsibly.&quot; &apos;My parents had a pretty rational position, which is that drugs are not bad, it&apos;s only bad to waste your time with drugs. Which I agree with&apos;     Hamilton with his dad Errol Morris. Photograph: J Vespa/WireImage    I ask him what kind of a kid he was. Introspective? Nerdy? &quot;Probably I was a nerdy kid, yeah. I certainly wasn&apos;t athletic.&quot; He thinks and then offers, &quot;I was a pyromaniac,&quot; with a languid wrist gesture that says &quot;weren&apos;t we all.&quot; &quot;There was no serious damage to anything,&quot; he insists. &quot;But I would spend hours stripping the phosphorous off the heads of matches and making different explosives.&quot; Morris is the only child of Errol Morris, the documentary film-maker, and Julia Sheehan, an art historian. &quot;My dad is a weird guy and always had a lot of &apos;characters&apos; around \u2013 Holocaust deniers and robotics experts.&quot; His folks sound pretty lenient. &quot;I think they had a pretty rational position, which is that drugs are not bad, it&apos;s only bad to waste your time with drugs. Which I agree with. I feel very lucky, very genetically privileged, that I have pretty solid control over my use of things. Drugs are too interesting, too much fun to use irresponsibly. I very rarely drink or smoke pot. But with something new, it&apos;s never recreational, and I try to mostly do new things.&quot; Morris&apos;s first meaningful drugs experience came at age 13, &quot;in my friend&apos;s Volvo, smoking salvia and crying tears of joy&quot;. He felt, he recalls, &quot;just astonishment that those states are even possible, that anyone can reach them so effortlessly.&quot; And like a fastidious gourmand bemoaning the rubes who dunk ketchup on their souffles, he has little patience for &quot;those people not having good experiences&quot;. Generally, he says, &quot;it&apos;s because they&apos;re not doing it right&quot;. and he stresses the word with exasperation. &quot;I don&apos;t even understand what is going on with these people, that are doing, you know, twenty grammes of mephedrone in a single night, because it&apos;s only going to result in misery. It does ruin it for everyone, a little bit.&quot; He&apos;s never been hospitalised himself, but evenly recounts his best friend at university going &quot;permanently insane&quot; while they were tripping together. &quot;He had such a severe psychotic break he did not recover. As in he is now schizophrenic as a result. So, I mean, I&apos;ve worried about going insane. But I think a lot of people in their early twenties worry about going insane. I think that&apos;s just a general human worry, not necessarily a psychonautical worry. &quot;I would encourage people to not reactively think that these things are bad or to always point out &apos;Oh it could be dangerous&apos;. Everything could be dangerous. There shouldn&apos;t be this weird attitude of being afraid to experiment with anything. The states can be so dramatic and can feel so terrifying or so unpleasant at a certain point that you wonder how could you ever recover from something so awful. Then you do recover, usually in the same day or the same hour. The resilience of the human mind is amazing.&quot; I wrap things up by asking Morris if he thinks drugs have made him a better person.

Helicopter skiing in Alaska or a getaway to luxury goods group LVMH&apos;s exclusive hideaway in the Maldives are the current trends for the growing number of millionaires, according to a report. It predicts that, despite the eurozone crisis, spending on luxury goods will hit $1.5tn (\u00a3975bn) this year as the wealthy look for novel ways to spend their riches. The study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) identifies a shift from &quot;owning a luxury to experiencing a luxury&quot; with bespoke treats now accounting for more than half of the $1.4tn spent on luxury goods and services last year. Luxury sales have boomed in the last two years as the industry recovered from the hiatus caused by 2008 global financial crisis, which provoked a sharp fall in conspicuous consumption. The sector has also been buoyed by the growing number of millionaire shoppers in markets such as China and Brazil, who are picking up the slack as consumers in traditionally important luxury markets such as western Europe, Japan and the US continue to spend more cautiously. &quot;The gap in income inequality is growing, which is unfortunate, but there are more and more millionaires every year,&quot; said Jean-Marc Bellaiche, a BCG senior partner who heads the firm&apos;s luxury practice. Bellaiche said sales of luxury experiences grew 50% faster than demand for physical goods last year. The trend is explained, in part, by demographics \u2013 as the consumers who drove the luxury boom in the 1990s start to retire, he said. &quot;They do not want to own new things, so are the primary customers for experiential luxury offerings,&quot; he said. Their options are not limited to exclusive safaris and spas, they can book themselves in for a five-star hospital stay where they will be waited on by a butler and the en suite facilities include a marble bath. The attitude to luxury is also apparent among their children who, the report says, now want more than the latest designer fashions. &quot;Members of Generation Y tend to define themselves more by what they&apos;ve done and experienced than by what they own,&quot; said Bellaiche. &quot;They are drawn to instant pleasure and lavish experiences \u2013 helicopter snowboarding in Alaska or a weekend shopping spree in Paris.&quot; The shift is evident &quot;even in brand-obsessed China&quot; where personal luxury goods serve as a\u00a0strong badge of status and success, he added. The business of providing luxury experiences \u2013 from art auctions to exclusive travel packages \u2013 is now worth $770bn, according to the study. BCG predicts a 7% increase in luxury spending this year, albeit at a slower rate than the industry has enjoyed in the last two years. Stock markets around the world have been shaken since April as the eurozone crisis, the faltering US economic recovery and signs of a slowdown in China, have made some analysts take a more cautious view of the outlook for luxury sales. Recent upsets include last week&apos;s decision by luxury jeweller Graff Diamonds to scrap its $1bn Hong Kong flotation after a lacklustre response from investors. Rival jeweller Tiffany, which is considered a key barometer of health for the luxury consumer, did not helped Graff&apos;s cause by cutting its sales and profit forecasts in the days leading up to the planned listing. Despite these fears, BCG says the growth of the middle class in emerging markets such as China, Brazil and Russia will boost the global luxury market. Big cities in the these nations are becoming powerful luxury hubs and their residents are a shopping force abroad, with the group dubbed &quot;international travelling consumers&quot; making their presence felt in the boutiques of shopping destinations such as London and Paris.

Well done, the FA, we all chorused, you&apos;ve really got the best interests of football fans at heart! Anyway, a decade on, and as Jarvis Cocker so nearly sang, clowns are still running the world. For in Cardiff, a deeply unpleasant shower of chancers are busy dismantling the local football team. This morning, two days before the start of Euro 2012, and with an England race storm dominating the media agenda to boot, the gaggle of shameless bozos currently with the keys to Cardiff City have quietly announced a &quot;radical and revolutionary&quot; change of team colours, plus a really cack new badge. What&apos;s more, they&apos;ve got the brazen cheek to dress up the effective franchising of the club as a &quot;progressive&quot; measure necessary to the club&apos;s survival. While hoping to distract large swathes of the club&apos;s support with a couple of shiny coins, Tan Sri Vincent Tan and Dato Chan Tien Ghee \u2013 pompously referred to in a rambling statement as Our Investors \u2013 have decided, seeing they have no respect for anyone or anything, to change Cardiff&apos;s blue kit to red, and their famous bluebird badge to a Welsh dragon. &quot;I know and understand that there have been reservations in certain quarters over the changes accompanying the investment, but \u2026&quot; began Dato, before going on to explain that he was going to do whatever he liked anyway. Chief executive and rich man&apos;s lackey Alan Whiteley insists that the rebrand will be &quot;accepted by the vast majority of supporters as judged in the light of the numerous emails and letters of support, backed by recent poll results from the Supporters&apos; Club and Media Wales&quot;. Which is an interesting take, given it was only 27 days ago when Dato himself insisted that &quot;in the light of the vociferous opposition \u2026 we will not proceed with the proposed change of colour and logo and the team will continue to play in blue at home for the next season with the current badge.&quot; Exactly why Cardiff are bothering anyway is a moot point. Their argument \u2013 &quot;to reactivate rebranding proposals with a view to exploiting and maximising brand and commercial revenues in international markets&quot; \u2013 doesn&apos;t actually mean anything in the world outside the PowerPoint presentation. But if building a modern superbrand is the aim, well, red shirts are hardly unique in football, while the new &quot;crest development&quot; is so amateurishly cobbled together it makes Shrewsbury Town&apos;s infamous clip-art effort look like it was designed by Saul Bass. Still, all is not lost, with the majority of fans presumably of the opinion that some things \u2013 113 years&apos; worth of tradition, basic self respect, etc \u2013 are worth a wee bit more than coin. Accordingly, the Fiver looks forward to City&apos;s attendances plummeting next season as fans boycott the club, before Our Investors are chased out of town, and the blue kit with bluebird is restored two or three home matches into the season.

Whisky producers are turning the taps on as drinkers thousands of miles away in the botecos of Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai&apos;s upmarket watering holes knock back Scotland&apos;s national tipple with gusto. Last year, whisky exports broke through \u00a34bn, as the drink cemented its position as a status symbol for the growing middle classes of the emerging economies of China, south Asia and South America. Diageo, owner of Johnnie Walker and Bell&apos;s whiskies, said it was already scouting locations in Speyside \u2013 known as the whisky triangle because the rugged landscape is home to more than half of Scotland&apos;s distilleries \u2013 and the Highlands for the first of potentially three new malt distilleries. Diageo&apos;s boss, Paul Walsh, said the five-year investment marked a pivotal moment for its scotch whisky business, which he said had achieved &quot;remarkable, sustained global growth&quot; in recent years. &quot;Scotch is resonating with consumers from Boston to Beijing,&quot; he said. &quot;We expect that success to continue, particularly in high-growth markets.&quot; The decline of Scotland&apos;s industrial base has meant that, as with the shipyards and the mines, few Scots have been able to follow their fathers into the traditional trades related to whisky production. But Diageo said the plan would create 110 new jobs aimed at young people including apprentice coopers and coppersmiths. The building projects will create around 250 construction jobs each year and an estimated 500 jobs in the wider economy, the company said. The promise of new jobs marks a turning point for the industry, said Campbell Evans of the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), because while many producers have been increasing production \u2013 including reopening mothballed distilleries \u2013 it has so far not particularly boosted employment. About 10,000 people, many in economically deprived parts of Scotland, are employed directly by the industry. &quot;The scotch whisky industry has been enjoying a renaissance for several years,&quot; said Evans. &quot;I hesitate to use the term &apos;golden age&apos; but this investment takes us beyond renaissance.&quot; With annual sales of nearly \u00a310bn, Diageo owns a bar-full of drinks brands including Buchanan&apos;s, Smirnoff vodka, Baileys and Guinness. Half the pot of money is earmarked to build two distilleries and a new warehouse to store the maturing spirit. Although storm clouds hang over the global economy, drinks companies such as Diageo must try to predict the level of demand for blends such as Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B and Bells a decade from now. Legally it takes three years for &quot;new make&quot; to even earn the name whisky, and the rest of the money will be tied up in the producing and maturing of the extra bottles. Whisky is Scotland&apos;s biggest export. John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said Diageo&apos;s investment showed the industry had a strong future: &quot;The investment in new distilleries and warehousing capacity is a vivid illustration of the positive and optimistic outlook for demand.&quot; Diageo said it would consider building a third distillery if whisky sales continued to grow at more than 10% a year. Walsh said three sites had been identified for the first new distillery, including Inchgower and Glendullan in Speyside, and Teaninich slightly further north, while nearly half of its existing 28 malt distilleries were set to expand. The industry is riding high as a dram becomes the status drink of choice in countries such as Brazil, Russia and China. This year it is predicted more scotch will be consumed in emerging markets than in the developed world, for the first time. Diageo&apos;s rivals are also expanding, with market number two Pernod Ricard \u2013 behind brands such as Ballantine&apos;s and Chivas Regal \u2013 unveiling a \u00a340m investment in its malt distilleries last week. Last year, Brazil was the fastest growing whisky export market, with sales surging 48% to nearly \u00a3100m as Cariocas cooled off at the beach with a whisky and coke. Yet it is a very different story back at home, with consumption in Scotland continuing to fall as the drink finds itself out of fashion with younger consumers who view it as a something their parents drink. &quot;This year, we forecast scotch consumption in the emerging markets will be greater than in the developed world,&quot; says Chris Pitcher, a drinks analyst at brokers Redburn. &quot;This is an important inflection point which highlights the broad-based appeal whisky has achieved.&quot;", "tags": ["Diageo", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "Whisky", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Scotland", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-06T19:36:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/08/japan-election-pop-group-akb48", "sentences": ["Just as K-pop has outgrown its South Korean roots, sister groups have emerged in Jakarta, Taipei and Shanghai."], "title": "Japan gripped by TV election of pop group AKB48", "article": "Political analysts have long warned that Japan has fallen prey to widespread popular discontent with the democratic process. But this week, the country succumbed to an outbreak of election fever focused on what, for many, was by far the most pressing issue of the day. Watched by millions on TV, the victors took to a stage in central Tokyo to deliver tearful acceptance speeches, as analysts offered interpretations of the vote&apos;s wider meaning. But this was not politics as usual. There was no place for greying, middle-aged men in dark suits - the candidates were dozens of teenagers and women in their early 20s, all vying for the title of president of the J-pop phenomenon AKB48. In a contest that has gripped Japan for weeks, Yuko Oshima \u2013 a relatively mature singer at the age of 23 \u2013 emerged as the most popular member of the band, whose sugar-coated refrains have rivalled their Korean counterparts for the affections of Asian pop fans. Japan&apos;s broadcasters spent weeks trailing the vote, culminating in three hours of live coverage from the Nippon Budokan venue in Tokyo on Wednesday night. Images of Oshima, who will lead the group for the next year, were plastered over the following day&apos;s newspapers and generated hours of analysis on daytime TV shows. Even the normally staid broadsheets recognised that her election, with 108,000 votes \u2013 putting her well ahead of her closest rival \u2013 was a significant moment in J-pop history. Likening herself to a flower bud about to come into full bloom, she told her fans: &quot;You have given me water and light. But flowers wither eventually. Please be my sunshine forever.&quot; Oshima and 15 other performers earned enough votes among the 1.4 million cast to guarantee them a place in the lineup for the group&apos;s 27th single, to be released in August. The group&apos;s 90 members appear in rotation depending on their popularity with the public. The marketing brilliance did not end there: the public could only secure votes by buying a copy of the group&apos;s latest single, a Japanese and English track about the joys of summer. Each copy came with a code number enabling consumers to cast their votes online. With the most devout snapping up multiple CDs to boost the prospects of their favourite singer, the single sold a record 1.62m copies in its first week. One fan reportedly spent US$6,700 to secure 2,700 votes in online auctions. Since their debut in 2005, AKB48 have built up a huge following among girls in Japan and, more recently, other parts of Asia, as well as salarymen who flock to concerts and publicity events for the chance to shake hands and exchange a few words with their idols. The group, named after the geeky Akihabara district of Tokyo, have had a succession of million-selling singles and generated sales of more than US$200m in CD and DVD sales last year alone. Members appear in commercials for everything from chocolate to mobile phones, and they were recently enlisted in campaigns to sell Japanese government bonds and prevent teenage suicides. Their performances owe more to a heightened sense of kawaii cuteness than overt sexuality, but AKB48 members courted controversy over a recent confectionary commercial that some conservative commentators deemed inappropriate. But neither that, nor the arrest of one singer&apos;s mother for allegedly having sex with a minor, has slowed the group&apos;s rise to J-pop&apos;s apex. Together, the 48 stable has more than 230 members comprising four main groups and several smaller offshoots. Just as K-pop has outgrown its South Korean roots, sister groups have emerged in Jakarta, Taipei and Shanghai. This week&apos;s election fever has been attributed to discontent with conventional elections, with one expert even drawing an improbable comparison with the Arab spring. Hidetomi Tanaka, a professor at Jobu University, offered a more prosaic explanation. &quot;These girls start from the amateur level with few singing and dancing skills,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;But the thing is they grow up with their fans.&quot; While some heralded the election as a popular challenge to the authority of the AKB48 impresario Yasushi Akimoto, the vote left some fans feeling disillusioned. &quot;It&apos;s supposed to be a general election, but it&apos;s the people with money who determine the result,&quot; a 16-year-old high school pupil told the Asahi Shimbun. &quot;It&apos;s like shareholders who have a bigger say if they invest more.

From the outset he reminds us: &quot;Today, for the first time in the history of the planet, more than half the population \u2013 3.3 billion people \u2013 are city dwellers \u2026 by 2050, 75% will be urbanites.&quot; In keeping with the spirit of the city itself \u2013 more a vital and unpredictable organism than a rationally planned machine for living in \u2013 this book has been planned as a walk, or wander, through the city with no set routes or strict chronology. &quot;As in a real city,&quot; says Smith, &quot;you can follow any number of pathways through this book. And don&apos;t worry about getting lost. Some say it&apos;s the only way really to experience a city.&quot; Smith is right when he talks about getting lost, for there is always another city alley to take, doorway to enter, park to stroll through or some overlooked or even forbidden quarter of a city to sidle through. The greatest cities are inexhaustible, and not least because they are constantly changing. And when a city stops evolving, its lifeblood freezes and it becomes \u2013 as history proves \u2013 little or nothing more than a museum showcasing its own past or a cluster of haunting ruins. And, yet, ambitious city builders, from ancient Sumeria to Shanghai today, have nearly always thought of the city as a rational and thoroughly planned ideal brought to life in avenues and public squares arranged as straight as a die. One of Smith&apos;s brief and illuminating chapters looks at the idea of the &quot;Ideal City&quot;, spinning through notions conjured by Plato, Vitruvius, Leonardo, Thomas More, Campanella, Ebenezer Howard and Le Corbusier. As a counterpoint, he also cites Italo Calvino&apos;s Marco Polo, who in that enchanting book Invisible Cities tells Kublai Khan: &quot;Cities, like dreams, are made of desire and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.&quot; The city, then, is never as rational as its founders, patrons, architects, planners, bureaucrats and engineers might have wished it to be. Truly great cities have always been a heady mix of the planned and the unplanned, the rational and the irrational, the dreamlike and the matter-of-fact. A great city today might have a magnificent core of grand central streets, stirring architecture, a comprehensive public transport system running like clockwork, secret sewers going about their sulphurous business untiringly, sane governance, bright schools, comforting hospitals, and all of these underpinned by healthy commerce and adorned by a confident culture. And, yet, the same city would be woven through with the unpredictable worlds of fashion, music, art, cuisine, carnivals, hobbies, cults, clubs. So behind the walls of the city \u2013 Smith has a chapter on these \u2013 there is darkness, graffiti, street language, uprisings, religions, ghettos and slums, cathedral-like railway stations, traffic, trade, bazaars, malls, museums, red-light districts and so much else. Smith packs the blood, guts, underbelly and driving forces of the archetypal city into chapters as densely packed as the streetscapes of Manhattan or Hong Kong. He reminds us that, today, such dense cities are surrounded by ever-expanding and mind-numbingly banal outer-suburbia; as a consequence \u2013 in the words of the theorist of renewable energies, Peter Droege \u2013 the promiscuously sprawling 21st-century city is &quot;a fossil-fuel construct in search of rapid restructuring&quot;. Smith&apos;s lively urban tutorial is framed between chapters looking at the origins and the future of the city. I was touched to see him so confident that the world&apos;s first city might well have been Eridu, in what is today southern Iraq, as this brought back memories of my getting to this antique city buried in scorching desert sands a few months before George W Bush and Tony Blair launched their assault on the venerable, if much younger, city of Baghdad. I am still researching the world&apos;s earliest cities and half expect to find examples older than Eridu. But what Eridu taught me in a direct way, as its hot sands slipped through my hands, was that cities are indeed organisms: they are born, mature, grow old and sometimes become irrelevant. The stuff of lofty intentions and grubby backstreet life, the city represents much of our restless and contradictory natures. &quot;In this dynamic, cosmopolitan space,&quot; Smith writes, &quot;lies the wellspring of our creativity as a species. The greatest cities nurture and stimulate ideas in science and the arts that are the very heart of human civilisation. For this reason, sustainable, humane and well-governed cities are our best hope for the future.&quot; Amen. Although, Smith might have added that to keep them alive, and healthy and &quot;civilised&quot;, we will have to wrestle with the forces of globalised banality threatening to turn cities into homogenous and mindless machines for unsustainable consumption. The sorcery of cities should not be lost; Smith&apos;s ebullient guidebook helps to remind us why. \u2022 Jonathan Glancey&apos;s Nagaland is published by Faber.", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Architecture", "Society", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-08T21:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/08/midnight-in-peking-paul-french-review", "sentences": ["Midnight in Peking could be usefully supplemented by a book such as Robert Bickers&apos;s Empire Made Me (2003), which tells the tale of a British policeman stationed in Shanghai between the wars, and combines a wonderfully atmospheric account of the city&apos;s &quot;noisy stinking streets&quot; with a thoughtful social history of the changes in the substantial British presence in China."], "title": "Midnight in Peking by Paul French - review", "article": "The scandal surrounding the former Chinese Politburo high flyer Bo Xilai has turned from political intrigue to something much more sinister. If the rumours being floated by the Chinese authorities are to be believed, Bo&apos;s wife, Gu Kailai, plotted to have Neil Heywood, a British businessman, killed and may even have paid thugs to force him to drink poison. The mixture of high politics, elite lifestyle and murder, all in the setting of a rapidly changing China, has caught the attention of millions of newspaper readers around the world, who couldn&apos;t have found Bo&apos;s city of Chongqing on a map three months ago. Another murder involving a Briton in China attracted popular attention three-quarters of a century ago. As with the death of Heywood, the circumstances were deeply suspicious. But the details were even more horrific. On the morning of 8 January 1937, the body of a 19-year-old girl was found at the foot of the Fox Tower in Beijing. All the blood had been drained from her body and in a particularly gruesome detail, her heart was missing, ripped out through her broken rib cage. The victim was Pamela Werner, daughter of ETC Werner, well-known in the British community as a former consul and academic sinologist. Pamela had been an ordinary expatriate schoolgirl, something of a loner, but keen on ice-skating and listening to big bands on the radio. Unusually, though, she spoke fluent Mandarin. Was there a hidden side to her life, people asked, that had led to her terrible death? An investigation was launched, but it quickly ran into trouble. The Legation Quarter of the city where expatriates under treaty protection tended to live was at the heart of the investigation, and an unusual joint Chinese-British police operation was instigated to get at the truth. Yet over and over again, the police were steered away from details that might throw the spotlight of blame on to the white community. Perhaps it was more convenient, and less embarrassing, to think that crazed Chinese ritual killers might be responsible. Paul French&apos;s narrative of the investigation is spellbinding, drawing the reader from the very first pages into an unwholesome, macabre world where nothing seems to make sense. In a welcome turn away from orientalist clich\u00e9, the book makes the westerners in Peking seem like an assortment of oddballs, standing out amid a crowd of Chinese who are getting on with their lives as best they can. A respectable American dentist turns out to be the leader of a nudist club (and his own consulate thinks him capable of more sinister and abusive activity). An upright schoolteacher is found to have sadistic tendencies and is shipped off to Britain. Even Werner, the scholar who turned detective, comes over as an obsessive (as well he might do with a murdered daughter), a man of violent temper who had broken a young Chinese man&apos;s nose for daring to talk to Pamela. The British authorities in China did their best to try to preserve their mystique of superiority in the face of the murder, thwarting attempts by British and Chinese detectives alike to penetrate into the &quot;badlands&quot; of the city to search for clues in a steamy quarter of brothels and dope dens. As war with Japan loomed, Werner became ever more frantic to find out the truth. A plausible account of what might have happened did eventually emerge, but too late to bring the culprit to justice. French calls the book a &quot;reconstruction&quot;, and that is quite accurate in the sense that history and true-crime shows on TV use the same term to describe a way of putting together known facts in an accessible fashion. But the technique does mean that, although the book is based on archival materials, many never used before, it often verges on the speculative: we&apos;re frequently told what a policeman or a doctor was thinking or feeling in a way that sounds novelistic rather than purely historical. The undeniably gripping plot also draws attention away from the wider context, perhaps inevitably. Titanic events, most notably the invasion of China by the Japanese, sit in the background, and the wider colonial history that brought these foreigners to China in the first place is sketched lightly. Pamela Werner&apos;s murder was so shocking, and the cast of characters surrounding it so baroque, that it&apos;s hard to use it to make a wider point (not many foreigners were murderers or even nudists, after all), and the story tends toward evocation rather than explanation, like White Mischief with the Forbidden City rather than the Kenyan highlands as backdrop. Midnight in Peking could be usefully supplemented by a book such as Robert Bickers&apos;s Empire Made Me (2003), which tells the tale of a British policeman stationed in Shanghai between the wars, and combines a wonderfully atmospheric account of the city&apos;s &quot;noisy stinking streets&quot; with a thoughtful social history of the changes in the substantial British presence in China. And Qian Zhongshu&apos;s classic 1947 novel Fortress Besieged (available in English translation) is perhaps the best evocation in fiction of what the tumultuous politics of the 1930s meant for China&apos;s own citizens as they coped with the onset of war and the horrors that followed. There&apos;s no doubt that the Werner case does have many of the features of the grimmest sort of fiction, and there was a danger that the story could have been written as a sort of Fu Manchu tale of murder in the mysterious east. Instead, French has created an affecting account of the death of a trusting, vulnerable and no doubt terrified young woman. Seventy-five years after the murder, it&apos;s not too much to suggest that the book is a final act of remembrance. The Chinese themselves, of course, have something of a record of composing &quot;true crime reconstructions&quot; of murders and scandals in high places. Back in 1997, a book appeared entitled Wrath of Heaven (Tiannu) \u2013 a novelised version of the true story behind the recent downfall and suicide of Beijing&apos;s former mayor.

There was a degree of cautious optimism on the Mauritian side that progress could be made \u2013 speaking earlier today on the BBC World Service Mauritius, UN ambassador Milan Meetarbhan stated that the occasion &quot;was an important opportunity to discuss how we can resolve these issues&quot; and so it proved. &quot;It was a friendly, cordial and open meeting,&quot; a source told me. &quot;David Cameron has agreed to restart dialogue with Mauritius over Chagos. It&apos;s something of a breakthrough.&quot; Successive governments in Port Louis have pointed out to anyone who would listen that the dismemberment of its territory as a condition of the country&apos;s independence in March 1968, was in blatant contravention of UN resolution 1514 of 1960, which states that &quot;any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the charter of the United Nations&quot;. Those words were coined more than half a century ago \u2013 the same year as Macmillan made his speech in South Africa, which inaugurated a second wave of decolonisation by Britain in sub-Saharan Africa. Now, Cameron appears to be willing to sanction a change of policy towards Chagos. Here are four big reasons why he should continue in this direction. The first is that since 1998 successive UK governments have been involved in a no-expense-spared battle with Olivier Bancoult, leader of the Port Louis-based Chagos Refugees Group, which is seeking the right of return for around 700 surviving islanders and their descendants, who were forcibly removed from their ancestral homeland by the British authorities between 1968 and 1971 and dumped in Mauritius and the Seychelles. After a spectacular series of victories in the high court and court of appeal, Bancoult lost by a narrow 3-2 verdict in the House of Lords in 2008. The case is now before the European court of human rights and a judgement is expected soon. Even the zealots in the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, who have maintained a consistently hostile attitude towards Chagossian resettlement, must be in fear that the court in Strasbourg will find against the UK. The second reason is that Mauritius is contesting the right of former UK foreign secretary, David Miliband, to have unilaterally declared Chagos a full &quot;no take&quot; marine-protected area on 1 April, 2011. As WikiLeaks later revealed, the policy, which outlaws all forms of fishing, was in part motivated to put paid to the right of return of the Chagossians, described as &quot;Man Fridays&quot; by Colin Roberts, the British Indian Ocean Territory commissioner. Evidence of an unreconstructed colonial mentality and a strategy straight out of Machiavelli&apos;s The Prince is unlikely to go down well at the forthcoming tribunal, which will hear the case under the UN convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS). Furthermore, it is of some significance that Mauritius will be represented by the formidable Philippe Sands QC, professor of international law at UCL. If the judgement goes against the UK, it will have significant implications for the Diego Garcia base, where an extension to the existing agreement between the UK and US has to be agreed by December 2014. The third reason is that Mauritius, which is about the size of the Isle of Wight and has a population of nearly 1.3 million, has experienced the shift of economic power from west to east and south. The palm-fringed island is being wooed by China and India as an important gateway to fast-growing consumer markets in mainland Africa, comprising over 1 billion people. The courtship means that Mauritius is no longer obliged to play a subservient role to the former colonial master (or the US) out of fear that its vital trading interests could come under pressure. That leads to the final point. Although the threat from the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean has long since disappeared, the new powers, China and India, are both flexing their ever growing military muscles. These old rivals, along with the US, are competing to secure the shipping lanes transporting goods and raw materials, especially oil and gas, between Africa and Asia. And the competition is not just limited to blue water. India now has the capacity with its Agni-111 rocket capable of carrying a 1.5 tonne nuclear warhead more than 3,000 kilometres, which would bring the Chinese cities of Beijing and Shanghai, but also Diego Garcia within range. David Cameron would do well to consider, then, whether the UK might be better to have Mauritius as a partner rather than an enemy. For strategic reasons, Port Louis has already indicated that the return of the Chagos archipelago to its control will not impact on the use of the Diego Garcia base. This would secure its future, rather than to leaving it to chance, with the risk that something might go badly wrong for western interests in the Indian Ocean because of the rivalry between China and India. The UK has a golden opportunity based on realpolitik, but also by supporting human rights and international law, to restore the Chagos archipelago to its rightful owners: the islanders who once possessed their homes and land by virtue of customary title, and Mauritius from which it was illegally excised. Harold Macmillan, the great Tory pragmatist and trend spotter, would surely approve.", "tags": ["Chagos Islands", "Mauritius", "David Cameron", "Politics", "Africa", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-09T14:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/11/chinese-activist-feng-zhenghu-house", "sentences": ["Feng Zhenghu remains under house arrest in his third-floor flat in central Shanghai.", "It is Shanghai, a metropolis, but such things are still happening,&quot; said Feng.", "An officer at the local station referred queries to the Shanghai police media department, where calls rang unanswered."], "title": "Chinese activist Feng Zhenghu held under Shanghai house arrest", "article": "A Chinese activist angers the authorities by helping people use the law to protect their rights, and ends up trapped inside his home for months. So far, so familiar. But Chen Guangcheng is now living freely in the US. Feng Zhenghu remains under house arrest in his third-floor flat in central Shanghai. Since February, the 57-year-old scholar has been barred from leaving his home, except when escorted to the police station for 10-hour interrogations \u2013 as he was on Saturday. At one stage, unable even to shop for food, he resorted to lowering a basket from his window for well-wishers to fill with groceries every few days. &quot;What they have done to me is a breach of the law. It has no legal basis. I am very angry,&quot; said Feng, speaking to the Guardian by telephone. Wang Songlian, of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said: &quot;Maybe people think Chen Guangcheng&apos;s case was unique and that this has been won. Feng Zhenghu and Chen&apos;s cases are both extreme, but they are on a continuum of illegal punishment and detentions for activists that is very, very common in China.&quot; Chen and his family were subjected to an extraordinarily vicious and sustained regime of house arrest. The blind activist&apos;s wife was prevented from leaving home and the couple say they were beaten repeatedly. Even their six-year-old daughter was escorted to and from school by guards. But while Chen was being held in a remote village in eastern Shandong province, Feng is in the centre of arguably China&apos;s most developed city, across the road from a glossy shopping mall. &quot;It is not Shandong province here. It is Shanghai, a metropolis, but such things are still happening,&quot; said Feng. &quot;They know what they are doing is wrong, but they still keep doing it. I can take the pain; this incident is a good education for the public. It is difficult to establish an adequate system of law in China and requires more effort.&quot; Supporters believe the authorities see the parallel with Chen, too. They say officials installed the two rows of metal spikes below Feng&apos;s window, apparently to stop him escaping, shortly after Chen fled to the US embassy. On Thursday, a police car was parked beneath Feng&apos;s window and several men were watching the block. Supporters say up to a dozen guards monitor him day and night. Feng is used to battling officials: in 2009, he made headlines around the world by camping out at Tokyo&apos;s Narita airport when Chinese authorities stopped him returning to his own country eight times. Many compared his case to the film The Terminal. After three months of high-profile protest, he was finally able to re-enter China. But since then he has experienced repeated harassment, including numerous bouts of detention and more than 10 searches of his flat. He believes the official resentment over his protest is partly to blame for his predicament, but says they are also angry that he helped other citizens to protect their rights. &quot;I exposed the unfairness of Chinese administration of justice and that has put pressure on local officials,&quot; he said. Cui Fufang met the activist when he helped her seek compensation over the demolition of her home. Now she is one of several petitioners who regularly gather beneath Feng&apos;s window to show their support. &quot;He helped so many people to get their legal rights. He was helping the country by protecting its dignity,&quot; she said. Police have never formally notified Feng he is under house arrest. An officer at the local station referred queries to the Shanghai police media department, where calls rang unanswered. Wang said: &quot;We do not have conclusive data, but my impression is that [house arrest] has been more favoured by the government since the Olympics. It doesn&apos;t elicit such a reaction from the public as putting people in prison.&quot; Liu Xia, the wife of jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo, has been under house arrest since the announcement that her husbandhad won the Nobel peace prize in October 2010. Grassroots democracy campaigner Yao Lifa has been held for shorter periods many times. Other dissidents and activists are often kept under &quot;soft detention&quot; at sensitive times \u2013 allowed to leave their homes under escort, but not to move freely or receive visitors. &quot;My freedom is not important,&quot; said Feng, from his flat. &quot;Whether China can be a country ruled by law is more important.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Protest", "Chen Guangcheng", "Human rights"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-11T09:21:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/11/china-terracotta-army-soldiers-unearthed", "sentences": ["&quot;We have found large quantities of red clay and charcoal along with holes for robbing in the major pit,&quot; Shen Maosheng, who is leading one of the teams, told Shanghai Daily."], "title": "China's mighty terracotta army gains 100 soldiers", "article": "Emperor Qinshihuang&apos;s terracotta army appears even mightier after Chinese archeologists unearthed more than 100 additional soldiers, though the warriors fell prey to arson and looting by the military leader who overthrew the First Emperor&apos;s dynasty, the new find suggests. &quot;We have found large quantities of red clay and charcoal along with holes for robbing in the major pit,&quot; Shen Maosheng, who is leading one of the teams, told Shanghai Daily. &quot;Rebel leader Xiang [Yu] was the person with the power, time and motive to destroy the terracotta warriors.&quot; He believes Xiang&apos;s troops stole the weapons and smashed figures before setting fire to parts of the pit. In all, more than 8,000 soldiers have been uncovered at the world famous mausoleum in Xi&apos;an, north-west China, but much of it is still unexplored. The 310 relics found in this phase of excavation, which began in 2009, are believed to be only a fraction of those that remain. Archaeologists found scores more soldiers, war horses, two sets of chariots, weapons, drums and a shield \u2013 the latter being the first of its kind to be found in the three pits of warriors, archaeologist Yuan Zhongyi told the state English language paper China Daily. Xu Weihong, executive director of the excavation team, said eight of the figures were officials, with more complicated and delicately detailed armour than that of the rank-and-file figures. There was also more colour left on the figures than in previous excavations. Some had black and taupe eyeballs and one even had eyelashes painted on. Yuan said the colour could have been lost from figures because they had been submerged in water or affected by the fire. Another possibility was that the paint had flaked away. &quot;At that time, craftsmen would paint raw lacquer on them before decorating. After so many years, the lacquer separates from the body, stripping off the colour,&quot; he said. A separate excavation in a nearby pit at the site has found more than 20 terracotta figures in two lines facing each other, which experts believe may have been part of a performance troupe.

Luanda, in Angola, where more than half the population of 5 million live in poverty and where the Foreign Office advises visitors not to venture out at night, was the second most expensive. British cities have fallen down the list in recent years, reflecting the weakness of sterling against the US dollar. London was the 25th most expensive city, said Mercer, down from 18th last year and behind every large Australian city and many emerging Asian metropolises. Birmingham was 133rd, Aberdeen 144th and Glasgow 161st. Belfast (165th) was the UK&apos;s least expensive major city, ranking cheaper than Warsaw, Budapest and Cairo. The survey takes account of small items of spending, such as a hamburger or a cinema ticket, but is dominated by the cost of renting a luxury two-bedroom apartment of the type favoured by expats. In Luanda, which is experiencing a post-civil war boom fuelled by oil exports to China, an apartment typically cost \u00a34,114 a month, said Mercer, compared with \u00a32,800 in London. In Hong Kong a city-centre apartment cost \u00a34,489 a month to rent. The survey highlights the shift in economic power towards China and the countries that supply it with raw materials. Shanghai was named the 16th most expensive city, moving ahead of London, New York and Paris. Australian cities have leapt fastest up the rankings after a currency surge. Sydney climbed from 14th to 11th, Melbourne from 21st to 15th, Perth from 30th to 19th and Brisbane from 31st to 24th. Last week the Australian airline Qantas issued a surprise profits warning brought on in part by hard-up Europeans cancelling holidays to what has become one of the most expensive destinations in the world. On every indicator counted by Mercer except for the price of petrol, Sydney was more expensive than London. The cheapest city was Karachi, in Pakistan, where the cost of living was a third of that in Tokyo, closely followed by Islamabad. Some US cities are also remarkably cheap: Winston Salem, in North Carolina, was said by Mercer to have the lowest cost of living of any major urban area in the US; Chicago was ranked a lowly 110th overall and Washington DC 107th. The Swiss cities of Geneva and Zurich remain hugely expensive destinations for expats, once again featuring in the top 10. Athens (78th) is still more expensive for an expat to live in than Berlin (106th), which was easily the best value of any major European capital.

Whoever lands the White Hart Lane gig will have to be aware that his first task \u2013 even before selling Jermain Defoe to whichever club next employs Redknapp \u2013 will be to placate hacks who long ago gave their hearts to the country&apos;s foremost Wii peddler in return for nothing but wily banter and a tape-full of rum yarns. The identity of that new manager is not yet known, of course, since it was only at 3.37am this morning that Tottenham confirmed that they had indeed committed wheelerdealercide. David Moyes is believed to be the front-runner, a position to which 10 years at Everton can have done to nothing to accustom him. It is still not precisely clear what pushed Spurs triggerman Daniel Levy to fire Redknapp: it could be the collapse in the second half of last season, during which Spurs frittered away a 10-point lead over Arsenal to finish a point behind their beleaguered neighbours and ultimately miss out on a Big Cup berth, what with caretaker boss Roberto Di Matteo winning double the number of major trophies in a few months that Redknapp has won in a lifetime on the dug-out. Redknapp&apos;s set-up and selections during that period clearly did not work, and the sight of Roman Pavlyuchenko tonking in a superb goal for Russia the other day may have got Levy to wondering why Redknapp never got the best out of the striker, just as he didn&apos;t with Steven Pienaar. It could also be that chairman and erstwhile gaffer disagreed over Spurs&apos; summer transfer policy, or it could even be that Levy didn&apos;t like working with Redknapp any more. Or a bit of all of that. Redknapp, for his part, seemed to hint, in that subtle way of his, that the chairman is a misguided oaf who thinks Spurs should have won the league and thus would have jilted him even if Spurs had reached Big Cup. &quot;We finished fourth and were unlucky at the end, but I think the same outcome would have happened,&quot; matter-of-facted Redknapp before endearing himsef to potential future employers by declining this particular opportunity to bad-mouth his previous ones. &quot;The people who run the football club have to make decisions that they think are right and that&apos;s their decision. You know I abide by it. I don&apos;t spend my life holding grudges, thinking about what could have been. That&apos;s life, we all move on.&quot; Mind, just as he never missed an opportunity to remind folks where Spurs had been before his arrival at the Lane, he chipped in a mention of where they would probably be in a couple of years if he had not been given the heave-ho. &quot;The only disappointment is that I think it&apos;s a team that could have gone on and won the Premier League in a year or two and I just wish I had been able to see that through and be a part of that.&quot; Quite why he expects Spurs to win the title within a year or two, given that he spent most of the last few months talking about how much harder ever finishing fourth will be for a club of Spurs&apos; means, is not altogether clear. OK, it is.

The $42m forecast for AKQA&apos;s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this year means WPP paid a multiple of 12.8 times for the $540m deal. &quot;We are looking forward to working with Ajaz and Tom to broaden their offer and our own, both geographically and functionally,&quot; said Sorrell, WPP&apos;s chief executive. &quot;We are delighted to be united.&quot; Ahmed and Tom Bedecarre, the chairman of AKQA, resisted a $600m (\u00a3383m) bid for the company from Japanese advertising giant Dentsu in 2010. The pair own about 10% of the business and at the time opposed a sale, which was being pushed by General Atlantic, the Connecticut private equity firm. General Atlantic took a majority stake in AKQA in 2007 for reportedly between $200m and $250m. AKQA was founded by Ahmed in his early 20s and now has offices in London, New York, Washington DC, Shanghai, Berlin and Amsterdam and employs 1,160 staff. Revenues were $189m in 2011 and are forecast to be $230m this year. Bedecarre will also take the role of president of WPP Ventures, a new Silicon Valley-based company, which will aim to make more digital investments. Sorrell said that there are few other targets out there like AKQA, perhaps the publicly listed LBi. But he added that LBi is a &quot;roll-up&quot; of a number of businesses over the years, which arguably makes it less attractive. &quot;AKQA is strongly developed and built organically, a double whammy,&quot; he told MediaGuardian. He admitted that the deal will break WPP&apos;s self-imposed \u00a3300m to \u00a3400m acquisition cap for 2012. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t make any pretence that this was cheap,&quot; he said. &quot;Nothing good comes cheap, nothing good comes easy.&quot; \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Next week, Unesco is holding its annual meeting in St Petersburg, Russia, and Liverpool is on the agenda. The impact of Peel Holdings&apos; \u00a35.5bn Liverpool Waters scheme on the city&apos;s World Heritage Status, which covers the waterfront and the city centre, is to be discussed. Unesco recommends that Liverpool is placed on its heritage &apos;in danger&apos; list. In a report it states: &quot;The proposed development of Liverpool Waters constitutes a potential danger to the World Heritage property and, therefore, decides to inscribe Liverpool on the List of World Heritage in Danger, with the possibility of deletion of the property from the World Heritage List, should the current project be approved and implemented.&quot; In November last year, a delegation of Unesco inspectors visited the city to see what impact the Liverpool Waters scheme would have. During the visit, the inspectors warned that unless radical changes were made to a plan to build a series of skyscrapers along Liverpool&apos;s famous waterfront, the city could lose its world heritage status. It is a fate that Liverpool is keen to avoid as the world heritage status places the city that spawned the Beatles alongside the Pyramids and the Great Wall of China. Such is the importance of WHS, it is regarded as crucial to marketing the city to visitors. Furthermore, tourism is worth \u00a33bn to the economy in Liverpool and around 42,000 jobs depend on it. When visitors are asked why they come to Liverpool, many cite the world heritage and capital of culture designations. Peel Holdings&apos; \u00a35.5bn scheme regenerates the deprived northern docklands by building shops, restaurants and offices. The company has already reduced the height of its controversial Shanghai Tower (which aims to replicate the Chinese city&apos;s dramatic waterfront) to 55 storeys. At the time, Professor Michael Parkinson of Liverpool John Moores University told me that given a choice of no development in north Liverpool and losing the world heritage status, it was a no-brainer. &quot;Without doubt, it is a very good thing to have the world heritage status and I&apos;m sure it&apos;s helpful in sharpening the city&apos;s image,&quot; he said. &quot;But we cannot be preserved in aspic and we have to have development.&quot; In January, Unesco concluded that the Three Graces would play &quot;second violin&quot; to the huge development and the site would be &quot;damaged beyond repair&quot; if the plans went ahead. However, Liverpool city council approved planning permission for the scheme in March this year. The government is waiting to receive the paperwork from the council before it makes a decision on whether a public inquiry is needed. Liverpool city council&apos;s spokesman said they were disappointed with the recommendation which &quot;appears to be premature as the planning approval for the Liverpool Waters scheme has still to be finally determined.&quot;  It will be submitted to the secretary of state who will decide on the way forward for the scheme.  The council argues that it is possible to have a world-class development co-existing with its world heritage status. Liverpool&apos;s world heritage site officially stretches from Albert Dock, which has the largest collection of Grade I listed buildings in the UK, along the Pier Head and up to Stanley Dock. It takes in the elegant Edwardian &quot;three graces&quot;: the Royal Liver, Cunard and Port of Liverpool buildings, which have defined the view from the Mersey for almost a century.

However, all the players will be well aware that the theme of England&apos;s participation in international tournament was defined way back then with the intervention of Tofiq Bahramov, the Azerbaijani guesser who became known, with appropriate inaccuracy, as &quot;the Russian linesman&quot;. From Bahramov&apos;s bungling all those years ago, England&apos;s campaigns have been all about tragicomic misfortune and scapegoatery, from Peter Bonetti&apos;s slippery hands to Graham Taylor&apos;s turnipy head, Gazza&apos;s red eyes to Beckham&apos;s red card, Campbell&apos;s quashed goal to Carvalho&apos;s squashed goolies, Schteve McClaren&apos;s effing brolly to Lampard&apos;s shifting goal-line. And from all of those incidents England came off worse, the damage being aggravated as the insistence on blaming those quirky occurrences helped convince much of the country that there was nothing wrong systemically. Last night, although England still looked second best overall, luck finally turned in the Three Lions&apos; favour when England&apos;s Brave John Terry was credited with a brave goal-line clearance that should really have been recorded as a tardy act of futility but, to the volcanic fury of Ukraine boss Oleh Blokhin, was not. &quot;Five referees were on the pitch and the ball was 50cm behind the goal-line, yet they did not see it!&quot; erupted Blokhin before turning on a local hack who had the temerity to suggest that that incident should not overshadow his dubious decision-making. &quot;Did you play football?&quot; belched Blokhin before offering to knock the hack&apos;s block off. &quot;I won&apos;t allow anyone to criticise my team,&quot; he bawled. &quot;You want to go with me? If you&apos;re a man, go with me. One on one. Let&apos;s go.&quot; Local media does not detail the hack&apos;s reply, which suggests that Ukraine have no one as efficient as Scott Parker, who reportedly has been making himself useful at England press conferences by scurrying around the room to pass the microphone from speaker to speaker. &quot;A lot of credit has got to be given to this team,&quot; droned $tevie Mbe after his busy sidekick nudged the mic sideways to him from two yards. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a case of us over-performing, we&apos;re just performing to the level we&apos;re capable of,&quot; he gushed of the backs-to-the-wall, feet-seldom-on-the-ball victories over mighty Sweden and Ukraine.

Today the World Heritage&apos;s foremost lintelled sarsen structure is not just enduring but thriving, spawning more academic research, wild theorising, bouncy art, and pagan robe sales than ever. Just consider some of the Stonehenge activities that will take place in the next few weeks. At sunrise on Thursday, the 14,500 transcendence questing druids and varied revellers may have been outnumbered only by world weary media drones as they tried to celebrate the summer solstice at the 4.52am sunrise (ideally in line with English Heritage&apos;s stringent Conditions of Entry document, which might be downloaded by socially responsible pagans). Heavy rain overnight reduced the number of people who camped out or arrived early to witness the dawn compared with previous years, which have seen numbers of around 20,000. And in Wales there was also a chance to get excited about mid-summer \u2013 for Stonehenge&apos;s inflatable simulacrum has arrived at the National Botanic Garden in Carmarthenshire. Although the rain may have dampened spirits. Jeremy Deller&apos;s Sacrilege, first placed in public on Glasgow Green, will be inflated to pop up in the capital as part of what sceptics would call that oxymoron the Cultural Olympiad. Is there anything more fun than a 35-metre bouncy castle that looks like Stonehenge, you ask? Not until they make a bouncy Warwick Castle with water slide into a moat laced with gin, I reply. What is Deller, the Turner prize-winning artist, up to? &quot;It&apos;s a very entry-level way into thinking about ancient history for five-year-olds,&quot; he says. True, but several bouncing Glaswegians were at least 45 years older than that target demographic. &quot;It&apos;s good to play with our history and culture. Stonehenge is part of British identity but no one knows what it was for.&quot; Good point. Ever since King Arthur&apos;s dad, Utherpendragon, invaded Ireland, defeated an army and shipped Stonehenge from Ireland to Salisbury with the help of the wizard Merlin, the stones have sunk themselves ever deeper into British national consciousness. In chapter 58 of Hardy&apos;s Tess of the d&apos;Urbervilles, for instance, slimy Angel Clare and the dopey heroine are walking fugitively through darkling Wessex when &quot;on a sudden, Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front [Oh grow up!], rising sheer from the grass \u2026 &apos;It is Stonehenge!&apos; said Clare. &apos;The heathen temple, you mean?&apos;&quot; Tess lies down on a sun-warmed stone. &quot;&apos;Did they sacrifice to God here?&apos; asked she. &apos;No,&apos; said he. &apos;Who to?&apos; &apos;I believe to the sun. That lofty stone set away by itself is in the direction of the sun that will presently rise behind it.&apos;&quot; Victorians wrote yards of this stuff: anybody who was anybody in 19th-century fiction got arrested, died, or got it on on those stones. Incidentally, if you are Irish and thinking that the paragraph above suggests Stonehenge is like the Elgin Marbles and should be repatriated immediately, think again; according to Geoffrey of Monmouth&apos;s marvellously unreliable 12th-century History of the Kings of Britain (the leading medieval account of Stonehenge&apos;s origin), Irish giants transported the stones from Africa to Ireland earlier and used them as a curative bath until they were nicked by King Arthur&apos;s dad. Part of Stonehenge&apos;s appeal is that it&apos;s a riddle wrapped in mythology, swathed in druidical vestments and draped in a dodgy, if grand, relationship to the cosmos. Over the millennia, intellectuals have cast it as vast cosmic clock wound up by woad-daubed neolithic nudists (a theory embellished recently by archaeologists at Birmingham University&apos;s Ludwig Boltzman Institute). Other thinkers, like the 17th -century architect Inigo Jones, maintained ancient Britons were too thick to have created such a sophisticated edifice, and concluded it must have been Roman. Today we aren&apos;t sure who built it or why. Was it a burial ground, a magnet for crusty rave-ups, a sacred zone where our bearded forebears chillaxed old school, or a mystic portal to the celestial superhighway? &quot;Stonehenge sets a puzzle that has never been solved,&quot; notes Chippindale. Could Stonehenge have functioned as a helipad for Lord Sugar&apos;s neolithic ancestors? It&apos;s not impossible. More likely it resembled a lecture theatre with uncomfortable seating and no power sockets. Archaeo-acoustic researchers at Salford and Huddersfield universities suggested as much recently after examining the 5,000-year-old-structure&apos;s acoustic properties. Their work, at the site and at a concrete replica in Washington, indicates that Stonehenge had the sort of acoustics desirable in a lecture hall. It wasn&apos;t only the sight of Stonehenge that would have blown ancient visitors away. Bruno Fazenda, professor at the University of Salford, says: &quot;As they walked inside they would have perceived the sound environment around them had changed in some way.&quot; Lucky them: all you can hear nowadays is the traffic howl from the A303. Ever since those ancient days of magic stones shipped from Ireland, Stonehenge has satisfied a yearning among the citizens of these lands for mystic grandeur. That yearning will be kindled in July when the flaming French move in to Stonehenge. Compagnie Carabosse will turn the site into a &quot;fire garden&quot; with flaming pots animating the stones, and cascades of candles lining the pathways. Think: rows of tea lights running down your garden path as you sink a sundowner, but much, much, more poncy. Shortly afterwards, in the culmination of Stonehenge&apos;s 2012, diggers will move in to right one of the most grievous historic wrongs in modern Britain. The stones will be moved slightly to the right away from the A303 and into proper alignment with the sun. I&apos;m kidding. In fact, the bulldozers will rip up the inadequate car park and visitor centre that have been a national disgrace since 1968. Simon Thurley, English Heritage&apos;s chief executive, said of the \u00a327m makeover: &quot;These are crucial steps which bring closer the transformation of the currently blighted Stonehenge landscape.&quot; The centre will be moved 1.5 miles away and visitors will get to the stones on a low-key transit system or, as others call it, a Noddy train. Noddy Goes To Stonehenge \u2013 what a film! There have been films, indeed. In National Lampoon&apos;s European Vacation (1985), Mr Griswold gives an affecting speech on the monument&apos;s indomitability before climbing into his rental car and (can you see the gag yet?) reversing and toppling the thing like dominoes. Hilarious: in reality an Austin Maxi couldn&apos;t knock the skin off a rice pudding. In the no less amusing Shanghai Knights (2003), this gag is reprised when the two main characters crash their car into Stonehenge. One says: &quot;Who the hell would put a pile of stones in the middle of a field?&quot; Somewhere someone&apos;s writing a PhD on Hollywood&apos;s symbolic castration of British heritage by means of such movie demolition jobs. Stonehenge&apos;s image reached its mock-heroic apogee in the rocku/mocku-mentary This is Spinal Tap (1984). Picture the scene: the band&apos;s plotting a comeback tour involving a lavish stage show featuring a replica of the monument as a backdrop to their pomp rock classic, Stonehenge. Only one problem, the order for the prop goes wrong and instead of being 18ft high it&apos;s 18in tall, making the band a laughing stock. Did Deller consider this pitfall in making his scaled-down bouncy version? You&apos;d think. He never thought, though, of emulating Steven Moffat&apos;s insanely elaborate cosmological topography in the 2010 two-part special of Doctor Who, The Pandorica Opens. All the doctor&apos;s many enemies hover above Stonehenge, while below in Underhenge lies the fabled prison of Pandorica holding the universe&apos;s most detested and feared prisoner, Jeremy Clarkson at the co-ordinates of a worrying fissure in the universe&apos;s frankly baffling structure. Actually, it wasn&apos;t Clarkson but some being even more unimaginably evil. Most of the filming took place at Foamhenge, a lightweight replica set up near Port Talbot. It was there that the doctor battled an army of cybermen and others in what proved to be a critic-slaying, award-winning and discombobulatingly mytho-metaphysical fuss. Very Moffat, very Stonehenge. It was also indicative of what Stonehenge really is: an open text, endlessly interpretable and readily bendable to our times and imagination. &quot;It is a mirror which reflects back, more or less distorted, that view of the past which the onlooker takes there,&quot; Chippindale says.

The close-up portrait of actor Jonny Lee Miller as The Creature in the National&apos;s 2011 sell-out Frankenstein shows, in full gory detail, his brutally stapled-together head, bald but for some grisly tufts of hair. Frankenstein pre-dated Cannas&apos;s appointment last September as head of make-up and hair, but, as he whips me at staggering pace through the number of productions and future productions currently in rehearsal, I am under no illusion about the huge scale of the job. &quot;I oversee two current productions and one in the making for each of the three in-house theatres \u2013 the Olivier, Lyttelton and Cottesloe \u2013 as well as providing technical support for cast changes and touring for external shows such as One Man, Two Guvnors at the Haymarket and War Horse at the New London,&quot; he explains. &quot;So I typically have 11 shows to manage at once.&quot; The day-to-day work of theatrical make-up artists like Cannas and his team can be more &quot;bread and butter&quot;, but there is still plenty of variety, he explains. &quot;We work to the blueprint already given to us by the play&apos;s designers, which means we have to produce a creative and technically accurate visual representation which looks good under the strong theatre lights. Sometimes it&apos;s more basic make-up and, at other times, more complex period make-up or special effects. &quot;Often it&apos;s Shakespeare but with a modern, or unusual, take. Our work involves creating images and characters through make-up, hairstyles and prosthetics in accordance with the brief we have been given.&quot; On our way out he shows me the mind-boggling spreadsheet on the wall showing the schedule for technical and dress rehearsals in the run-up to opening nights, previews and press night; along with the locations of the actors&apos; dressing rooms on the floor below, where all but very technically complex make-up will be done. Given that all wigs are made in-house there is surprisingly little time \u2013 often days, rather than weeks \u2013 to get everything ready for productions. In the large airy hair and make-up studio on the fifth floor of the National (it looks out on to an internal courtyard with the feel of a scruffy 1960s&apos; office block) Cannas&apos;s colleague Sarah Lou is &quot;hand-knotting&quot; a multi-layered hippy-style wig for the actress Helen McCrory for her part in the new play The Last of the Haussmans, which opens in just a week&apos;s time. This could take at least 45 hours to complete. In the world of theatre and entertainment, the highly-skilled roles of make-up artist and wig-maker are intertwined, and most courses train people to do both. All the wigs used at the National are created from human hair and made especially for the relevant actors, which means that separate ones are also made for under-studies, too \u2013 even if they are rarely used. Coloured swatches, to help with orders, are stacked up in plastic boxes, and the wigs will usually be styled closer to the production itself, depending on what is required by the designer, Cannas says. Members of his team act as supervisors for individual productions. Cannas has a demanding managerial role at the National, where he reports directly to the Theatre&apos;s Head of Costume. Although he is in charge of a 10-strong department, with all the administrative and financial responsibilities that brings, he likes to keep his hand in, and enjoys &quot;putting on his blacks and grabbing his pouch&quot; to do make-up himself. Blacks \u2013 black clothing \u2013 are typically worn by staff backstage to reduce the chances of being seen by the audience. And Cannas is a big fan of hats \u2013 today he is sporting a black beret, but on other days he favours a sloppy woollen beanie or even a baseball cap. His style is &quot;casual but comfortable&quot;, with practical outfits he could wear to a meeting with director Nicholas Hytner or attending an opening night. Today he has come in especially over the Jubilee bank holiday to lend a hand with a series of workshops the National is running in its &quot;pop-up&quot; space as part of its summer programme, &quot;National Theatre Inside Out&quot;, to demystify and explain its activities to the public. Two members of his team have wig stands and pouches to hand, creating fifties-style makeovers for mums (as their daughters look on in wide-eyed wonder) and a plate of prosthetic &quot;stitches&quot;, warts and putrefying flesh fascinate the little boys. Cannas \u2013 who says he used to enjoy watching his own mother putting on her make-up in front of her dressing table mirror \u2013 unrolls the pouch and, with chuckles of laughter and great enthusiasm, he works some magic of his own. &quot;This is a great line of communication with the public&quot;, he says. &quot;There is something rather elitist about working in TV and the theatre, so we are trying to show what we actually do. People think this is glamorous but it is very long hours.&quot; Cannas&apos;s route to working at the National Theatre began in his native Sardinia where, after studying languages (including Latin and Greek) for his national diploma, he dropped out of an engineering course at university. After compulsory army service in Italy, he came to London at 22 and decided to stay. &quot;My mum said goodbye to me at the airport and gave me three months&quot;, he recalls. &quot;That was 20 years ago.&quot; Although he did not speak English when he arrived, he picked up the language by working as a pizza delivery boy and in a bar, before securing a place on a year-long beauty therapy course at the Hammersmith and West London College. That led him to an HNC and HND in make-up and hairdressing at the University of Westminster, including business studies and marketing &quot;which have been absolutely critical for what I am doing now&quot;. Initially, he did freelance work assisting on big-name advertising campaigns for the likes of designer Alexander McQueen, with whom he also worked on London Fashion Week. Keen to put something back into the English education system, a talent for teaching saw him returning to Hammersmith and West London College where he eventually became a full-time lecturer in hair and make-up for three years, while creating numerous specialist courses in make-up. In 2000 he went to Australia &quot;for love&quot; just as Disney&apos;s touring production of The Lion King was coming to south-east Asia. He became head of hair and make-up, working with a 60-strong cast and a team of six make-up artists to bring the famous two-dimensional characters to life. Cannas worked on The Lion King in Sydney, Melbourne, Shanghai, Johannesburg, Taiwan and Singapore. &quot;It was absolutely fantastic and it was very difficult to say goodbye to the team I had worked for. I think I was married to my job, albeit in not a very healthy way.&quot; Now only 40, he claims the biggest challenge of his working life to date has been stepping into the shoes of Joyce Beagarie, the NT&apos;s former head of wigs, who had been at the National for 38 years until she retired last year. &quot;I was thrilled to get the job but terrified at the same time,&quot; he admits. &quot;I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to do here, which is to make my own mark \u2013 to create another layer. I have an average of six meetings here a week. There is a lot of planning, scheduling and so on, but I am fortunate to have a great team.&quot; I sit in with Cannas on the dress rehearsal of The Last of the Haussmans just hours before the production&apos;s official opening, where about 50 staff, representing various departments including lighting, costume and hair and make-up, gather to scrutinise the final run-through and order changes if necessary. I see Helen McCrory in her (now finished) full-length wig, alongside Julie Walters whose long silver-grey wig - described by one critic as a &quot;mad grey mane&quot; \u2013 has been crimped to within an inch of its life. He thinks it obscures her face at times, so this will be fixed. All the makeup and wigs are applied and fitted one hour before the show in the actors&apos; dressing rooms, and when the make-up is minimal they are taught to do it themselves. Very specific show plots are written to allow a smooth run of quick changes backstage. Interestingly, Cannas says that the make-up and hair are as much for the actors, to help them to get into character, as for those watching the play. &quot;About 80% of the job we do is actually for the actors, not the audience.&quot; And with a chuckle, he is off backstage to touch up Julie Walters&apos;s make-up for the second half.", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Guardian Careers"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-22T22:00:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/26/the-rumour-mill-didier-drogba-barcelona", "sentences": ["And Chelsea fans will be aware that one of the hallmarks of having Didier Drogba&apos;s tenure at a club is constant rumblings of discontent and word reaches the Mill that the Ivorian could be ready to turn his back on Shanghai Shenhua."], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to land Joleon Lescott?", "article": "L&apos;Arry Redknapp, anyone? That&apos;s how we may soon have to refer to the man who is not being used to bash Roy Hodgson so much these days ever since Hodgson won sceptics over by guiding England to two squeaky victories at Euro 2012 before they were comprehensively outplayed by the first decent team they came up against, as usual. While all that was happening, it may have escaped your attention that Tottenham jilted their erstwhile manager, who quickly declared his ambition to return to gaffership at the first suitable opportunity. Would an opportunity that could entail speaking a language other than Engerlish and ingratiating himself with a whole new pack of press &apos;ounds be considered suitable? Marseille hope so, as, according to decidedly dubious chatter in the ether, they are hoping to entice L&apos;Arry to the south of France, a region where football is a passion and dogs have bank accounts. Word is there is a vacancy at Marseille because Didier Deschamps has decided not to renew his contract. And in a pleasing piece of symmetry, Deschamps is expected to sidle into L&apos;Arry&apos;s old chair at White Hart Lane. Deschamps is hardly known for the flair and adventure of his teams but Daniel Levy is believed to consider that but a small quibble compared to the size of his trophy collection. Another Frenchman on the move could be Florent Malouda, who is considering doing what all of the France team who stunk out Euro 2012 should do: scarper to Brazil. He remains in touch with his old Lyon chum Juninho, who is said to be helping arrange a transfer to Vasco da Gama. A player who had a much more impressive Euro than any Frenchman or England was the Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic, whose slick displays convinced Bayern Munich that he&apos;s the man for them: which means Manchester City are likely to be left lumbered with Eden Dzeko. Joleon Lescott may be on his way away from Manchester, however, as City are said to be mulling over letting him go to Liverpool, which would facilitate City&apos;s swoop for Daniel Agger. If that elaborate plot is thwarted, City will just go buy Fabricio Coloccini. Roman Abramovich is still so high on Champions League glory that he may actually stump up the humungous fee that Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are demanding for relentless striker Radamel Falcao. Although he may raise a smattering of the amount by flogging Raul Meireles to Napoli. Sunderland are plotting a move for the flip side of Kevin Doyle, aka Steven Fletcher, the not particularly mobile or dynamic striker who actually scores goals. Birmingham City are on the verge of hiring Lee Clark. And Chelsea fans will be aware that one of the hallmarks of having Didier Drogba&apos;s tenure at a club is constant rumblings of discontent and word reaches the Mill that the Ivorian could be ready to turn his back on Shanghai Shenhua.

Nowadays Shanghai crops up frequently in the education secretary&apos;s speeches. But his latest destination is a novel one - east Africa. In a speech to the Spectator&apos;s schools conference, Gove said that &quot;perhaps the most powerful lesson from abroad&quot; came from Kenya, and the Masai people who live there.  Whenever one Masai greets another they ask a question - Kasserian Ingera? Not &quot;how do you do&quot; or &quot;how&apos;s it going&quot;, but &quot;how are the children&quot;? It&apos;s wonderfully revealing about the values of Masai society - their first concern is the next generation. And the hoped-for reply is equally revealing: &quot;all the children are well&quot;. Not my children. Not some of the children. All the children are well. For the Masai, society cannot be well unless all the children are well. The question the Masai ask each other is revealing not just of their society - but of ours. Whatever tests we set ourselves - and whatever achievements we boast of - the question that goes to the heart of the health of our society should be the same - how are the children?&quot;   It&apos;s a charming story - but how valid is the comparison with our own society? The standard Masai greeting, as anyone familiar with Kenya knows, is &quot;sopa&quot;, the equivalent of saying &quot;hello&quot; in English. I asked the Guardian&apos;s Nairobi correspondent Clar Ni Chonghaile about this, and she spoke to a contact in the town of Narok, on the fringes of the Masai Mara. Clar reports:  According to a contact in Narok, by the Mara park where the Masai live, when Masai meet they greet each other with &apos;sopa&apos;. But that is the start of a long greeting process that can take several minutes. It can include &apos;How is the homestead?&apos;, &apos;How is the weather?&apos;, &apos;How are the cows?&apos; and would usually also include &apos;How are the children?&apos;, &apos;Kasserian Ingera?&apos;.   Clar&apos;s contact pointed out that in Masai culture, when men ask each other how the children are, they are also asking about the wives. So is this as revealing as Gove suggests? After all, most acquaintances in Britain would ask after each other&apos;s families at some point in the conversation. Gove routinely uses international comparisons to criticise domestic failings - in this case, he went on to take swipes at &apos;welfare dependency&apos; and the exam system. He&apos;s an engaging speaker, and stories like this help him make his case vividly. The use of the Masai greeting as an emblem of a more caring society appears to originate from a sermon given by a US church minister, Patrick O&apos;Neill, in 1991. O&apos;Neill&apos;s comparison is often cited in US education circles. He said:  This story, I think, is moving, illustrating a society that values its children so highly that a reminder of them is part of every greeting. The story is also sobering \u2013 the fact that it&apos;s surprising illustrates how very far our own culture is from valuing children in this way.

Emanuel has instructed officials to examine the technical and financial implications of turning the whole of downtown Chicago into a wireless network zone. Under the plans, the city&apos;s traffic and street lights would be turned into smart polls, ensuring unbroken internet access throughout the city centre that would be extended underground across the entire CTA subway system. Combined with the already existing connectivity of Chicago&apos;s two great electronic trading exchanges \u2013 the Mercantile Exchange and Board of Options \u2013 the audacious plans would give Chicago, Emanuel believes, a huge strategic advantage. &quot;We are the broadband backbone of America, right here. That&apos;s a physical fact, and I have to use that advantage to its maximum capacity, both in the city and in terms of connectivity with the rest of the world.&quot; Wiring the entire downtown area is just one of a long list of innovations that Emanuel, 52, has put in train since arriving at City Hall in May last year. The famously foul-mouthed overseer of the West Wing during Barack Obama&apos;s first two years in office hasn&apos;t so much hit Chicago&apos;s ground running as burnt it up in a frenzy. He has introduced a $7bn plan to overhaul the city&apos;s crumbling infrastructure, replaced the membership of city boards, reshuffled departments, introduced safeguards against petty corruption, cut remuneration for commission members, hosted the Nato summit and encouraged companies such as Walgreens and Chase to expand their presence in the city \u2013 all within 13 breathless months. All his moves, Emanuel insisted in an interview in the board room of City Hall, have been taken with an eye to Chicago&apos;s long-term future as one of the world&apos;s great cities. &quot;There are 100 cities in the world that drive the creativity, the economy, the world GDP, the culture \u2013 and Chicago&apos;s one of those 100,&quot; he said. &quot;The decisions we make here in the next two to three years will determine whether Chicago 20 or 30 years from now stays in that 100 club or veers off track. That&apos;s true for the mayor of Shanghai, or London, or Paris, or New York \u2013 what we do now will determine our trajectory.&quot; On current growth projections the population of metropolitan Chicago is expected to exceed 10 million people by 2030, which will gain it entry to the very select club of global megacities. Emanuel sees that as another huge opportunity, though he adds it is &quot;fraught with danger if you don&apos;t plan right&quot;. The first task the mayor set himself was to face head-on the historic legacy problems of a crumbling city. The Chicago he inherited from his predecessor, Richard Daley, who served 22 years as mayor, is in some regards in spanking good health with a vibrant economy, sparkling riverfront, world-class universities and effervescent architecture. But in other aspects it is desperately in need of a facelift: its water services and sewers are rotten and bursting, its public high schools have a shocking 50% graduation rate, the subway is creaking in parts, unemployment is rampant in the poorer outlying neighborhoods and the murder rate is high and rising. As a symbolic example of the problem, it is reported that when Emanuel took possession of the mayor&apos;s office he found that it wasn&apos;t even wired for the internet. Over the next three years Emanuel will pump $7bn to bring the ageing city up to scratch. That will pay for a massive upgrading of the underground water infrastructure, two new runways at O&apos;Hare airport, an overhaul of subway stations, $660m investment in public schools, a rapid-transit bus system in the centre of the city and the first steps towards making Chicago the most bike-friendly city in the world. Looking further ahead, the mayor is setting up a Chicago Infrastructure Trust composed of private and public members to advise him on how to push the city into the future. Its first act will be to carry out a $225m &quot;retrofit&quot; of public buildings to make them more energy-efficient, and then he will be looking for ideas on how to ensure that Chicago is what he calls &quot;a knowledge-based, creative economy built on 21st-century foundations and moving at 21st-century speeds&quot;. His overall ambition, he said, is to make Chicago &quot;one of the most liveable of cities in America&quot;, but to keep true to its roots as a city of neighbourhoods with deep ethnic roots and 28 different languages spoken. Emanuel is fond of calling his city &quot;the most American of American cities&quot;. What does he mean? &quot;We are the capital of the midwest, but we also gather people from all over the country. We are a city of immigrants, from America and the rest of the world,&quot; he said, adding that he is himself a typical Chicagoan with a father from Israel and maternal grandfather who came from the Russia-Romania border. Should Emanuel succeed in implementing even a portion of his ambitions he will have written himself into the history books as one of a new generation of activist mayors grabbing American cities by the lapels and giving them a good shake. The most visible example is Michael Bloomberg in New York, who has startled the US with his proactive policies for fighting obesity and making the Big Apple green. But in Emanuel&apos;s case, the determination to press ahead with large-scale revitalisation of the city has a peculiarly personal quality. It is founded upon his recognition \u2013 based in turn on his own close-up experience of the gridlock in Washington as Obama&apos;s former chief of staff \u2013 that government in America is not working and thus can no longer be relied upon to deliver change. &quot;Washington is not moving, Springfield, our state capital, is not moving. I cannot tie this city&apos;s \u2013 my city&apos;s \u2013 future to that dysfunction. If they were to get a highway transportation bill in Washington, all the better; if they were to make a major investment in our national infrastructure, all the better. &quot;But a strategy for a city&apos;s growth is not one based on hope. I have to get things done.

This week&apos;s release, 7 Days in Havana, a &quot;contemporary portrait&quot; of Cuba&apos;s capital in which Malibu-commercial cliches (Benicio del Toro&apos;s opening segment) sit alongside poker-faced pieces of absurdist excellence (Elia Suleiman&apos;s), is no exception. Given the innate quality control issues and how laborious it must be to set up these portmanteau projects, why make them at all? Who exactly do they serve? Money doesn&apos;t seem to be the principal reason: they&apos;ve only done tepid box office in the past. Think of 2006&apos;s Paris je t&apos;aime. It made $17m (\u00a311m) on a $13m budget. Three years later, New York, I Love You pulled in $8m against $14m of costs. Someone thinks they&apos;re worth something, though: the French producer Emmanuel Benbihy, who kicked off the phenomenon in its branded form with that pair of films (but not the Havana one), has already had to issue two legal challenges to rivals allegedly looking to pinch his Cities of Love concept. He settled in February with Marina Grasic, his producing partner on the NYC collection, who had set up a breakaway anthology, Love Berlin \u2013 How We Met. She has now agreed to buy a licence to the franchise, and the film has been renamed Berlin, I Love You, with Benbihy as producer. In May, he won an order of seizure, claiming copyright infringement again, from a Marseille court for documents relating to Sydney Unplugged, another omnibus about to go on sale at Cannes. There&apos;s no sign of a similar challenge to 7 Days in Havana, but then it doesn&apos;t share the unifying &quot;love&quot; motif that seems to be the basis of Benbihy&apos;s legal argument. However much it protests, it seems the world is to be united in his universal hug: he is prepping the Shanghai instalment of his franchise, with Jerusalem and Rio to come, the latter is scheduled for release in 2016, just before the Brazilian city hosts the Olympics. The Cities of Love series \u2013 indeed the whole city anthology form \u2013 seems to have as much to do with branding and tourism as it does with art. You can see why Cuba, as it liberalises, wants to market itself, and an anthology such as 7 Days in Havana is an established method now. But the overall parade of marquee names who get on board is as important, if not more, than the fleeting dramatic content. Cities of Love encourages the perception that the spotlighted city is a modern, multicultural passing gallery where enlightened souls catch each other&apos;s eyes and the artistic electricity is constantly crackling. New York, I Love You says it&apos;s Manhattan culture that makes things happen, such as Natalie Portman rustling up a little film in Central Park starring Carlos Acosta. (And, of course, like any true promo, the money-shot \u2013 Acosta dancing \u2013 is inevitable, even if there&apos;s no dramatic reason for it.) I can see that anthologies allow actors to stretch writing or directing muscles that might go unused, or give directors a chance to spin out a bit of whimsy about their favourite city \u2013 but I wonder if the big names don&apos;t have bigger political reasons for signing up to this auteur scrum. I suspect that some of these projects have as much to do with the network of back-scratching and interlocked interests that supports the film festival circuit, which could influence how your next film is received; or perhaps even be understood as part of the price for securing financing or location shooting rights on the real business of feature length production. If being a broker at the centre of all this is what motivates Benbihy, then I understand why he&apos;s protecting his financial interests. But if his ambitions are cinematic, and he really wants to bottle the essence of these cities, then maybe he should spend his time examining his format more closely. Anthology films are only one way of breaking up metropolitan sprawl into manageable chunks. One strong guiding vision gets the best results: Robert Altman (Short Cuts), Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia) and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (Amores Perros) are just three directors who, with different structures, have pierced through to the heart of urban living. Benbihy pruned back the Cities of Love framework between the Paris and New York films, because the first over-reached in its attempt to represent every arrondissement. But I&apos;m still unconvinced that the city anthology enterprise is headed in a direction that will please anyone but the tourist boards. The producer has spoken about expanding the franchise online, using the internet to identify talented local film-makers. It&apos;s possible that \u2013 by shifting it away from the global film oligarchy \u2013 this might raise the standard of the material, and the credibility of the mission. And I hate to be the mad-eyed vagrant yelling in the middle of the roundabout, but the whole &quot;love&quot; thing feels far too restrictive as a way of corralling urban experience \u2013 a mistake 7 Days in Havana at least avoids. It sends far too many of the short films hurtling towards a soppy terminus, and cities, in my experience, have more interesting places to explore. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood will look at video jockeys in Tanzania.

More than 100 recycle-to-ride devices will be installed in an attempt to reduce the environmental impact of the informal bottle collection business and improve the profits of the operator, which works in an industry thought to be worth billions of dollars. Donors will receive between 5 fen and 1 mao (about 1p) on their commuter passes for each polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle they insert into the machine, which then crushes them to a third of their original size and sorts them according to colour and type. &quot;It will be as easy to use as an ATM,&quot; said an employee of the operating company, Incom, who declined to give her name. &quot;We hope to put one at every station on the route [subway line 10] and later expand to other lines, bus stops and residential areas.&quot; The firm currently processes 50,000 tons of bottles a year, most of which it buys from informal collectors who roam the city&apos;s streets looking for discards, which they pack on to carts and bicycles. With the machines, the firm hopes to collect directly from the public and generate extra revenue from government subsidies and sales of advertising shown on the machine&apos;s screens. Incom says it plans to approach Coca-Cola and other beverage retailers. Similar devices have been used in several countries, including the US, Japan and Brazil, but they have benefited from civic mindedness, convenience and widespread ignorance about the true value of PET. Waste-trade experts are sceptical that the same business model will work in China, which already has a vast and highly competitive PET recycling industry. Nobody knows the numbers of collectors, but estimates range from 500,000 to 20 million. Many go from door to door, or come when called. Adam Minter, a Shangai-based blogger and author of an upcoming book on China&apos;s scrap business, reckons that recycling may be the second most popular profession in the country after farming and that the PET market alone is worth billions of dollars. More significantly, he says the motives are also different, which will mean the reverse vending machine operators will have to offer competitive rates or they will struggle to attract takers. &quot;In the west, recycling is seen as a green activity. In developing Asia, it is an economic activity,&quot; Minter says. &quot;One thing is guaranteed. If donors are not paid market price, it is not going to work.&quot; A similar device was launched in Shanghai several years ago, but has not made any noticeable dent in the informal industry. Incom says, however, that environmental benefits should be considered alongside economic factors. While most informal PET recycling workshops re-use the plastic for clothes and create pollution during their largely unregulated activities, the company says it makes the cleanest and most efficient use possible of the plastic for new bottles. Environmental activists said they would wait to see whether the devices were energy intensive and waste-producing before passing judgment. &quot;Using better technology for recycling is a good thing, generally speaking,&quot; said Feng Yongfeng of the Green Beagle NGO. &quot;But bottle recycling is not an urgent problem in China. We already have a mature system for that. Our real need is to complete a comprehensive recycling system.&quot;", "tags": ["Recycling", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Waste", "Ethical and green living", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-04T12:11:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/06/education-pisa-maths-reading-grammar-schools", "sentences": ["26.6% of their peers in Shanghai municipality achieved a level 6, 15.6% in Singapore and 11.3% in Chinese Taipei.", "Scores in science tests - not included in the study but also recorded by PISA - showed a similar pattern, with 1.9% of England&apos;s teenagers attaining a level 6, against 4.6% for Singapore and 3.9% for Shanghai."], "title": "England's brightest pupils 'let down by failing policy'. Get the data", "article": "England&apos;s schools are failing their most able teenagers, leaving them trailing far behind their peers in other developed countries. Pupils at England&apos;s secondary schools are just half as likely to score highly on international maths tests than those in the average developed country, according to a report from the Sutton Trust. The study shows that the majority of England&apos;s pupils achieving the highest marks are from independent and grammar schools, with &quot;almost no pupils&quot; achieving top levels from non-selective state schools. Just 1.7% of England&apos;s pupils achieved the top proficiency level in maths (level 6), compared to an average of 3.1% for countries within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED). Pupils are assigned a level based on their score on Programme for International Student Asessment (PISA) tests, needing 707.93 or above to qualify for level 6. Pupils at England&apos;s grammar schools outscored their state-educated peers in both maths and reading - on average - by 546 to 490 and 553 to 492 respectively. Across the UK as a whole, 1.8% of all pupils achieved a level 6 in maths, with this figure falling to just 1% for reading skills. England&apos;s failings are thrown into sharper relief when the scores of non-OECD regions are also included. 26.6% of their peers in Shanghai municipality achieved a level 6, 15.6% in Singapore and 11.3% in Chinese Taipei. In reading tests, New Zealand&apos;s pupils scored highest, with 2.9% achieving level 6, followed by Singapore with 2.6%. Scores in science tests - not included in the study but also recorded by PISA - showed a similar pattern, with 1.9% of England&apos;s teenagers attaining a level 6, against 4.6% for Singapore and 3.9% for Shanghai. The report recommends that the most able children should be identified in tests at the end of primary school, and their progress and performance monitored in published secondary school tables. It also advocates that national tests should include tougher questions, allowing the highly able to demonstrate the extent of their abilities. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said:  These are shocking findings that raise profound concerns about how well we support our most academically able pupils from non-privileged backgrounds.  Professor Alan Smithers, co-author of the report, emphasised the need for schools to take responsibility for the progress of their brightest students, saying:  The key issue is that secondary schools should be held to account for the progress of the highly able. The Government should signal to schools the importance of educating the brightest through how it holds the schools to account. At present the accountability measures are pitched at the weakest and middling performers.  Education Secretary Michael Gove was quick to link the report&apos;s findings to his ambitions for reform of Britain&apos;s examination system. He said:  This report underlines why the Government is determined to act decisively to restore academic rigour to schools and ensure our exams match the world&apos;s best.

She was only 13, and he wanted to speak to her mother. Sweetenham had a fearsome reputation. He alienated and infuriated his athletes in equal measure. He was, he explained, putting together a training group for the best young female swimmers in the country. &quot;Would Ellen,&quot; he said, &quot;like to sign up?&quot; That was late in 2004. That November, Gandy found herself in Mexico along with 11 other young British girls. They were on their way to a high-altitude training camp. Sweetenham had also rung around a few other houses. He called Elizabeth Simmonds, now 21, who won the 200m backstroke at the European championships in 2010. He called Fran Halsall, 22, who is competing in three individual events in London this summer and is ranked inside the world&apos;s top five in all of them. And he called the 22-year-old Jemma Lowe, who finished seventh in the 200m butterfly final at the world championship last year. Gandy, now 20, is arguably the most talented of the bunch. She won silver in the 200m butterfly at the world championships in Shanghai last year, and was just four hundredths of a second away from gold. She says she still cannot bring herself to watch the tape of the race because she can see exactly where she went wrong, and that hurts. &quot;Looking back I can see how much it has helped me,&quot; Gandy says of Sweetenham&apos;s work. &quot;We were taken all over the world, we were doing altitude training when we were 13. Myself, Fran, Lizzie, Jemma, we&apos;ve all been together for so many years now. It is amazing that we&apos;ve all been through these experiences together from such a young age.&quot; Over the next few years, Sweetenham took the girls to intensive training camps in China, Japan, Australia and the USA. For two of those trips they gained a new member, Hannah Miley. She is now a European and Commonwealth champion at the 400m individual medley, and, like Gandy, won silver in her event in\u00a0Shanghai. For Sweetenham, who endured a three-month inquiry into allegations that he had bullied members of the GB team, the 2012 Olympics will be a remarkable vindication of his work. He was hired in the wake of Britain&apos;s disastrous performance at the Sydney Olympics, when the team failed to win a single medal. Eight years later the groundwork he did with Gandy&apos;s generation is about to pay off at the home Games. British women&apos;s swimming has never been stronger. Team GB has set a target of five to seven swimming medals at the 2012 Games. They have won a combined total of only eight medals at the last five Olympics, and yet their 2012 target is certainly achievable. The team won five medals at the world championships in Shanghai last year. Four of them went to women. The one exception \u2013 Liam Tancock&apos;s gold in the 50m backstroke \u2013 was in an event that is not included on the Olympic programme. Tancock is all but unbeatable over a single length, but has never been as strong over double the distance. He is ranked seventh in the world at the 100m and will do well to win a medal. Otherwise the only real male medal contender is James Goddard, who has the misfortune to be going in the same event as two of the greatest swimmers in history, Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte. Like everyone else in that event, he will be competing for a bronze medal at best. So if the team meet their medal target, it will be the women who do it for them. Miley, Gandy and Halsall should all be in contention for gold. It would be easy to say British swimming is blessed to have such talent, if you did not know that it was all the result of so much planning and effort. Under Sweetenham&apos;s replacement Michael Scott, the team have made further advances. Scott has put more emphasis on sports science, and has set up a programme that pays meticulous attention to detail. Britain&apos;s swimmers have help in everything, they have even had lessons in how to wash their hands properly to cut down on the risk of infection. They have a lifestyle coach who teaches them what food to shop for and how best to cook it. Each swimmer works with a performance psychologist, a performance nutritionist, a physiotherapist, a soft-tissue therapist and a performance scientist. The team have worked with marine engineers to study how best to cut down drag in the water, and talked to scientists who study the movement of fish about how to maximize propulsion. Challenged to find a way to improve their turns, some of the squad started ballet training because they believed it would help them improve their core strength and spatial awareness. All that is only icing on top of the essential quality that Sweetenham identified in all these swimmers. He called it the &quot;mongrel factor&quot;. Miley, 22, grew up in a far more rough-and-ready environment. She was swimming in a 25m pool in Scotland, coached by her father who worked in between as a helicopter pilot flying back and forth to the North Sea oil rigs. Gandy moved to Australia when she was 16, after her father took a job at Melbourne airport. There, she trains alongside the former Olympic champions Michael Klim and Leisel Jones. &quot;When I moved to Australia it just gave me a fresh start on things,&quot; she says. &quot;It kicked me back into swimming it again.&quot; She made her breakthrough in 2010, and dominated her events at the Australian state championships this winter. Halsall is perhaps the most charismatic of them all, a star in waiting. She will be competing in five events in London, so for her the challenge is going to be in managing her workload and her post-race recovery. There are other medal contenders among the women&apos;s squad too. Simmonds will expect to make the final of the 200m backstroke. Gemma Spofforth was world champion at the 100m backstroke in 2009, and still holds the world record at the distance, but like Jo Jackson, who won bronze in the 400m freestyle in Beijing, she has been struggling to find her best form in the last 12 months. Keri-Anne Payne, 24, is the toughest of the bunch. In the open water marathon, she has had to get used to swimming through jellyfish, past dead dogs and live sharks. By comparison, swimming in the Serpentine is going to be a pleasant day out in the park. Since she won silver in Beijing, Payne has dominated marathon swimming, winning back-to-back world titles. She too is likely to end the Games as an Olympic champion and a star, if she can find time for it in between preparing for her wedding to her team-mate David Carry. And then, of course, there is Becky Adlington, who has two Olympic titles to defend, in the 400m and 800m freestyle. Adlington, oddly enough, was one woman who wasn&apos;t part of Sweetenham&apos;s Smart Track squad. But her victories in Beijing had a major influence on her team-mates. &quot;That made the difference,&quot; Gandy says. &quot;It really just said to all of us &apos;it&apos;s possible&apos;. When someone does well like that you just feed off the energy.&quot; Success in Beijing almost spoiled Adlington, which is understandable given that she was only 19 at the time. At the world championships in Rome the following year she broke down in tears after finishing fourth in the 800m freestyle.

And so he has arrived: playing for the men&apos;s title at Wimbledon, at 25, muscles rippling, heart beating, hoping it is the start of something, not the conclusion. And, while it has makings of a fairytale, it is not a dream; nor is it one of his fantasy football games. He is not a boy anymore. Yet Murray contradicts the view that playing for the most coveted title in tennis has been a core obsession for him since childhood. &quot;A lot of people say I dreamt of winning this,&quot; he said. &quot;But when I was a young kid I didn&apos;t understand what a grand slam was, I didn&apos;t know how important Wimbledon was. It&apos;s been the last few years when I have started to appreciate it and understand how important it is to me and my career. This is the reason you put your body through the workouts and training. It&apos;s the last few years I have thought about it more and come to understand how important it is.&quot; Once, maybe not long ago, it would have been tempting to imagine that if he could do this deed behind closed doors instead of under the gaze of millions, he might be considerably more relaxed about the situation. He is the toughest of competitors, the most reticent of heroes, a shy man in a world of flashing lights. But he is fully grown now, not so worried about the opinion of others, less regarding of the criticism of strangers, journalists and even old friends. He even had the audacity to say after beating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a tense semi-final on Friday he was &quot;not that bothered&quot; how those watching from his courtside box would have been feeling. &quot;I have to be selfish,&quot; he said. Only seasoned athletes talk like that. Otherwise they get eaten alive. It is often still hard to read what he is really thinking or feeling, mind. Whatever his commitment to focused tennis and sticking to a gameplan, he could roar out of the blocks against Roger Federer on Sunday afternoon \u2013 much as he did in the first round against poor Nikolay Davydenko \u2013 and nail the Swiss before the nation has had time to put the kettle on. Or he could descend into paroxysms of self-doubt, as he did against David Ferrer in Paris last month (although not here, where he got sweet revenge). More likely, he will start cautiously, hoping not to serve first, lest his trembling betray him, building his game, waiting for openings \u2013 and, ideally, taking them \u2013 then losing himself in the smoke and fire of battle, which is how he likes it. As Serena Williams said beforehand, &quot;There is nobody I like to watch more than Andy.&quot; Warming up at Wimbledon on Saturday, Murray said: &quot;I need to be perfect.&quot; That is a big ask. This is a big moment, the biggest of his career. Although he leads Federer 8-7 in career match-ups, in grand slam finals, the US Open in 2008 and the Australian in 2010, it is 2-0 Federer. They have played seven finals in total, all on hardcourt, and Murray has won only one \u2013 but what a one: the devastating decider in Shanghai two years ago, when Federer could scrape only five games in two sets. Murray was irresistible that day. There are more relevant numbers, though: like zero. They have never met on grass. Both are comfortable on the surface, Federer profoundly so, having won six finals here. It suits Murray&apos;s teasing backhand slice, his rejuvenated serve and a souped-up forehand. His tools are sharp. So is his mind. Murray will be buoyed, too, in the knowledge that Federer has not won a major since embarrassing him two-and-a-half years ago on the Rod Laver Court in Melbourne, even though he has 16 slams in the locker. In the end it will come down, as it always does, to court presence and concentration. If Federer senses hesitation in Murray \u2013 as when he blew free points against him in Melbourne \u2013 he will make him suffer as surely as he made Novak Djokovic suffer on Friday. But if Murray seizes the moment, and his hitting is true and decisive, Federer might find he no long has the legs to get out of trouble. His back is also suspect, and he needed a 10-minute break after the third set against Djokovic. Murray (whose own back seems to be working well after the horrors of Roland Garros) has done a remarkable job in turning his season around. After probably his best performance in a major six months ago in Melbourne, going out in five sets and nearly five hours to Djokovic, the eventual winner, the adrenaline seeped from his tennis. He beat Djokovic again in Dubai, but could not beat Federer in the final. There was disappointment in Indian Wells, revival in Miami, a couple of quarter-final exits in Monaco and Barcelona, withdrawal with injury before Madrid, a poor Rome Masters, a so-so French Open, when his back went again, badly, and a first-round shock at Queen&apos;s. And here we are, riding the Murray handcart to heaven and hell and back again, full of good intentions. When Murray and Federer walk on to Centre Court, the scale of the occasion will kick in like one of the Scot&apos;s vastly improved second serves, a throat-ball of reality, and he may sneak a look at his opponent to detect even a sliver of apprehension in the great man. He won&apos;t find any. Is Murray up to it? I think so. I hope so. If he is not, if he folds under the pressure of expectations and his opponent, the embarrassment will be profound, the damage deep. But the perception that Murray cracks when asked his sport&apos;s toughest questions \u2013 drawn from three losing performances at this level, without winning even a set \u2013 is not altogether fair. Few players in the history of the game have ever fought harder for a point on a tennis court. Murray is the patron saint of lost causes. But so tight are his emotions that sometimes they strangle his talent. And it is because he cares so much \u2013 not just for the nation, but for himself and those close to him \u2013 that anxiety can flood his well-muscled limbs at the most inconvenient times. He assures us it is not the problem it was. His demeanour might retain dregs of the old whinge gene, but, generally, he has matured in front of our eyes \u2013 whatever the absurd avalanche of criticism that so angered him the past month. If Murray needed further incentive to beat Federer beyond the obvious demands of the occasion \u2013 the world No 3 is hoping to leapfrog Djokovic and Rafael Nadal to No1 by winning a record seventh title here \u2013 he was gifted that by Virginia Wade, who, in all fairness, probably uttered her infamous &quot;drama queen&quot; jibe to fill a media void. So, the queen will be at Wimbledon on Sunday, but not the one from Buckingham Palace; and so will the king. While Federer affects unshakeable cool, smiling and quipping in one of his five languages, he has the advantage of not wondering if he deserves to be adored, even a month short of his 31st birthday in an era of unprecedented quality at the summit. Murray, meanwhile, retreats into his Oxshott bubble during Wimbledon, he says, not listening to the outside world. He reads no papers, watches little TV, takes no heed at all of any criticism that leaks through the armour his team wrap around him. For some, this would be unhealthily obsessive, but Murray is a sensitive soul. He was close to tears on Centre Court on Friday evening after beating Tsonga. We ought to be in no doubt this matters to him. If he senses a reciprocal sentiment coming from the crowd on Sunday, it might be enough to haul him into the history books. Murray abhors jingoism. Nor is he overly sentimental. But it would be a wonderful moment in his life and ours if he were to do today what he has wanted to do for so long: the impossible.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "Wimbledon 2012", "Wimbledon", "Sport", "Tennis"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-07T21:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/jul/09/pioneering-social-innovation-china", "sentences": ["UK-born Leigh-Anne Russell, from the Non-Profit Incubator (NPI) in Shanghai, has been working with the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) and the Shanghai social sector, and says that &quot;relevant government policies are under review, and reform is being pushed in order to support the development of social entrepreneurship as a more sustainable way to address societal challenges&quot;.", "It will provide a physical space in Shanghai for social entrepreneurs to share learning and build links across sectors in order to devise solutions that address local social issues.The Nest and other co-working spaces in China like Xindanwei are setting up shop in all of the major Chinese cities, and are urban landmarks for social innovation.", "Christina Rebel is UK projects and research co-ordinator at We Impact, a social enterprise based in Beijing and Shanghai in China and London."], "title": "Pioneering social innovation in China", "article": "The momentum for social innovation is picking up in the Far East. In 2007, President Hu Jintao of the People&apos;s Republic of China made a proclamation about the importance of social development to the wellbeing of its people and, since then, various initiatives have been springing up.  It has now been more than three years since the British Council launched the Skills for Social Entrepreneurs in China, training 250 professionals in addressing community-based issues through social enterprise. Earlier this year, a Social Enterprise Summit in Hong Kong attracted more than 100 organisations.  A question of identity As in Britain, Chinese social entrepreneurs find themselves lacking the right legal framework in which to trade, uncomfortably deliberating between not-for-profit or for-profit status.  However, the dispute should be less about whether the enterprise is for-profit or not-for-profit (this distinction is often less important in the early stages of most enterprises as most are loaded with risks and shortcomings in their pursuit of meeting costs). The more important question is what are the resources available in China to support the social entrepreneur? Growing support While it has still to catch up in terms of scale, China has seen a number of social enterprise organisations such as the China Social Entrepreneur Foundation establish themselves. UK-born Leigh-Anne Russell, from the Non-Profit Incubator (NPI) in Shanghai, has been working with the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) and the Shanghai social sector, and says that &quot;relevant government policies are under review, and reform is being pushed in order to support the development of social entrepreneurship as a more sustainable way to address societal challenges&quot;. The Narada Foundation and Ecsel are also among the group of incubators that promote partnerships and provide support for social innovation in China. Russell&apos;s new project is The Nest, a social innovation park project lead by NPI and Moca due to open in 2013. It will provide a physical space in Shanghai for social entrepreneurs to share learning and build links across sectors in order to devise solutions that address local social issues.The Nest and other co-working spaces in China like Xindanwei are setting up shop in all of the major Chinese cities, and are urban landmarks for social innovation.  Anna Levy from Hub Islington, the original hub of a global network with more than 4,000 members and which has supported the growth of the social enterprise sector in London since it opened in 2005, explains that these spaces are instrumental in supporting start-ups achieve their impact. &quot;It&apos;s not just about providing affordable office space and facilities, although that is of course important at the early stages of a business, but even more crucially, these spaces provide access to a readymade network of like-minded individuals and organisations with a wealth of shared experience and potentially useful contacts and knowledge,&quot; she says. Eastern promise This emergence of social entrepreneurship in China, with government endorsement and buttressed by the establishment of the appropriate support networks and institutions, provides real opportunities for the UK entrepreneur to venture east for trade. Key for the success of any such initiative is respecting that, while influenced by European and American practices of social enterprise, the trend in China will still have characteristics that reflect local culture and tradition. Getting to grips with what this might mean in practice will be essential for any start-up entrepreneur wishing to stand to gain from the opportunities in China. We&apos;ll be considering some of these questions tomorrow evening \u2013 Tuesday 10 July \u2013 in a debate at the Hub Islington, organised by We Impact, Hub Islington and the ChinaNext Foundation. Emerge: Pioneering Social Innovation in China will open a conversation on the social innovation sector in China, with a panel debate which invites the perspective of professionals like Erika Helms, founder of Linking China Ltd, and Tristan Edmonson from CSR Asia to share first-hand expertise of what China has to offer.  Isabel Hilton, editor of the bilingual sustainability news source, ChinaDialogue, will also be providing her perspective on the role of the media and communications, with start-up entrepreneurs from the UK with recent experience in China joining the discussion to share their experiences. In the words of Helms, whose social enterprise focuses on exchanges between the third sectors of Europe and China, the key obstacle to social enterprise in China involves developing local capacity and experience. Helms sees &quot;real opportunities for UK-based intermediaries to share their capacity building, education and other support mechanisms with those up-and-coming organisations in China that aim to support the growth of the sector&quot;. The ChinaNext Foundation, newly registered as a charity in the UK that serves as a bridge builder between civil organisations in China and Europe, also endeavours to share the best practice of civil society in the UK with developments in China. Seeing that the UK is becoming a world leader in social enterprise, the work of Linking China and the foundation will bring extra promise to UK social entrepreneurs with their sights set on the East.

Traditional Chinese medicine, which has been tried and tested on its home turf over three millennia, is working hard to gain mainstream acceptance in the west, where there are stricter regulations and requirements for therapeutic trials. Based on a range of remedies inherited from Taoist scholars, and also on acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine is derived from Confucianism. But it would be a mistake to suppose that what is now officially known as TCM has traversed so many centuries unchanged. &quot;TCM is a political construct dating from the 1950s, following on from the 1949 revolution,&quot; says Professor Paul Unschuld of Berlin Medical University, who chairs the International Society for the History of East Asian Science, Technology and Medicine. &quot;It includes selected aspects of historical Chinese medicine, but it is also influenced by the rationale and concepts of modern science.&quot; Despite the slow acceptance, there have been advances. In Europe, where little was known about Chinese practices, TCM gained traction in the 1970s as part of the movement towards alternative therapies. A World Health Organisation congress emphasised the legacy of such medicine in a 2008 declaration, though stressed the need to hasten its modernisation and acceptance. China, too, has realised the need to integrate and advance, and has been working since 2007 to abandon some outdated methods. &quot;Many Chinese medicinal herbs are used in south-east Asia, in Singapore and Indonesia, but also Russia and Australia,&quot; says Professor Guo De-an, chief scientist at the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. &quot;But Europe and the United States account for the major part of the global pharmaceutical market.&quot; To gain a foothold in the market for prescription drugs in the US and Europe, manufacturers must comply with the standards set by the agencies tasked with regulating healthcare products. They must satisfy requirements for both pharmacological effectiveness and overall quality. &quot;There is still no appropriate methodology for assessing the effects of TCM,&quot; says Guo. &quot;It is not sufficient to measure blood pressure \u2026 the question is how to carry out group studies of individualised treatment.&quot; Robert Verpoorte, the head of the Natural Products laboratory at Leiden University in the Netherlands, advocates a new approach to studying traditional Chinese medicine. &quot;We should base our approach on the effects produced by a medicinal plant on living organisms resulting from the activity of its many components,&quot; he says. &quot;This approach is used in systems biology and metabolomics, which studies all the metabolites present in a cell or organism.&quot; Guo sees two ways ahead for medicinal plants used in TCM: &quot;Either they can be authorised, through a simplified procedure, as traditional plant-based treatments; or they may obtain the status of herbal medicinal products for human use as defined by the European Medicines Agency,&quot; he says. The Chinese government has encouraged efforts to obtain US and EU authorisation of TCM-derived drugs for treating heart disease and menopause-related disorders. &quot;For the time being there is no alternative to western assessment criteria and we must work hard to provide the data required by the US and EU agencies,&quot; he says. As these therapies seek to gain greater recognition, the question of side effects also looms. Chinese advocates have tended to assert that TCM remedies are safe. But at a recent conference on such treatments in Bologna, one speaker diverged from this position. Defending an approach based on strict clinical trials, Bian Zhao-xiang, the head of the clinical division of the School of Chinese Medicine at Hong Kong Baptist University, said: &quot;We must improve reporting of side effects.&quot; Co-operation between China and the west is developing. &quot;Several major western drug firms have invested in industrial co-operation projects,&quot; says Guo.

Together with items from the Guimet Asian Arts Museum these are part of an exhibition on cooking and eating in China through the ages (until 30 September). This is the first time so many works of art have left China and the first time a European museum has hosted an exhibition from China&apos;s National Museum. In return, the Quai de Branly will send part of its collection to China in 2013. When asked why cooking utensils and dishes were selected for this first event, Jean-Paul Desroches, sinologist and curator of the exhibition, replied that it was an obvious choice. &quot;In China, 70% of [museum] items relate to food, while the remainder are to do with calligraphy and sculpture \u2026 It&apos;s quite logical, China is a walking stomach!&quot; That becomes clear when you wander around the streets of Beijing, where you can eat at any time of day or night, picking from baskets of steamed dumplings or little skewers of grilled meat, not to mention the restaurants. That is when you realise that the Chinese food as served abroad is misrepresentation adapted to European or western tastes. In China there are no &quot;Asian&quot; restaurants: you eat spicy food from Sichuan, or steamed dishes from Guangzhou, thinly sliced Peking duck wrapped in rice pancakes from Beijing, or soy-marinated fish from Shanghai. Dishes are usually served on a glass lazy Susan from which\u00a0diners help themselves, taking care not to deprive their neighbours by pulling it too close. In Beijing it is not done to stuff oneself, Desroches explained. &quot;Eating rice at the end of the meal implies that your host has not fed you well&quot;. In the Quai de Branly exhibition a video installation by Pleix, a contemporary artists&apos; collective, has used the lazy Susan concept to show the 32 dishes visitors learn about in the course of the exhibition. One also views the ancient recipients displayed according to their purpose and their dynasty. The exhibition itself is mouth-watering. The oldest utensil is a tripod for holding rice dating to 7,000BC. The Chinese also invented the brazier for cooking kebabs. Items on display include gilded silver wine jugs carved by Iranians who worked at the imperial court, small stoneware dishes for serving spices, porcelain bowls with flower patterns from the Ming dynasty, and a porcelain jar with an extract from the classic tale Romance of the Western Chamber painted on it. &quot;In China, a prince was defined by the quality of his tableware,&quot; said Desroches, summing up the exhibition in a nutshell.

I have thought about Heather Locklear every day since circa 1981, but knowing that she was previously married to Tommy Lee, I am realistic enough to understand that she would have been bitterly disappointed&quot; - David Fortune. &quot;Anyone wishing to avoid confusion over Heathers Thomas and Locklear need just remember that one starred as the foxy blonde sidekick of an ageing former sci-fi star playing an unconvincing law enforcement professional while wearing a preposterous hairpiece, while the other starred as the foxy blonde sidekick of an ageing former sci-fi star playing an unconvincing law enforcement professional while wearing a preposterous hairpiece&quot; - Steve Doohan. &quot;Mr Hannigan (yesterday&apos;s Fiver Letters) should consider himself lucky that he gets the Fiver on a regular basis.

Eating dim sum at a restaurant is known as &quot;going to drink tea&quot;, or yum cha in Cantonese \u2013 and is a must-do. While I make no claim that the Yum Cha at Maxim&apos;s Palace is the best in Hong Kong (I&apos;ll keep you posted on my quest), the dim sum&apos;s very good, you get great harbour views and it&apos;s one of only a handful of restaurants in the city which still uses the old-school dim sum trolleys. Come at lunchtime but be prepared for a wait \u2013 they don&apos;t take bookings and it gets pretty hectic, particularly at weekends when it&apos;s customary for Cantonese families to eat dim sum together. Take your seat in the large red and gold dining hall and keep a close eye on the trolleys being wheeled between the tables. When you spot something you fancy, stop the waitress and grab a basket. I suggest that you try a little bit of everything but my top dim sum picks are: har gau (shrimp dumplings), char sui bau (steamed barbecue pork buns), cheung fan (rice paper rolls which come with various fillings aka Chinese ravoili), sui mai (pork dumplings), and Xiaolongbao (steamed pork soup dumplings originating from Shanghai). If you&apos;re feeling brave, try the chicken&apos;s feet \u2013 they don&apos;t taste as bad as they look. \u2022 City Hall Maxim&apos;s Palace, 2/F, City Hall Low Block, +852 2521 1303 Happy Valley races     Photograph: Alamy/World Pictures Photoshot    Gambling is a national obsession in China. In Hong Kong it&apos;s illegal to gamble unless it&apos;s through the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Unsurprisingly then, Hong Kong&apos;s largest single tax payer, largest private charity donor and largest employer is the Hong Kong Jockey Club. If you want to see Hong Kong doing something it really loves, head to Happy Valley Racecourse on a Wednesday night between September and June. The racecourse itself is pretty impressive. The floodlit green track has a dramatic backdrop of towering apartment blocks glittering against the night sky. For a bargain HK$10 entrance fee (about 80p) you get access to the public stands and betting hall. Tourists can present their passport and pay an extra HK$100 (about \u00a38) for entry to the Members&apos; Enclosure, but for atmosphere and value for money the stands can&apos;t be beaten. Tourists and expats tend to gather by the beer tent next to the course. For a glimpse of the locals at play and a superb bird&apos;s-eye view of the action head further up the stands. Races run approximately every 30 minutes from 7.30pm. Get there early, grab a good spot by the railings and place your bets. \u2022 2 Sports Rd, Happy Valley, +852 2895 1523 or +852 2966 8111, happyvalleyracecourse.com Tai Long Wan     Photograph: Alamy    A short hop outside the urban centre you find green country parks, walking trails and pretty beaches. Some of Hong Kong&apos;s more accessible beaches can get a little dirty and crowded but Tai Long Wan in the New Territories is harder to get to which means that it&apos;s often almost deserted. The sand is fine and buttery yellow, the water&apos;s clear and clean; you could easily mistake it for a beach on one of the calmer Thai islands. Head here first thing and when the sun gets too much enjoy lunch at one of the rustic beach bars which serve up cold beers to wash down noodles, fried rice and basic seafood (don&apos;t expect lobster and scallops). While a day trip is entirely possible, for a real getaway you can rent camping equipment for a reasonable price from one of the beach bars and pitch up on the sand. \u2022 How to get there: A speedboat taxi from Saikung harbour takes around 30 minutes. If the water&apos;s too rough, the boats won&apos;t go. The more energetic route is to take a taxi to Saikung Country Park and hike in (a hilly, 1\u00bd-hour walk). For the high rollers, there are helipads on the beaches and there are always a couple of Sunseekers moored just off the shore Yardbird     Yardbird, Hong Kong    This is one of my favourite spots for a laid-back evening with great food, strong cocktails and a bit of light bar-staff ogling. Yardbird yakatori restaurant opened late last year and was an instant hit. Located on the edge of Soho, the restaurant&apos;s USP is nose-to-tail Izakaya-style dining of the chicken variety. You can&apos;t make a reservation, so head down early and while you wait for a table get stuck into a bowl of edamame and a cocktail. The bar staff (who all look like off-duty models) mix seriously strong cocktails while knowledgeably guiding you through the menu. From your standard chicken cuts to the more unusual like knee and tail, all items on the menu are made from birds delivered fresh that day. My top picks are the salty, lemony oysters (the fabled circular nuggets of meat from just beside the thighs) and the moreish chicken meatballs. The KFC on the menu is not chicken related \u2013 it stands for Korean fried cauliflower, the perfect accompaniment to the chicken. \u2022 yardbirdrestaurant.com, 33 Bridges Street, +852 2547 9273 Gao&apos;s Foot Massage Co     Foot massage neon signage in Kowloon. Photograph: Alamy    Stuck in Hong Kong during the humid typhoon season, or just in need of an hour&apos;s break from sightseeing? A foot massage is the perfect solution. The city has numerous reflexology shops which can be spotted by the flashing neon feet signs above the doorways. After rigorous trials (it&apos;s a tough job but someone had to do it) I can confirm that Gao&apos;s is one of the best. Don&apos;t expect a sleek spa interior \u2013 Gao&apos;s looks a little like your Chinese grandmother&apos;s sitting room with a bit of Ikea thrown in \u2013 but the focus isn&apos;t on decor but on the blissful foot rubs. Choose how long you want your reflexology to last, settle into one of the reclining leather armchairs and let the therapists work their magic. Wrapped in blankets, resting on a warm, cinnamon scented neck pillow and sipping on rose petal tea, it&apos;s the little extras that make Gao&apos;s special. I guarantee that after an hour you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;re walking on clouds.\u2022 15/F, Century Square 1-13 D&apos;Aguilar Street, Central, +852 2810 9289, gaoshk.com Posto Publico     Posto Publico, Hong Kong    This restaurant works for any occasion: I head to this open-fronted American-Italian for after-work prosecco with the girls, long lunches, late night suppers and morning-after, hangover-busting brunches. Even if the food was average, the atmosphere would still keep me coming back. And the food&apos;s anything but average. Creamy, homemade mozzarella (and if you get in very quickly, incredible Burrata \u2013 so legendary that it sells out almost instantly every day), crusty ciabatta served with peppery, green olive oil and rock salt, homemade pastas and slabs of mouth-watering pizza. But my top picks are the veal meatballs and the arancini. All ingredients are organic, of the highest quality and where possible, sourced locally.\u2022 G/F, 28 Elgin Street, Central, +852 2577 7160, postopubblico.com The Peak     Hong Kong's famous Peak Tram.  Photograph: Samantha Sin/AFP/Getty Images    Victoria Peak is the highest point on Hong Kong Island which means 360-degree views of the island and a breathtaking harbour vista as you look across to Kowloon side. Hong Kong&apos;s most popular tourist attraction is a must-see, but instead of taking the Tram Peak funicular railway to the top (avoid the queues and save that for the journey down) take a cab up and ask your driver to drop you off outside the Peak Tower and take a stroll along the Hong Kong Trail, a route which loops for about an hour around the top of the Peak through lush greenery that chirrups with cicadas. You&apos;ll get beautiful views across the city and wind past some of Hong Kong&apos;s most luxurious houses (prices of the real estate up here exceed even those of Monaco&apos;s mansions). This is a perfect walk to take during late afternoon so that you end up back at the Peak Tower just before sunset. Head to the viewing platform in time to watch the sun sink below the skyscrapers and stay until the city&apos;s kaleidoscopic lights come up.\u2022 128 Peak Road, The Peak, thepeak.com.hk. The Hong Kong Trail China Club     Dining room at the China Club. Photograph: Alamy    This private members&apos; club, owned by Sir David Tang, is housed over three floors in the former Bank of China building. Usually you have to be, or know, a member but most hotels should be able to get you a booking with enough notice. The restaurant is designed to resemble a decadent 1930s Shanghai club, and everything from the ceiling fans to the lamps conjures up a bygone colonial era. Start with aperitifs up on the 14th floor in the glamorous art deco Long March Bar, then head to the main dining room, slip into one of the red leather booths and get your chopsticks at the ready for the Cantonese feast to follow. Be sure to order the Peking duck, I think it&apos;s the best in Hong Kong. If people-watching doesn&apos;t keep you entertained (Victoria Beckham visited on her recent trip to Hong Kong), be wowed by the chef who spins ribbons of noodles right in front of your table. After dinner, decamp to the elegant terrace for nightcaps under the stars overlooking the city lights.\u2022 12/F, The Old Bank of China Building, Bank Street, Central, +852 2521 8888 001 For arguably Hong Kong&apos;s best cocktails head to 001. That&apos;s if you can track it down. Hidden away in the Graham Street wet market, this speakeasy is accessed via an anonymous black door sandwiched between a fruit stall and a paper lantern seller. I should warn you that a prior booking is essential, and once you&apos;ve made it in, you&apos;re greeted with a moodily lit bar full of shadowy nooks which hint at secret liaisons. Jazz hums while waiters glide around proffering silver trays of cocktails and bowls of nuts. The Earl Grey martinis are legendary. The elderflower caipirinha and the strawberry blonde come a close second but be warned, the pear side car is deadly.

Second-quarter growth of 7.6% \u2013 down from 8.1% in the previous three months \u2013 was in line with expectations, but dampened hopes that the world&apos;s second largest economy would help to offset wider woes. &quot;The growth rate of 7.6% is already an achievement because the economic situation facing China has been complex and severe,&quot; said Sheng Laiyun of the National Bureau of Statistics. &quot;We have seen tepid domestic and external demand.&quot;     China GDP Photograph: Graphic    Growth in the first half of the year stood at 7.8% overall, with Europe&apos;s struggles and government curbs on the property market weighing on the economy. The Asian Development Bank trimmed its forecast for the year from 8.5% to 8.2% on Thursday \u2013 echoing the World Bank&apos;s move in May. The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, warned last week that the economy &quot;still faces relatively huge downward pressure&quot;. Lower than expected consumer inflation and import growth, in addition to producer price deflation, have also unnerved investors. Xianfang Ren, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Beijing, told Reuters: &quot;Overall, this is a soft landing, but we can see that the Chinese economy is undergoing serious pain. &quot;I have 80% confidence that the economy will pick up in the third quarter as we have been in a slowdown for six consecutive quarters now.&quot; Xiao Li, an economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai, told AP: &quot;It is not certain whether or not there will be a strong upward rebound. But at least the economic growth rate will stop coming down.&quot; Sheng said the slowdown partly reflected China&apos;s shift to a more sustainable development pattern after years of double-digit growth. The government has set its target for GDP growth this year \u2013 which rarely bears much resemblance to the actual figure \u2013 at just 7.5%, after years of an 8% goal. &quot;The downside risks remain, but the government has plenty of tools in its hands to make sure it won&apos;t collapse. The issue is whether the government can adjust to steady and healthy growth in the medium term,&quot; said Qian Liu of the Economist Intelligence Unit. &quot;Obviously in the last few months, things have been slower than anyone wanted or expected \u2013 they succeeded in scaring people out of buying houses so the residential property sector fell; and they frightened local officials and bankers in terms of infrastructure. They have fixed that,&quot; said Andy Rothman of researchers CLSA. &quot;China&apos;s economy survived a period of much slower growth in 2009, where there were massive layoffs, without social unrest or serious problems.&quot; The government has already cut interest rates twice in a month and lowered the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves three times since November. Analysts expect further easing of monetary policy, but officials have insisted they will not launch a stimulus package comparable to the 4tn yuan (\u00a3405bn) package of 2008. Retail sales growth in June fell to 12.1% from 13.8% the previous month, while growth in factory output ebbed slightly from 9.6% to 9.5%. Fixed asset investment growth \u2013 the key driver of economic expansion over the last decade \u2013 was 20.4% in the year to June, slightly above expectations, with a sharp acceleration in the last month. The government has long vowed to rebalance the economy away from its reliance on investment and exports towards domestic consumption, but experts say progress is proving painfully slow. Wen told economists this week: &quot;The measures to stabilise economic growth include boosting consumption and diversifying exports, but currently, what is important is to pursue a reasonable growth of investment.&quot;", "tags": ["Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-13T07:36:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/14/london-2012-rebecca-adlington-surprise", "sentences": ["She has maintained that status since, particularly after winning respective gold and silver medals in the 800m and 400m events at last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai, and now goes into these Games as the principal target for her rivals."], "title": "London 2012: Rebecca Adlington loses the element of surprise", "article": "A little under a fortnight before the swimming starts in London, Rebecca Adlington is fit, healthy and focused on retaining the two gold medals she won in Beijing four years ago.

Back in 2008 the effervescent 19\u2011year\u2011old from Mansfield was unknown to all but the truest of swimming aficionados, but after triumphing in the 800m and 400m freestyle \u2013 setting a world record time in the former and becoming the first British swimmer to win two Olympic gold medals since 1908\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Adlington became one of the most recognisable faces in Britain and, more significantly, one of the stars of her own sport. She has maintained that status since, particularly after winning respective gold and silver medals in the 800m and 400m events at last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai, and now goes into these Games as the principal target for her rivals. &quot;Everyone wants to beat me,&quot; Adlington said. &quot;I don&apos;t [feel the pressure of that] because I want to beat everyone else and I&apos;ve never been to a meet where the people who go in as the top three finish as the top three in every single race. It happens, it&apos;s life, and that&apos;s what is so exciting about sport in general. &quot;I am not under the illusion that I am going to win any race comfortably. It is going to be a fight, there are going to be other girls coming through who shock everyone. I know that because nobody expected me to do what I did in Beijing. It always happens; people always bring it out of the bag in Olympic year \u2013 that&apos;s what makes Olympic year so brilliant. I&apos;m looking forward to seeing who that person is myself.&quot; Having posted the fastest two times in the world this year, Adlington is the red-hot favourite for the 800m, but doing so in the 400m appears less certain, with Italy&apos;s Federica Pellegrini, the world champion and world record holder, undeniably the woman to beat over the shorter distance. Adlington is refusing to worry about losing one of her titles, however, insisting she will take whichever result comes her away with a level head having &quot;done absolutely everything possible&quot; to succeed during a gruelling training regime under the guidance of her long-serving coach, Bill Furniss. The 23-year-old admits to having suffered extreme &quot;mental tiredness&quot; as a result of her preparations for the Olympics and as she retreats to a holding camp in Edinburgh on Wednesday to taper down ahead of the Games, she could be forgiven for contemplating life away from the rigours of top-level competition. &quot;Who knows,&quot; replied Adlington when asked if this could be her last Olympics. &quot;After the Games I&apos;m taking two or three months off and am doing a [charity] bike ride in Zambia in October. Before that I also have Keri-Anne Payne&apos;s hen-do and wedding. When I come back from the cycling I will start to think about whether I want to carry on or not. I will sit down with Bill and see where he&apos;s at. I don&apos;t know how I am going to feel. But as far as the bike ride is concerned, I am definitely looking forward to doing something new.&quot; All that matters now, however, is London 2012 and the chance for Adlington to fire this country&apos;s imagination all over again. &quot;I don&apos;t want to let the opportunity of a home Olympics to go by,&quot; she said. &quot;As swimmers we train for 50 weeks a year for one moment and, in my case, it&apos;s over in eight minutes. Actually it&apos;s ridiculous when you say it like that. &quot;It can go right, it can go wrong, it can go average, you just never know. I don&apos;t want to come out crying, I don&apos;t want to be upset, but at the same time I know that I cannot control the other girls; if they are faster and better than me then fair play to them, they deserve it.

Fran Halsall has long been aware of the anonymity she and other swimmers confront as a daily reality alongside their draining training regimes and faceless competitions. Earlier this year, during the British trials, Halsall wore a pink swimsuit in the 100m freestyle final so she could help her father identify her more easily. &quot;I want to come high in the fashion stakes,&quot; the relentlessly chatty 22-year-old from Southport said. &quot;But the real reason I wore it is because when my dad\u00a0comes to watch he tells my mum: &apos;Fran&apos;s not doing well, her stroke looks awful.&apos; And my mum has to tell him he&apos;s looking at the wrong lane. So if I wear the bright, hot-pink suit he can see what lane I&apos;m in.&quot; Halsall might confound everyone, including her father, by becoming one of the most familiar faces of London 2012 as she sets about her pursuit of five Olympic medals. She is the only British swimmer to have qualified in three individual disciplines \u2013 the 50m and 100m freestyle, and the 100m butterfly. Currently ranked as world No2 and No4 in her first two events, and sixth in the butterfly, with two relays to follow, Halsall harbours realistic ambitions to win at least a few medals. Yet she is most impressive in asserting that she would rather win one gold, in her &quot;favourite Olympic blue-riband event&quot;, the 100m freestyle, than settle for a hypothetical five medals. Both outcomes are fraught with uncertainty, but Halsall has the personality to match her competitive gumption. When I interviewed her last year, she happily confirmed her description of herself on Twitter as &quot;70% professional athlete, 20% Krispy Kreme addict, 10% rock star&quot;. She also told me &quot;Aristotle is my main man. Oh my God, it&apos;s definitely got to be old Aristotle. He had all these ideas before anyone really knew anything \u2013 a whole new way of thinking was based around his thoughts. And this was like millions of years ago! It&apos;s crazy!&quot; Halsall zipped off on another jag in which she explained why Aristotle is a more trenchant thinker than Thomas Aquinas. She then told me about her &quot;lovely boyfriend&quot;, Alastair Wilson, who will also compete at the Olympics as a member of the GB hockey squad, and their cats \u2013 a big ginger Tom called Banks and &quot;a crazy, pretty little thing with the name of Bella&quot;. She then strutted down the path of fashion \u2013 paying serious homage to Chanel, Marc Jacobs and Brian Atwood \u2013 before discussing what she loved most\u00a0about ballet and kickboxing. After demonstrating a few of kickboxing&apos;s breathy cries and guttural grunts, she said, with a huge smile spread across her face: &quot;I really go hell for leather against the pads. It&apos;s a really good way of getting all the stress out.&quot; Her mention of that word \u2013 &quot;stress&quot; \u2013 was telling, for Halsall still has unanswered questions to confront. Despite her ability to produce blistering times, and match almost any woman in the world, she has often found it difficult to produce her finest swimming when it matters most. Halsall has twice proved that she can win five medals at a single competition \u2013 for in 2010 she won a quintet at both the European championships and the Commonwealth Games \u2013 but she lacks the major victories that define Rebecca Adlington. Despite their friendship, Halsall is acutely aware that Adlington currently occupies a different dimension to her. The contrast between them does not just centre on the fact Halsall is a sprinter and Adlington more of an endurance swimmer. Unlike Halsall, Adlington has already won two world championship gold medals. Even more impressively, she won two golds at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing \u2013 and she is flying again in the 800m freestyle and on course successfully to defend her title in London. Halsall&apos;s desire to match Adlington&apos;s achievements explains why there is such urgency in her voice when she says: &quot;I&apos;d definitely take just the one gold in the 100m free \u2013 before anything else.&quot; Last year, at the world championships in Shanghai, Halsall qualified fastest for the 100m final. But all that glittering promise shattered when she finished a disappointing fourth and did not come any closer to a medal in her other events. Yet the dejection she felt after the 100m freestyle prompted her to consult the psychologist Simon Middlemas. &quot;He said, &apos;Well, you&apos;ve had that experience now. You know what it feels like to be put on a pedestal to win and then not win. But nothing ridiculously bad has happened, so what are you complaining about?&apos;&quot; Halsall provided her own answer: &quot;The worst has happened,&quot; she said of that dispiriting swim in Shanghai. &quot;But it&apos;s taken the scariness out of it. The scare factor has gone. I came fourth \u2013 the worst position to come \u2013 out of lane four in a world championship final. And I&apos;m still here. I&apos;m still smiling.&quot; She can afford to smile because, in London, Halsall is at the perfect age, and in the right form, to win gold when it counts more than ever. A victory in the Olympic 100m freestyle final would transform her life and strip away the last vestiges of her anonymity. Halsall would burst on to a wider public stage with even more verve and panache than Adlington showed as an unaffected teenager in the Beijing limelight. As befits a worldly young woman, Halsall has a taste for glamour to match her often sophisticated, if zany, topics of conversation. She will also be spared the cruel jibes that were flung at Adlington, for Halsall has a sleeker and more petite presence. Yet, in the pool, her slighter physical frame is a distinct disadvantage. Halsall is only 5ft 7in tall and she shrugs wryly when comparing herself to her more physically imposing rivals: &quot;Yeah, it&apos;s me and the six-foot club. But I&apos;ve got long arms so that helps \u2026&quot; Halsall rightly underlines the need for power and strength in the freestyle sprints while highlighting the balance of flow and technique required in butterfly. She claims not to like butterfly, but Halsall is really just fascinated by the 100m freestyle. She describes its shorter variant, the one-lap 50m thrash, as a &quot;bun fight&quot;, while extolling the virtues of her favourite race: &quot;In the 100m you need experience, composure and strength. And you also need to win the battle of the mind. The psychology of racing is really important to me because I&apos;m not as big as the other girls. So much comes down to winning the battle in your mind even before you stand on the blocks. If you have the slightest doubt, you&apos;re not going to do it. Everyone has that battle \u2013 and I definitely have it \u2013 but I just clear my mind and, before the start, I say something as simple as: &apos;C&apos;mon, Fran, you can do it.&apos; I then remind myself what stroke I&apos;m meant to be swimming.&quot; This is a typical Halsall-ism \u2013 and it echoes her joke that she never has nightmares about London 2012. Halsall insists her bad dreams are limited to scenarios where she turns up to race in her socks or walks into a glass door on the way to the pool. &quot;But it&apos;s normal for me to walk into glass doors when I&apos;m awake,&quot; she quips. &quot;So I just see 2012 as a good thing \u2013 rather than a reason for nightmares.&quot; London 2012 could also be the stuff of dreams for GB&apos;s consistently impressive women swimmers and, especially, the medal-chasing Halsall. Her Olympics will be gruelling, and the need to rest and recover between races is crucial. Yet beyond the chatter about philosophy and handbags, kickboxing and perfume, cats and socks, one line resonates when attention focuses on Halsall. It was said by Bill Sweetenham, the formidable Australian coach who spent seven years in this country and was responsible for discovering most of the young swimmers who could win the biggest haul of British medals. &quot;Fran Halsall is a gladiator of the pool,&quot; he said just before he stepped down from his harsh regime. Sweetenham&apos;s uncompromising approach helped produce what Halsall describes as &quot;a golden generation&quot; of British swimmers. And it seems striking that he should anoint Halsall, with her elfin wit and snazzy eccentricities, as his chosen &quot;gladiator&quot;. In the coming weeks she will need to draw on all those gladiatorial instincts, and resilience, if she is to overcome her past frailties and produce the performances that could win her a clutch of medals. Yet Halsall&apos;s desire for a single gold medal before anything else perhaps best explains why Sweetenham sees her more clearly than us as a steely and goggle-faced gladiator rather than just a flighty and pink-suited star in the making.", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: swimming", "Swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Team GB", "Sport", "Olympic Games", "Fran Halsall"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-14T22:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/15/wheels-bmw-320d-review-olympics", "sentences": ["Foust and Tracy smashed the previous record for the largest loop in a car, set at 42ft in September 2011 by Chinese driver Li Yatao in a Lotus 5 Sportback in Shanghai."], "title": "Car review: BMW 320d", "article": "BMW 320d Efficient DynamicsPrice \u00a328,080MPG 68.9Top speed 143mph Fun Fred, the ebullient old fellow who lives a couple of doors up from me, is delighted.

Can&apos;t imagine how I\u00a0got through. Can&apos;t work a satnav \u2013 and I&apos;m rubbish at sport\u2026&quot; I begin to worry that Fred may think he&apos;s actually been selected for the Games. He babbles on and on. If I was an athlete sitting in the back of his car, being pummelled by his good cheer, when all I\u00a0wanted to do was get in the zone or whatever, I\u00a0think I&apos;d lose it. I&apos;d unravel. Whether Fred is driving you or not, you will at least be able to depend on the car. BMW is the official automotive partner to London 2012 and is providing a fleet of 4,000 vehicles for use during both the Olympics and Paralympics. If it strikes you as unpatriotic that a\u00a0German manufacturer is providing the vehicle support for the Games, remember that BMW owns the keys to both Mini and Rolls-Royce, two cornerstones of the UK motoring empire and both about as British as, well, the royal family. BMW also supports directly and indirectly about 46,000 jobs in this country, so as far as the Games go, they&apos;re one of us. All the BMWs doing the business this summer will be super-efficient diesels, hybrids and electrics. Locog, the 2012 organising committee, set a\u00a0fearsome benchmark for emissions and fuel consumption for its vehicles \u2013 a sort of qualifying performance for cars \u2013 of 120g/km and 62.4mpg in official tests. BMW didn&apos;t just qualify, it posted a record-setting fleet average of 116g/km and 64.5mpg \u2013 figures almost unthinkable for most premium manufacturers. Fred could have ended up chauffeuring a Mini Countryman, a\u00a0magisterial 520d or, confusingly, a\u00a0Citro\u00ebn C8 in full BMW livery (the German marque doesn&apos;t make people carriers so it had to add a French ringer to its Olympic team). In fact, Fred will be at the wheel of the new 320d with Efficient Dynamics. As you may have guessed, this is the fastidiously clean smaller sister of the 520d \u2013 which is itself no slacker. But in the dirty world of performance doping, the 320d is a beacon of Corinthian wholesomeness. It&apos;ll knock out almost 70 miles to the gallon while sipping fuel as slowly as a camel with water-retention issues. Agreed, it&apos;s not much of a\u00a0looker. In fact, it borders on the plain \u2013 the only real departure from the outgoing model is that the front now boasts some friendlier-looking headlamps with &quot;tear-duct&quot; extensions linking to the classic kidney-shaped grille. But beneath that bland exterior you&apos;ll find a world-class runner boasting a remarkable package of fuel-saving innovations \u2013 from longer gearing to lowered suspension and low-rolling resistance tyres to improved aerodynamics \u2013 which means its lively four-cylinder, two-litre 180hp diesel will prove to be a real handful for both its industry competitors and \u2013 I\u00a0suspect \u2013 for Fun Fred\u2026 Don&apos;t try this at home Rally car driver Tanner Foust and Hollywood stuntman Greg Tracy set a world record on 30 June by driving two Hot Wheels all-wheel-drive advance rally spec coupe cars through the 66ft tall Hot Wheels Double Loop Dare track at X Games LA. The track, two football fields long, was modelled on Mattel&apos;s Hot Wheels Double Dare Snare toy racetrack set. Foust and Tracy smashed the previous record for the largest loop in a car, set at 42ft in September 2011 by Chinese driver Li Yatao in a Lotus 5 Sportback in Shanghai. &quot;The moment when it&apos;s go time, the heart rate slows down, the adrenaline goes away and it&apos;s a matter of letting it happen,&quot; Foust said. The drivers hit 52mph in the track and experienced approximately 7Gs going through the loop. &quot;That was pretty hardcore: the 7Gs\u2026 I almost felt my chin hit my lap.&quot; Impressive stuff. To have a look at the stunt, go to hotwheelsmedia.com/i/videos/view/events/84 Top five driving test mistakes and how to avoid them According to information released by the Department for Transport, there are several main reasons why learners fail their test. But don&apos;t panic. Here, Ian McIntosh, the CEO of Red Driving School discusses the most common mistakes people make and how you might avoid them: Junctions \u2013 observations A key part of your junction routine is LOOK-ASSESS-DECIDE-ACT. Give yourself time to look and get into the best place to look. You may have heard your driving instructor refer to it as &quot;effective observation&quot;, this means not just looking, but actually seeing what&apos;s there, working out what it&apos;s doing, making the right decisions and then taking the correct action. Mirrors \u2013 change direction If you are in the habit of just looking at the mirror and not through them for the information they give you, this leaves far too much to chance and increases the risk of crashing. The key steps of LOOK-ASSESS-DECIDE-ACT also apply to the way you use your mirrors. Make sure you can say to yourself: &quot;I&apos;ve checked the mirrors and it&apos;s safe to move.&quot; Control \u2013 reverse left, reverse park Studies have shown that spatial awareness can be improved through practice, so to be confident have plenty of practice at getting the car to move slowly on flat roads, on uphill and downhill gradients and corners with varying degrees of sharpness. When turning into a side-road if you find the car didn&apos;t go where it should; either hitting the kerb or swinging out too wide, then this is a mistiming of the turning point and is often caused by being too close to the kerb on approach or not looking into the road when turning left or turning too late when turning right, again often because of not looking into the road. Response to signs \u2013 traffic lights You should scan the road ahead and if the lights have been green for some time, expect them to change. Look for clues such as vehicles approaching or waiting in the side-roads. Most traffic lights have some kind of sensor that is triggered by vehicles approaching \u2013 this is similar to pedestrians pressing the button at a crossing. If you can see these clues, reduce your speed to give you more time to react if the lights do change. Don&apos;t mentally switch off when you come to a stop at the lights; this is just a pause in moving forward so stay alert. You need to continue gathering information, such as watching the other moving traffic slowing down or stopping because their lights have now changed. However, don&apos;t be tempted to go too early on red and amber - wait until the lights are green and it&apos;s safe to go. And finally: Simply Bond Simply Bond on Sunday 29 July at Beaulieu is a special one-off event connected to the Bond in Motion exhibition at the National Motor Museum.

Bei Bei Shuai&apos;s lawyer, Linda Pence, has filed papers with the Indiana courts in which she alleges that state prosecutors are trying to &quot;intimidate and seek to silence the defendant and her counsel&quot;. She also accuses the authorities of attempting to block her from building up the fighting fund that would be essential if they are to mount an effective defence. Last month the state of Indiana lodged a motion with the courts in Indianapolis calling for Pence to be admonished for content contained in emails the defence lawyer circulated asking for financial help in creating a fighting fund for Shuai. The defendant, originally from Shanghai, was held in jail for more than a year and now faces a murder trial related to the death of her baby, Angel, who died three days after she was delivered by emergency Caesarian. The case is believed to be the first in 200 years of Indiana history in which a woman is being prosecuted for murder over a suicide attempt while pregnant. Women&apos;s groups around the country have warned that it could set a precedent in which the actions of a pregnant woman are criminalised. In its motion for admonishment, the prosecutors accuse Pence of breaking the Indiana professional conduct code by circulating information that could prejudice a jury convened at the eventual trial. The prosecutors object in particular to the defence lawyer&apos;s public statements that Shuai has no previous criminal record. They also object object to Pence&apos;s statement that Shuai faces a possible sentence of 45 years to life imprisonment. &quot;The sentencing range for murder is 45-65 years,&quot; the motion states. &quot;Defence counsel does not have the right through mass emails to publicly argue the case, misstate facts, discuss the defendant&apos;s background, and inaccurately state the potential sentence the defendant faces,&quot; the prosecutors&apos; motion says, adding such actions could &quot;prejudice the potential jury pool&quot;. In her rebuttal, Pence points out that within hours of the death of Shuai&apos;s daughter Angel on 3 January 2011, Indianapolis police themselves indicated to the media that Shuai had no previous criminal record. The response also points to numerous comments that have been reported from senior prosecutors that went beyond the public record, such as the statement of Terry Curry, the chief prosecutor for Indianapolis, that had Shuai &quot;sought counseling, this could have been avoided&quot;. As to the length of sentence, the rebuttal points out that a median 55-year prison term would be tantamount to a life sentence for Shuai, who is now 35. On Friday, Shuai turned down an offer of a deal from the prosecutors in which she would plea guilty to attempted foeticide, carrying a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, in return for the murder charge being dropped. Pence said her client was determined to fight all the charges and to clear her name. The move to have Shuai&apos;s lawyer admonished has rung warning bells among criminal defence lawyers across the US. Richard Kammen, a member of the National Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers, said that it was &quot;hard to fathom their thinking and what they want to get out of this&quot;. &quot;This strikes me as being way outside what a prosecutor should be doing. Given the numerous public statements about this case made by the prosecutor, it makes you wonder what the agenda might be \u2013 is it to intimidate her or prevent her raising money?&quot; Curry said that the suggestion he was trying to prevent Pence waging an effective defence on Shuai&apos;s behalf was &quot;simply not true. Our motion doesn&apos;t say anything about her ability to solicit contributions for her client. &quot;If she wants to send out emails asking for contributions, then fine, do it.

Prof Zhan Jiang, who teaches journalism at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the South China Morning Post: &quot;Any topics or reports that might draw excessive attention or cause trouble are not tolerated by the authorities.

Missy Franklin is not the next Michael Phelps. Nor is Missy Franklin the next Natalie Coughlin. And Missy Franklin is most certainly not the next Ryan Lochte. Missy Franklin is the first Missy Franklin. &quot;To compare her to Michael or Natalie is not fair. They&apos;ve had their own challenges and their own success,&quot; says Teri McKeever, the head coach of the US Olympic women&apos;s swimming team. &quot;Missy is definitely the marquee female athlete on this Olympic team and probably has the highest expectations. Our job as coaches is to help her manoeuvre those and help her stay true to who she is.&quot; So who is Franklin? The 17-year-old qualified for the 2012 Olympic team by finishing first in the 100m backstroke, setting a new American record in the process. She came second in the 100m and 200m freestyle. A phenomenon in the pool since the age of five, Franklin was the youngest member of the US team at the 2010 Mutual of Omaha Pan Pacific championships. She made an even greater impact at last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai, winning five medals, including three golds. That this girl from Colorado would be compared to Phelps \u2013 the American with 16 Olympic medals to his name who holds more world records than any other swimmer \u2013 is impressive, but doesn&apos;t really tell the whole story. So, some facts about Missy: she is the first American woman (make that girl) who will swim in seven events in a single Games; with size 13 feet, she has a 76-inch wingspan, three inches longer than she is tall; she holds the world record in the 4x100m medley and in the short-course 200m backstroke; two months ago she attended her junior prom; at the trials in Omaha last month, Franklin broke Coughlin&apos;s American 100m backstroke record of 58.94sec. Coughlin \u2013 Franklin&apos;s idol and until last month the face of US women&apos;s swimming \u2013 doesn&apos;t begrudge the teenager a 10th of a second of her success. &quot;Missy is really a great girl. She has a lot of pressure on her going into the Olympics, but I think she can handle it,&quot; says Coughlin, an 11-times medal winner. &quot;Her strengths are that she&apos;s so young, how much she loves swimming, how much she loves competing. I don&apos;t see any resentment towards her.&quot; Coughlin, 29, swam with Franklin on the national team at the world championships in Shanghai last year. She describes Franklin as an effervescent, open and sincere team-mate \u2013 with a few hidden talents. &quot;Every year, the rookies have to do a skit and entertain us veterans. Last year, instead of a skit we did karaoke,&quot; Coughlin recalls. Word got out that Franklin loves to dance, so the older swimmers not-so-gently urged her into the spotlight. &quot;She very coyly and shyly said: &apos;No, it&apos;s OK.&apos; &quot;But we barely had to nudge her and she got in front of all 60 of us, blasted Usher&apos;s OMG and did the craziest hip-hop dance. The funniest part was her pretending how she didn&apos;t want to dance and then suddenly loved performing. She had the confidence at 16 to get up and dance in front of us \u2013 and had the skill on top of it.&quot; As it happens, the Usher anecdote provides a good prism through which to appraise Franklin the competitor: all sweetness and light on the deck, a heat-seeking missile in the water. &quot;She&apos;s the nicest person in the world, one of the sweetest people you&apos;ve ever seen,&quot; says John Koslosky, the girls&apos; athletic director at Regis Jesuit high school, where Franklin will return in the autumn after the Games. &quot;But when that horn goes off and she jumps in the water, she will reach up and rip your heart out.&quot; A typical day in the life of Franklin: awake at 4:15am; pool workout from 5-6:30am; school from 7:30-2:30pm; dry-land workout for one hour; two more hours of pool workout; dinner and homework (this might be a good moment to mention Franklin is an honours student with a perfect grade point average); bedtime is sometime between 9 and 10pm; rinse, lather, repeat. &quot;That&apos;s a 16- or 17-hour day for a 17-year-old kid,&quot; says Todd Schmitz, Franklin&apos;s coach for the past decade. &quot;We&apos;re going into London, truly having faith in what we&apos;re doing. We&apos;re in shape and we have the physical and mental fortitude.&quot; When Schmitz talks about Franklin, it is in the first person plural. &quot;In Omaha we had trouble spotting the walls,&quot; he said of Franklin&apos;s performance at the trials. At another point Schmitz says: &quot;We can go 1:55 like we did last year in the 200 freestyle and we can make it to the finals.&quot; At 33, Franklin&apos;s coach on the Colorado Stars club team is himself a youngster in the sport. The two grew up in the pool together. And he is also London-bound \u2013 as an assistant coach on the US Olympic team. Schmitz and Franklin have worked together since Franklin was seven. Schmitz recalled recently looking at Franklin&apos;s team picture from when she was eight. &quot;She always had a physical stature that was at least six inches bigger than the rest of her team,&quot; he said. That remains one of her biggest assets (so to speak): her dad calls her size 13 feet &quot;built-in flippers&quot;, even though they make shopping for shoes difficult. &quot;I definitely don&apos;t think I would be where I am in my swimming without the body that I have,&quot; she has said. Melissa Jeanette Franklin first got into a pool aged eight months with her mother, DA, who was scared of swimming, at a Mommy and Me class. &quot;She was completely at home in the medium,&quot; her father, Dick, has said. It was love at first splash. &quot;I can&apos;t remember a time when I wasn&apos;t swimming,&quot; Franklin says. &quot;Swimming and the water have always been central to me and who I am.&quot; At five, the first year she was eligible, she joined the Rocky Mountain swimming club and won the VIP award for her age. She loved competing \u2013 at 10 she was beating 12-year-olds \u2013 and soon she had the trophies to show for it. But you wouldn&apos;t know it by strolling through her home in an understated Denver suburb. Franklin keeps her trophies tucked away in her bedroom, out of sight from visitors. Dick is quick to describe how she once left the room before NBC aired a 30-second spot on her, either uninterested or embarrassed to see herself aggrandised. &quot;She does not like any overt demonstration of the trophies and medals,&quot; Dick says. &quot;She&apos;s very modest; doesn&apos;t read anything about herself.&quot; At 13, Franklin competed in her first Olympic team trials, but did not make the 2008 Games in Beijing. In 2010, Franklin competed in six individual events at the national championships, earned the first international medals of her career at the 2010 short course world championships in Dubai, and won the breakout performer of the year award at the seventh annual USA Swimming Foundation&apos;s Golden Goggle awards. Things only got better in 2011, when she set the first world record of her career in the 200m backstroke by 0.15 seconds. No lesser a swimmer than Phelps has called her &quot;a stud&quot;. Meanwhile, she was still in school \u2013 being a teenager. In addition to Usher, she adores Justin Bieber and One Direction, loves the Sound Of Music, and travels with a teddy bear. She has a ritual of getting her nails done with her mother before every competition. School is of tantamount importance to her. Franklin has repeatedly said she will most likely refuse any endorsements, sponsorships or pro money so as not to compromise her amateur status. She wants to swim in college as part of a team and is eyeing the University of Georgia, University of Southern California, University of Texas and University of California, Berkeley, where McKeever is a coach. Her coach and her parents, however, are discussing with her how important it is to consider the monetary ramifications of not turning pro. &quot;Only a handful of athletes can make $1m in our sport,&quot; Schmitz says. &quot;We just want to make sure she makes an educated decision. We also want her to understand that it takes a long time in the real world to make $1m.&quot; For now, Franklin says she wants to stay focused on being true to her sport \u2013 and herself. At Regis, students in their junior year are expected to participate in a community service project and a spiritual retreat known as Kairos. Despite being a world-class athlete breaking records in Shanghai and swimming in Dubai, Franklin completed both requirements. For her community service, she volunteered with low-income children aged three to five whose parents cannot afford child care during the day. &quot;It was probably one of the two or three best weeks of my life, just to be there, help them and play with them,&quot; she says. Kairos, a secretive secular retreat where students strip away their beliefs and attempt to acquire a better self-awareness, was no less revelatory. &quot;You submerse yourself into &apos;Who am I and where am I going,&apos;&quot; Koslosky, the girls&apos; athletic director, described it. &quot;You get away from cellphones and TVs. It&apos;s kind of a powerful four-day ordeal; you hear peers talk about hardships.&quot; &quot;It was one of the most incredible experiences,&quot; Franklin says, declining to go into the details of the weekend. There are more amazing experiences just around the corner for Franklin. And remaining grounded is something that seems to come as naturally to her as swimming. She has been billed, like it or not, as the future of women&apos;s swimming. (&quot;It&apos;s weird not being the baby on the team any more,&quot; she says.) And she has been subjected to media scrutiny that people twice\u00a0her age would have trouble handling. &quot;I&apos;m loving every second of it,&quot; she says on the phone from her training camp in Knoxville just before shipping off to France. &quot;I&apos;m just trying to enjoy the moment and be in the moment. The media and the attention are a part of the moment.&quot; The fact that she will be competing in the Olympics has yet to fully sink in, though. &quot;The thing that really hit me was getting a text from Jack Roach [the USA Swimming national junior team head coach] that said whatever happens I&apos;ll be an Olympian for the rest of my life.&quot; Seven and hell Missy Franklin will compete in four individual events and three relays, meaning a punishing schedule that involves races on every day of the swimming competition 4x100m free relay Medal target 1 Heats Sat 28 July 12.42pm Final 8.48pm 100m backstroke Medal target 2 Heats Sun 29 July 10am Semis 8.45pm Final Mon 30 July 7.50pm 200m freestyle Medal target 3 Heats Mon 30 July 10am Semis 7.30pm Final Tue 31 July 7.41pm 4x200m free relay Medal target 4 Heats Wed 1 Aug 12.35pm Final 8.59pm 100m freestyle Medal target 5 Heats Wed 1 Aug 10am Semis 7.37pm Final Thu 2 Aug 8.31pm 200m backstroke Medal target 6 Heats Thu 2 Aug 11.49am Semis 7.53pm Final Fri 3 Aug 7.30pm 4x100m medley Medal target 7 Heats Fri 3 Aug 12.06pm Final Sat 4 Aug 8.07pm", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "USA Olympic team", "Swimming", "Sport", "Missy Franklin"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-18T13:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/20/china-uk-nuclear-power-plants", "sentences": ["A team from the Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute (SNERDI), an arm of the huge China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), met senior DECC officials over the last few days, three different sources confirmed."], "title": "China in talks to build UK nuclear power plants", "article": "China is poised to make a dramatic intervention in Britain&apos;s energy future by offering to invest billions of pounds in building a series of new nuclear power stations. Officials from China&apos;s nuclear industry have been in high-level talks with ministers and officials at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) this week about a plan that could eventually involve up to five different reactors being built at a total cost of \u00a335bn. Greenpeace described the move as desperate, while others warned of security fears, but the government has been courting China as the UK atomic programme has been hit by rows over subsidies and worries that EDF \u2013 the French company with the most advanced plans to build new reactors in the UK \u2013 could be hampered by the change of government in Paris. China has operated its own atomic plants since 1994. It is awash with cash from its hugely successful industrial expansion and sees the UK as a potential shop window for exporting its atomic technology and expertise worldwide. Companies from China have already invested in or taken over other infrastructure assets in Britain, such as Thames Water, the port of Felixstowe and the Grangemouth oil refinery. They also own businesses ranging from Weetabix to the Gieves &amp; Hawkes tailoring brand. The China National Nuclear Power Corporation (CNNPC), which is keen to invest in Britain, has just unveiled plans to raise about \u00a317bn through a domestic share offering. A team from the Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute (SNERDI), an arm of the huge China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), met senior DECC officials over the last few days, three different sources confirmed. The first part of the plan involves CNNC and another state-owned firm, China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation, bidding in two separate groups against each other for a stake in the Horizon consortium, which wants to construct new atomic plants at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. But sources close to the Chinese say they are also interested in other locations at Bradwell in Essex, Heysham in Lancashire and Hartlepool in County Durham. EDF has the right of first refusal to operate on these sites but CNNC wants to use an existing technology tie-up with US-based nuclear engineering group Westinghouse to potentially build three more reactors. The Chinese accept they would need to bring in a UK utility firm to operate the plants and overcome any political or public resistance to their plans. &quot;The Chinese have the money and the experience,&quot; said the well-placed source. &quot;They see setting up in the UK as an opportunity to show they can operate in one of the world&apos;s toughest regulatory environments so they can then move into other markets in Africa and the Middle East.&quot; The DECC was unwilling to comment on whether it had met SNERDI officials this week, saying such meetings would be commercially confidential. A DECC spokesman would only say: &quot;The UK is open for business and actively welcomes inward investment to our energy sector, but any potential nuclear operator is, and would be, subject to rigorous scrutiny through the established regulatory process.&quot; Keith Parker, chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association in London, said it was &quot;highly encouraging&quot; that China wanted to invest in the UK. &quot;They have 14 of their own reactors in operation and 25 under construction and they use both [French multinational] Areva and Westinghouse designs that could be used here. It was clear from my discussions with them that they have international ambitions.&quot; In May, the energy minister Charles Hendry told the Energy and Climate Change select committee that he had no objection to Chinese firms being involved in the UK. &quot;In China, there are different companies who have experience of building dozens of nuclear power stations on time and on budget, and so there is no suggestion that these are companies that do not have expertise in this sector. They have extremely well-proven expertise in this sector, and in looking at how we take this forward in the United Kingdom I think we should be guided by where that expertise has already been proven.&quot; But Greenpeace said the bid to woo China was a last throw of the dice by the government. &quot;This is a sign of desperation,&quot; said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace. &quot;Chinese nuclear players have state backing, which could help solve the issue of financing colossally expensive new nuclear power stations in the UK. But this just means that the money from UK taxpayers will flow to the Chinese government, rather than to France.&quot; The potential for political conflict has been highlighted by the former Downing Street energy policy director Nick Butler. He wrote in a recent Financial Times blogpost that Chinese involvement in the UK energy business could be a concern [subscription required]: &quot;They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK&apos;s National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK&apos;s nuclear technology. &quot;Perhaps that doesn&apos;t matter. Perhaps a Chinese wall exists between the Guangdong Holding company and the government in Beijing. Perhaps we have reached a level of globalisation in which the nationality of ownership is irrelevant. &quot;But even if all those things are true, it seems regrettable that in return for this investment the Chinese are not being required to halt the cyberattacks and the theft of intellectual property in which they are now the world leaders.&quot;", "tags": ["Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment", "UK news", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Energy industry", "Business", "Politics", "Wales"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-20T19:20:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/23/keri-anne-payne-olympics-2012", "sentences": ["The one thing keeping me calm is the knowledge I&apos;ve given 100% in training before arriving on that pontoon.&quot; As the home pick for a gold medal, and the first British Olympian to qualify for London when she won the world championships in Shanghai last July, Payne is subject to a weight of expectation from which she was free four years ago."], "title": "Keri-Anne Payne: 'Being favourite means absolutely nothing'", "article": "&quot;It&apos;s nothing like a quiet call room when you&apos;re one of only eight girls waiting to swim in an Olympic final,&quot; Keri-Anne Payne says coolly as she begins to describe the crowded start of the brutal 10 kilometre open-water event which she is favoured to win at London 2012. &quot;We&apos;re on a pontoon and there are 25 of us. We&apos;ve each been given a number that gets randomly drawn and every swimmer is allocated her own metre of space. That&apos;s when it hits you. You&apos;re about to start then.&quot; Payne, the current world champion and an Olympic silver medallist in her gruelling discipline, has spoken often in the past of swimming in open waters which have been teeming with jellyfish or animal corpses. She has swum in warm seas where she has been worried about the absence of shark nets and in icy cold waters which have numbed all feeling in her hands and feet. Payne has been kicked and smacked in the face by the thrashing limbs of her rivals, to the extent of suffering cut lips and a bleeding nose, and she knows what it is like to feel an opponent grab her ankle to slow her down. Yet Payne expects a different kind of race in the more placid waters of the Serpentine in Hyde Park. She is almost certain to lead from the front so that she can avoid the worst of the carnage caused by bony elbows and kicking feet. Payne, however, cannot escape the tension of the start. On 9 August, near the very end of the London Olympics, Payne will apply the last few smears of Vaseline and check that her goggles are clear. &quot;There&apos;s not much more you can do before the start. The one thing keeping me calm is the knowledge I&apos;ve given 100% in training before arriving on that pontoon.&quot; As the home pick for a gold medal, and the first British Olympian to qualify for London when she won the world championships in Shanghai last July, Payne is subject to a weight of expectation from which she was free four years ago. &quot;Beijing was different,&quot; she says. &quot;For me it was just great I&apos;d made the Olympics. I was just going to enjoy it and give everything that I had. It was only my seventh open-water race and I was ranked eighth in the world. I wasn&apos;t even thinking about a medal.&quot; Payne, in characteristic fashion, led from the start and she held that winning position for the next 9,950m. She was only 50 metres from a shock Olympic victory when Larisa Ilchenko, the great Russian swimmer, made her decisive attack. &quot;Larissa is an eight-time world champion and so it was always going to be tough to hold her off. But I was still immensely proud to win silver at my first Olympics.&quot; In 2004, Payne and her close friend Rebecca Adlington had been invited to a pre-Olympics training camp for the British team. &quot;Becky and me went as training partners for Rebecca Cooke [the former freestyle swimmer] and we were based with the team at the holding camp in Cyprus. I learnt a tremendous amount about the Olympics from that camp because we felt the pressure and need to perform even in training. That helped so much in 2008. &quot;I also qualified for the pool in Beijing [in the 200m and 400m medley]. Sometimes, in the warm-up pool, you&apos;d see a guy swimming towards you and you&apos;d think, &apos;Oooo, I better get out of the way or I might get accidently drowned.&apos; So I&apos;d move and then I&apos;d be, like, &apos;Oh, that was Michael Phelps! Wow \u2013 cool!&apos;&quot; Payne is disappointed not to have qualified again for GB in the London pool. &quot;I was hoping to get through the trials,&quot; she says. &quot;But the one positive is the fact I can concentrate totally on the 10k.&quot; A far more wounding disappointment, after the Commonwealth Games in 2006, resulted in Payne switching to the open water marathon. &quot;I came close to stopping swimming after the Commonwealths,&quot; she remembers. &quot;It was devastating because I came fourth in the 800m [freestyle] and felt a huge failure. My funding got cut and \u2013 even if it was for only four months \u2013 I didn&apos;t think I could go on. &quot;There was no way my parents could fork out any more as they&apos;d been doing that for my brother and sister and me for years. So it was a central funding issue and, also, the fact that I&apos;d almost fallen out of love with swimming. I was tired of the pressure. My coach [Sean Kelly] wasn&apos;t used to dealing with girls then as he&apos;d just trained men \u2013 so he wasn&apos;t quite sure how to handle me at first. But we&apos;ve got a good team and a supportive family around me and we worked out what I loved about swimming. I also felt I had more to give and so I agreed to try open-water swimming.&quot; Payne did not enjoy swimming in the open water and only the receipt of new funding convinced her to persevere. Yet, with Kelly learning about the event alongside her, she slowly changed her mind. &quot;It took a while but I came to love it,&quot; she says, especially after conquering a panic attack before only her second open-water swim \u2013 at the 2007 world championships in Melbourne. Initially she was &quot;freaked out&quot; by hundreds of jelly fish, &quot;each as big as a dinner plate&quot;. Payne was, again, tempted to surrender. &quot;But I knew if I pulled out someone stronger would take my place. It made me realise that, with the 10k, you&apos;re going to be tested. Questions will be asked as to how strong you are and how much you want it.&quot; Before the Beijing Olympics she swam in the Xin Jinhe River in Shantou. Dead dogs and horses floated down the river. Payne remembers how &quot;we swam in the middle and they were along the edge. Open-water swimming is like that and you have to deal with it.&quot; Payne&apos;s steely resilience, despite her beguiling appearance and relaxed manner, has been proved repeatedly. She describes her youth in South Africa as an idyllic time but, also, as an introduction to adversity and danger. &quot;We trained at the Ellis Park pool [next to the rugby stadium in Johannesburg] and that area, Doornfontein, is not the greatest. I think it&apos;s one of the reasons why we eventually left and my parents decided to come back to the UK. We had to drive past the centre of Jo&apos;burg every day and my mum would get a little uptight.&quot; Her parents are English but Payne was born in Johannesburg. Her immediate affinity for the water soon became obvious. &quot;My brother is nine years older than me and so I was the annoying little sister who used to tag along whenever he went to the local swimming club. I was always running along the side of the pool and, one day, the coach said, why don&apos;t we teach you to swim? The next thing I jumped in the pool with all my clothes on. I just wanted to swim.&quot; There were more troubling moments in South Africa and one of her sister&apos;s best friends was murdered at a time when the country, in the wake of apartheid, was caught in a particularly bleak cycle of violence. &quot;It had a big impact on us and I remember my sister being inconsolable for two weeks,&quot; Payne says. &quot;I trained with my sister&apos;s friend and she was not someone to be pushed around. She walked across a field in a bad area and this guy tried to steal her bag. She fought back and shouted at him \u2013 and got killed.&quot; Payne stresses that the primary reason for the family&apos;s return to Heywood, just outside Manchester, was that her brother and his fianc\u00e9e had just become engaged in London. But increasing violence in Johannesburg and her own swimming talent were contributory factors. &quot;For me, coming to England, was an adventure. But in April 2001 I was only 13. My sister was 17 and she went straight into sixth form. She found it hard to adjust and it was a bit of a shock to me as well. &quot;In South Africa if you were ever sent to the principal&apos;s office it felt like you were going to be expelled. But in the UK it seemed as if going to the principal&apos;s office was a way to score points with your friends. Still, I was always a friendly girl and I guess I was interesting with my South African accent. All the kids asked me to say words like &apos;cat&apos;, &apos;top&apos; and &apos;lid&apos;. I changed my accent pretty quickly.&quot; Payne made her best friends while swimming at a club in Stockport and became close to Adlington. &quot;Becky&apos;s a couple of years younger,&quot; says Payne, who will turn 25 in December, &quot;and she wasn&apos;t an amazing swimmer at first. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a bad thing because I was maybe too focused on swimming and, physically and mentally, it&apos;s taken its toll on me after 15 years. Becky was always more concerned about other people. After a race I&apos;d say, &apos;Becky, don&apos;t worry about me. You should just concentrate on yourself.&apos; Then, when I got to about 17, she beat me for the first time. And that was it. She beat me every time after that.&quot; Adlington will be a bridesmaid at Payne&apos;s wedding to the swimmer David Carry in September. Carry has made the GB team in the 400m freestyle and 4x200m relay in his third and last Olympics. Payne, who has competed in the British Gas Great Swim Series as part of her training, is unsure how much longer she will keep swimming after she spends next year concentrating on a media career. &quot;I&apos;m currently doing a journalism course \u2013 mainly as a way of improving my writing. I&apos;ve realised I enjoy the research but not the writing. That opening paragraph kills me every time. I never get it. But something in TV would be great. And then after a year getting some work experience I&apos;ll probably miss swimming so much it&apos;ll be easy to jump back into 10 sessions a week again.&quot; Before then, Payne will attempt to win an Olympic gold medal in an event as savage as it is surreal. &quot;It&apos;s never easy,&quot; she says, &quot;and being favourite means absolutely nothing. There&apos;s not one person you can say is certain to win the open-water 10k. But if I can stand on that pontoon at the start, with no regrets, because I know how hard I&apos;ve worked to reach that point. I&apos;ll be happy. That&apos;s when the nerves mix with excitement. You&apos;re ready to start then \u2013 and to swim your very hardest.&quot;", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: swimming", "Keri-Anne Payne", "Swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-23T17:07:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/24/iphone-5-launch-expected-september", "sentences": ["The Taiwanese electronics news site Digitimes has quoted industry sources saying that Pegatron, a contract manufacturer, has begun making the new iPhone at its factory in Shanghai."], "title": "iPhone 5 expected to launch in September with new connector", "article": "Apple&apos;s next iPhone, already being dubbed the iPhone 5, is expected to launch in mid-September, with a new &quot;nano-sim&quot; system to enable the device, the Guardian has learned. Sources also say that the device will introduce a new 19-pin power and control connector on its base, dumping the 30-pin connector first introduced with the third-generation iPod in April 2003. The new phone is also expected to include 4G mobile broadband capability, but only offer compatibility with networks in the US. 4G networks in Europe and the rest of the world transmit on different frequencies and so are incompatible with US systems. Apple will be the first major manufacturer to use the nano-sim card. Some operators began ordering the chip cards in substantial numbers even while Apple, Nokia and BlackBerry-maker RIM were still wrangling over the fine details in spring this year. The nano-sim design is 40% smaller even than the micro-sim used in smartphones such as the iPhone 4S, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Nokia Lumia range introduced in the past 12 months, and was only agreed by the European standards body ETSI on 1 June. Mobile phone companies anticipate a mid-September launch for the iPhone 5, and expect demand to be extremely high as present owners of iPhone 3G and 3GS look to upgrade, and those who have not yet bought a smartphone consider a shift from an older featurephone. The Taiwanese electronics news site Digitimes has quoted industry sources saying that Pegatron, a contract manufacturer, has begun making the new iPhone at its factory in Shanghai. It also says that Pegatron is making new versions of the iPad for a third-quarter shipment date. Another source in China, quoted by the French site App4Phone, suggests that Apple will release the next iPhone on Friday 21 September. If correct, that would be the day on which the phone goes on sale, because manufacturers want to release new handsets to consumers at the beginning of the weekend. Last year, Apple chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone 4S on Tuesday 4 October, and the phone went on sale on Friday 14 October. If the 21 September release date is correct, that would imply a public unveiling by Apple on Tuesday 11 September this year. Dumping the 30-pin connector for a new design could hobble the multi-billion-dollar business for iPhone, iPod and iPad accessories, which relied on the now likely-to-be-outmoded proprietary socket to connect the Apple equipment to the power supply or other devices. Apple will be keen to begin selling a new iPhone as soon as possible. Last year expectations were high that, as from 2007 to 2010, it would announce the new model in June and start selling it soon afterwards. But instead the iPhone 4S launch did not come until October, leading to a dramatic dip in iPhone sales in the July-September quarter. Though sales of the 4S and the rest of the iPhone range was very high, Cook said at Apple&apos;s earnings announcement that month that the company knew there was great anticipation in June and July and that speculation hit extreme highs by September 2011. Consumers held off buying Apple phones that month in anticipation of the new model. Accessory makers will be holding their breath to find out more about the new design. The website iMore, which was the first to report in February that the next iPhone would remodel its connector, said on Tuesday night that Apple would offer an adapter to enable 19-pin devices to link to older 30-pin connectors and accessories. But that will still leave accessory makers in a quandary about whether to focus on the newer connector, in the expectation that more devices will use those in the future, or to stick with the old one \u2013 which fits more than half a billion iPods, iPhone and iPads. The accessory business is highly competitive, yet offers retailers a better margin than selling Apple devices alone. Retail margins on the items are typically around 40%, compared to about 10% on iPods or iPads. Some manufacturers will almost certainly make adapters to let older iOS 30-pin devices connect to the new 19-pin systems. Speculation is already building, with a survey carried out by ChangeWave Research reporting unprecedented demand for the next iPhone: a poll of 4,042 American consumers found 14% &quot;very likely&quot; to buy one, and 17% &quot;somewhat likely&quot; to. The iPhone commands a substantial share of the US market, helped by subsidies from US carriers. UK operators, too, expect to see heavy demand for the new phone, whose release would also bring a new version of Apple&apos;s iOS which dispenses with Google for its mapping system. O2, which originally signed up many iPhone users in the UK, could lose out as the new phone is expected to be available through every carrier, leading to a more competitive market than previously for owners looking to upgrade.

He worked for the National Basketball Association public relations department through the 2008 Olympics, and the experience stoked a passion for FIBA hoops. The passion for PR was quite abating, if it ever existed at all. So he quit his job, and devoted his full time to making a public spectacle of his basketball obsession.

Strauss has written for ESPN.com, Salon.com, The Classical, Dime Magazine, Free Darko. He&apos;s quite thrilled at the prospect of speaking to a broader international audience, because &quot;&quot;basketball as a unifying force&quot;&quot; is the kind of touching trope that wrings water from his oft-rolled eyes. He&apos;s rooting for the United States in theory, but his intellectual vanity is hoping that Spain shows them up.

She was inspired by watching her older brother play for his local team and would join in with their weekly training sessions twice a week but was never allowed to play in matches. At 13 she joined Horsham Ladies and by 14 she was moved up to the Horsham Ladies Senior team where her coach moved her to centre half and she quickly made her mark and an impact in the FA National Southern Division. Two seasons later in September 1995, at just 16 she became the first ever player outside of the FA National Premier League to be selected for a England training session. Word spread quickly and she was scouted by Arsenal Ladies and joined them in 1996. In her first full season for the Gunners she was voted FA National Player of the Year in 1996/97. Over the next 15 years Faye has gone on to win a total of 34 major trophies with Arsenal Ladies including 3 Domestic trebles, 10 League championships, 9 FA Cup and the biggest prize of all, the UEFA Champions League in 2007 (formally named Uefa Womens Cup). She was named Club captain in 2002 and still remains it to this date. Faye made her debut for England against Scotland as a sub in 1997 and in 2002 Faye achieved the biggest honour of all when she was named England Captain. She went on to lead her country at four major tournaments, including 2 World Cups and 2 European Championships, where in 2009 they reached the European Final and ended up as silver medallist to Germany in Finland. After 16 long years Faye announced her international retirement this year after the news that she is expecting her first child. As Captain of both club and country Faye has worked tirelessly at promoting and raising the profile of the women&apos;s game and one of her biggest passions is being a positive role model for future young female players. In 2006 Faye was awarded an MBE for her services to Football. Off the pitch Faye has also gained a lot of experience working with the media and appears regularly as a pundit for the women&apos;s game on the BBC, Sky and ESPN. This summer will see her join the BBC Olympic talent team where she will help cover all six days of the Women&apos;s Olympic Football tournament.

It is on a\u00a0little world, a human world.&quot; Sure enough, the film&apos;s tag-team of Marvel superheroes \u2013 who have been teasingly cameoing in each other&apos;s movies in recent years \u2013 stormed together to the No 3 spot at the all-time worldwide box office. An expanded outfit breaking out into a wider universe, it seems to mirror what&apos;s happening to the blockbuster as globalisation continues to open up new markets. Director Peter Berg put his finger on the tumescent mood when he declared that Battleship was his attempt to make his own &quot;super-movie&quot;. Even the Batman franchise, the most grimly sequestered in its brooding on the American soul, has had to embrace the rest of the world, taking in Bhutan, Hong Kong and India&apos;s most circular prison during the trilogy. Back in 1991, Michael Eisner, then Disney chairman, described Hollywood&apos;s future goal as &quot;planetised entertainment&quot;. We\u00a0have now reached that point. This is your guide to the global super-movie, and where it might have left to go. The nine-figure norm The money necessary to build these entertainment superstructures, bolted together with cutting-edge CGI, and then promote them around the world has become jaw-dropping. In 1997, James Cameron was accused of profligacy when Titanic hit $200m; now blockbusters routinely hoover up that amount. The average budget for a worldwide top 10 hit in 1995 was $72.8m; last year, it was $146.6m, an increase significantly above inflation. &quot;It used to be it was a compliment to the audience how much you spend on a blockbuster,&quot; says Roberto Orci, writer of Transformers, Star Trek and Cowboys &amp; Aliens, &quot;Now it&apos;s something that studios want to hide because it no longer impresses people. In fact, if it&apos;s too much money, they think it&apos;s wasteful or irresponsible.&quot; Perhaps this waste factor is why it&apos;s harder to find exact budget statistics in the last seven or eight years - especially for the often-submerged P&amp;A (prints and advertising) fees piled on top of basic production. It&apos;s unclear which is the most expensive movie of all time: some sources claim Avatar chewed through $425m.  Animated Virtually every blockbuster has a strongly animated component because of CGI. Data usage tells the story of just how central special effects have become: in 1989, The Abyss used 45GB of storage for sequences that lasted 73 seconds; A\u00a0Perfect Storm, in 1999, about 500GB; The Avengers, which barely had a shot without a digital trace, 200 terabytes (204,800GB). &quot;What happened in the 90s is that CGI made anything possible,&quot; says Don Murphy, producer of Transformers. In other words: if you can think it, you can show it. The strange thing about this infinite flexibility is that it has resulted in a strangely homogenised, machine-tooled feel to a lot of marquee films. John Gaeta, who invented the Bullet Time effect for the Matrix films, says he is &quot;worried about visual effects. For western audiences, I think they&apos;re less and less riveted \u2013 they&apos;ve seen a lot of this stuff before. Indirectly, I&apos;m saying: I&apos;m jaded. I&apos;m bored.&quot; US patent law actually contains loopholes that allow studios to reverse-engineer code in patented SFX techniques; so some of the lightshows you see may literally be duplicates of the competition. Geographically noncommittal Hollywood&apos;s growth markets are abroad: US annual box office has been stagnant around the $10bn mark for the past decade, while overseas takings nearly tripled to $22.4bn last year. With films such as Tintin, the third Ice Age and the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean pulling in close to 80% of receipts outside the US, blockbusters increasingly hedge their bets in terms of their settings, so they can appeal across as many markets as possible. Avoiding real-world, present-day specifics that might exclude, or bring in awkward politics, is good: hence the run on fantasy backdrops (The Lord of the Rings; Harry Potter), prehistory (Ice Age; 10,000BC), mythic and fairytale (Immortals; Clash of the Titans; Red Riding Hood; Snow White and Huntsman), history so denuded of reality it borders on fantasy (Pirates of the Caribbean; Prince of Persia) and sci-fi (too many to list). The globe-trotting antics that used to be the preserve of James Bond have become a commonplace format, as in 2012, and the Transformers, Bourne and Mission: Impossible franchises. But back in 1996, Paramount wasn&apos;t making the latter go to Prague to exploit the burgeoning Czech box-office scene; with showcase episodes in Shanghai and Moscow in the last two installments, it is most definitely targetting two of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Orci, who co-wrote the third M:I, says writers don&apos;t necessarily tailor their work consciously to foreign preferences, but other forces are in play. &quot;The studios probably do tweak [writers] one way or the other \u2013 through expressing story preferences and not telling us that their preferences are based on research,&quot; he says. So long America Conversely, the Land of the Free is disappearing. Contemporary American settings of the kind that dominated the worldwide top 10 at the start of the 90s - think Dead Poet&apos;s Society, Ghost, A Few Good Men - are the exception, not the rule these days. &quot;It&apos;s not that they&apos;re a turn-off, it&apos;s just that they&apos;re not a turn-on,&quot; says Orci. &quot;(a) American settings been used too much. (b) The reality of the economics of it is that it&apos;s so expensive to film here.&quot; The gleaming face of the States is really only seen strongly in the superhero movies these days - and then in caricature. Even the super-movie, when it does touch on today&apos;s America, is starting to pine for the glory days are in the past: last year&apos;s Real Steel, with Hugh Jackman&apos;s washed-up prizefighter and its travelling-hobo Midwest backdrop, was as a paean to bricks&apos;n&apos;mortar old Americana as it was to its giant robots. The nostalgia was even more biting in Battleship, where a crew of second world war old-timers fight off the aliens in their tugboat destroyer when Taylor Kitsch and the state-of-the-art posse run out of firepower. The Avatar effect The plot of James Cameron&apos;s record-breaker was a metaphor for the super-movie experience: download your own personality into another body. The average movie protagonist these days can&apos;t be burdened with too many psychological traits in order to facilitate this videogame-like proxy experience; the likes of old Star Wars and Indiana Jones look like The Deerhunter in comparison with the generic personal-journey narratives that have taken over. Perhaps part of this, like avoiding too-specific locales, is having points of human identification that are universally familiar, and so cross cultural borders for a maximum box-office trawl: hence character types that seem to migrate across movies with a quick wardrobe change, like the badass-comes-good of\u00a0Battleship or Prince of Persia, or Robert Downey Jr&apos;s Sherlock Holmes, a\u00a0cousin-in-tomfoolery to Johnny Depp&apos;s Captain Jack Sparrow. Diminished stars You can&apos;t lay the blame for rising budgets at the door of the A-list: they have had as tough a decade as anyone. &quot;Stars have plummeted,&quot; says Murphy, &quot;And they&apos;ll continue to plummet. I\u00a0think what matters now is concept. If\u00a0you ask your mates how many of them are going to see The Dark Knight Rises, I bet it&apos;s all of them. Then ask, &apos;It&apos;s because you love that Christian Bale guy, right?&apos; And I bet half of them go: &apos;I forgot he was in it.&apos;&quot; Will Smith is\u00a0widely cited as the only dead-cert name consistently able to open a film worldwide. - and the recent response to Men in Black 3 suggests that&apos;s still true Though old-school deals with massive up-front fees topped with profit participation (such as the $30m plus 15% deal Keanu Reeves took on the Matrix sequels) are still around, it&apos;s more the case that the franchise makes the\u00a0star these days, not the other way\u00a0around. Daniel Radcliffe and Kristen Stewart have made good post-Potter and Twilight starts with The Women in Black and Snow White and the Huntsman, but do they really have decades-long appeal? Post-event After Titanic, every blockbuster had to become an event: the must-see, the one that sucks all of the oxygen out of the room and scorches the box office. The economics of selling to the entire globe, with US domestic no longer a certain guarantee of profitability for such large budget, made it a necessity. But, with 20 or more tentpole films a year by the mid-noughties, all pumping up the spectacle on screen and stoking the hype off it, it became a lot harder to invoke a sense of the exceptional. Murphy thinks the bottomless digital toybox has also made it tougher: &quot;If all you have to do is think of it, it becomes harder, right? Because [everyone is] trying to think of something new.&quot; With gigantic $900m mega-hits regular occurrences, few of the super-movies were non pareil events. Everyone talked the talk - but few walked the walk and seriously outperformed their blockbuster peers: in the noughties, only the first Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, the second Pirates of the Caribbean, The Dark Knight and the peerless Avatar. (Maybe Inception deserves a place on that list for building buzz on account of being that noughties rarity: something fresh). And when you can see and hear everything coming, the other route for springing a surprise on audiences and creating an event is closed: have there been any sleeper hits of serious stature since The Matrix and The Sixth Sense?  Pre-sold That&apos;s the industry buzzword for ensuring audiences are on board \u2013 by basing films on existing properties \u2013 before a single frame has been shot. Seventeen out of this year&apos;s top 20 worldwide so far fall into this category. Murphy points out pre-selling is nothing new: &quot;The Maltese Falcon was a Dashiell Hammett novel. The thing with a property is that someone has has already worked out that the story works. Sixty years of Avengers comics proves that the idea of superheroes teaming up works.&quot; But such is the desperation for a safety net, there is nothing the studios won&apos;t plunder now: the much-maligned videogames trough (Prince of Persia); theme-park rides (Pirates of the Caribbean); boardgames (Battleship; Ridley Scott&apos;s gestating Monopoly film); self-help books (What to Expect When You&apos;re Expecting); toys (GI: Joe; the forthcoming Lego: The Movie). As Battleship showed, the perception of\u00a0being a desperate cash-in can do irreparable damage from the start (the film isn&apos;t as bad as some have said), undermining the kind of insurance effect that being pre-sold is designed to\u00a0guarantee in the first place. Hermetic Once they&apos;ve got you, they&apos;re not letting you leave. That&apos;s the mentality behind 150-minute-plus runtimes, and the growth in multi-episode funfairs that have broken the elegant rule of three that used to rule the franchise world. Franchises are especially important overseas, where the familiarity factor helps ensure success across diverse markets. It&apos;s not a cast-iron rule, but sequels tend to do better abroad than in the US; in fact, there are numerous instances of America being less keen on shopworn franchises (late 90s Bond, Hannibal, Ocean&apos;s 12 &amp; 13) than international audiences. And now, with The Avengers, comes the dawn of the meta-franchise, combining four existing properties. Whatever you think of the recent franchise binge, the\u00a0level of Marvel&apos;s ambition is impressive, displaying the same kind of long-range vision that Chris Nolan has trained on Batman; film-making that strives to unlock the possibilities of its chosen universe. Gaeta is excited about a marked change from the old tendency to exploit commercial property, to exploring it: &quot;Younger makers of IP are starting to get savvy \u2013 the smartest and most innovative entrepreneurs are the ones who understand their universes go into multiple places.&quot; The future At blockbuster level, the studios&apos; approach to the new international frontiers hasn&apos;t been very sophisticated yet. It doesn&apos;t amount to much more than a stripping-down of the traditional spectacular picture, with a more generic approach to setting and character engineered to play the averages, to pull in significant grosses from lots of countries. But more deeply focused attempts to court Chinese and Indian audiences have already begun, such as Stan Lee&apos;s The Annihilator, the first Chinese superhero movie. Sooner or later, the foreign companies that are increasingly bankrolling Hollywood, such as India&apos;s Reliance, will begin to demand more creative input; then the\u00a0American values that are the tectonic plates of the blockbuster world will shift. &quot;The west has perfected making super-polished films, but that&apos;s not to say it can&apos;t be perfected elsewhere,&quot; says Gaeta. &quot;There are super-bright people everywhere, right?&quot; Technologically, Gaeta thinks we are\u00a0five to 10 years from another quantum leap \u2013 hinted at in the virtual-cinematography techniques James Cameron used in Avatar. He says that he is working on smaller blockbuster innovations on a two-year timeframe; he won&apos;t give details, but they&apos;re possibly for the Wachowski original sci-fi script Jupiter Ascending. &quot;Volumetric cinema&quot; \u2013 films projected in three-dimensional space, like Star Trek&apos;s holodeck, which the viewer would be able to interact with \u2013 is going to make conventional 3D look like the zoetrope, says Gaeta. &quot;If you want to\u00a0know what movies are going to look like, you&apos;re going to have them pour off the screen and into your living room. That&apos;s what\u00a0our culture is going to look like. It&apos;s\u00a0a\u00a0freight train that isn&apos;t going to stop.&quot; Thanks to Curt Miyashiro at Industrial Light &amp; Magic for CGI statistics. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 July 2012.

One might not have expected his Chinese hosts to welcome those words. The world&apos;s most populous nation bestrides table tennis like a bat-clutching colossus, claiming all six medals in the singles and gold in both team events at the Beijing Games. But having produced the Four Great Inventions (paper, printing, gunpowder and the compass), it appears quite happy to give Britain the credit for a fifth. &quot;It&apos;s a fact. It&apos;s true. It was invented by England,&quot; concedes Zhen Li, before adding: &quot;But it was developed in China. And now the English can&apos;t beat us.&quot; Double Happiness, Zhen&apos;s employer, has been there at every step of the evolution. Named by Zhou Enlai, wielded by Mao Zedong and stolen by the disgraced politician Bo Xilai, the company&apos;s bats and blades remain the weapons of choice for both park amateurs and global champions. &quot;Double Happiness and Double Fish [another Chinese brand] provided the equipment for Chinese teams to dominate the ping pong world for nearly 60 years,&quot; says Deng Yaping, who won six world championships and four Olympic gold medals with the company&apos;s blades. It produces 100,000 tables a year, 3m to 4m bats and more than 100m balls. And as official Olympic table supplier, it has already shipped 70 of its finest examples (usually retailing at around \u00a310,000 a pop) to London: eight for competition and the rest for warm-ups, practice and as reserves in case of mishap. Table tennis has come a long way from its origins, when squiffy Victorian gents \u2013 possibly officers serving in India \u2013 used cigar box lids to bat champagne corks at each other. &quot;Other nations looked at the dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner. We looked at the dining table and saw an opportunity to play whiff-whaff,&quot; Johnson told his audience in Beijing.An alternative history credits Jaques of London, who marketed a game called &quot;gossima&quot; and then &quot;ping pong&quot;. Either way, it rapidly spread through the empire and beyond; by the 1930s it had reached China, where a small Shanghai workshop sprang up catering to &quot;pingpangqiu&quot; enthusiasts. Two decades later, Mao declared table tennis China&apos;s national sport. Then, in 1959, China won the world championship. Zhou, the then premier, declared the year one of &quot;double happiness&quot;: the 10th anniversary of the People&apos;s Republic and its first major sporting victory. The small Shanghai business was formally launched as the Double Happiness brand, now known in English as DHS. Lou Shihe, the company&apos;s general manager, says: &quot;When Rong Guotuan won the ping pong championships, it changed the Chinese image in the western world. Westerners used to have the impression of China as the &apos;sick man of Asia&apos;. China promoted the sport as a political campaign. The government called for the whole nation to learn from ping pong players.&quot; The Great Helmsman himself took it up \u2013 with a Double Happiness racket, says Lou \u2013 and even the youngest were encouraged to play. &quot;Set up a battlefield on the rectangular table \u2026 With deep unity and friendship we promote the revolutionary work-style!&quot; began one children&apos;s song. &quot;Regard a ping pong ball as the head of your capitalist enemy. Hit it with your socialist bat and you have won a point for the motherland,&quot; the top athletes were exhorted. When the Cultural Revolution convulsed China, Rong and two other national players were hounded to their deaths. But by 1971, the game was on the rise again, helping pave the way for the Sino-US rapprochement. An American team arrived to challenge Chinese players in the legendary &quot;ping pong diplomacy&quot; initiative, fought out on Double Happiness tables. Table tennis was &quot;the one and only&quot; sport back then, recalls the Chinese poet and detective novelist Qiu Xiaolong, who now lives in the US. &quot;Those days, the top players all used Double Happiness rackets, the then top brand \u2013 at least so we learned in all the newspapers \u2026 For us, it was a valued possession, like luxurious brands such as Armani or Montblanc among the young Chinese materialists today,&quot; he says. His prized red racket was widely coveted; and, one day, borrowed by a high-profile schoolmate. The eager player was Bo, whose ousting as party secretary of Chongqing this spring was the biggest political earthquake in China for decades. &quot;That was the only encounter between me and Bo Xilai,&quot; Qiu wrote recently. &quot;I remember it not because his father was one of the most powerful Communist party seniors in the Forbidden City but because he never returned the racket.&quot; You can pick up a Double Happiness beginner&apos;s bat for as little as 20 yuan (\u00a32); but a professional level blade and rubbers \u2013 no serious player would buy a pre-assembled offering \u2013 costs 2,500 yuan or so (\u00a3250). The finest are still made in the Shanghai suburbs. Even now, much of the work is carried out by hand. Young men sweep metre-long feather dusters across the surfaces of boards to ensure they are immaculate before they are sent through a curtain of cobalt paint. The variation in a table&apos;s coating depth must be no more than 0.2mm; the precise tock of a ricocheting ball can be enough to alert an athlete to an inconsistency. &quot;Professional players are very sensitive. If the paint is any thicker in one place it influences how long the ball stays on the table and how it angles and bounces off \u2026 Every single point must be exactly the same,&quot; says the factory&apos;s deputy director, Jin Yuanwei. Elsewhere, rubber is melted, dyed red or black, stretched over long metal boards and chopped into rough squares. Workers weigh the slabs on old-fashioned scales and shear off waste with scissors; others thwack them on to light boxes and hover over them with tweezers, pouncing on tiny specks of grit they spy. Metal moulds, compressed and heated to 150C for up to half an hour, transform the lumpy, uneven squares into pimpled mats. The technology involved in making the blades themselves is so commercially sensitive we can go no further. Though they must be at least 65% wood, the incorporation of hi-tech new materials has helped to shave their weight from 130g to as little as 80g. &quot;They have kept developing. If they didn&apos;t make hi-tech rackets and tables, then no matter how good our skills were, we still wouldn&apos;t be able to get good scores,&quot; says Deng, the champion. To beginners, the choices are befuddling: &quot;Five-ply with single fibreglass-carbon core brings outstanding two-side loop spinning capacity, consistent control and attacking ability,&quot; promises the blurb for one racket; &quot;Unique agglutinate technique means sufficient power and excellent performance in long table,&quot; vows another. The Magician rubber advertises its destructive power; the G555 is highly elastic and ideal for backhand; others boast &quot;changeful spin&quot; or increased stickiness. The firm \u2013 now majority-owned by the Li Ning sports group \u2013 also diversified into badminton gear and weightlifting equipment as ping pong&apos;s hegemony gradually slipped away. &quot;In China, football and basketball are far more popular nowadays,&quot; points out Qiu, who continues to play in his basement. Yet table tennis has a place in China&apos;s future as well as its past. Researchers at Zhejiang University have been hard at work on ping pong-playing robots. For the lure of whiff-whaff remains eternal, in London as in Beijing. And wherever you find two bats, two players and one celluloid ball \u2013 the chances are that you will find Double Happiness. * Additional research by Cecily Huang", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: table tennis", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "China Olympic team", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-27T00:17:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/28/music-data-science-emi-predict-song-preferences", "sentences": ["However, in the end there was a very clear winning team, which came from Shanda Innovations, a tech incubator based in Shanghai and Beijing and a rising star in the Kaggle community."], "title": "Can you predict who will love a song?", "article": "As finales go, it couldn&apos;t have been much more tense. With the finish tantalisingly in sight, the relatively unknown frontrunner held a clear and seemingly unbreakable lead, only to find a veteran champion breaking through. And then as the two grappled for first place, in a true Cinderella story, a third darted in from nowhere in the final moments to steal it from them both and claim the victory. But this nailbiting finish had nothing to do with the Tour de France, the Olympics, or any other kind of traditional sporting event for that matter. Instead, it involved a battle between hundreds of data scientists around the world racing to help shape the future of the music industry. Their task: to develop an algorithm capable of predicting if a listener will love a new song. Not that long ago such a pursuit would have been considered utter folly and best left to soothsayers and astrologers. Thanks to the sheer scale and quality of data that&apos;s now becoming available, and to the development of better algorithms through events such as this, it is now not only quite feasible but rapidly becoming a way of doing business in many industries. This event, the Music Data Science Hackathon, is clear evidence of that because it involved the music giant EMI Music sharing its highly prized EMI Million Interview Dataset for the very first time. This is a vast and uniquely rich dataset compiled from 20-minute interviews with 800,000 music lovers from 25 different countries, recording their interests, attitudes, behaviours, and their familiarity and appreciation of music. For the data science community in London and those further afield \u2013 through Kaggle&apos;s online platform \u2013 this was a chance to show just what can be achieved when the right kind of data meets the right minds. Held in partnership with Data Science London, EMI Music, EMC, Lightspeed Research and Kaggle, the challenge was to use this dataset to predict the rating someone would give a song based on their demographic, the artist and track ratings, their answers to questions about musical preferences and the words they use to describe EMI artists. With a prize fund of \u00a36,500, we saw more than 1,300 entries submitted by 138 different teams. Some of these attended the event in person, while the rest were made up of Kaggle&apos;s online community of 45,000 data scientists. We saw a broad range of approaches, from generalised boosted methods to random forests, single value decomposition to matrix factorisation and collaborative filtering, with no one class of model outperforming all the others. The results were outstanding, both in terms of quality and quantity of algorithms. However, in the end there was a very clear winning team, which came from Shanda Innovations, a tech incubator based in Shanghai and Beijing and a rising star in the Kaggle community. As in several previous Kaggle and Data Science London collaborations, the winners&apos; code and algorithms will be open sourced. But besides showing that is possible to make these kinds of predictions, this event also uncovered some other nice gems, such as how women tended to be generally more positive than men, using words like &quot;current&quot;, &quot;edgy&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; to describe songs, as opposed to &quot;cheap&quot;, &quot;unoriginal&quot; and &quot;superficial&quot;. Retired people tended rate songs higher, while students and unemployed people often gave lower ratings. And it was interesting to see correlations between the words people used to describe the same song, often seemingly at odds with each other. The words &quot;noisy&quot; and &quot;uplifting&quot; is one example. And similarly one person&apos;s &quot;superficial&quot; is another&apos;s &quot;playful&quot;. Another consistent theme was that the characteristics commonly used by the music industry to inform their marketing, such as &quot;age&quot; and &quot;gender&quot;, turned out to be not the most powerful predictors after all. Perhaps the loudest message to take from this is how very qualitative data sets \u2013 extremely subjective survey questions about people, their relationship with the music they like, and the words they associate with different tracks \u2013 can be mined. It&apos;s a great reminder that collaboration, bright minds, and machine learning can be used to understand even a very non-technical question such as &quot;Will you like a new song?&quot; Jeremy Howard is president and chief scientist at Kaggle, a platform for competitive data science, specialising in predictive modeling.

On the opening morning of London 2012, the 556-mile distance between Miley&apos;s home pool at the Garioch amateur swimming club in Inverurie and the Aquatics Centre in Stratford appeared to be the least significant difference separating her everyday workplace from a soaring Olympic dream. Miley, who reached Saturday night&apos;s final of the 400m individual medley by winning her heat in the sixth fastest qualifying time of 4min 34.98sec, has long been touted as the first British swimmer to win a medal at these Olympics. That medal remains a realistic prospect \u2013 and the fact that Miley defeated Stephanie Rice, the reigning Olympic champion in a close and testing heat, will encourage her raucous supporters. Significantly, Miley has always believed that a gritty training base in Aberdeenshire has hardened her resolve in this gruelling eight-lap test of all four swimming styles. The cramped and downbeat Inverurie pool is a mere 25m in length, half the size of the Olympic pool which glistens at the heart of Zaha Hadid&apos;s \u00a3269m wonder of a building. Yet, in this loneliest of sports, there is scant glamour in the water. A darker pulse of ambition and dedication is far more telling. On Saturday night, however, the solitary nature of Miley&apos;s trade will be framed by noise and tumult. The morning provided a small warning of the din that awaits Miley a few hours from now. Early qualifying is usually a polite affair at poolside but a first appearance by the 22-year-old Scot, in heat five, cranked up a racket that is likely to reverberate even more loudly during the final. She took the lead from the US&apos;s Caitlin Leverenz after 150m and Rice, who has been beset with injury, trailed Miley by some distance. The first rhythmic chants of &quot;Hannah \u2026 Hannah \u2026&quot; resounded around an arena imposing and beautiful enough to warrant the comparisons that have been made with a giant wave or, more accurately, a whale in its size and majesty. Leverenz swam hard during the breaststroke, where Miley is usually strong, and it needed a determined surge from the Scot to regain control of the race. She turned for the last lap marginally ahead of Leverenz. Miley soon widened her advantage but a familiar freestyle attack from Rice, who won three golds at the 2008 Olympic in Beijing, was even more notable. Miley&apos;s delight, though, was obvious as she stepped from the pool with a grin broad enough to match the rapturous reception. Qualification was all that mattered; and the serious work awaited on Saturday night. &quot;It&apos;s good,&quot; Miley said of beating Rice into second place, &quot;but I know, maybe, she went a little bit slower. That means she&apos;s got more in the tank for tonight. Who knows? I&apos;ve got to see how these guys do in the last heat.&quot; Elizabeth Beisel, the current world champion and one of those &quot;guys&quot; in heat six, swam with impressive power and control to record the fastest time of 4:31.68. Beisel, who is almost inevitably known as &quot;Diesel&quot; in her US team, is the clear favourite for gold. Miley has beaten her once before, at the 2009 world championships, but last year&apos;s battle was more illuminating. In that 2011 final, in Shanghai, Miley swam outstandingly to win silver fractionally ahead of Rice \u2013 but Beisel still beat them both convincingly. On Saturday After qualification had been settled, the 19-year-old American suggested that &quot;I&apos;ve had a big dart on my back since last summer.&quot; But Beisel did not look much like a woman buckling under the pressure and, rather coolly, she said of the final: &quot;A medal would be nice but I&apos;m just concentrating on my time.&quot; That time is sure to be fast again but the psychological and emotional dimension of this race cannot be dismissed. Miley is a restrained and intelligent woman outside the pool but she plans to use the fervour of the home crowd to galvanize her. If she can compose herself before the defining swim of her life, Miley might tap into this support during the key third leg of the medley. She is a better breaststroke swimmer than both Beisel and Rice and it is during these laps where she will hear the crowd most clearly. Miley&apos;s easy charm has persuaded some naive souls to nickname her &apos;&apos;Smiley&apos;&apos;. But the chip of granite in her competitive heart, forged in Aberdeenshire and at the Garioch amateur swimming club, makes Miley believe she can win Britain&apos;s first medal in the pool at these Games. She also has the look of a swimmer who recognises the inspirational role that noise and passion can play in an Olympic final as she tries, with roaring support, to overtake the Diesel.", "tags": ["Hannah Miley", "Team GB", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-28T13:29:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/28/chinese-protesters-industrial-waste-pipeline", "sentences": ["The decision came hours after about 1,000 protesters marched through the city of Qidong, about one hour north of Shanghai, shouting slogans against the pipeline."], "title": "Chinese protesters force officials to cancel industrial waste pipeline project", "article": "Officials in eastern China have cancelled a planned industrial waste pipeline project after up to 1,000 environmental demonstrators occupied a government office, overturned cars, destroyed computers and beat police officers. The demonstration in the city of Qidong was the latest in a string of protests sparked by fears of environmental degradation. Zhang Guohua, mayor of the eastern city of Nantong, announced the cancellation of the pipeline, which would have emptied waste water from a Japanese-owned paper factory via the coastal town of Qidong into the sea. It is the second industrial project to be cancelled in a month. The decision came hours after about 1,000 protesters marched through the city of Qidong, about one hour north of Shanghai, shouting slogans against the pipeline. Several protesters entered the city government&apos;s main building and were seen smashing computers, overturning desks and throwing documents out of the windows to loud cheers from the crowd. Five cars and one minibus were also upended, according to Reuters reporters at the scene. At least two police officers were dragged into the crowd at the government office and punched and beaten bloody. Environmental worries have stoked calls for expanded rights for citizens and greater consultation in the tightly controlled one-party state and come before a once-in-a-decade leadership transition this year. The protest followed similar demonstrations against projects in the Sichuan town of Shifang earlier this month and in the cities of Dalian in the north-east and Haimen in southern Guangdong province in the past year. The government in Shifang halted a multimillion-pound copper alloy plant project because it said there was insufficient public understanding and support after teargas was used to disperse protesters.

Lochte was ahead from the beginning and held off challenges from Thiago Pereira and Kosuke Hagino to take gold with a time of 4min 05.18sec. Phelps had to be content with fourth spot and a time of 4:09.28. Brazil&apos;s Pereira finished second on 4:08.86, followed by Kosuke Hagino of Japan on 4:08.94. South Africa&apos;s Chad le Clos came fifth, followed by Japan&apos;s Yuya Horihata, Australia&apos;s Thomas Fraser-Holmes and Italy&apos;s Luca Marin. Despite the huge cheers that greeted Phelps as he emerged poolside, the race was a foregone conclusion after Saturday morning&apos;s heat, which had seen Phelps, the greatest swimmer in Olympic history, almost suffer the humiliation of failing to qualify, edging his way into the final by just seven-hundredths of a second. Earlier Phelps had confessed that he had not expected his rivals to perform as well as they had in the heats, but said he was pleased to have got a place in the final. &quot;I think the only thing that matters is really getting a spot in,&quot; he said. &quot;You can&apos;t win the gold medal from the morning.&quot; Despite Phelps coming within a whisker of missing a place, Lochte had refused to dismiss his rivals chances, saying: &quot;He&apos;s a racer and we&apos;re going to do everything we can to go one-two tonight. Phelps had vowed never to contest the event again after Beijing but, after qualifying in the US trials last month, the Baltimore swimmer decided to give it one last go. While Phelps has already secured 14 Olympic titles, it is Lochte whose star has risen over the last couple of years, culminating in five world championship golds in Shanghai last summer. Phelps did not attempt to make any excuses for his defeat. &quot;Just a crappy race,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt fine for the first 200m. I couldn&apos;t really go in the last 100m. I saw Thiago out there and they just swam a better race than me, swam a smarter race than me and were more prepared. &quot;That&apos;s why they&apos;re on the medal stand. I don&apos;t think the lane has anything to do with it. &quot;I felt I just couldn&apos;t really put myself in a good spot for that race. It&apos;s frustrating, sure, but I was under 4:10 three times, twice in the last month, month and a half. &quot;So, it&apos;s okay. It&apos;s just really frustrating to start off on a bad note like this. It&apos;s pretty upsetting. But I think the biggest thing now is just to try to get past this and move forward. &quot;I have a bunch of other races and hopefully we can finish a lot better than we started. That&apos;s what I&apos;m going to try to do. &quot;I was lucky to get in. After our heat, I figured, &apos;I&apos;ll be fourth, fifth, sixth \u2013 somewhere in there&apos;. The whole last heat was 4:12. &quot;So I was lucky to get in, had a chance to put myself in a spot to start off on a good note and didn&apos;t do it.&quot;", "tags": ["Ryan Lochte", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Michael Phelps", "Olympic Games 2012", "USA Olympic team", "USA Olympic medals", "USA Olympic gold", "Sport", "London 2012 Olympic gold", "London 2012 Olympic medals"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-28T18:56:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-michael-phelps-ryan-lochte", "sentences": ["Since then, honours have been fairly even: at last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai, Lochte won six medals, five of them gold, to Phelps&apos;s total of seven, in which four were bronze."], "title": "London 2012: Michael Phelps fourth as Ryan Lochte cruises to victory", "article": "After the Beijing Games, Michael Phelps vowed never again to compete in the 400m individual medley. At some point, however, he changed his mind, though he has never explained why, saying: &quot;I&apos;ll give you the honest answer when I&apos;m done.&quot; He must be wishing now he had stuck to his first instinct. As he took to the blocks for the first of what was supposed to be his London victory tour, just the seven finals to Beijing&apos;s eight, he flapped those albatross arms across his body three times, just as he did before each of the superhuman victories of the last Games. But there the familiar scenes ended. Lined up in the first of two hotly billed head-to-heads against his USA team-mate Ryan Lochte, the greatest swimmer of all time \u2013 with 14 gold and two bronze medals to his name and needing just three more to become the greatest Olympian of all time \u2013 came fourth. Whatever occurs in the six more events in which he plans to compete in these Games, the once seemingly superhuman athlete is invincible no more. He will not, now, be the first swimmer to win the 400 IM at three successive Games. Michael Phelps&apos;s absolute dominance of Olympic swimming is done. At least Lochte was playing his part in the blockbuster encounter, cruising to victory and setting up the tantalising theoretical possibility of a new and scarcely less impressive champion of the Olympic pool. Lochte, like Phelps, will bid for seven golds in the Aquatics Centre these Games. For only one of them is that now a possibility. The &quot;duel in the pool&quot; works slightly better in an American accent than an English one, but only just. For Lochte, one gets the impression that the phrase, setting up one of the big dramatic narratives of these Games, was always more of a commentator&apos;s coinage than a visceral personal rivalry of his own. &quot;I don&apos;t really have any enemies, so I can&apos;t really say he&apos;s my enemy,&quot; he said recently when asked about Phelps. &quot;He&apos;s my competitor. No matter, win or lose, after the race we&apos;re still going to be friends.&quot; Phelps, one senses, is happier to think of the relationship in uncomplicatedly competitive terms. The ebullient and well-liked Lochte, 27, like Phelps, has declared himself &quot;friends with everyone&quot;, saying: &quot;Even before a race, I&apos;ll talk to anyone on the pool deck \u2013 sometimes they don&apos;t speak English, so I guess I&apos;m really just talking to myself.&quot; By contrast, Phelps, whose manner can at times be as awkward as his gangly frame out of water, says of himself: &quot;I&apos;ve always been a person to let my swimming do the talking.&quot; In the athletes&apos; village, the two men share a six-bedroom suite with other members of the US swimming squad, even teaming up to play cards in the evenings. Phelps has the only single room. For many years the hierarchy in this relationship was utterly unchallenged. From 2002 to 2010, Phelps beat Lochte every time they met, 17 times in a row, in fact. Since then, honours have been fairly even: at last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai, Lochte won six medals, five of them gold, to Phelps&apos;s total of seven, in which four were bronze. Lochte beat Phelps in the 200m individual medley; in the recent Olympic trials, Phelps beat him back in the same event, and Lochte took the 400m medley. Did Phelps perhaps not want it enough? Eyebrows were raised when, at a recent press conference, he compared the London Games to a sweet treat after supper, with the defending champion apparently not quite sure whether to stop the passing sweet trolley: &quot;This is really how many toppings do I want on my sundae.&quot; Some felt, with an attitude like that, it wouldn&apos;t be such a bad thing for him to go without pudding. If Lochte is indeed to inherit the mantle \u2013 and the burden of hopes of US supporters, who battled the puzzling sight lines and acoustics of the Aquatic Centre to bellow &quot;USA! USA!&quot; towards either or both men during the race \u2013 he will be an immensely popular new pretender, certainly among the US sports press, who can scarcely conceal their collective crush. The New York Times this week declared Lochte &quot;impossible to dislike&quot;, declaring he &quot;has the personality of a golden Labrador&quot;. To the LA Times he is &quot;an embraceable dude who wears weird shoes, sticks fake gold grills on his teeth and pals around with the world&quot;. His three Olympic gold medals are now four, and who knows how many more he can add to his tally before leaving London. In one of those events, the 200m individual medley, he will have to overcome Phelps once more to win gold. The king, needless to say, is not yet dead. With six more events in which to compete, Phelps is still immensely capable of winning the three medals \u2013 of any colour \u2013 that will take him above Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina&apos;s tally of 18 (his 14 golds to her nine already arguably puts him ahead). But he has declared these his last Games and said he wants to travel the world, to see everything he missed in decades swimming up and down a pool.

Her time of 4min 05.75sec was easily good enough to beat the seven swimmers alongside her, but it left the way open for the women going in the two following heats, and they took advantage. Italy&apos;s four-time world champion, Federica Pellegrini, made almost exactly the same mistake. She and Adlington qualified seventh and eighth for the final, which only goes to show how fierce the competition is, and how good the final will be. Neither Adlington nor Pellegrini will start as favourite. That burden will rest on France&apos;s Camille Muffat, a woman they both beat at the world championships in Shanghai last year, but who has kicked on since. She won the final heat, and qualified first for the final, in a time of 4min 03.28sec. She was pushed all the way by the USA&apos;s Allison Schmitt, who finished just three-hundredths of a second behind her. Muffat&apos;s team-mate Coralie Balmy was also impressive, winning her heat in 4min 03.56sec. The ferocious competition was way too stiff for Jo Jackson, who looks a shadow of the swimmer she was back in 2008 and 2009, when she won an Olympic bronze and a world silver. If Adlington had been in a faster heat she would, doubtless, have been quicker herself. She was two seconds up by 300m, and allowed herself the luxury of easing down in the final 100m. But the trend at these Olympics has been for blisteringly fast heats, which, in Hannah Miley&apos;s words, turn into &quot;real bunfights&quot;. After such a quick morning session, the final will, just like Miley&apos;s 400m individual medley, be about who can recover best in the afternoon. Ryan Lochte was another swimmer wrestling with that problem. He was back in the pool, having had just a short night&apos;s sleep since he beat Michael Phelps in the 400m individual medley. Unlikely as it may seem, he faces tougher competition still in the 200m freestyle, which Phelps decided not to compete in. That could be a good choice, because the field is stacked. Lochte qualified second-fastest for the semi-finals in 1min 46.45sec, behind China&apos;s Sun Yang. Really, Yang should have had even less time to recuperate than Lochte after winning the 400m freestyle on Saturday night, but then, unlike the American, he probably didn&apos;t stay up till 2am. Sun beat Lochte in the finish, timing his guide to the wall a little better than his US rival. The very next heat included South Korea&apos;s Park Taehwan, who won silver behind Phelps in Beijing, and finished second to Sun in the 400m. He was pipped in his heat by France&apos;s Yannick Agnel, the fastest man in the world this year. Great Britain&apos;s Robbie Renwick wasn&apos;t too far behind that quartet. Only four tenths of a second separated those five men - Monday&apos;s final promises to be one of the great races of the week. As does the women&apos;s 100m backstroke. Australia&apos;s Emily Seebohm set a new Olympic record of 58.23sec in the heats, knocking half a second off Kirsty Coventry&apos;s time from Beijing. Seebohm, 20, won two relay medley gold medals in those Games. She looks in formidable shape, which is all the more surprising given that in 2011 she came down with swine flu, tonsillitis, bronchitis, and pancreatitis in the space of 12 months. She will square off with the 17-year-old starlet Missy Franklin, who was the second-fastest qualifier. Seebohm pulled Great Britain&apos;s Georgia Davies along in her wake. Davies tied for bronze with Seebohm in the 50m backstroke at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. The difference was that was Davies&apos;s only medal at those championships, whereas Seebohm went on to win seven more. Davies swam brilliantly to finish in 59.92sec, qualifying sixth overall. The former world champion Gemma Spofforth also made it through, in 12th place. Liam Tancock also eased through his heat, going shoulder-to-shoulder with France&apos;s world champion Camille Lacourt. Tancock eased down to finish in 53.86sec, second to Lacourt&apos;s 53.51sec. The final heat was faster still, with the USA&apos;s Matthew Grevers dipping under 53 seconds. Things didn&apos;t go quite so well for Great Britain in the women&apos;s 100m breaststroke, where both Kate Haywood and the 16-year-old Siobhan Marie O&apos;Connor failed to get through the heats. The men&apos;s 4x100m freestyle relay team finished sixth in their heat, and so missed the final, which will be a tussle between the USA and Australia.", "tags": ["Rebecca Adlington", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-29T11:22:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jul/29/london-2012-china-ye-shiwen", "sentences": ["This is one of my worst basic skills, but turning is a very important skill, therefore I was practising my turns before the competition.&quot; She says she is even better at the 200m IM, the event in which she won gold at the world championships in Shanghai last year, when she was 15.", "Sun won the 800m in Shanghai, too."], "title": "London 2012: China's Ye Shiwen staggered the world \u2013 even Ryan Lochte | Andy Bull", "article": "The morning after the night before there was only one name on everybody&apos;s lips. It was not Ryan Lochte or Michael Phelps. In fact it was exactly the same person those two had been talking about themselves: Ye Shiwen. The 16-year-old, born and raised in Hangzhou out on the east coast of China, became the first swimmer to break a world record at these Olympics when she knocked more than a second off the time that won Steph Rice gold back in Beijing in 2008. And Rice had the advantage of swimming in a polyurethane suit, of the kind long since banned by the sport&apos;s governing body, Fina. It was not just Ye&apos;s speed, or her age, that was so staggering \u2013 it was the manner of her victory. After 300m of fly, back and breaststroke, Ye was eight-tenths of a second behind USA&apos;s world champion, Elizabeth Beisel. And then, with 100m to go, something extraordinary happened. She swam her first 50m of freestyle in 29.25sec, and her second in 28.93. Those are just numbers, and mean little to those who do not study the sport. To put them in context, consider this: Ye was faster in the final 50m of her own 400m IM than Lochte was in his. &quot;Yeah, we were talking about that at dinner,&quot; Lochte said. &quot;It is pretty impressive. She&apos;s fast. If she was there with me, she might have beat me.&quot; There&apos;s no might about it. Ye was 0.17 quicker over the final 50m of freestyle than the man many reckon to be the greatest all-round swimmer in the world. Beisel, Lochte&apos;s training partner, had no chance. She was two seconds slower over the final 50m. It is the first time in history such a thing has happened. But it will not be the last. Ominously, Ye is certain she can get better still, and seeing as she is only 16, who can doubt her? &quot;There&apos;s much room for improvement,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s true for breaststroke I am lagging behind but I think my freestyle result is also not that good. Usually I&apos;m very bad at turning. This is one of my worst basic skills, but turning is a very important skill, therefore I was practising my turns before the competition.&quot; She says she is even better at the 200m IM, the event in which she won gold at the world championships in Shanghai last year, when she was 15. Ye&apos;s team-mate Li Xuanxu took bronze and she is only 17 herself. She too came home in under 30 seconds, with a time of 29.77. The next best split was almost a second slower. Then there was Sun Yang, 20, and also from Hangzhou. The world knew a little more about him, after he beat the longest-standing record in swimming at the world championships last year, taking 0.42 off the 1500m time set by the great Grant Hackett back in 2001. Sun won the 800m in Shanghai, too. In London he has already won gold and set a new Olympic record in the 400m freestyle, beating South Korea&apos;s world and Olympic champion Park Tae-hwan. And on Sunday morning he was the fastest-qualifier in the heats of the 200m freestyle, pipping Lochte. It is entirely possible that Sun will sweep all the freestyle distances from 200m to 1500m. China&apos;s success has prompted, with tedious predictability, dark mutterings about exactly how they are achieving it. Over the course of the 1990s they had 40 swimmers banned after positive doping tests. The sceptics \u2013 or perhaps cynics \u2013 would say that the doubts about Ye, Li and Sun are the inevitable consequence of that history. There is, of course, no evidence to support such thoughts other than the talent and speed of the athletes themselves. Surely the success of this young generation stems from a legacy of a very different kind \u2013 that of the Beijing Olympics. China has sent 49 swimmers to these Games, and 27 of them were born after 1990. On the women&apos;s side, there are eight who were born in 1995 or after. The country&apos;s success in the Aquatics Centre surely owes a lot to the investment in the sport made before the 2008 Games. Their medals could also owe something to the unique talent identification system China uses to stream children into different sports. In his excellent 2003 profile of Yao Ming for the New Yorker, Pete Hessler, talks about how Chinese basketball players are selected strictly on the basis of their height and genealogy. &quot;We go to the schools and look at the children&apos;s height, and then we check their parents&apos; height,&quot; Hessler was told by one high school coach. &quot;The method of early recruitment is a product of China&apos;s inability to provide every public school with coaches and sports facilities,&quot; Hessler wrote. &quot;The system has proved effective in low-participation, routine-based sports like gymnastics and diving.&quot; And also, it seems, swimming. Ye says she started swimming in 2003 because her &quot;teacher spotted she had big hands&quot;. In swimming, where physique determines so much, the rather-rudimentary method of recruiting young athletes on the basis of their physical characteristics rather than their talent or inclination for the sport, appears to work well. It is coupled, of course, to an infamously fierce training programme, to the point where Ye was asked whether she resented being treated like a robot. &quot;Of course not,&quot; she replied. &quot;I think we have very good training, very scientific-based training, that&apos;s why we all have progressed.&quot;", "tags": ["Ye Shiwen", "China Olympic team", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-29T14:18:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/29/olympics-team-gb-schoolgirl-diver", "sentences": ["China are expected to dominate, having swept the board at last year&apos;s Shanghai world championships."], "title": "Olympics: Team GB's schoolgirl diver given hard lesson by China", "article": "Team GB&apos;s 15-year-old Alicia Blagg could collect only valuable experience from the Olympic 3m springboard synchronised diving final, finishing a disappointing seventh along with her partner Rebecca Gallantree.

Hopefully I&apos;ve got many more Games in me to improve on this and the dives I&apos;m not confident on.&quot; The Leeds teenager, who was sitting in lessons when she was summoned to her head of year&apos;s office to be told she had been selected for the Olympics, tweeted: &quot;Thanks for the messages guys, had the time of my life out there!

Although the event had been billed as a clash between the defending world champions, Australia, and the USA, the French quartet of Amaury Leveaux, Fabien Gilot, Clement Lefert and Yannick Agnel surged past their competitors, leaving the USA second, Russia third and the Australians medal-less in fourth. France clocked 3min 9.93sec and the USA settled for silver in 3:10.38. Russia took bronze in 3:11.41. The victory was sweet revenge for the French, who lost a close race to the Americans in Beijing four years ago. The USA team \u2013 which also included Nathan Adrian and Cullen Jones \u2013 led after Phelps carved out a commanding lead, but things changed in the final leg when Agnel began closing in on Lochte, and eventually passed him in the last 50m to stun the crowd and the bookmakers. The upset came despite the USA&apos;s efforts to win by pulling out two biggest guns in its swimming arsenal. Although neither Phelps nor Lochte swam the event at the US Olympic trials or in Sunday morning&apos;s heats, the American coaches named the pair in their lineup alongside Adrian and Jones. Jimmy Feigen, Matt Grevers, Ricky Berens and the 2008 Olympic star Jason Lezak competed in the morning preliminaries, posting the second-fastest time behind the Australians. The coaches decided on an entirely new lineup for the final, sending out Adrian on the first leg, followed by Phelps and Jones, with Lochte going on the anchor leg. Australia \u2013 who had three of the four members from the 2011 world championship team in Shanghai, James &quot;The Missile&quot; Magnussen, Matt Targent and Eamon Sullivan \u2013 proved unable to deliver, even with the help of James &quot;The Rocket&quot; Roberts going against Lochte in the final spot.

The race was made more poignant by the absence of Alexander Dale Oen, the late and much-loved Norwegian swimmer who had captivated his fellow athletes and the wider world with his prowess, wide grin and dignified response to the massacre of 77 of his compatriots by Anders Behring Breivik in July 2011. Dale Oen, who was only 26 when he died suddenly in April from heart disease, had been Norway&apos;s great hope for swimming gold at London 2012. He won his country&apos;s first Olympic swimming medal in 2008 when he took silver in the 100m breaststroke in Beijing and became a national hero after winning the same event at the world championships in 2011, just three days after Norway was hit by Breivik&apos;s atrocity. The Bergen swimmer dedicated his victory to those who had died, weeping on the podium and pointing to the flag on his swim cap as Norway&apos;s national anthem played.

Bill Furniss, Adlington&apos;s coach, had always predicted that the race would &quot;turn into a dogfight&quot;. In his blunt and forthright way Furniss had also described Adlington, whom he has coached since she was 12, as &quot;the ultimate racer&quot;. Swimming in front of a roaring home crowd, the 23-year-old from Mansfield strove to turn those words into a defining truth as she attempted to become the first British swimmer in 104 years, since Henry Taylor in 1908, to complete a successful defence in the Olympic pool. But the inevitable dogfight had just too much snap and bite at the front. Muffat and Schmitt forced a fierce pace from the outset, which eventually resulted in an Olympic record, and Adlington never looked likely to beat either the American or the Frenchwoman. But she did produce an immense last 100m to clinch Britain&apos;s second medal of the Games. Four years ago, in the equivalent race at the Beijing Olympics, Adlington was in fifth place as she made the final turn for home. Yet with an astonishing burst of speed she passed the three women closest to her and then hunted down Katie Hoff, the celebrated American, to achieve a victory that was almost shockingly unexpected. The miraculous comeback did not happen again here but Adlington would not be denied a medal as she powered her way from sixth to third place \u2013 and held off a fierce surge by Lotte Friis, her old Danish rival in the 800m. They should meet again on Friday but Adlington is at her best in a race which is twice as long. On the evidence of this swim, and her world No1 ranking over 800m, Adlington is now a compelling favourite to win Britain&apos;s first gold medal in the 2012 pool. Over 400m, however, the speed of Muffat and Schmitt was blistering. The morning heats had provided a measure of the challenge they posed. Swimming early, in heat three, Adlington went out hard and such was her dominance that the rest of the field wilted. Chased only by the distant figure of the US&apos;s Chloe Sutton, fifth fastest in the world this year, Adlington looked imperious. She slowed over the last 100m, conserving the best of herself for the final, and very nearly paid a heavy price. As each of the heats unfolded, with qualifying times rocketing, the final lap of the morning&apos;s last race suddenly conjured up the prospect of Adlington failing even to make the final. In the end she scraped in with the eighth fastest time. Federica Pellegrini, the world champion, was another star reduced to looking up anxiously at the big screen after the heats. The Italian qualified seventh \u2013 meaning that she and Adlington swam the final in lanes one and eight. Adlington&apos;s draw meant she was the last competitor to be introduced to the crowd. If the reaction from an increasingly noisy home support ratcheted up the fevered atmosphere, the delayed arrival of Adlington underlined the extent of her battle to overcome a clear disadvantage. She waved stoically to the crowd and then, having stripped down to her textile suit, coolly splashed water on to her face and over her gleaming red cap. At last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai, when she won silver behind Pellegrini, Adlington recovered from a poor qualifying session and overcame the difficulty of swimming in lane one. She and Pellegrini both beat Muffat convincingly in that 2011 final \u2013 but the woman from Nice has improved markedly and arrived at these Olympics as the most consistently fast 400m swimmer in the world this year. Muffat was irresistible in winning here; but Adlington will now draw upon her admirable powers of recovery as she seeks to defend her remaining Olympic title. As such an imposing competitor over 800m Adlington should be difficult to beat \u2013 as long as she again displays the familiar resilience that was so evident on Sunday night. In a career of both glory and tumult she has been tested before. And, for an essentially grounded woman, the nature of those examinations have been surprisingly severe. After she won her two gold medals in Beijing in 2008 Adlington was swamped by fame and, problematically, scrutinised more for her ordinariness outside the pool than her landmark sporting achievements. Her breathless fascination with designer shoes and reality television, and her homespun Mansfield background, made many people warm to her as an unaffected teenager; but it also obscured the true depth of her ability and resolve. The intensity of attention contributed to the loss of confidence she suffered a year later. Disappointment in the 800m at both the 2009 world and European championships shook Adlington. &quot;Confidence is something that is so hard to gain and so easy to knock,&quot; she said then. &quot;Losing shocked me. It became mental rather than physical \u2013 which is so much harder to overcome. When it&apos;s a mental problem, nobody can really help you apart from yourself.&quot; She also suffered outside the pool \u2013 with the comedian Frankie Boyle&apos;s cruel jibes about Adlington&apos;s appearance encouraging still darker verbal abuse from the &quot;trolls&quot; she despises on Twitter. Yet Adlington claims that this adversity both in and out of the pool has strengthened her. &quot;I&apos;m glad I did go through all those low points,&quot; she let on earlier this year. &quot;It definitely made me tougher and more determined.&quot; Her competitive steel was graphic during the brutal conclusion to this 400m final. It will surely rise to the surface again in the coming days as Adlington prepares to turn a bronze medal into gold by winning the 800m title she believes should belong only to her. Fittingly the first person she embraced after leaving the pool was Furniss. He looked prouder than ever to coach a racer as brave as Becky Adlington.", "tags": ["Rebecca Adlington", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Team GB Olympic bronze", "Team GB", "Team GB Olympic medals", "London 2012 Olympic medals", "London 2012 Olympic bronze", "Swimming", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-29T22:10:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/29/rebecca-adlington-bronze-medal-olympics", "sentences": ["Adlington has swum well in outside lanes before \u2013 she won silver at last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai from lane one, after finishing seventh in the heats, and the year before won bronze from an outside lane."], "title": "London Olympics 2012: Rebecca Adlington has to settle for bronze", "article": "So the nation&apos;s sweetheart was not, this time, to get her fairytale ending. Rebecca Adlington secured for Britain its first medal of the pool, but for a nation greedy for gold, it was the wrong colour. The defending Olympic champion \u2013 whose twin victories in Beijing made her one of the superstars of London 2012 years before it actually took place \u2013 could manage only bronze in the 400m freestyle, despite enormous roars of support that at felt at times that they might lift the temporary wings of the Aquatic Centre. Adlington was not the favourite at her less favoured distance, and the race was to be won by the woman with the fastest time this year to her name. France&apos;s Camille Muffat broke the Olympic record to win in 4min 1.45sec, narrowly beating Allison Schmitt into silver. Adlington, in sixth at the halfway mark, had to battle heroically in the final 100 metres to pull herself back to bronze. But if four years of expectation may have lent the result a tinge of disappointment for some, Adlington insisted that she herself was delighted. &quot;We can only do our best and that&apos;s what I did tonight and that&apos;s why I&apos;m pleased with a bronze. I&apos;m happy to say I&apos;m third in the world, it&apos;s unbelievable.&quot; Those who had anticipated an easy victory had always been mistaken, she said. &quot;Going in to that, I didn&apos;t expect ever to get a gold medal, it was never an expectation of mine, that was other people&apos;s. Your own goals are very different to what other people want to set for you. &quot;Everyone has been just saying to me, &apos;Hey are you going to get a gold?&apos;, like I&apos;m just going to pick up my drink and it&apos;s so easy.&quot; In the moments after stepping from the pool she was close to tears, she admitted, at the response from the audience, who in contrast to earlier scenes in the Aquatic Centre packed almost every seat, and roared to a deafening crescendo as the race progressed. &quot;The crowd, oh my God, was unbelieveable,&quot; she said, adding that in the last 100 metres of the race their cheers &quot;inspired me, encouraged me, gave me that little bit extra.&quot; Her bid had very nearly ended in disaster earlier in the day when, like Michael Phelps 24 hours previously, she only narrowly managed to squeak into the final in eighth place. Though she dominated her own heat, two extremely fast races that followed came close to edging her out of the final, and meant she was forced to seek to defend her title \u2013 a feat no British swimmer has ever achieved \u2013 from lane eight. Adlington has swum well in outside lanes before \u2013 she won silver at last year&apos;s world championships in Shanghai from lane one, after finishing seventh in the heats, and the year before won bronze from an outside lane. But, away from the frenzied competitiveness of the centre lanes, where Schmitt stayed on the Frenchwoman&apos;s shoulder throughout the race, it was a lonely battle. &quot;I couldn&apos;t see much,&quot; she said. &quot;To be honest I didn&apos;t have a clue where I was coming. I just had to swim my own race. I just put my head down and went for it. Adlington had swum the second fastest time this year at 400m, but her favoured distance has always been the 800m freestyle, and Sunday&apos;s result will increase inevitably the pressure on her when she comes to contest that race on 3 August. &quot;The 800 is going to be a completely different race,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s my favourite event, it&apos;s always going to be the event I&apos;m drawn to.&quot; For the 23-year-old from Mansfield, the race was the culmination of a remarkable journey from the night at Beijing&apos;s Water Cube when she burst spectacularly into the national consciousness. An overnight media darling who saw the Mansfield pool in which she had trained as a child promptly renamed in her honour, Adlington has admitted that her newfound celebrity status was a distraction. Her form slumped after the last Games, and in her favoured distance of 800m she came 4th in the 2009 world championships, and a disappointing 7th at the European championships the following year. She has battled back to impressive form, however, and as world champion and world record holder at the 800m distance, she will start that race the clear favourite for gold, having swum the two fastest times this year. Arriving, at last, at the Games had left her &quot;so emotional&quot; before the race, she said. &quot;I think the whole event, the whole being here, overwhelms you at once. It&apos;s only sunk in today that I&apos;m actually at the London Olympics. It&apos;s going to be an emotional week.&quot; Elsewhere in the pool, American Ryan Lochte saw his dream of winning seven swimming golds crumble when the US 4x 100m freestyle team were narrowly beaten at the death by France. The result gave team-mate and rival Michael Phelps his first medal of the Games and his 17th overall, but for Lochte, who beat Phelps in the 400m individual medley race on Saturday, the best he can now hope for is a modest six golds. Earlier Briton Ellen Gandy finished in last place in the 100m butterfly final, in a race that saw American Dana Vollmer break the world record. It was Gandy&apos;s first Olympic final, and there was little expectation that she would challenge for medals with the 200m her favoured event. Gandy, too, paid tribute to the &quot;amazing&quot; crowd. &quot;I was the first swimmer out and it was so loud. You can also hear them on the second 50 which is unusual.&quot; Vollmer&apos;s world record was the second of the meet after Ye Shiwen lowered the women&apos;s 400m individual medley on Saturday with a final 50m quicker than Ryan Lochte, winner of the men&apos;s equivalent.

However, it is Heatherwick&apos;s design for the Olympic cauldron that has made him a household name. When the cauldron, codenamed Betty, was lit by seven young athletes, and its 204 copper &quot;petals&quot; rose to create one huge flame, it caused jaws to drop around the world.  Heatherwick revealed that his cauldron was made in Yorkshire in what he described as &quot;the most sophisticated shed in Harrogate ... like the Bond gadget workshop&quot;. Though the secrecy surrounding it was so complete that the young athletes lighting it didn&apos;t even tell their parents, the design was cheekily hidden in plain sight on wallets for the tickets to the opening ceremony.

Like you, I didn&apos;t quite believe it was the Queen, until it really was the Queen. And, like you (probably), I&apos;m not that bothered about athletics \u2013 but still found myself on the sofa at just before midnight, watching the athletes of Sao Tome march through east London. But where many saw &quot;a night of wonder&quot; (this paper&apos;s judgment), and a select few spied &quot;leftie multi-cultural crap&quot;, I spotted something else in Danny Boyle&apos;s opening ceremony: a country adjusting to relative economic decline. What does a three-hour show featuring Dizzee Rascal have to do with dismal statistics? Let me explain. Last week brought the news that Britain&apos;s GDP shrank a calamitous 0.7% this spring. The temptation after such reports is to ask questions with a relatively short shelf-life: are the figures right? Will there be an Olympics boost? Will Osborne keep his job as chancellor? Take a step back, however, and the view gets so much worse. In the years since the height of the banking crisis, Britain&apos;s recovery has been among the least convincing in the rich world. But even that understates just how badly we&apos;re doing on some measures. Do as the World Bank does, for instance, and tot up each country&apos;s annual income in dollars. Then copy John Ross, a visiting professor at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, and calculate how each nation has done since 2007. Over the past five years, he finds, the UK has been the third-worst economy in the world, just behind Iceland and Ireland. Up until the end of 2011, Britain&apos;s GDP has been slashed by nearly 14%. Ross dubs the UK &quot;the incredible shrinking economy&quot;. For most of the past decade, and especially since the credit crunch, it has been a commonplace to talk of power shifting from west to east. And most of the time, this is depicted as a smooth process: the big, developing countries get richer and so displace the smaller, western nations from the world rankings, and no one gets any poorer, even as they swap places. True enough, but what such talk misses out is how suddenly such shifts come about, and the loss of status that follows. During the boom, Britain could kid itself that it was, if not a power, at least a power-broker. Blair had an economic model he could hold aloft at international summits, one built around finance, creative industries and lots of investment in education. And Brown could claim to have beaten boom and bust. Much of this is now revealed to be so much delusion. Britain&apos;s new model is obviously broken, our world-beating financial centre will spend the next few years in supplication for repeated fraud, and our army of graduates will struggle to find a job. You might find all the above too gloomy; the thing is, even the optimists aren&apos;t that much sunnier. John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PWC, forecasts that by 2050, Britain will no longer be one of the world&apos;s seven largest economies. On some measures, it will have been overtaken by both Mexico and Indonesia and will be struggling to hold a place in the top 10. We&apos;ll flourish in a few niches, he thinks: finance, top-end manufacturing and design ... and that&apos;s about it. Economic decline isn&apos;t a new lesson for Britain to learn. In the new book he has co-written on Britain&apos;s relative economic decline, Going South, my Guardian colleague Larry Elliott uses the Olympics as a gauge of just how the UK has come down in the world. When Britain first staged the Olympics in 1908, it was the world&apos;s superpower; by 1948, it was merely the least bombed-out economy in war-torn Europe. This time, however, the UK is among the most badly capsized economies in northern Europe, desperately hoping to drum up some business through what Boris Johnson tastefully describes as a &quot;schmoozeathon&quot;. Which brings me back to last Friday night, and The Boyle Show. As the American academic Jed Esty argues, periods of economic atrophy often lead to a more introspective, backward-looking culture. In his book A Shrinking Island, Esty studies how this played out in Britain, as it lost its empire between the 30s and the 60s. Even 1950s science fiction, he argues, was far more nostalgic in Britain than its more optimistic American counterparts. This doesn&apos;t make it worse; it does make it different. With its three-hour depiction of Our Island Story, the Olympic ceremony fits Esty&apos;s argument perfectly. This was a very slick romp: Blake, Brunel, the industrial revolution. But all of it was nostalgic: a la recherche du social-democracy perdu. The suffragettes. The NHS nurses in their 1950s uniforms. Even the nods to the modern world, with the (well-deserved) appearance of Tim Berners-Lee were sepia-tinged: look, world, we invented the web! Even if it is the Americans who now run the internet industry. Esty points to other cultural manifestations of Britain hunkering down: the Booker success of Hilary Mantel&apos;s historical novel Wolf Hall, the massive audiences for Downton Abbey. He could have added Martin Amis&apos;s Lionel Asbo and John Lanchester&apos;s Capital: attempts to define who we are.

In the Olympic pool on Tuesday morning she finished 17th in the morning&apos;s heats of the very same event and failed to qualify for the semi-finals. Gandy, 20, is the seventh-fastest woman in history over the distance but finished in 2min 09.92sec, almost four seconds shy of her best time this season. She was so distraught at her poor performance that she did not stop to talk to the media but later said: &quot;I felt OK at the start but after 100m felt like I had been hit by a truck. I&apos;ve been feeling fine, no health issues, I just don&apos;t know what happened.&quot; Gandy may yet take a place in the 4x100m medley, if the coaches reckon that her form justifies it, otherwise her Olympics could be over. If that was a terrible start to the session for Great Britain, the disappointment was soon alleviated by other results. Jemma Lowe, who has been in Gandy&apos;s shadow a little of late even though she finished seventh in that same Shanghai final, easily qualified for the semi-finals as third fastest, behind the USA&apos;s Kathleen Hersey and the Chinese world champion Liuyang Jiao. Lowe, 22, has won six medals at international short-course championships, but is still waiting to\u00a0make a breakthrough in an Olympic-size pool. She is a good friend of Gandy, the pair having been close since the days of the Smart Track programme pioneered by the former national performance director Bill Sweetenham. Of Gandy, Lowe said: &quot;She made the Olympic final in the 100m and that was brilliant, and she had a fantastic year last year. Everyone has ups and downs and I&apos;m sure she gave it her best.&quot; The Swansea ITC swimmer swam a measured race to touch in 2:7.15 and is well capable of reaching the final. Lowe said: &quot;I&apos;m really happy to make it into the next round, it&apos;s been pretty hard for me the last few days watching all my team-mates compete. &quot;I&apos;m used to competing on the first day in the 100m.

It was a rare chance for Ye Shiwen to relax and spend time with her parents after months of tough training for the provincial swimming team. But halfway through dinner she put down her bowl and chopsticks, walked over to the balcony and shouted to the skies: &quot;I will win it back!&quot; Her bemused parents learned that Ye \u2013 barely 11 then \u2013 had lost to a teammate in a race during training the previous day. Not long afterwards, true to her word, she beat her rival again. The story encapsulates the buried but intense ambition that took a shy young girl, now aged 16, this week to a world record and Olympic gold medal with one stunning performance \u2013 only to land her at the heart of an international controversy. Sceptics questioned how her performance could have improved so dramatically; and, in particular, how she could have racked up such an astonishingly fast final 100 metres. Others, including former British Olympic gold medallist swimmers Duncan Goodhew and Adrian Moorhouse, have attacked those comments as destructive and as smacking of sour grapes. In the shadow of the row is a girl who should have been revelling in her moment of glory and focusing on her next race. Her pink microblog page is a typical teenager&apos;s, with cutesy pictures and a snap of her cuddling a puppy. She enjoys cross stitch \u2013 a bafflingly popular hobby among Chinese girls \u2013 as well as watching TV and reading detective novels. In her last message to her 200,000 followers, written not long after that spectacular performance, she observed modestly: &quot;The first day&apos;s competition is finished. The score is satisfactory. Tomorrow, I still have the 200m and will continue to strive. Thank you for your support.&quot; Her parents&apos; strategy is clearly working. Zhang Xinming, a Sports Illustrated journalist who has followed Ye&apos;s career closely, said: &quot;Her father, Ye Qingsong, once told me &apos;Her mother and I keep our eyes on Shiwen to make sure she stays grounded.&apos;&quot; The swimmer was born in Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province and one of China&apos;s most picturesque cities, to parents who had been keen amateur athletes in their youth. Her mother, Ning Yiqing, now works for a washing machine company but was a champion long-jumper when she was at school; her father excelled at running. According to Chinese media, she took up swimming after her kindergarten teacher noticed her height and large hands and feet and surmised her build was ideal for swimming. The six-year-old joined the city&apos;s Chen Jinglun Sport School, whose alumni include two-time Olympic gymnastics gold medallist Lou Yun and former Olympic gold medallist swimmer Luo Xuejuan. By 2007 she had made it to the provincial team; a year later, she joined the national squad. But it was at the Asian Games in 2010 that she really started to attract attention. Her time in the 200m was the fastest in the world for the year, while her 400m was the second best. Her sights were already set higher: &quot;My goal in the coming two years is to win in the London Olympic Games,&quot; she told Chinese media. At the FINA world championships in Shanghai last year, she beat American world record holder Ariana Kukors and Australia&apos;s Olympic champion Stephanie Rice in the 200m individual medley. Her freestyle \u2013 which has now come under so much scrutiny \u2013 was the &quot;lethal weapon&quot;, said state newspaper China Daily. &quot;What they are saying is: &apos;Where did this girl come from? She came from nowhere,&apos;... That&apos;s absolutely rubbish,&quot; the high-profile Australian coach Ken Wood told Associated Press on Tuesday . Ye has ascribed her success to the quality of the training she has received since childhood, but says her weeks of hard work at Wood&apos;s academy in Queensland and with another well-known Australian coach, Denis Cotterell, were &quot;really harsh, but ... really helpful&quot;. &quot;She was strong in freestyle and backstroke but weak in the other two. The Australian training has helped her to improve on her weak side,&quot; explained her personal coach, Xu Guoyi, last year. Wood said the Chinese swimmers&apos; success was down to hard work and keeping their weight down, with Ye boasting a particularly good power-to-weight ratio \u2013 helping to explain her speed in that last 100m. Despite the intensity of the training, he had also urged her to be confident, lighten up and enjoy her work. &quot;I said, &apos;Come on, Ye, have a joke and smile,&apos; and we got her to crack a smile,&quot; he said. Zhang said the young athlete is a polite and &quot;lovely&quot; girl with a sense of adventure, whose introversion perhaps prevents both Chinese and foreign journalists from getting a better sense of her personality. When an entire team of relatively sheltered athletes is put through the same media training, &quot;their answers or reaction at press conferences cannot really represent themselves&quot;, he pointed out. Her brilliance and drive also make it hard for others to remember quite how young she is. &quot;Every athlete wants to become an Olympic champion. And, of course, I am no exception,&quot; she said last year. But if her gold is her main reward for her years of dedication, she still has her eyes on another thing, perhaps more fitting for her youth. Her father, has promised to take her to Hong Kong Disneyland. She had, he said, been wanting to go for some time.

The figures emerge from the World Cities Culture Report 2012 published on Wednesday - an international survey which is the biggest of its kind examining in number crunching detail the cultural offerings of 12 cities, although the authors stress that it is not an attempt to rank them. One of the report&apos;s central points is that world cities are as important in terms of culture as they are in finance or trade. The report says: &quot;Culture in all its diverse forms is central to what makes a city appealing to educated people and hence to the businesses which seek to employ them.&quot; It was commissioned by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and is being published to coincide with a cultural summit in London in which representatives of the 12 cities - London, Berlin, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Mumbai, New York, Paris, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo - will gather to discuss common aims. Johnson said: &quot;World cities are international hubs for commerce and trade, but as this groundbreaking report makes clear, they are powerhouses for culture too \u2013 in London the creative industries alone contribute \u00a319bn to our economy and employ 386,000 people. In coming together as city leaders and policymakers we want to harness the full potential of culture, which makes our cities exciting and desirable places to live in and visit, but also makes a massive contribution to wider social and economic goals.&quot; The report says the contribution of the arts and creative industries is fundamental to a city&apos;s health. It uses 60 different indicators and reveals that London has the most museums at 173 which includes 11 national museums; while Berlin has 158 combined; Paris has 137; and New York has 131. Paris has the most art galleries (1,046) followed by London (857), New York (721) and Tokyo (688). The importance of public libraries is explored with Paris coming way out top in numerical terms. It has 830 public libraries compared to Shanghai&apos;s 477, London&apos;s 383, Tokyo&apos;s 377, Johannesburg&apos;s 234, New York&apos;s 220, Sydney&apos;s 154 and Berlin&apos;s 88. Paris also has more bookshops \u2013 1,025 to London&apos;s 802, although Tokyo has the most (1,675); Shanghai has 1,322 and Johannesburg has 1,020. Paris has the most cinemas (302) and cinema screens (1,003) in the world, while London has 108 cinemas and 566 screens. New York comes out top in terms of number of theatres. It has 420, compared to 353 in Paris, 230 in Tokyo, 214 in London and 184 in Istanbul. London&apos;s theatre admissions total is the second highest at 14.2m \u2013 but it is dwarfed by New York which has twice that number at 28.1m. Paris is top in terms of live music venues: a figure of 423 compared to 385 in Tokyo; 349 in London; 294 in Sao Paulo and 277 in New York. London does come top for comedy performances: 11,388 compared to 11,076 in New York and 10,348 in Paris. And the city also has a strikingly high number of restaurants with 37,450, or 478 for each 100,000 of population. The report addresses the assumption by some that the world is &apos;flattening&apos; or becoming more homogenous; that cities are becoming more similar places. &quot;What links world cities to one another is trade, commerce and finance. What makes them different from one another is culture.&quot; The report says many cultural elements shape a city whether &quot;its record shops, its large and small music venues, its libraries and book shops, its museums and galleries, its parks and open spaces, football clubs and cricket grounds, students and cafes.&quot; Paul Owens, of BOP Consulting, who led the research team said: &quot;Culture is an under-researched and poorly understood factor in the social and economic success of world cities.

Ye Shiwen flew down the final length of Saturday&apos;s 400m individual medley final in 28.93 seconds, seventeen hundredths of a second faster than Ryan Lochte, the winner of the equivalent mens&apos; race. This fact is significant not because swimming aficionados are sexist and believe that a women cannot naturally swim faster than a man, but because it is a clear statistical anomaly.

Use the buttons beneath the chart to choose whether to view data from females only, males only or both; to filter results by competition and to select the particular statistic to display.   Powered by Tableau   Swimming the freestyle section of a medley (final 100m) at a faster pace than the butterfly (first 100m), backstroke (second 100m) and breaststroke (third 100m) is to be expected, but the extent to which Ye did so has caught the attention of sporting performance analysts. Ye swam the freestyle phase 16% quicker than her average pace for the other three strokes. The average for her beaten rivals was 10%. In the men&apos;s race the average increase in speed for the final two lengths was 8%. Looking at the results from the men&apos;s and women&apos;s 400m individual medley finals from London 2012 and from last year&apos;s World Championships in Shanghai, Ye&apos;s performance on Saturday is the only occasion where a female has completed either the final 50m or 100m in a faster time than any male finalist. At this stage Ye&apos;s performance certainly does seem statistically extraordinary, but widening the data-set to include lower pedigree events shows her to be less of an outlier. Adding the results for 400m medley finalists at the US Olympic trials, 2012 European Championships and 2010 Asian Games raises the number of freestyle phases by female swimmers that beat at least one male finalist to 27. But Ye&apos;s performances remain statistically remarkable. Of the 40 freestyle legs swum by male finalists, her 58.68 second split beats almost three quarters (27). It remains impossible to say with any certainty that Ye&apos;s swim was anything other than mightily impressive, but it is clear that her performances are in a different statistical bracket to contemporary world class female medley swimmers.

We may not be able to make judgment on that for many years yet, but it is vital that London uses this occasion to turn what some see as the Olympic Village&apos;s microcosm into a catalyst for large scale sustainable urban development. London&apos;s stadium has used less than a quarter of the steel required in the construction of Beijing&apos;s Bird&apos;s Nest, the velodrome is the world&apos;s largest sustainable wooden building and there are genuine hopes that east London will fully use its new amenities. But put aside these achievements. Beijing and London have started something, and they urgently need to put that experience into wider practice to address their serious urbanisation challenges. More than 300 million people are expected to migrate to China&apos;s cities in the next 25 years. A majority of the country&apos;s population now lives in urban areas. Recent census figures show the UK&apos;s inner cities growing strongly as immigration and higher birth rates have their impact. Consider the UK and China as bookends on the shelf of fossil-fuelled industrial revolution. As China wrestles with being the last major economy to industrialise on the back of fossil fuels, it aims to jump to a new shelf of what it would call harmonious urbanisation. It was no coincidence that sustainable cities were high on the agenda as some of the most senior business leaders from China and the UK gathered at the government hosted UK China Business Day that took place just before the Olympics opening ceremony. I was speaking on a panel with the chairman of Central China Real Estate and the CEO and chairman of China&apos;s Neusoft, both of which are active in urban projects. And it soon became clear to us that the Olympic connection is apt: the primary motivation for sustainable cities is raw competition. In a world of mobile capital and labour, cities are competing for talent and investment. The rate of urbanisation in the UK, China and elsewhere will intensify that competition. The winners of this sport will be those cities that succeed on not just one, but on three attributes: their liveability, their commercial attractiveness and their environmental performance. This is a triathlon. So what are the essential ingredients of success? First, a competitive and sustainable city must be citizen centric. That means treating growing populations not as a burden on services and infrastructure, but as a source of investment that must be served with the best environment, opportunities and amenities. Second, collaboration between all players will be critical. Market forces must be aligned with public sector goals. Investors must be supported, particularly if we are to encourage the application of risky immature technologies. Value chains in areas such as electric vehicle infrastructure need to be carefully constructed. And, in Asia in particular, there will need to be greater alignment between national and city strategies, which are often developed separately. Finally, these cities must be powered by technology, but not dominated by it. Knowledge and insight are critical to making cities intelligent. Opening up unused data to creative third parties, for instance, can create service innovation that delights and impresses residents; and open platforms will be the foundation on which the greater collaboration I&apos;ve argued for will come to life. It goes without saying we also need strong leadership and vision that starts with the competitive potential of a city and which never forgets that the best talent and investors have choices as to where to go. There&apos;s much talk of the legacy of the Olympics. The wider city&apos;s long-term sustainability would surely be an appropriate one. China&apos;s scale and growth provide the world with extraordinary urban laboratories. Beijing and London should use their shared Olympic experience, and their growing commercial relationship to extend sustainable innovation in their respective cities.

Don&apos;t call it a comeback. It was the 20th Olympic medal of his career, which is as many as, to pluck one example from several, India have won in 112 years of competition. It was also his 16th gold. No one else has even made it into double figures. Staggering as they are, such numbers alone tell little of the story. Phelps had already lost the two individual finals he was competing in at the Games, beaten by Lochte in the 400m IM last Saturday night, and by South Africa&apos;s Chad le Clos in the final of the 200m butterfly on Tuesday. The one gold he had won came in the 4x200m freestyle relay, when his three team-mates, Lochte among them, gave him such a large advantage that he could coast to victory in much the same way that he looked to be coasting through these Games. Until Thursday night, that is. Phelps&apos;s time was 1min 54.27sec, the third-quickest in history. Only he and Lochte have gone faster, and that was in the final of this same event at the world championships in Shanghai last year. Lochte was quicker off the blocks but Phelps beat him to the turn in the fly, and again in the backstroke. At that point he was two-tenths inside Lochte&apos;s world record. Phelps beat him in the breaststroke leg too. Lochte came back at him hard in the final 50m of freestyle, but not hard enough. It has been a good 24 hours for Phelps. On Wednesday night he took a call from Barack Obama. The first he knew about was when he picked up his phone and was told to &quot;please hold for the president&quot;. He would not reveal what they had talked about, only that Obama had signed off by saying &quot;Tell your Mum I said &apos;Hi&apos;.&quot; Where do you go from there? Phelps has, in all likelihood, two competitive races left. On Friday night he will go in the 100m butterfly, against one old rival in Milorad Cavic and one young one in Le Clos. Five minutes after he had stepped down from the top of the podium he was back in the pool swimming in the semi-finals. He destroyed the field in that too, finishing in 50.86sec. It was the fastest time in the world this year, the eighth-quickest in history, and more than half a second better than anyone else. After that, on Saturday night, he will surely get one final send-off in the 4x100m medley relay. He is not going quietly. Lochte had an even tougher task. He was trying to double up in the 200m backstroke and the medley. Caught between the two, he did not swim as well as he was can in either. He finished third in the backstroke, behind his team-mate Tyler Clary and Japan&apos;s Ryosuke Irie. Clary, funnily enough, would have been attempting the same double himself if he had not finished third to Lochte and Phelps at the US Trials. As it was, he had the advantage of a light schedule, and it showed. Lochte lead for the first 150m but Clary powered past him in the final 25m. Irie, the consummate technician who trains with a bottle of water balanced on his head to minimise unnecessary movement, eased past him too. Clary finished in an Olympic record of 1:53.41, .43 ahead of Lochte. Until now Clary had been in the headlines only for calling out Phelps as &quot;somebody that has basically been asking to get beat for the longest time&quot;. Turns out he was wrong about that. After the finish, Lochte looked over and said to him simply &quot;good job&quot;. There were just 29 minutes between Lochte&apos;s two races, and he spent them swimming lazy lengths in the dive pool. Similar feats have been done before \u2013 Germany&apos;s Kornelia Ender won the 100m butterfly and the 200m freestyle in the space of just 27 minutes in 1976. But this was far from Lochte&apos;s ideal preparation. He normally likes to spend his time shooting the breeze. He tends to talk a lot in the call room, and has had to get used to the fact no one wants to talk back to him because they are all so focused on the race ahead. Lochte has never been that way. Lochte&apos;s father, Steve, tells a story about how once, at a state championships in 2001, his son went missing before a big final. Frantic, he found him in a nearby gym, shooting hoops in his racing suit. Steve bawled his son out. &quot;I said, &apos;Ryan, what the heck are you doing? You&apos;re up in the next heat!&apos;&quot; Lochte replied: &quot;One more shot, Dad.&quot; He makes the basket, says &quot;Yeah!&quot; grabs his cap and goggles and runs out of the gym. Lochte won the race by more than 10sec, in a personal best. Lochte has won five medals at these Olympics, two golds, two silvers and one bronze. Added to those he won in Athens and Beijing, it gives him a tally of 11. But after this week, there is no doubt: he will go down as the second-greatest swimmer of his generation, behind only the greatest of all time.

The three swimmers crouched on the start blocks, waiting for the signal. This was the biggest moment of their lives, something they had been training for, dreaming about, for, in one case, almost two months; the first heat of the first round of the women&apos;s 50m freestyle. In lane three was Masempe Theko from Lesotho, who only found out she was coming to compete in London in June. In the next lane stood Nafissatou Moussa Adamou, a 14-year-old from Niger, and, with a personal best over a second quicker than her rivals, the clear favourite. Last, and least in stature, was Adzo Kpossi, from Togo. Aged 13 years and six months, she was the youngest athlete in the 2012 Olympics. Adamou was first into the pool, but the 14-year-old soon slipped behind Kpossi, who swam a strong first 25m. Theko, somehow, took well over a second to react to the gun, almost as though she didn&apos;t actually want to get in at all. Which may not have been so far from the truth, given that afterwards she said her main emotion was relief at having got the whole thing over with. With a start like that, she was always going to struggle. Up ahead of her though, the two young teens were having a titanic battle. Kpossi still had the lead until the final 10m, when Adamou&apos;s extra year&apos;s worth of training just began to show. She sneaked ahead to touch the wall .36sec ahead of Kpossi. The winning time? 37.29sec, some 14 seconds behind the German swimmer Britta Steffan&apos;s world record. Adamou didn&apos;t stop in the mixed zone to talk to the press, but marched purposefully past to the warm-down pool, mindful of the fact that as at this stage she was leading the entire field of 73 swimmers and that she should prepare herself for the semi-finals. Sadly, her final position was 71st, Kipossi was 72nd, Theko 73rd. But each of the three knocked more than five seconds off their personal bests. Theko, in fact, improved hers by over seven seconds, an improvement to rival that of Ye Shiwen. Kpossi did stop, and she struck a strikingly professional tone with the press. &quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; she explained in flawless English, &quot;but I don&apos;t speak English.&quot; Moments later she was correcting the bad grammar of one middle-aged man&apos;s pidgin-French. Was she excited just to be here? &quot;No, no, no&quot; she said, stamping her foot. &quot;I am used to it. I went to the world championships in Shanghai last year, so this wasn&apos;t my first time swimming in a big pool.&quot; It was almost a little diva-ish, until you remembered that even a 13-year-old can spot the press&apos;s attempts to patronise them. Yes, she said, she trains at the one pool in her part of the country, at the Hotel Mercure in Sarakawa. No, we didn&apos;t need to sympathise with her, because it is really quite a nice place to practise. And with that, she broke into giggles and scampered off down the corridor, arm-in-arm with her 19-year-old friend and fellow swimmer, Assita Tour\u00e9 from the Ivory Coast. By that point, Theko had just about made it out of the pool. She finished in 42.35sec. Never mind how that measures up next to the 50m world record, it&apos;s less than 10 seconds quicker than Steffan&apos;s time for the 100m. Theko, 25, was one of the sweetest, most charming athletes ever to talk to the press. She gave us a scoop, of sorts, by announcing her retirement from professional swimming. Or rather, competitive swimming. By her own admission, there was nothing that professional about what she was doing. Theko is an HR consultant. She had done a little swimming in the past, but gave it up five years ago. Like Kipossi, she too had been given an unexpected call up to the world championships in Shanghai last year, where, again, she came last. And that, she thought, was that. She gave up training and went back to work. Then one day in June a letter landed on her doormat. It told her she had been selected for London 2012. &quot;It was a big shock. I was like &apos;Umm, Okaay&apos;. It took a while to sink in, but eventually I had to admit that &apos;OK, I had better go and do some training,&apos; because the whole country was going: &quot;Yeah, we&apos;ve got a swimmer in the Olympics!&quot; At first she was worried her boss would cause &quot;a big hullabaloo&quot; about giving her the time off, but actually, &quot;he was very supportive&quot;. Too supportive, almost. Like a lot of other people in Lesotho, he began to get very excited about her chances. The Lesotho Times ran a story on her under the somewhat optimistic headline &apos;Lesotho Eyes Olympic Medal in Swimming&apos;. It pointed out that Theko&apos;s personal best &quot;is 49 seconds and 75 mini-seconds&quot;, and that &quot;should she win her heat she will be up against the world&apos;s greatest and fastest Dutch 50-metre freestyler Ranomi Kromowidjojo&quot;, whose own PB of 24.10sec was merely twice as quick. Even the partisan local press had to concede that &quot;Theko&apos;s weight might also not be on her side as she has gained more kilos since her last official international competition in September last year.&quot; She had, it would be fair to say, a build that gave us all hope that we could still be Olympians. But then she had only been training for a few weeks, in the mornings before she went to work. She got a little more done during a team training camp in Wrexham. &quot;It has been nerve-racking,&quot; Theko said with a smile. &quot;Part of me wishes I could go and do it again and do it properly, but 60% of me is just relieved it is over. Mainly I wish I could have done better. But it is over now, I can&apos;t do anything about it.&quot; She had loved the &quot;whole spirit and buzz&quot; of the Olympic Park, and had done some star-spotting. &quot;But I am too shy to go and say hello. I saw Ryan Lochte the other day, and Sun Yang, and I wanted to go and ask for their autographs but I was too shy.&quot; Now, Theko says she will go back to Lesotho, the &quot;beautiful mountain kingdom&quot;, as she calls it, take up her day job again and &quot;just enjoy that I have been here&quot;. Unlike Kipossi and Adamou, Theko thinks her swimming days are over. She did not beat Kromowidjojo, or even Kipossi, but she is an Olympian. And no one can take that away from her.", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: swimming", "Swimming", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-03T13:34:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/aug/03/world-cities-culture-summit-report", "sentences": ["His comments came in the keynote address of the World Cities Culture Summit on 1 August at London&apos;s City Hall, which saw the launch of the World Cities Culture Report 2012, an international survey analysing the range of cultural assets and activities that are produced and consumed in 12 major cities: Berlin, Istanbul, Johannesburg, London, Mumbai, New York, Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo.", "Professor Huang, vice-president of Shanghai Theatre Academy touched on how the city embeds culture in public policy via a five-year development plan that aims to use culture as a way of positioning the city as a global metropolis by 2020."], "title": "World Cities Culture: a tale of 12 cities", "article": "What makes a world city? According to British Museum director Neil MacGregor, it&apos;s not cultural integration in London&apos;s case, but a determined fostering of diversity. His comments came in the keynote address of the World Cities Culture Summit on 1 August at London&apos;s City Hall, which saw the launch of the World Cities Culture Report 2012, an international survey analysing the range of cultural assets and activities that are produced and consumed in 12 major cities: Berlin, Istanbul, Johannesburg, London, Mumbai, New York, Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. The report, produced by BOP consulting, is a substantial body of knowledge, packed full of revealing statistics and newly gathered data as well as pen portraits of each city alongside commentary to contextualise the findings. Its conclusion: that alongside finance and commerce, culture is the defining cornerstone that establishes a city as a powerhouse within the global economic system. The crux of the summit was MacGregor&apos;s compelling keynote. The British Museum is currently the most visited museum in the UK, attracting more than 5.8 million visitors in the past year. While some might say the British Museum was born out of empire, we were reminded how the museum was established as a consequence of the first global economy in the mid-18th century as a place where any global citizen can visit to gain insight on the interconnected network of human cultures throughout history. World cities are able to support the widest range of cultural activity because of their scale and diversity of people. Instead of forcing cultural integration, suggested MacGregor, London fosters diversity, enabling multiple cultural heritage identities to co-exist, producing art that is unique yet none-the-less inherently British. Hybridised art forms then emerge when ideas are blended together fuelled by their constantly changing populations and international connections \u2013 this forward-thinking approach is not a new argument but one that is more likely to succeed if universally embraced. MacGregor&apos;s words resonate in the context of London 2012. The opening ceremony of the Olympics was a celebration of the rich and continuously evolving nature of our cultural landscape. London is proudly portraying itself as a dynamic and heterogeneous environment where innovation thrives. MacGregor also emphasised that having a strong leader who enables a city to be cosmopolitan is crucial \u2013 commercial exchange and cultural exchange go hand in hand and it is the leader of a world city who lies at the helm of these transactions. Even if he gets stuck on a zip-wire from time to time. Boris Johnson wasn&apos;t there to personally enjoy the summit but MacGregor did show us a colourful PowerPoint slide show that included the Tower of Babel, ancient Vienna and images of the London mayor juxtaposed with other historical leader figures. It went down a treat with delegates and removed the impression that this event was simply a cheer-leading exercise. The ensuring plenary sessions reflected the nuances of different national cultural policies. Dr Bilgili, director of Istanbul&apos;s provincial directorate of culture and tourism acknowledged the challenge of balancing tradition with modernity and ensuring that both are valued in the context of Istanbul&apos;s young dynamic population and its rich history and architecture. Kate Levin, commissioner from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs explained the heavy investment in the arts and culture is most likely to be sustained through continued public-private investment and endowments from wealthy philanthropists. Professor Huang, vice-president of Shanghai Theatre Academy touched on how the city embeds culture in public policy via a five-year development plan that aims to use culture as a way of positioning the city as a global metropolis by 2020. Culture is viewed as a source of cohesion in China&apos;s rapidly changing environment. Rachel Healy, head of culture for the city of Sydney, highlighted they have more festivals and events than any other &apos;World City&apos; and this boosts other economic areas, for instance outdoor dining, in Australia&apos;s rich informal culture. And Yusaku Imamura from Tokyo Metropolitan Government explained how the 2011 Japanese earthquake prompted a reappraisal of values and culture to be put at the heart of its future revival as reflected in its cultural infrastructure and participation. Delegates to the summit arrived a day earlier to sample the treasures of London&apos;s cultural sector. Their itinerary included tours of the Royal Opera House and the fantastic Thomas Heatherwick exhibition at the V&amp;A. Invited guests on the day included the great and good of London&apos;s flagship art institutions, including the Royal Opera House, National Portrait Gallery, National Theatre and the London 2012 Festival. London based arts organisations will be able to see where they feature in the World Cities report and which matrices they contribute to. For instance London has over 1,000 museums and art galleries \u2013 more than the other world cities surveyed \u2013 and the highest level of attendance. Public participation in the arts is a key strength of the capital reflected across engagement with libraries, film and performance. Arts organisations now need to come together to absorb and reflect upon the findings and perhaps use as a goal post for future activities. The summit signalled a desire to cement closer co-operation between the partner cities and there was also talk of expanding the membership of the forum to other world cities wishing to join. The intention is to update the data every three years and rotate future summits between forum members. In the meantime global culture will continue to be shaped by world cities, each with their own individual strengths and each serving as inspiration to the others.

Matthew Brittain, Sizwe Ndlovu, John Smith and James Thompson came from behind to snatch the title from favourites Britain and Denmark and win their country its first rowing gold. 3 A blind man claimed the first world record of London 2012 when South Korean Im Dong-hyun won the men&apos;s archery ranking round at Lord&apos;s. Im Dong-hyun, who is registered as blind, broke his own 72-arrow mark of 696 by three points and also contributed to the record in the team shoot.

The 29-year-old 10 metre air rifle shooter from Malaysia finished 34th overall, shooting 392 targets out of 400. 9 On Monday, 15-year-old Ruta Meilutyte from Lithuania defeated a vastly more experienced field to win the women&apos;s 100m breaststroke title. Meilutyte attends the same Plymouth school as British diver Tom Daley. 10 Kayla Harrison, who has spoken out about the years of sexual abuse she suffered, won gold in the women&apos;s judo under 78kg division. In doing so, the 22-year-old became the first American to take a judo gold. 11 Last Wednesday saw Japan&apos;s Kohei Uchimura take gold in the men&apos;s all-round gymnastics with a score of 92.690 points. Four years after winning silver in the same event, the 23-year-old cemented his reputation as the greatest male gymnast in the world. 12 Swimmer Adzo Kpossi, at 13 the youngest athlete in the 2012 Olympics, competed in the 50m freestyle. Kpossi, from Togo, knocked five seconds off her personal best in the 50m freestyle, but came 72nd. Asked if she was excited, Kpossi said, stamping her foot: &quot;No, no, no. I am used to it.

The drawing together of 204 long-stemmed and flaming petals seemed to prompt a collective gasp of delight across the UK \u2013 for its symbolism as well as its technical grace. It was the perfect summation of what had already been a remarkably inventive show, and a powerful reminder to the rest of the world of one of the greatest strengths of this tiny isle: our creativity. Thomas Heatherwick has form in this regard. The survey of his work currently on show in the V&amp;A is not only testament to his personal talent, and to his studio&apos;s breadth, ingenuity and skill, but also to the amount of projects he has completed worldwide. Sir John Sorrell, an ambassador for the UK creative industries, recently half-joked that the &apos;seed cathedral&apos; pavilion Heatherwick designed for the Shanghai Expo last year is almost entirely responsible for China realising the UK is, rather than a nation of stuffy afternoon tea-drinkers, a highly creative place. This reputation for creativity, design and innovation is incredibly important; not just because it feels good but because it makes us competitive. It is one of the few things that still distinguishes us on a world stage, allows us to compete with vastly larger and better resourced nations, and keeps us ahead of the game. This is not new \u2013 from Brunel and the invention of industrialisation alluded to in Boyle&apos;s ceremony, to the first ever Great Exhibition, to the William Morrises of the early 20th century, to the swinging sixties, to the first city-wide design festival in London, the UK has been known for its design innovation. And it is not a false reputation. We really are very good at design, which in turn powers the other creative industries. If this is hard to visualise, try imagining how the rest of the Olympic ceremony would have gone without design input: the landscape and set, the costumes, the soundtrack, the digital displays and films, the torch \u2013 all the product of different creative disciplines, but all dependent on design. Beyond the creative industries, design adds value all over the place, not least in manufacturing. You can see this in the number of global car companies that base their design functions in the UK: JLR, Nissan, Ford, Tata, as well as the home grown brands \u2013 Bentley, Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce. But, as we have learned with sporting prowess, you get out what you put in. Invest enough money in the late 1990s, and in 2012 you have a Tour de France champion. The same is true with design and the other creative industries it supports. We are good at the moment because we&apos;ve had a great creative education system over the last 50 years, a solid manufacturing base (though many people will try and insist otherwise) and an open and permissive business environment, all set within a very socially liberal context. But we cannot be complacent. It would be a shame if reinvesting in our creativity had to be prompted by some form of national design sector &apos;failure&apos; \u2013 just as it took the British Olympic squad&apos;s poor performance at the 1996 Games in Atlanta to kick start policymakers into providing appropriate (and, in some disciplines, world-leading) levels of funding for British athletes. Only a fool would believe that other rapidly industrialising nations aren&apos;t desperately seeking to move up the industrial scale. There is no reason why China would want to remain the home of low-value manufacturing. They are explicitly seeking to upgrade from &apos;Made in China&apos; to &apos;Designed in China&apos; \u2013 hundreds of design schools are flowering at the instigation of the Chinese government. What is worrying, then, is the very real possibility that in the UK we underrate our skills in this area, underinvest, and risk undermining one of our greatest assets. Our politicians are unfortunately the worst culprits. It was allegedly almost impossible to get a British politician to turn up and represent (take credit for) the UK at the Shanghai Expo. There is scant evidence that Osborne&apos;s 2011 budget statement, in which he committed to economic recovery through a &apos;March of the Makers&apos;, has any real policy to back it up. In fact we have no long term design policy or strategy at all. We are potentially on the verge of removing art and design as statutory curriculum subjects at school; they are already excluded as qualifying subjects for the English Baccalaureate, the new gold standard for achievement at GCSE. It is becoming more and more expensive to train in these subjects at university. Designers&apos; IP is not protected in the same way as other industries \u2013 design infringement carries no criminal sanction. Too few businesses (and government departments) understand the real value of design, as a fundamental process and strategic asset, rather than a logo, or some nice cushions. And it would be very surprising if Lord Heseltine&apos;s competitiveness review addresses these sectors with the same seriousness as, for example, manufacturing. To remain competitive, we have to take design seriously, and not make the mistake of believing it&apos;s &apos;nice-to-have&apos;. Hopefully, Danny Boyle&apos;s very well-received advertisement for our creative industries will help cement the importance of design and creativity in the minds of our politicians. We need them to worry a bit more about supporting and investing in this most valuable national asset, or it will disappear.

His new firm, CPG China Division, will aim to take advantage of the rapid growth in Chinese cinema audiences by working with studios in the world&apos;s most populous nation. &quot;The future of entertainment is 3D and we believe that the future of 3D is right here in China,&quot; Cameron told the Associated Press. This is the best place for us to create a kind of a second home.&quot; The film-maker, whose blockbuster science-fiction epic Avatar helped spark Hollywood&apos;s current love affair with 3D, also re-released his 1997 film Titanic in stereoscope earlier this year. The two films are currently the highest grossing movies of all time at the worldwide box office. Titanic 3D was hugely popular in China, where Hollywood films have historically been limited to no more than 20 a year. It garnered the biggest opening of all time in the country, with a staggering $58m, far higher than it managed in its north American bow. China said earlier this year that it will relax its quota, allowing an additional 14 foreign films to be screened providing they are made in 3D or for the big-screen Imax format. Hollywood is also testing the water with a number of investment projects designed to circumvent restrictions, such as Disney&apos;s decision to shoot Iron Man 3 partly in China with support from local company DMG Entertainment. Rival studio DreamWorks Animation has set up a Shanghai-based studio which is due to release its first films in 2016. It will also work with Chinese partners to open a 20 billion yuan theme park in the city to coincide.", "tags": ["James Cameron", "Film", "Culture", "3D", "Technology", "China"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-09T14:42:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/09/ai-weiwei-never-sorry-review", "sentences": ["For years, until the Chinese government chillingly decided on the demolition of his Shanghai studio and an 81-day detention without trial in 2011, ostensibly on tax charges, Ai Weiwei had seemed almost immune to state harassment, due to his chutzpah, his international fame and the very fact he was an artist."], "title": "Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry \u2013 review", "article": "The ghosts of Tiananmen Square 1989, and maybe Grosvenor Square 1968, are revived in this engrossing documentary by Alison Klayman about Chinese artist and democracy campaigner Ai Weiwei, who became widely known in the UK with the spectacular Sunflower Seeds installation at Tate Modern in 2010. For years, until the Chinese government chillingly decided on the demolition of his Shanghai studio and an 81-day detention without trial in 2011, ostensibly on tax charges, Ai Weiwei had seemed almost immune to state harassment, due to his chutzpah, his international fame and the very fact he was an artist. The authorities perhaps believed \u2013 to paraphrase Auden's line about poetry \u2013 that conceptual art makes nothing happen. But his art was making a lot happen: it was brilliantly insisting on creativity and freedom, and made compelling political statements \u2013 perhaps chiefly his Citizen's Investigation into the Sichuan earthquake. This was simply a moving and monumental list of people killed in 2008 by the collapse of shoddy and unsafe government buildings; the list is an ongoing, continuously updated work in progress.

Where would an Arsenal close-season be without a will-he-won&apos;t-he-please-make-it-stop transfer saga? The club, though, have learned the lessons of last summer and they have got their retaliation in first. The signings of Lukas Podolski, Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla, in particular, have given rise to optimism. And they may be joined by others: Ajax right-back Gregory van der Wiel and midfielders Nuri Sahin of Real Madrid and Yann M&apos;Vila of Rennes are targets. It is unclear when Jack Wilshere will return to full fitness or whether Alex Song will stay. Key player Van Persie if he stays, although much will depend on the speed with which Cazorla adapts. Wenger also has high hopes for the 17-year-old winger Serge Gnabry. Achilles heel Injuries: Arsenal&apos;s trademark. Headline generator Wojciech Szczesny: not shy.

Prediction 4th Aston Villa Last season: 16th Title odds: 2,500-1 Going down: 8-1 Summer update Alex McLeish has gone, Paul Lambert has replaced him and Aston Villa&apos;s supporters have rediscovered the will to live after a truly miserable season. Nobody knows quite what to expect this time round \u2013 how Stephen Ireland and Charles N&apos;Zogbia perform depends on what side they get out of bed and the four new signings are not exactly stellar names. It does, though, seem safe to work on the assumption that it will be a whole lot better than 2011-12. Key player Darren Bent. Unlucky to miss Euro 2012 through injury, the England striker will be crucial to Villa&apos;s hopes. Has averaged close to a goal every other league game for Villa. Achilles heel Take Bent out of the equation and Villa are desperately short of firepower. Headline generator Lambert says he&apos;ll get the best out of Ireland. &quot;I&apos;ve got a fair idea of what I want to do with him.&quot; One to watch.

Eden Hazard, Marko Marin and Oscar have arrived for around \u00a360m combined, with the promise of more to come. Key player With Drogba gone and a fine supply line assembled, this has to be Fernando Torres&apos;s time. No more excuses. Oscar looks a precocious talent but may need time to adjust. Achilles heel A lack of depth if Torres misfires and potentially width in midfield.

Prediction 3rd Everton Last season: 7th Title odds: 250-1 Going down: 33-1 Summer update Serene by recent standards, so far, with two permanent signings and no major losses to compensate. Crucially, David Moyes remains in charge, though has not signed a new contract, and hopes to add a few more faces on loan or on a free before the window closes as he seeks that rarest thing at Goodison: a good start. Key man Nikica Jelavic turned Everton&apos;s usual promise into points in the second half of last season and will need to maintain that form, and stay fit, in the absence of quality back-up. Much is expected of Ross Barkley but it is certainly time for Jack Rodwell to fulfil his promise. Achilles heel A lack of depth and vulnerability to big money bids. Headline generator Leighton Baines has been leaving Everton for a richer club for at least the past four seasons. He&apos;s still there \u2013 but for how much longer? Ins Steven Naismith (Rangers, free), Steven Pienaar (Tottenham, \u00a34.5m) Outs: Tim Cahill (New York Red Bulls, \u00a31m), Joseph Yobo (Fenerbahce, \u00a31.5m), James Wallace (Tranmere, undisc), Marcus Hahnemann, James McFadden, Denis Stracqualursi, Jose Baxter (all released), Adam Forshaw (Brentford, undisc) Prediction 7th Fulham Last season: 9th Title odds: 2,500-1 Going down: 11-1 Summer update Martin Jol has revamped his front line, though his squad strengthening is on-going with further arrivals anticipated and required ahead of the closure of the transfer window. Clint Dempsey will only be allowed to leave reluctantly, but some stalwarts of the Roy Hodgson era have moved on, adding to the sense that this team continues to evolve. Key player If Dempsey is sold, given that he is now in the final year of his contract, Belgian Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 will have to thrive. Achilles heel Goals. Hugo Rodallega has rarely proved prolific, while Mladen Petric is experienced but new to the Premier League. Headline generator Chairman Mo.

The new man promises much after a fine debut season in the top flight with Swansea but has so far made few signings to implement his style. The existing crop, however, are buying into his ideas. Key man Keeping Luis Su\u00e1rez content on an improved contract was essential as Rodgers looks to improve on last season&apos;s eighth \u2013 and improvement is imperative. Whether it is a breakthrough season for the winger Raheem Sterling remains to be seen but Jack Robinson should put pressure on Jos\u00e9 Enrique at left-back. Achilles heel The squad is short on numbers and, with Daniel Agger and Andy Carroll potential departures, there are questions over whether Liverpool have the funds to add enough quality Headline generator Su\u00e1rez: a one man publicity machine, for better or worse.

City don&apos;t actually need Van Persie, they have more than enough quality up front already, but on the other hand they do not particularly want to see him end up at Manchester United. By the time the season starts Daniel Agger could have arrived from Liverpool and Adam Johnson travelled in the opposite direction, though the unhurried nature of the transfer negotiations indicates that City are merely making adjustments to their squad, not going all out for a new central defender. Key man The form and confidence of Mario Balotelli will be a big influence. Potentially the Premier League&apos;s most potent striker. Achilles heel Whenever the Kompany-Lescott partnership was broken up last season, quality cover was lacking. Headline generator Why always him? Ins None. Outs Vladimir Weiss (Pescara, undisc), Wayne Bridge (Brighton, loan), Greg Cunningham (Bristol City, undisc), Gai Assulin (R Santander, free) Owen Hargreaves (released). Prediction 1st Manchester United Last season: 2nd Title odds: 11-4 Going down: 3,000-1 Summer update Still no Robin van Persie, and though Shinji Kagawa and Nick Powell appear astute enough signings, Old Trafford still awaits a grand-gesture response to being pipped to the title by the noisy neighbours. City can afford to stick rather than twist, but United keeping the chequebook closed not only appears uncharacteristically defeatist, it raises suspicions that the owners are being tight with funds. Key man Van Persie would be a perfect statement of intent, but otherwise the focus will remain on Wayne Rooney. Achilles heel Nemanja Vidic&apos;s return is a lift, but there are questions over just about everyone else in defence, with Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra showing their age and David de Gea still to mature. Headline generator A frustrated Rooney questioned United&apos;s ambition two years ago. A slow start and the questions could begin again.

By the time his \u00a37m release clause expired on 31 July Demba Ba was still a Newcastle player and Alan Pardew says he is not expecting any key departures. In terms of new faces, progress has been slow, with Lille playing hardball over the right-back Mathieu Debuchy&apos;s mooted sale and Twente, Ajax and Liverpool doing likewise regarding Douglas, Vurnon Anita and Andy Carroll. Key man Pardew reports that Cheik Tiot\u00e9 is &quot;10 times better&quot; than he was this time last year. If so he will be some enforcer. Sammy Ameobi (right) has also been in fine form pre-season. Achilles heel The Europa League. No one knows if Pardew&apos;s squad is deep enough to cope with the relentless routine.

Prediction 6th Norwich City Last season: 12th Title odds: 5,500-1 Going down: 13-8 Summer update Paul Lambert&apos;s decision to swap Carrow Road for Villa Park in June represented a sizeable blow for Norwich given the Scot&apos;s success as manager. Two successive promotions were followed by a 12th-place finish in the Premier League last season and his departure raised fears that this would be a tough campaign. Chris Hughton&apos;s arrival has lifted spirits, though. Key man Grant Holt. Last season&apos;s top scorer remains the team&apos;s focal point, while the England Under-21 defender Ryan Bennett also impressed at the end of last season. Achilles heel Defence. They conceded 66 goals last season, the joint fourth-highest in the division. Without real improvement at the back, this season will be a slog. Headline generator Holt made a transfer request in May, and signed a new deal in July.

Prediction 18th QPR Last season: 17th Title odds: 3,000-1 Going down: 11-2 Summer update Rangers might have stopped playing before the final whistle blew on last season but they cannot wait for the first one this time out. In Park Ji-sung, who was unveiled at a glamour press conference on the 29th floor of London&apos;s Millbank Tower, they feel they have signed a &quot;global superstar&quot;. Mark Hughes completed a lot of encouraging business early on and his ambitions are high. After promotion in May last year under Neil Warnock, a 17th-placed finish was the target and was achieved, just. Hughes has said that Rangers will no longer be involved in relegation scraps on his watch. Key player Park will be pivotal. Achilles heel Rangers had the worst away record in the division last season. Headline generator Joey Barton&apos;s debut after his 12 game ban. What odds on a straight red?

Outs Ten players released. Prediction 9th Reading Last season: 1st, Championship Title odds: 10,000-1 Going down: 6-5 Summer update Reading&apos;s struggle to interest neutrals is over: this season under their wealthy new Russian ownership should provide plenty of headlines. Spending has been relatively modest so far \u2013 quantity over stellar quality \u2013 though Pavel Pogrebnyak&apos;s rumoured \u00a360,000 a week is a sign of things to come. If they are struggling by Christmas, expect a lavish January. Key man Pogrebnyak excelled for Fulham and needs to do the same here if his new side is to avoid a long, drawn-out struggle. Achilles heel Midfield options are solid but unspectacular: adding some creative, scoring talent would seriously change the outlook. Headline generator Katsia Zingarevich \u2013 wife of the owner and tabloid dream. Won &quot;Supermodel of the World&quot; as a teenager. Ins Chris Gunter (Nottingham Forest, \u00a32.3m), Adrian Mariappa (Watford, undisc), Danny Guthrie, Nicky Shorey, Pavel Pogrebnyak, Garath McCleary (all free) Outs Michail Antonio (Sheffield Wednesday, undisc), Mathieu Manset (Sion, undisc), Karl Sheppard (Accrington Stanley, loan), Joseph Mills (Burnley, loan), Brian Howard, Tomasz Cywka, Andy Griffin, Cedric Baseya (all released) Prediction 19th Southampton Last season: 2nd, Championship Title odds: 7,500-1 Going down: 11-8 Summer update The honeymoon could be short \u2013 it&apos;s Manchester City away on the opening day \u2013 but this is a solid side, albeit at Championship level. Nigel Adkins says stability, strength and willpower will hold them together. &quot;You can&apos;t underestimate team spirit.&quot; Key man Championship Player of the Year and all-round big unit Rickie Lambert. The 30-year-old scored 27 last season and hit four hat-tricks. Big money Jay Rodriguez should relieve some of the scoring burden, though. Achilles heel Relative top-level inexperience. The influence of the former Rangers captain Steven Davis will be crucial. Headline generator Matt Le Tissier in the Soccer Saturday studio \u2013 needs to prove himself as a cool, calm model of impartiality. Ins Jay Rodriguez (Burnley, \u00a36m); Steven Davis (Rangers, \u00a3800k); Paulo Gazzaniga (Gillingham, undisc); Nathaniel Clyne (Palace, \u00a32.5m).

But there is a sense of collective purpose at the Britannia Stadium. Another lively mid\u2011table finish beckons. Key man Peter Crouch. Goes into his first full campaign at the club buoyed by last season&apos;s 14 goals following his arrival from Tottenham. Achilles heel Tony Pulis may not consider it a weakness but Stoke&apos;s reliance on a direct attacking approach makes them a limited and predictable: a dangerous combination. Headline generator Discipline issues. Case in point: some pre-season argy bargy with Orlando City, including a red card for Glenn Whelan. Ins Michael Kightly (Wolves, \u00a33.1m), Geoff Cameron (Houston Dynamo, \u00a31.9m), Jamie Ness (Rangers, free).

Prediction 11th Sunderland Last season: 13th Title odds: 1,250-1 Going down: 12-1 Summer update A long trek to South Korea for a Peace tournament has proved the most notable event of a low-key preamble to Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s first full season in charge. After the frantic buying and selling of the Steve Bruce era, transfer activity has been minimal and principally involved long-term haggling for Steven Fletcher with Wolves. Even so, with European qualification the aim, O&apos;Neill is seeking increased creativity and goals and a couple more additions seem likely. Meanwhile Wes Brown has injured his knee again. Key man St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon was the brightest imaginative force last season, while young Ryan Noble is one to watch. Achilles heel Titus Bramble. Talented, but prone to lapses. Headline generator The outside chance of a move for Liverpool&apos;s ex-Newcastle man Andy Carroll. &quot;He&apos;s a really good player,&quot; says O&apos;Neill. Ins Carlos Cu\u00e9llar (Aston Villa, free).

Prediction 10th Swansea City Last season: 11th Title odds: 4,500-1 Going down: 9-4 Summer update All quiet with the exception of the departure of Brendan Rodgers to Liverpool, appointment of one of the greatest players of all time in his place, Joe Allen&apos;s imminent Welsh record \u00a315m move to Anfield and the arrival of two Spaniards and a Dutchman from La Liga. Who knows what to expect at the Liberty Stadium this season \u2013 but with Michael Laudrup in charge at least it should be fun. Key player Michu. The Spaniard&apos;s 15 goals last season made him the highest scoring midfielder in La Liga, he should be in his prime at 26 years old and yet Swansea paid only \u00a32m for him. Achilles heel Scoring enough. Goals were hard to come by at times last season and it would be a worry if Danny Graham, who notched 12 in his first season in the Premier League, got injured. Headline generator All eyes on Laudrup. He is among the favourites to be the first manager to go. Ins Michu (Rayo Vallecano, \u00a32m), Jos\u00e9 Manuel Flores (Genoa, \u00a32m), Jonathan de Guzm\u00e1n (Villarreal, loan), Itay Shechter (Kaiserslautern, loan, subject to work permit) Outs Joe Allen (Liverpool, fee to be confirmed), Ferrie Bodde, Casey Thomas, Joe Walsh, Scott Donnelly (all released) Prediction 16th Tottenham Hotspur Last season: 4th Title odds: 40-1 Going down: 250-1 Summer update When Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas was presented to the media on 11 July he talked of the need to &quot;complete&quot; the squad. With less than a week before the season starts, the Portuguese has not yet added to the positive early summer signings of Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jan Vertonghen. Jermain Defoe is his only established striker, Luka Modric wants to leave, Scott Parker is a long-term injury casualty and Sandro has not yet trained under him. The new boss could be forgiven for feeling edgy. Emmanuel Adebayor and Leandro Dami\u00e3o are the main targets up front while a top keeper is also being sought. Key player Gareth Bale, while Jake Livermore and Steven Caulker are developing well. Achilles heel The dangerous policy of leaving transfers late. Headline generator Modric&apos;s state of mind. Ins Gylfi Sigurdsson (Hoffenheim, \u00a38m); Jan Vertonghen (Ajax, \u00a38m) Outs Nico Kranjcar (Dynamo Kyiv, \u00a35.5m); Vedran Corluka (L Moscow, undisc); Steven Pienaar (Everton, \u00a34.5m); Ryan Nelsen (QPR, free), seven players released, including Louis Saha and Ledley King. Prediction 8th West Bromwich Albion Last season: 10th Title odds: 3,500-1 Going down: 4-1 Summer update The FA&apos;s surprise decision to appoint Roy Hodgson led, eventually, to Albion making the surprise decision to appoint Steve Clarke. After years of being a No2, Clarke at last has the chance to call the shots. The Scot has decent squad at his disposal, aided by three new faces and Ben Foster&apos;s permanent transfer, although he will do well to reprise last season&apos;s top-10 finish. Key player Shane Long. Started last season on fire, scoring against Manchester United and Chelsea in his first two games before injuries knocked him off course. And George Thorne, a highly rated academy graduate, is one to watch. Achilles heel Lack of cover at left back after NickyShorey&apos;s departure and doubts over Jonas Olsson&apos;s future raise questions about defence.

Modibo Ma\u00efga, a striker signed from Sochaux, may take time to settle. Mohamed Diam\u00e9 and Alou Diarra are shrewd signings, James Collins less so, but the loss of goalkeeper Robert Green to QPR could be crucial. Key players Kevin Nolan&apos;s leadership unites the side, but Ricardo Vaz T\u00ea often makes the difference. Achilles heel Carlton Cole is not good enough to play every week in the Premier League. Slow full-backs are a feature too. Headline generator Big Sam. Knows how to play mind games, if not to win them, and relishes inter-gaffer verbal conflict. Will be under pressure, too, if his side make a slow start.

Prediction 15th Wigan Athletic Last season: 15th Title odds: 6,000-1 Going down: 7-4 Summer update If Roberto Mart\u00ednez&apos;s side begin the new season like they finished the last they will end up in Europe \u2013 but no one in Lancashire seriously expects anything close. Wigan have lost good players in Mohamed Diam\u00e9 and Hugo Rodallega, and made just a couple of low-key purchases in Fraser Fyvie from Aberdeen and Ivan Ramis from Real Mallorca. And Mart\u00ednez, who passionately believes the transfer window should shut as soon as the season starts, is still worried about losing Victor Moses to Chelsea. Key man Moses was consistently excellent in the second half of last season. If he moves to Chelsea&apos;s bench it will not be easy for Mart\u00ednez to replace his quality.

So there is little understanding about the current organisational structures, origin, size, scope of work and impact of social enterprises in China. To fill the void FYSE has conducted an annual survey among social entrepreneurs in China for the past two years. In this four part series we share more about the current state of social enterprises in China. Since around 2004 the concept has begun to gain supporters, advocates, incubators, impact investors, the media and academic researchers \u2013 have expanded across the country. 95% of respondents to FYSE&apos;s annual Chinese Social Enterprise Survey got involved in social entrepreneurship after 2006, with the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 being a major driving force for participation. The recent interest in social enterprise is reflected in the youthfulness of enterprises: 54% of them are under three years old and 38% are older than five years. One notable development is that of an inverted pyramid with fewer new social enterprises compared to the number of mature social enterprises. The number of mature social enterprises who were older than five years rose from 15% in 2011 to 38% in 2012. On the flipside the pipeline of early \u2013 state social enterprises is drying up, with the number of enterprises up to two years of age and again aged 3-5 years are notably decreasing, indicating that a large proportion of social enterprises are not graduating to the next level and size of operations. Notwithstanding the perception of China as serious economic competitor with internationally expanding enterprises such as Haier, Lenovo and Sinopec, social enterprises are still limited in scale and economic impact, mainly due to their youthfulness. Firstly, 71% of surveyed social enterprises generate less than 500,000 Yuan (\u00a350,000) in annual revenues and while social enterprises grow in size over time, older social enterprises are still relatively small. For example, only two surveyed social enterprises achieved a turnover above 10million Yuan (\u00a31m). Secondly, social enterprises are limited in geographic scope with 63% operating on a village or city level, 13% operating on provincial level, 17% reaching national level and 8% operating on an international level. Thirdly, two-thirds of surveyed social enterprises are headquartered in either Beijing or Shanghai, with very few social enterprises operating out of China&apos;s smaller cities. In the 2008 China Social Enterprise Report by the British Council 68% of interviewees predicted social enterprises to be most likely to evolve from existing NGOs. Indeed an increasing number of NGOs in China are embarking towards marketisation and commercialisation out of necessity due to a revenue shortage and institutional challenges facing NGOs. One example is Bread For Life founded by Keith Wyse. Keith originally established an orphanage outside Beijing, for children diagnosed with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, commonly known as brittle bone disease. Eager to see the children strive for more beyond the orphanage walls and with the ambition to break free from a grant dependency model, Keith established the Bread of Life Bakery six years ago. The bakery, which produces and sells western style bread to the mostly expatriate community in Beijing, provides employment to four disabled women who hail from the orphanage and generates profits that are reinvested into the orphanage. Yet many NGOs striving to become social enterprises struggle to become social enterprises due to inadequate business and market expertise, institutional challenges, an unclear business model and inefficient income generating strategies. Therefore they often revert back to grants and donations to cover costs or are unable to expand. These challenges have led many Chinese experts to question the ability of NGOs to turn into viable social enterprises. Instead they believe that the most promising Chinese social enterprises are to be found in the business sector, among the businesses across China that might not even identify themselves as social enterprises. One example is Beijing Landwasher Science &amp; Technology Development, which produces environmentally friendly toilets that use a water-free flushing system. This technology both conserves resources and meets the sanitation needs of rural communities lacking access to current public infrastructure. Since 1999 Landwasher has sold over 2,200 of its environmental toilets and achieved sales revenues of \u00a36.6m. This places Landwasher as a leader in the environmental sanitation industry in China. However, these entrepreneurs often do not know of the concept of social enterprise and do not consider themselves to be social entrepreneurs. In fact, only 63% of social entrepreneurs in our survey consider themselves to be a social entrepreneur (down from 75% in our 2011 survey). Yet, no matter the size and location social entrepreneurs in China face a variety of challenges, some in common with their global counterparts, some unique to China. The foremost challenges cluster around three key issues: access to funding at different stages of the entrepreneurial lifecycle; access and retention of human resources; and challenges related to government policy and the legal framework. Yet that requires a follow up article to elaborate in detail. Andrea Krause is executive director at FYSE, an organisation dedicated to inspire, connect and accelerate social entrepreneurs and the field that supports them.

The public outcry led to Tang Hui&apos;s release, but did not end with her return home last week. The case has fuelled calls for the immediate reform of a system that means low-level offenders can be detained in forced-labour camps for up to four years without a trial or legal representation. The 39-year-old mother was sentenced to 18 months re-education through labour for &quot;seriously disturbing the social order and exerting a negative impact on society&quot; after she repeatedly petitioned officials in Yongzhou, Hunan, because she believed the sentences given to the men who kidnapped, raped and forced her 11-year-old daughter into prostitution should have been more severe. Tens of thousands of people commented or forwarded posts about her ordeal. Since her release, attention has shifted to the general shortcomings of the system. In a poll of almost 20,000 internet users, posted by a well-known author on the Sina Weibo microblog service, 98% called for abolition of the system. The poll was later deleted, prompting some respondents to joke that it too had been sent to a labour camp. Ten well-known lawyers have now issued an open letter calling for change to &quot;re-education through labour&quot;, which dates to the 1950s. China had 350 labour camps with 160,000 prisoners at the end of 2008, the last year for which figures are available. The inmates endure long working hours, often in heavy agricultural or factory roles, and receive political education. The justice ministry does not publish details on why people were detained, although in 2005 it suggested drug offences accounted for more than half the cases. The system is often used to deal with minor criminals, such as thieves and sex workers. The lawyers who wrote the letter say detaining critics has become an easy way to preserve stability. They want to see it abolished but say that in the short term it must at least be reformed to prevent the most egregious abuses. &quot;Now this system is being used more frequently in a more casual way,&quot; said Li Fangping, one of the authors, adding that petitioners, activists, dissidents and whistleblowers had been victims of it. Pang Kun, a signatory from a Guangdong law firm, said that suspects got as little as three days to prepare for their hearing, were often in detention for that period, and had no right to legal representation. He said they should be given more notice, should remain free before their case is heard and should be able to hire lawyers. The lawyers also say committees should release written statements explaining their decisions, and that those detained should have the right to appeal. &quot;I am pessimistic about whether the laojiao system can be abolished now as all different levels of governments still regard it as the useful tool to maintain the social stability,&quot; Pang added. Joshua Rosenzweig, a Hong Kong-based independent human rights scholar, said: &quot;You can deal with people who you consider to be problematic or threats to that social order without really having to justify it to anyone but yourselves. &quot;Decisions are essentially made by police \u2026 Even though they have a fancy name for [the hearing committees], when it&apos;s time to send someone to re-education through labour they just put the sign on the door.&quot; The ministries of justice and public security have yet to respond to the letter. There have been repeated calls for reform in recent years, often via the National People&apos;s Congress, the largely rubber-stamp legislature. Ying Yong, president of the Shanghai High People&apos;s Court, called for changes at the NPC session this spring. He pointed out that although the system was supposed to deal with cases not serious enough to constitute a crime, the penalties could be much stiffer than the six-month minimum term for criminal offences. Suspects can be sentenced to between one and three years in confinement. And the sentence can be extended by a year if authorities decide the detainee has not been sufficiently re-educated.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Human rights", "Law", "Prostitution", "Society", "Rape and sexual assault"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-16T14:55:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/16/disconnect-power-fixed-term-parliaments", "sentences": ["Why should anyone in Shanghai need to know about \u2013 or control \u2013 the behaviour of a power station in Stratford?"], "title": "Letters: Only disconnect", "article": "Why are essentially autonomous power stations connected to the internet at all (Cyber-attack alert sparked checks on eve of Games, 16th August)?

The special French menu for Chinese visitors begins with an aperitif of cider and local honey. The starter is foie gras on toast and salad, followed by duck \u2013 cuisse de canard, in honey. &quot;Chinese people don&apos;t like much red meat and would shudder at the sight of blood dribbling across a plate from rare cooking, so duck is a good choice. The key is local wine that is matched to each course and cuts through the fattiness of foie gras,&quot; Wang said. &quot;The typical French cheese course has been omitted as the Chinese aren&apos;t big cheese eaters. Likewise, dessert is light and based on fresh fruit.&quot; France is the most popular European destination for Chinese tourists, with around 900,000 flocking there in 2011, a figure expected to quadruple in the next decade. Paris is the No 1 destination, with Chinese tourists on tightly scheduled coach tours often scrimping on accommodation in chain hotels off the ring-road and eating at \u00a410 (\u00a37.93) Chinese self-service buffets in order to spend on products such as designer bags and luxury perfumes and cosmetics, which are cheaper in France and tax-free. The French daily Le Figaro has even launched a regular luxury goods supplement in Chinese. But about 60 miles south of Paris, the town of Montargis, best known for pralines and canals, has become a must-see \u2013 a symbolic stop-off for its role in the history of Chinese communism. It was here in 1910 to 1920 that hundreds of Chinese students came to study, including future leaders such as Deng Xiaoping, and a group of friends of Mao Zedong. Chinese history books recount that it was in a leafy Montargis park that the young Chinese students set out in a letter to Mao their first ideas for a Chinese Communist party. Wang, head of the China-Montargis friendship association, has lived in France for more than 20 years, and seven years ago set up guided tours of the Chinese history of Montargis. She now hosts about 100 Chinese groups a year, mostly senior functionaries and dignitaries. The tour ranges from Hutchinson&apos;s rubber factory, where Deng worked in the women&apos;s shoes sectionas a 17-year-old, to the former public baths, via old dormitories and secret courtyards. French tourists can be seen around town reading the numerous bilingual French-Chinese historical plaques that the association put up with the local authorities. Wang is now extending the tours to take in the increasingly popular chateaux of the nearby Loire valley, particularly the Chateau du Clos Luc\u00e9 where Leonardo da Vinci spent the last three years of his life and whose rooms dedicated to his engineering exploits are an eye-opener for Chinese visitors. &quot;France&apos;s appeal to Chinese tourists is all about romance and romanticism,&quot; Wang said. But time must always be set aside for shopping. Louis Vuitton leather goods are a key draw, and more modest souvenir gifts include Breton butter biscuits. &quot;Cosmetics and creams are more and more popular,&quot; Wang said. &quot;Before I started this, I didn&apos;t know the Chinese word for Lanc\u00f4me.

The number of British students applying to Dublin&apos;s Trinity College has jumped by 20% to nearly 2,000 this year. At University College Dublin (UCD), applications from students with British A-levels have surged 37% from 800 to around 1,100. The University of Groningen in the Netherlands, where many courses are taught entirely in English, has seen the number of applicants from Britain quadruple in the last two years alone. British 18-year-olds are fleeing the prospect of a \u00a350,000 bill for studying at home \u2013 and finding they can save as much as \u00a325,000 over three years by studying abroad as well as enjoying a life-changing experience. In Denmark, tuition fees for students from within the EU are zero. In the Netherlands, they are around \u20ac1,700 a year (\u00a31,330), and it&apos;s even possible to access Dutch state grants worth around \u20ac500 (\u00a3390) a month (see page 5). Irish institutions such as Trinity and UCD, ranked among the top universities in Europe, charge just \u20ac2,250 a year (\u00a31,760) to EU citizens. It has also emerged that a significant number of UK students have applied to universities in the EU as an &quot;insurance&quot; against failing to achieve the grades they want and having to go through clearing. Many British &quot;Russell group&quot; universities now demand A-level scores of AAB and above, while similarly-ranked Dutch universities accept lower grades \u2013 though they are much tougher (almost brutal, say some) about weeding out underperforming students in their first term. &quot;It&apos;s not exactly a flood of students fleeing the new tuition fees in Britain, but we are seeing much more interest,&quot; says Mark Huntington, who runs astarfuture.co.uk, which has since 2006 offered a free advisory service to British students and parents considering higher education opportunities abroad. There are now more than 1,200 degree courses in Europe (not including Ireland) taught entirely in English, while in the Netherlands alone 20 universities are teaching in English. &quot;The overall cost of a three-year course in Holland, taking in tuition fees, accommodation and living costs, will be around \u00a324,000 compared with the \u00a350,000 or so it now costs in the UK,&quot; says Huntington. But, as he warns on his website, &quot;we don&apos;t believe you should go abroad just to save money and there are lots of other reasons why studying abroad is a good idea. &quot;It is also worth bearing in mind that even though a degree abroad may be significantly cheaper than an equivalent qualification in the UK, you will possibly have to pay out more up front than if you were to study at home.&quot; Not being able to speak a word of Dutch, Danish or Flemish does not seem to be a problem. &quot;You could survive the whole way through a course in Holland without learning a word of Dutch,&quot; says Huntington. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t recommend it, but it is possible.&quot; Hania Thurlow, 18, from Norwich, left for Maastricht University yesterday a day after learning she had got A*AB in her A-levels. She initially planned to go to the University of Exeter, anticipating three A grades, but was deterred by the costs. &quot;The fees really put me off,&quot; she said. &quot;I know you can take out loans and don&apos;t have to repay them straight away, but it&apos;s still a huge debt. Accommodation costs are lower too. In Maastricht I will pay \u20ac375 (\u00a3293) rent a month for a room, but Exeter wanted \u00a3125 a week (\u00a3540/month). Even travel is cheaper \u2013 I can fly home from Eindhoven for around \u00a330 on Ryanair, less than the cost of going to Manchester.&quot; She is aware of the tougher first year students face in the Netherlands compared to Britain, but is unfazed: &quot;The first year is supposed to be quite difficult. But I&apos;m going to university to study hard anyway.&quot; She has also already lined up part-time employment (arranged through the university) as a babysitter for Dutch families, and will be starting lessons in Dutch when she arrives. She says one other student from her school in Norwich is already at Maastricht, and another has applied. Christian Garrard from Canterbury, who is about to start his fourth year studying law at the University of Groningen says: &quot;It&apos;s the best decision I have ever made. I had a Dutch girlfriend and if it wasn&apos;t for her I would probably have thought, no way. It was only really daunting until I got here. As an international student you live in an international house, mostly with other foreign students who all speak English, while Groningen is almost becoming a bilingual university. I&apos;ve thrived on it, though maybe if you&apos;re more of a home-bird it&apos;s not for you.&quot; Garrard worked part-time, which also enabled him to access Dutch grants, meaning that after two years he had no debts at all: &quot;I was even saving money at one point.&quot; But it is the Republic of Ireland which is seeing the biggest surge in British students beating the tuition fee hikes. For many 18-year-olds it is far less daunting than going to a non-English speaking country and many arrive with family connections in the country. The major barrier is academic entry requirements. &quot;The grade requirements can be almost ridiculously high,&quot; warns Huntington. The Irish equivalent of A-levels is the Leaving Cert, which covers six subjects. Unless a British student has studied four A-levels and gained good grades, they may find it difficult to obtain enough points to qualify for an Irish university. Prices in Dublin, once one of Europe&apos;s most expensive cities, is another issue, though the cost of living has fallen in recent years. UCD says rent for on-campus rooms are \u20ac486 a month (\u00a3380), while living off campus nearby in Rathmines would be about \u20ac450 (\u00a3352). The universities of Cork, Limerick and Galway all charge similar tuition fees but with lower living costs. Most of the &quot;bargain&quot; tuition fees are in EU countries, but some students are heading further afield. The University of Nottingham has set up campuses in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Ningbo, China (south of Shanghai), where students graduate with a UK degree. At \u00a37,100, fees at the Kuala Lumpur campus are not far short of the cost of studying at Nottingham, and most students are from Malaysia, but a number are now coming from Britain, many having gained scholarships. Without scholarships (and no access to student grants) the financial equation is much less attractive, though living costs are a fraction of the UK. In Ningbo, student accommodation is \u00a3100 a year. Nottingham was first to pioneer campuses abroad, and others are following: Reading University is opening a Malaysian campus in 2015 while Liverpool is partnering with a university in Shanghai. Emerging universities in Asia, keen to recruit European students, are also offering highly attractive scholarship programmes to students with decent A-level grades. Ben Poulter, 18, from Brentwood County High, a state school in Essex, will be packing his bags in a few weeks&apos; time to head to Singapore, where he will begin a four-year course in business at SP Jain Global School of Management. His second year will be in Dubai, followed by two years in Sydney, Australia. And the $18,000 annual tuition fees will be sliced to zero as it&apos;s entirely paid for by the scholarship. &quot;SP Jain came to our school and gave a presentation to year 12 and year 13 [lower and upper sixth],&quot; he says. &quot;I applied and they offered me a scholarship almost immediately after the interview so long as I got AAB at A-level. I&apos;m really excited. It&apos;s a little bit daunting, but an incredible opportunity.&quot; Poulter was lucky; his school encouraged students to consider opportunities abroad. But Gerard Spencer, founder of europeducation.org.uk, which provides information on studying in Europe for students and parents, says: &quot;Unfortunately, most British schools don&apos;t talk about options outside the UK for higher education. Admissions to European universities for September 2012 are now closed. But postponing the decision for a year and starting in a European university in 2013 would be a unique and life-changing decision.&quot; Reality restricts the overseas options British students have a huge range of options for studying abroad, but the reality \u2013 if you want to keep costs low and can only speak English \u2013 is that Ireland and the Netherlands are head and shoulders above the rest. We&apos;ve highlighted a few other choices \u2013 Denmark and Norway in particular, as they do not charge tuition fees. We excluded France and Germany because they have few courses taught in English (apart from a few specialist private universities). The US and Australia, with pricey tuition fees, only come into the picture because they offer numerous scholarships. Republic of Ireland     Republic of Ireland flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee \u20ac2,250 (\u00a31,760) student contribution for 2012/2013, expected to rise to \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,955) next year. Students also pay &quot;capitation&quot; fees at institutions such as University College Dublin (\u20ac183/\u00a3143) to cover facilities such as its 50m pool. Private universities charge around \u20ac5,000 (\u00a33,900) a year. What&apos;s available Seven universities, 14 institutes of technology and a number of private universities. Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin are ranked in the world&apos;s top 200 universities. Entry requirements Tough. Based on points score in the Irish Leaving Certificate (six subjects, maximum 600 points for six As). A British A grade is worth 135 points, so students will need four good A-levels to obtain a place a leading university. Irish universities do not make conditional offers. No one receives an offer from an Irish university until they have received their grades. Grants/Scholarships No Irish state grants for UK students. Individual universities have limited scholarships/exhibitions for top students. Accommodation Not cheap. As an example, University College Dublin this year charges \u20ac486 (\u00a3380) per month. Living costs High, especially in Dublin, where the price level is similar to London or higher. Part-time earning opportunities more limited than in the past; the Irish unemployment rate is 14.8% compared with 8.1% in the UK. Netherlands     Netherlands flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee \u20ac1,771 (\u00a31,385) for most courses. Expected to rise in line with inflation. What&apos;s available Twenty universities offer degrees taught entirely in English, although at some (such as Amsterdam) there may be just one or two courses in English. Groningen and Maastricht are the most popular among British applicants. Groningen, founded in 1614 and one of the Netherlands&apos; oldest universities, currently offers nine undergraduate programmes in English but will raise that to 19 in 2013. Entry requirements A general rule is that a GCSE in three subjects with marks ranging from A*-C, plus a GCE (A-level) with three subjects at advanced level (six different subjects in total) is comparable to a Dutch VWO diploma and thus admissible for a programme in a Dutch university. Grants/Scholarships British students can access Dutch student finance on exactly the same basis as local students. So long as you find part-time work of at least 32 hours a month and pay Dutch national insurance, you qualify for a grant of \u20ac266 (\u00a3208) a month, plus you can apply for a means-tested additional grant of up to \u20ac242 (\u00a3189) a month. Students can also borrow up to \u20ac285 (\u00a3223) a month if they have been awarded the full means-tested grant. Accommodation Expensive in Amsterdam. Don&apos;t expect en-suite bathrooms. Rents outside the capital are typically \u20ac200-\u20ac400 (\u00a3150-\u00a3300) a month. Living costs Approximately the same as London and the south-east of England, but higher than the north of England. Expect to pay around \u00a33.70 for a pint in city centre Dutch bars. Denmark     Denmark flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Denmark does not charge tuition fees to anyone with an EU passport. So nothing to pay over three years. What&apos;s available There are 27 universities and higher education colleges in Denmark, but only a few offer courses taught in English. About the best option is the University of Southern Denmark, based in Odense, about an hour-and-a-half south of Copenhagen. Entry requirements If you have A-levels you should be eligible for entry to a Danish university. Details at StudyinDenmark.dk Grants/Scholarships Limited. No state grants or loans for UK students. Accommodation USD says expect to pay around \u00a3235 a month for rent, but much more in Copenhagen. Living costs Very high. Denmark is not in the euro and its krone has risen in value in recent years. But students with EU nationality are able to work, and pay rates are relatively high. Norway     Norway flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Norway&apos;s state universities do not charge students from any country. What&apos;s available There are seven universities and eight specialist universities, but few offer courses taught in English. But the University of Nordland, inside the Arctic Circle, welcomed 200 international students last year and has courses taught in English in subjects such as marine ecology. Entry requirements The minimum requirement is five GCE passes, of which two must be A-levels. Grants/Scholarships Limited. Accommodation Student rent at the University of Nordland is \u00a3375 a month Living costs Some of the highest in the world, with the Norwegian krone one of the world&apos;s strongest currencies. A bottle of beer in a pub can cost anything up to \u00a37, while a loaf of bread is around \u00a32.70. United States     US flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Vary enormously. Most universities quote all-in tuition, lodging and food prices at around $20,000 - $45,000 a year (\u00a312,700-\u00a328,600), so they&apos;re not cheap. What&apos;s available Immense. There are around 4,000 universities in the US. Entry requirements Visas are required, and you must depart after completing the course.

The new film Shadow Dancer \u2013 adapted by Bradby from his late 1990s novel of the same name \u2013 shows how far we have come since then. &quot;It really hit home for me when I saw the Queen shaking hands with Martin McGuinness the other month,&quot; says Bradby, now ITN&apos;s political editor. &quot;I was gobsmacked by that and very uplifted by it too. It shows that anything is possible in the world.&quot; Shadow Dancer, to be released on Friday 24 August, opens in the early 1970s before switching to the 1990s when the British security forces had infiltrated every level of the Provisional IRA. Andrea Riseborough plays a Republican single mother who is coerced into spying on her extended family by an MI5 agent, played by Clive Owen. Both protagonists are eventually revealed to be pawns in a wider game \u2013 and forced to rely on each other in order to survive. The film is based on Bradby&apos;s own experiences in Belfast, where he lived from 1993 to 1996. His tenure covered the IRA ceasefire, Bill Clinton&apos;s Belfast rally and the fraught runup to the Good Friday agreement. &quot;It was my good luck to be there at a crucial time,&quot; he said. &quot;I only got the job because the older, more experienced reporters didn&apos;t go for it. They were sick of the place and assumed that nothing would ever change. &quot;But three weeks into the job I heard the first whispers that the IRA were thinking about taking a different path. Some colleagues were very cynical \u2013 they thought it was a trick. But I knew nothing about anything. I came without any baggage, which was probably for the best.&quot; Shadow Dancer was directed by James Marsh, the British film-maker who won an Oscar for his 2008 documentary Man on Wire. Marsh admits that he initially hesitated over the project, reluctant to excavate such painful recent history. &quot;It was about Ireland and the Troubles, and we are all glad to have got beyond that,&quot; he said. Yet Bradby, now 45, feels that the film&apos;s themes speak to today&apos;s headlines as much as to the archive. &quot;Yes, the film is set in Northern Ireland, but it could have been anywhere. It&apos;s about people caught up at the heart of a vicious conflict and the choices they make in a life or death situation. A similar situation might just as easily be taking place in Cairo or Aleppo.&quot; Shadow Dancer premiered at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, where it was greeted by positive reviews. The Hollywood Reporter called it a film of &quot;riveting assurance&quot; while the Guardian saw it as &quot;a raw reminder of a sad and painful past&quot;. On leaving Northern Ireland, Bradby progressed through stints as ITN&apos;s Asia correspondent and royal correspondent. He currently juggles his day job as political editor with his sideline as a novelist and is in the process of adapting another of his books \u2013 the Shanghai-based historical thriller The Master of Rain \u2013 for the screen. Meanwhile, his recent visits to Belfast have reminded him how far the city has travelled in the past two decades. &quot;I think I&apos;ve always been more interested in humanity than politics,&quot; he said. &quot;The best stories are the ones about the ordinary human beings who are caught in the vortex, mired in the misery. What&apos;s most inspiring about Northern Ireland is the way in which the people caught in that vortex were able to march themselves out of it.&quot; In so doing, perhaps, they set an example for the politicians. &quot;I&apos;ll tell you what was even more remarkable than McGuinness shaking hands with the Queen,&quot; said Bradby. &quot;It was watching McGuinness and Ian Paisley sitting together at Stormont as though they&apos;d been mates forever, laughing away like the Chuckle Brothers. &quot;We could never have conceived of that 20 years ago \u2013 the idea that two men with that much history would ever arrive at that kind of relationship. &quot;Although maybe it was that recognition of shared history that allowed them to get there. Maybe they got to the point where they stopped making judgments. They recognised that they had both been in the same boat all along.&quot;", "tags": ["Film", "Andrea Riseborough", "Clive Owen", "Northern Ireland", "Belfast", "IRA", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "UK news", "Northern Irish politics", "Martin McGuinness", "Politics", "Culture", "ITN", "TV news", "Television industry", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-20T17:13:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/21/environment-activists-china-pollution-protest", "sentences": ["The demonstrators gathered at dawn in Qidong, a small coastal town north of Shanghai."], "title": "Environmental activism gains a foothold in China", "article": "Li Wei, 18 (not her real name), doesn&apos;t seem like a dissident. She is more focused on her accounting studies, her friends on the social networks and chatting with her sister. Nevertheless, she took part in a demonstration last month in front of the Chinese Communist party offices that degenerated into violent clashes with police. The demonstrators gathered at dawn in Qidong, a small coastal town north of Shanghai. By noon, the local government headquarters were occupied and files were being thrown out of the windows. In the heat of the moment the party secretary&apos;s shirt was ripped off. &quot;We have to get mobilised to protect the environment, it&apos;s our home town,&quot; explained Li, from her parents&apos; restaurant. Protests against pollution have multiplied in China as people become better informed and more concerned about the heavy ecological cost of economic development. Even state media now stresses the environment is a priority for China. Young people use micro-blogging to pass on the word. &quot;People understand that the fight against pollution is a personal right, for there are very few places in the world where industrialisation has had such a massive and direct impact on such a large number of people,&quot; said environmental activist Ma Jun. Earlier this summer there were student-led protests against a copper alloy plant in Shifang, central Sichuan province. The local authorities quickly scrapped the project. In August 2011 a similar protest broke out in the industrial port of Dalian in the north-east, which mobilised 12,000 people. The authorities gave way there too. In Qidong, locals were protesting against plans by a Japanese-owned paper mill to build a wastewater pipeline close to a small port. &quot;Many people earn a living from fishing here. That project jeopardised their livelihoods,&quot; said Li. She had learned about it on an internet forum and felt she had to do something. &quot;Protecting the environment is our generation&apos;s responsibility, we have a better understanding about these issues.&quot; Oji, the plant&apos;s owners, had stated that the waste would be treated before being discharged into the sea but the locals are sceptical, convinced that they are not being told the truth about the extent of the pollution \u2013 let alone the outcome of the demonstrations. The local hospital reported that a dozen people were treated for light wounds, but rumours say that three people were killed in the clashes. The government is concerned by these demonstrations. An editorial in the People&apos;s Daily, the communist party organ, stated that &quot;the public is rapidly becoming aware of environmental issues and its rights&quot;, and went on to accuse local governments of failing to consult the people in such cases, but without suggesting any real alternatives. According to Yang Guobin, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who researches environmental activism, the government&apos;s response was typical of the Chinese leadership in President Hu Jintao&apos;s era. &quot;The government&apos;s response is typical of their &apos;wei wen&apos; approach [the policy of maintaining stability at all costs] and stopping any widescale demonstrations, by force if necessary. But should state coercion fail, the government will immediately make some concessions to prevent the movement from escalating. In all cases, it acts fast,&quot; summed up Yang. Li Wei regrets that the protest degenerated. &quot;It went too far, the local government offices suffered a great deal of damage. That&apos;s a waste, because the government&apos;s money is the people&apos;s money.&quot; But it was difficult for people to co-ordinate better. Official requests to hold the protest were turned down and the only environmental NGOs countenanced by the government are tolerated precisely because they steer clear of any confrontation. &quot;In future we will have to find a mechanism for consultation between the various parties concerned prior to any new industrial project,&quot; said Ma, the environmental activist. At the crossroads in the centre of Qidong, news of the people&apos;s victory was splashed across a massive advertising screen, where the government statement announced that the wastewater project was to be abandoned. Nevertheless, the government bussed in anti-riot police from around the province, just in case. Thousands of blue-uniformed police were stationed in the city while the khaki-clad armed police units in helmets and wielding truncheons, blocked all the streets in the centre. For Li, who had never taken part in a demonstration before, this was a reality check. Not because of the local police intervention \u2013 she heard Qidong police slipping in the occasional &quot;jia you!&quot; (go on!), an expression more commonly used to encourage athletes \u2013 but the ensuing state repression. &quot;They pulled us by the hair. They slapped one girl in the face,&quot; she exclaimed, before switching to English: &quot;I really wanted to say to them, &apos;Fuck you!&apos;&quot; This article originally appeared in Le Monde", "tags": ["Activism", "Pollution", "Environment", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Protest"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-21T11:30:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/22/lessons-education-singapore-gove", "sentences": ["South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai match Singapore&apos;s performance."], "title": "Lessons on education from Singapore | Michael Barber", "article": "The teenagers anxiously opening their GCSE results on Thursday will be wondering whether they might be among the last to do so. The future of GCSEs is in doubt, as we wait to see how the government moves forward with exam reform and who prevails in the coalition struggle over education policy. We know that the education secretary, Michael Gove, is impressed by Singapore&apos;s education system, and there is indeed much to admire. In Singapore, 15-year-olds are 10 months ahead of those in the UK in English. They are 20 months ahead in maths. South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai match Singapore&apos;s performance. So we most definitely have something to learn from Pacific Asia. The question is what? Eastern cultures have valued education for centuries: the belief is that\u00a0diligence will be rewarded. The &quot;talent myth&quot; that is ubiquitous in Atlantic societies \u2013 that either you&apos;re smart or you&apos;re not \u2013 is roundly rejected. Parents \u2013 such as &quot;tiger mothers&quot; \u2013 prize and prioritise education. Eastern governments do likewise. South Korea pays teachers well, and recruits the best graduates into teaching. It pays for that by having much larger classes; whereas across the Pacific California chose a class size cap, which in effect limited teachers&apos; pay. The former strategy worked; the latter didn&apos;t. When President Obama asked South Korea&apos;s President Lee about his biggest problem in education, he was told it was parental expectation. Nice problem to have. But at the very moment when Gove is looking east, the east is looking west. Leaders in Pacific Asia are realising that what worked in the last 50 years is not what will be required in the next 50. They have come to the conclusion that their economies need to become more innovative and their schools more creative. It is one thing for an education system to produce well-educated deferential citizens; another to produce a generation of innovators. They see that mastery of the basics, while essential, is not enough. When I talk about the future of the curriculum, including not just knowledge but also ability to lead by influencing those around you, I find a ready audience among leaders of Pacific Asian systems. People understand too that while exams are important, the obsession with them among parents can be dangerous. As the Chinese say, public exams are the batons that conduct the entire orchestra. If students are to develop well across the full range of this emerging curriculum, innovation in tests and exams will be essential. Hong Kong&apos;s new exam system began this year, after a decade of careful consultation with parents. The National Institute of Education in Singapore is a hub of innovation in assessment, while the OECD as a whole is looking to assess collaborative problem-solving from 2015 onwards. The best computer games may be a good pointer to the assessment revolution ahead. The educational challenge for Pacific Asia is to encourage greater diversity and individuality by building on its undoubted high standards in the basics. For Gove it is to match Pacific Asia&apos;s standards in the basics \u2013 which really are basic \u2013 while also developing the capacity to innovate that is evident in the US. As Arne Duncan, the US education secretary, told me: &quot;The US is still ahead in experimentation \u2026 we have many islands of excellence.&quot; However, the US struggles to apply to the system the lessons from those islands. In future, education systems will need to combine a high-quality, reliable system with the capacity to innovate at scale. Pacific Asian countries know this only too well and are beginning to move in the right direction. We don&apos;t yet know what Gove plans for the exam system. As he makes up his mind, it will be important for him to learn not just from where Singapore is, but also where it is heading.", "tags": ["Education", "Schools", "UK news", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Michael Gove", "Politics", "Singapore"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-22T18:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/aug/24/best-accessible-disabled-holidays", "sentences": ["In Shanghai, most popular sights are wheelchair-accessible."], "title": "Accessible holidays: all you need to know before you go", "article": "Travel resources Blind travellersHolidays for blind or visually impaired people, and sighted travellers (who get substantial discounts) can be booked through Traveleyes (08448 040 221, traveleyes-international.com).

The move by the students, who wore T-shirts saying &quot;Invite a Migrant Worker to a Meal&quot; was televised as a primetime entertainment.. This says much about the social attitudes towards migrant workers, who often come from the vast interior of the country. They make up half of China&apos;s urban workforce and account for half of the country&apos;s GDP. They are indispensable, and yet are the most socially marginalised group of workers in China. Yet rural migrants continue to suffer from deep-seated prejudice and discrimination. Not only are they denied access to public services in the cities due to the hukou (household registration) system, they are also subjected to day-to-day exclusion and abuse. You see them being talked to and shouted at like children in public places; you see them banned from hotel lobbies and posh restaurants. And as an angry blogger pointed out when observing open discrimination against rural migrants, he said that the &quot;No Dogs or Chinese&quot; signs put up by western colonialists in the 1920s and 1930s have been replaced by the &quot;No Dogs or Peasants&quot; signs at shopping malls in the cities. How have these become acceptable? Since Deng Xiaoping&apos;s reform and opening-up (gaige kaifang) era, the media has led the way in manufacturing images about rural migrants and reinforcing prejudice against them. The word &quot;peasant&quot; (nongmin) has always had negative connotations, either implying ignorance and lack of education or carrying a patronising tone, addressing passive masses receiving benevolence from the rulers. Since the 1980s and 1990s, the media began to widely use to the term &quot;blind flow&quot; (mangliu) to describe rural-to-urban migration, portraying an irrational, senseless and out-of-control migration of labour into the cities. This negative language has long shaped public views and sentiments towards rural migrants and further deepened the prejudice against them. Nongmin is a permanent social status that entails someone&apos;s inferior educational and cultural background as well as economic capabilities. As a segregated social class, nongmin carry the subordinated status with them wherever they migrate. I had a Chinese publisher questioning me about the dialogue I wrote for a rural migrant when he discussed politics. She said: &quot;How can a peasant speak like that? They aren&apos;t intelligent enough to analyse things that way.&quot; I also had a Chinese reporter saying to me: &quot;Don&apos;t trust what the peasants tell you; they would mislead you.&quot; Neither of them has had any experience working with anyone in the rural communities. This raises the question about the media&apos;s distance and lack of knowledge of the &quot;rural&quot; of which social imagery they have been shaping. Interestingly, Owen Jones, in his Chavs: The Demonisation of the Working Class, talked about a similar process where the media lacks contact with and knowledge of the class they are belittling. The media take on the role of demonising the working class, Jones says, and providing moral justification for the state to deny that class of entitlements. Similarly, the Chinese media manufacture &quot;inherent&quot; moral deficiency and characteristics of the nongmin in order to justify their lack of rights and entitlements. Thus the idea that nongmin are inherently much less intelligent and unable to make sense of their own reality; thus the idea that nongmin are &quot;a blind flow of labour crowding into the cities&quot; and they &quot;create social and economic problems&quot; for the urbanite. It is the equivalent of the Daily Mail in the UK \u2013 Jones quotes the Mail&apos;s remarks on the &quot;council-estate working class&quot;: &quot;These are the people who are getting sentimental about a vicious killer; they have no values, no morality and are so thick that they are beyond redemption.&quot; And then see Chinese bloggers condemning migrant workers in Yunnan who held a protest with their children holding placards &quot;Hand over my parents&apos; sweat and blood money!&quot; in order to claim back owed wages. One blogger sneered: &quot;What kind of parent would let their kids beg money for them?&quot; As China&apos;s rural migrants have had this class distinction stamped on them permanently, the only way their demands for social justice and equal rights can be justified is through the promotion of national economic interests and the greater good. One way to advance the rural migrants&apos; case for better access to public services in the cities is to argue that they could power consumer spending growth in China. As China Daily reports this week, &quot;The 230 million-strong migrant workforce drives China&apos;s economy, but a lack of access to education, health and other services \u2026 forces massive saving, restraining Beijing&apos;s efforts to shift growth&apos;s focus to consumption from investment.&quot; No media are able to talk about migrant workers&apos; basic rights. Social attitudes will take a long time to change in China, and the media is guilty of delaying that change. Rural migrants need to be treated as citizens, like everyone else, not as passive nongmin to be receiving occasional goodwill and charity. Much more needs to be done than taking migrants to a Chinese Valentine&apos;s dinner.", "tags": ["China", "Migration and development", "Global development", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-25T10:30:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/26/fernando-torres-didier-drogba-chelsea", "sentences": ["With the Ivorian gone to Shanghai Shenhua there is a different tone to the side."], "title": "Fernando Torres emerges from Didier Drogba's shadow to fire Chelsea", "article": "The loss of a formidable player may just have strengthened Chelsea. Didier Drogba sometimes looked as he was overshadowing team-mates as much as opponents. With the Ivorian gone to Shanghai Shenhua there is a different tone to the side. The memories of the forward will still be treasured, particularly because he secured the Champions League trophy with his last touch of the ball for Chelsea by converting the decisive penalty against Bayern Munich in the shootout. Even so, the presence exuded by Drogba could seem to intimidate those around him. Fernando Torres, in particular, sometimes looked cowed and did not take the field against Bayern until the 84th minute. &quot;I spoke to Fernando on the plane coming back from Munich,&quot; the Chelsea manager, Roberto Di Matteo, said, &quot;and told him I thought he was part of the future of this club. &quot;Understandably there&apos;s frustration when you don&apos;t start such a big game but ultimately we had a big success. Everybody was involved in that success, not just the ones who started the final. I was always very happy with Fernando. Towards the back end of last season he was fantastic. Maybe not scoring but being a provider and even when that doesn&apos;t happen he works very hard. He&apos;s a great team player.&quot; Torres had impact and influence against Newcastle United on Saturday. Indeed there was a certain style to Chelsea. It may have helped that Alan Pardew&apos;s team were drained as they returned to action less than 48 hours after the Europa League qualifier away to the Greek club Atromitos. Only two members of the lineup, Vurnon Anita and Papiss Ciss\u00e9, started both fixtures but it would still have felt like a hectic and debilitating few days. Worse still, Newcastle were taking on an invigorated Chelsea. The attacking Eden Hazard, who cost \u00a332m from Lille, does not resemble Gianfranco Zola but if this contest is any guide he, too, may scare opponents with his imagination and technique. Although it is much too early to tell whether the Belgian can sustain the impact as opponents devote ever more attention to him, his sheer ability surely cannot be suppressed entirely. Various factors contributed to the impression of a new Chelsea that will enhance the style. On other days, John Terry, would have been missed. He has a neck injury and will also be absent from Friday&apos;s Uefa Super Cup match with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Monaco through suspension. Chelsea were not presented with much of a test by Newcastle, whose firepower in attack seldom registered despite the commendable efforts of Hatem Ben Arfa. The menace of Di Matteo&apos;s men was always apparent. &quot;It&apos;s really hard to replace someone like Drogba,&quot; said the goalkeeper Petr Cech. &quot;But we&apos;ve got really talented players here and Fernando is scoring goals, which is another great thing. We also have Mata playing well, Lampard as well and they have all found a quick understanding in the midfield, which is great to see. &quot;Hazard can make a difference on his own and sometimes that&apos;s a key factor in a tight game. He takes people on and creates situations and openings. The first goal was the key. It helped us. Last season, they scored an early goal [in a 2-0 win], sat back and then tried to pick us off. It was completely different today.&quot; Chelsea&apos;s opening goal was the catalyst. Torres left Davide Santon in his wake and was brought down by Vurnon Anita, with Hazard converting the penalty with assurance in the 22nd minute. The victory was, in effect, clinched with a more spectacular effort. Following a smart back-heel from Hazard, Torres sent a drive soaring beyond the left hand of the goalkeeper Tim Krul. Many a side will flounder at Chelsea. That will be thin consolation for Newcastle but they still merit praise. The signings that Pardew has made at modest cost are still to be acclaimed but there was a demonstration at Stamford Bridge that great outlay tends to make a difference. &quot;I think we are realistic about where we think we are,&quot; Pardew said. &quot;I think we are in that group with Tottenham, Everton, Liverpool. But whether we can reach the dizzy heights of Man City, Man United, Chelsea \u2026 where they are now \u2026 it&apos;s going to be tough. But you&apos;ve got to believe you can. &quot;The only time I hear the word &apos;expectations&apos; from Newcastle fans is from journalists from the Midlands and London. But up north, they know. We will continue hopefully to excel this year and get a top- eight finish. Top five would be a great achievement.&quot; Chelsea showed on Saturday why their loftier ambitions are also appropriate.

This fourth win from four races this season for Audi means the marque has already taken the manufacturers&apos; championship, although this was almost a given since Toyota, the only other manufacturer entering a works car, is in its debut season, missed the first two races and had already had to accelerate their development program after Peugeot pulled out of the championship just before it began. For the drivers&apos; championship it means the winning driving trio have gone top of the table ahead of the German marque&apos;s sister drivers, Allan McNish and Tom Kristensen who finished third at Silverstone, by just 4.5 points. This means the race to crown the first sportscar world champion since the title was last officially contested in 1992 is likely to go down to the wire at the last race at Shanghai in October. Nonetheless, while the win belonged to Audi, Toyota will also take huge heart from a performance that proved they have become competitive at the top level in a remarkably short period of time. Their No7 TS030-Hybrid driven by Alexander Wurz, Nicolas Lapierre and Kazuki Nakajima, having qualified in third, was quickly on the pace. Wurz jumped Kristensen&apos;s No2 car, which McNish had put second on the grid, at the start but unlike at Le Mans where it took several hours for the car to match and better the Audis for performance, at Silverstone it had caught and overtaken the leading No1 e-Tron Quattro Audi hybrid of Lotterer within the first hour. Before the race there had been considerable debate about the winglets that Pascal Vasselon, technical director of Toyota, had added to the rear of the car to improve downforce, given that the width of the rear wing itself is very strictly defined but they had been declared legal, through his clever interpretation of the rules that defined them as part of the wheel arch, not the rear wing. They certainly seemed to be working as the Toyota pulled out a lead of just under 15 seconds after the first round of stops and the opening hour was completed. An advantage that suggests that if the rules loophole is not closed other teams will quickly pursue the winglet option for the remaining races. However raw pace, as ever in Endurance racing, is not the only factor and the petrol-driven Toyota had pitted four and five, respectively, laps ahead of the two chasing Audis which left the No1 and the No7 cars swapping the lead during pit stops throughout the race as Audi looked to run longer stints and make one less top than their rivals. The other Audi of McNish and Kristensen in the diesel-powered non-hybrid R18 Ultra had seen their challenge thwarted by a slow puncture towards the end of the second hour that was compounded when they were forced a lap down during a safety car period. Battling hard for the remainder of the race the pair came back strongly to finish 18.752sec behind the Toyota. At the sharp end there remained little between the two leaders but another safety car period with 90 minutes to go not only ensured that Audi could finish in the required seven stops but also split the Toyota from the front-running car, allowing Lotterer to take the chequered flag just under one minute ahead of the chasing Wurz. For Fassler, who with his colleagues have won the last two rounds of the championship, it was another step toward the drivers title. &quot;Four races left and things can change again but for sure we&apos;ve now had another step towards the goal we want to achieve at the end of the year,&quot; he said. Toyota, meanwhile, who are already out-performing in terms of expectation for a new car, expect only to carry the fight closer to their rivals. &quot;After the first pit stop it was looking difficult,&quot; said Lapierre. &quot;We were stopping two or three laps before them and also our refuelling time was just a disaster for us as we lost six seconds every time.&quot; &quot;On track we were very competitive and had the same kind of pace. It was very good and we are really getting better. The car has improved since Le Mans and now we just need to sort out the strategy and refuelling problem to fight better with them,&quot; he concluded. The Rebellion Racing Lola of Andrea Belicchi and Harold Primat took fourth to head the class of privateer LMP1 prototypes, with the ADR-Delta Oreca 03 Nissan leading home the LMP2 field. Ferrari again dominated the GTE-PRO class with the 458s of AF Corse and JMW taking first and second places.

When Dan Mintz, the man who&apos;s being called the gatekeeper to the Chinese market for Hollywood, talks about dealing with the communist party, he gets close to eastern mysticism. But stop there: that&apos;s exactly the kind of orientalist cliche that is out of step with the new box-office era, as the American studios and China&apos;s own film-makers readjust to the new clout of the country&apos;s film-goers, now the second most lucrative audience in the world. &quot;Everyone in Hollywood is trying to figure how to crack this market,&quot; says Mintz, &apos;How do we get in? What do we do with it?&apos; But you can&apos;t necessarily approach a film like that, &apos;cos it&apos;s not a widget business. We&apos;ve all seen those films. If you&apos;re trying to make soup, following a recipe, good luck.&quot; Mintz&apos;s company DMG (Dynamic Marketing Group) \u2013 a Beijing-based media agency with nearly 20 years&apos; experience \u2013 is getting into the business of fusion cuisine, cinematically speaking. The time-travel feature Looper, directed by Rian Johnson, will be their first attempt at simultaneously piquing the palates of US and Chinese audiences. The script was rewritten when DMG came on board, offering both finance (reportedly 40% of its $60m budget) and a crucial co-production status, which allowed the independent film to bypass China&apos;s foreign-film quota. Originally, Paris in 2077 had played a key role in the film, but Mintz insisted this be changed to Shanghai. DMG were never going to go for the hackneyed mainstream depictions of the country: yellow-peril skulduggery, dragons-and-lanterns romanticism, or the kind of fortune-cookie descents into Chinatown that recently got Men in Black 3 trimmed by Beijing censors. Mintz says that Looper is groundbreaking in one key respect: &quot;It&apos;s talking about China in the future, and there&apos;s never been a film that&apos;s done that. Even China has never made one.&quot; Press him for specifics about how the film deals with the potentially awkward geopolitical implications of the predictions game \u2013 like suggestions that his adopted country might be more powerful than the US \u2013 and he is a bit evasive, talking about fulfilling &quot;mutual visions&quot; and &quot;creative scenarios&quot;, and the &quot;humanity of the piece&quot; trumping the politics.     Gatekeeper \u2026 DMG's Dan Mintz.    I wonder if this isn&apos;t a taste of the face-saving obfuscation that is necessary to thrive in the modern Chinese business world. The 47-year-old Mandarin-speaking Staten Island native was ahead of the curve in choosing to set up in the country: he established DMG in Beijing in 1993, and built a business creating advertising spots for the global and local brands that benefited from the explosion of Chinese capitalism. He seems to have the knack of gently pushing the boundaries with the authorities: one pioneering campaign for Volkswagen was based around characters for virtues \u2013 &quot;loyalty&quot;, &quot;wisdom&quot;, &quot;ambition&quot; \u2013 that DMG wanted to associate with the cars. The traditional ideograms had been banned during the Cultural Revolution, but Mintz and his partners persuaded officials to regard them as artworks, not as symbols, allowing the campaign to pass. Hollywood is knocking on Mintz&apos;s door because of this kind of careful strategic insight. &quot;In the States, we&apos;re always focused on what the fans want, what the consumers want,&quot; he says, &quot;Whereas in China, there are two groups of people we need to be aware of: the government and the consumer. We look at that as access and relevancy. Some people have one but not the other, and that&apos;s when problems arise. Some people might have access but no one wants to go see it, or some people have a great movie, but can&apos;t get it into the country. That sweet spot is key.&quot; It&apos;s clear that, better than most western companies, DMG have cracked the access part of the equation: Looper, in an extended cut with more Chinese material, is getting a velvet-rope release at the start of the Golden Week holiday; other Hollywood hopefuls, like The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises, are still sometimes forced by the communist party to share release dates and cannibalise each other&apos;s profits. But relevancy is less simple, because DMG isn&apos;t solely targeting the domestic audience (though it makes those kinds of films, too). Mintz says they will make global movies, &quot;with China as the wind to our backs&quot; \u2013 but there&apos;s a tension between the two requirements. It may be surfacing in the production of Iron Man 3, whose Chinese hookup, with DMG on board as producers and distributors, was trumpeted back in April. There was some internet debate about how Marvel and DMG were going to make the film Sino-friendly, in particular mooted villain the Mandarin, who was a beard-stroking Fu Manchu knockoff in the comics. Then Iron Man 3&apos;s whole eastern direction seemed to be thrown into question when director Shane Black denied at Comic-Con there would be any first-unit presence in China at all. Mintz categorically says that Iron Man 3 will shoot in the country, and that announcements about Chinese actors will be made shortly. But Ben Kingsley is playing the Mandarin, and it&apos;s difficult not to detect some struggle over &quot;relevancy&quot;. As Mintz points out, the world&apos;s two biggest movie markets \u2013 the US and China \u2013 are also the most culturally different, and he has elected to marry the two. But then Mintz seems accustomed to performing balancing acts. He says that staying constantly aware of his environment has been the most important lesson he has learned; even his interview manner, a sort of scampering assemblage of points slightly unbecoming for a CEO, suggests empirical nosing-about, not fixed conclusions. Which brings us back to the importance of the right question. &quot;The first question a lot of people ask me is, &apos;What brought you to China?&apos; But that&apos;s not really the question,&quot; he says, &quot;The question is, &apos;Why&apos;d you stay?&apos; The reason is a moment in time. It was a realisation that what I could witness here, I could never witness again. I&apos;m from New York \u2013 greatest city in the world. But somebody already built that.&quot; \u2022 Looper is out in the UK on 28 September. After Hollywood is taking a break \u2013 and will be back on 2 October.

Their children would learn to read books in 20 seconds and identify poker cards by touch. The most talented would instantly see answers in their heads when presented with test papers. Around 30 pupils aged from seven to 17 were enrolled for the Shanghai summer course. But 10 days later their &quot;special abilities&quot; had not materialised. &quot;I found that my child learned nothing except how to cheat,&quot; one parent complained. Experts say the bizarre programme&apos;s popularity was simply an extreme example of how families seek to help their children in the intensely competitive education system. Chinese parents have long focused on the college entrance exam, the gaokao. Now families say they are caught in a chain, because good gaokao results depend on getting into a good high school, which, in turn, requires a good primary. Even some nursery schools in big cities have waiting lists and interviews. After-hours classes, weekend tutoring and summer courses are common before middle-class children hit their teens. Few are quite as spectacular as the Shanghai programme, which claimed it achieved remarkable results by training children to use the right-hand side of their brain. A tutor told an undercover reporter from the Oriental Morning Post that pupils learned to detect &quot;certain waves&quot; that emanated from everything, including words. Those waves were &quot;recorded in their brains as pictures&quot; so that they could read without even looking, she added. Police are now investigating the company behind the course. One angry father told the Guardian the teachers had convinced his daughter she really could read cards by touch. Though his tests proved her wrong, other parents were reluctant to accept the truth, he said. The case underlines the lengths to which parents will go to give their children a competitive edge, or simply help them keep up. Of the wider phenomenon, one Beijing mother, who has paid for extra English and maths lessons since her daughter was six \u2013 a year before she started primary school \u2013 said: &quot;Every kid is going to after-school classes nowadays. It&apos;s not only kids who are not good at school but also top students.&quot; Ms Wei, who asked that only her surname be used, said her previously carefree daughter was already showing signs of stress. &quot;But what can we do? If she fails to get into a good high school, her future won&apos;t be bright,&quot; she added. &quot;Kids have to fight fiercely in order to go to top schools. It&apos;s like a real battle with blood and bruises.&quot; Such anxieties are widespread. Last year research by the Pew Global Attitudes Project found that China was the only country in which most people \u2013 68% in all \u2013 thought parents put too much pressure on students. In contrast, 64% of Americans thought parents applied too little pressure. Children seem to agree. A 2010 study by British and Chinese researchers found that more than a third of the primary school pupils they surveyed in the eastern province of Zhejiang suffered headaches and stomach pains at least once a week. &quot;The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,&quot; said the researchers, who were led by Professor Therese Hesketh of the Centre for International Health and Development at University College London. Officials have already tried to curb some excesses. Earlier this year, Chinese media reported that the ministry of education had banned nursery schools from setting homework. But parenting expert Yin Jianli, who urges families to value creativity and independence, said it was also time for fathers and mothers to grow up. She acknowledged that people worried about their sons&apos; and daughters&apos; futures, but added: &quot;They won&apos;t let their children have a proper break during holidays. They know very little about education and child-rearing, but they have a strong sense of being competitive. So they will just follow other parents blindly.&quot; That was not just tough on the children, but counter-productive, she warned: &quot;In the short term, kids will feel tired. In the long run, they will lose their interest in studying.&quot; Additional research by Kathy Gao", "tags": ["China", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-28T15:04:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/28/the-fiver-tottenham-transfer-window", "sentences": ["Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka&apos;s adventures in China may be over sooner rather than later due to a barney between shareholders at Shanghai Shenhua."], "title": "The Fiver | Acclaim while wearing a leather cap | Paul Doyle", "article": "&apos;ARRY&apos;S GAME Some things are guaranteed to trigger nostalgia.

Yet, at 21, the versatile striker \u2013 who more normally operates wide but also potentially through the centre \u2013 fits Chelsea&apos;s criteria as they plan for the long-term to leave the Premier League club considering submitting a further bid before Friday&apos;s cut-off. Should that, too, be rejected they would aim to return when the market reopens. Chelsea&apos;s European Cup winning forward, Didier Drogba, visited Cobham on Tuesday while uncertainty surrounds his position at his new side, Shanghai Shenhua. The Chinese Premier League club&apos;s major shareholder and chairman, Zhu Jun, is seeking greater control having pumped more than \u00a360m into Shenhua in the last five-and-a-half years. If that control is not forthcoming, he is now threatening to contribute only 28.5% - matching his stake in the club \u2013 of the running costs, including players&apos; salaries. Both Drogba and Nicolas Anelka earn close to \u00a3250,000-a-week in Shanghai. Regardless, the Ivorian could yet return to Cobham to train with his former Chelsea team-mates in November once the Chinese domestic season ends. There are six league games still to be played, the final round of matches due on 3 November, with Drogba \u2013 whose family are still based in Surrey \u2013 likely to seek to maintain his fitness ahead of his involvement with the Ivory Coast at the African Cup of Nations in the new year.", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Bayer Leverkusen", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-28T23:52:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/29/wales-top-gastro-tourism-destination", "sentences": ["A touring kitchen showcasing Welsh food at festivals is going global, with visits to Singapore, Barcelona, Paris, Cologne, Shanghai, Washington and Dubai."], "title": "Wales becomes a top gastro-tourism destination", "article": "Bryn Williams is looking for a new butter.

Fantastic.&quot; Williams has long been banging the drum for Welsh food, serving up the finest produce from the valleys at his acclaimed London restaurant Odette&apos;s. Now, he has company \u2013 Wales is ready to be noticed, with a government-funded True Taste of Wales brand and a flurry of gastro-inspired initiatives. True, Wales has always been respected in food circles, chiefly for its renowned Abergavenny food festival, but now there is a concerted effort to put the country firmly on the global food map. A touring kitchen showcasing Welsh food at festivals is going global, with visits to Singapore, Barcelona, Paris, Cologne, Shanghai, Washington and Dubai. Gastro-tourism is growing, with young companies such as Snowdonia Safari taking visitors to sample local produce at homegrown businesses \u2013 think stewy cawl and Welsh cakes \u2013 and Turnstone Tours taking tourists to people&apos;s houses for home cooking. And it is paying off, with companies reporting increased business. &quot;One beer company&apos;s exports have grown from 5% to 17% in the past three years,&quot; says Nerys Howell, True Taste food consultant. Wales is also listed as one of the top three destinations for gastro-tourism, according to the journal Rural Geographies. &quot;People are discovering how good their produce is,&quot; says Shaun Hill, from Michelin-starred The Walnut Tree, near Abergavenny. &quot;We have first-class lamb, good beef, game, cheese and some very good charcuterie such as Trealy Farm&apos;s. Wales has always been a poor country so the culture is simple food \u2013 baking, and good meat or fish.&quot; Ah, the produce, testament to Wales&apos;s grassy slopes, mountainous farmland and, as Williams says, the fact that &quot;it never stops bloody raining&quot;. Speak to most chefs in Wales about the country&apos;s produce and their eyes grow dewy. &quot;The coastline is fabulous,&quot; says Stephen Terry, from The Hardwick, Abergavenny. &quot;Great crab and lobsters, fantastic Welsh samphire, salt-marsh lamb and cheese. Perl wen kicks the ass\u00a0off brie.&quot; There is a strong spirit of localism. &quot;Research shows that 80% of visitors are looking for a Welsh food experience,&quot; says Howell. Elisabeth Luard, author of A Cook&apos;s Year in a Welsh Farmhouse, points out an interesting mix: &quot;Incomers are keen on green self-sufficiency; locals, who lived isolated lives on the mountains, have a tradition of necessity.&quot; Most people bake, she says, many own pigs and chickens, and she used to get home-churned butter from her neighbours. So what are chefs rustling up? Terry does a Welsh rarebit made with pressed ham hocks, acclaimed Hafod cheese and Welsh beer (&quot;there&apos;s a brewery in virtually every valley&quot;), Black Mountains Smokery smoked salmon with laverbread (made from seaweed) and rye bread from nearby award-winning baker Alex Gooch. Back at Odette&apos;s, Williams does a light bara brith (&quot;speckled bread&quot;), a Welsh cheeseboard \u2013 perl las, caerphilly and perl wen \u2013 with Welsh buttermilk soda bread and panna cotta. Then there&apos;s Welsh black beef, pedigree Welsh pork and mutton \u2013 and, of course, slow-roasted Welsh lamb (new season and salt marsh).&quot;They would kill me at home if I didn&apos;t!&quot; For Williams, who has staked his reputation on bigging-up Welsh food, its growing clout is vindication. &quot;I&apos;m known as a chef who uses Welsh ingredients,&quot; he says, &quot;It took years to gain the confidence to stick it on the menu.

There it stands, mouth-wateringly: &quot;My darkest depths were in that vessel, a chalice I had crossed the earth to evade \u2026 I was holding my soul, distilled into liquid and aching to be reunited with my body.&quot; Tristram refrains from tasting it, though afterwards, on his way to an AA meeting, he surreptitiously &quot;suckled the knuckle the stout had doused&quot;. It&apos;s only a matter of time, for, suckler or sucker, Tristram shares in the infantilism of his compatriots as they savour Ireland&apos;s boom. At the airport to meet the returnee is Hickey, old schoolmate, corrupt builder, with a financial proposition. And on the phone is his unseen mentor and demon, the sinister Monsieur Deauville. Is it credible that the patrician Tristram is so matey with the foul-mouthed Hickey? Don&apos;t ask. There are no realistic characters in The Devil I Know, only savage caricatures. In this carnivalesque allegory of Ireland&apos;s property boom, Claire Kilroy presents a satiric danse macabre of brio and linguistic virtuosity. The profiteers are an array of vulpine nasties and asinine greedies who&apos;ve sold both soul and reason to Old Nick. Tristram, scion of an ancient Anglo-Norman house, has unknowingly sold his birthright for a mess of potage. As the novel opens, the year is 2016 and Tristram is testifying at a tribunal delving into the Celtic Tiger&apos;s dodgy dealings. Kilroy&apos;s novel is a fable whose moral we already know: Ireland, spending money it didn&apos;t have, lost everything it did have. It&apos;s a dark divertimento that runs on linguistic verve and energy, a madly saturnalian style for a berserk era. Her Ireland is populated by ghouls and asses, with Tristram harbouring a bit of both. As in Tristram Shandy, another cock and bull story, the hero&apos;s brain is a flimsy organ: Sterne&apos;s Tristram acknowledges, &quot;So often has my judgment deceived me in my life, that I always suspect it.&quot; Kilroy&apos;s Tristram, appointed &quot;Director, Castle Holdings&quot;, exists in a state of existential bafflement, goggling at the fact that his shell company &quot;bought nothing, sold nothing, manufactured nothing, did nothing&quot;, with tremendous profits. &quot;Me? I was only the conduit,&quot; he tells the judge. But indeed nobody in the book understands the nature of money. Money&apos;s something provided by banks, to be handed to corrupt government ministers such as Ray Lawless. This bent politican arrives in person to collect his bribe, a &quot;rain-coloured man&quot; carrying off a Jiffy Bag stuffed with cash &quot;under his arm like a hog&quot;. The grand dreams and schemes cherished by Hickey, Viking and the other wannabe-billionaires are all funded by debt. The prostitution of the motherland to property developers begins in Tristram&apos;s cession of his maternal inheritance, Hilltop, for an apartment complex whose value increases exponentially by the day. The ventures of the so-called &quot;Golden Circle&quot; hyperinflate to plans for a new urban quarter for Dublin, &quot;to annex London&quot;, &quot;to purchase Britain&quot;, Shanghai, the world. The wine drunk by these dreamers is &quot;rich in tannin&quot;, blackening their lips, hearts, souls. They laugh &quot;in a medieval display of mettle&quot;, padding around the boardroom &quot;in an exhausted delirium, the mark of the plague still staining their lips&quot;. A blackly comic afflatus swells until its essential bathos punctures it. I was reminded of Ben Jonson&apos;s Sir Epicure Mammon and the Jacobean world of The Alchemist and Volpone \u2013 but Kilroy&apos;s banal modern clones lack lascivious imagination. &quot;They are all the same. Boyler, Coyler, Doyler, sitting sharpening their knives.&quot; What The Devil I Know fails to do is to give the reader a sense of how the grand scam affected ordinary people when, with the international banking crisis, the world economy collapsed. On the other hand, its feeling for the rape of nature, both landscape and animals, is powerful and poignant. The scene of lobsters being barbecued is one I shall flinchingly remember: the intoxicated profiteers don&apos;t bother to kill them before cooking, and the seared creatures escape, dropping to the floor, scurrying for shelter, stamped on and replaced. And still they won&apos;t die. &quot;Christ \u2026 it&apos;s still alive.&quot; The insult to nature is not the least of the squanderers&apos; sins and a sign of their twisted minds. The savage indignation of such a scene taps into the darkness of the finest Irish satire. \u2022 Stevie Davies&apos;s Into Suez is published by Parthian.", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-31T21:55:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/01/transfer-window-premier-league", "sentences": ["The deals (selected) \u25b6 Eden Hazard, Lille, \u00a332m; C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Marseille, \u00a37m; Oscar, Internacional, \u00a320m; Victor Moses, Wigan \u00a39m; Marko Marin, Werder Bremen \u00a37m; Thorgan Hazard, Lens, \u00a31m; \u25c0 Didier Drogba, Shanghai Shenhua, free; Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa, QPR free; Rhys Taylor, Southend free; Salomon Kalou, Lille, free; Romelu Lukaku, WBA, loan; Sam Hutchinson, Nottm Forest, loan; Thibaut Courtois, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, loan; Matej Delac, Guimar\u00e3es, loan; Sam Walker, Bristol Rovers, loan Everton Did they get what they wanted?"], "title": "The transfer window: Premier League club-by-club comings and goings", "article": "Arsenal  Did they get what they wanted?

A summer that saw Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Clint Dempsey sold to Spurs can hardly feel satisfactory, though Martin Jol and the Fulham hierarchy have been creative with their replacements.

Possibly, and Javi Garc\u00eda&apos;s late arrival certainly cheered up Roberto Mancini who had seen Robin van Persie go to Manchester United and spent the summer moaning about Brian Marwood, who controls the City transfer budget.

Pretty much and they also did their business early, enabling Brian McDermott, the Reading manager, to integrate the new signings during pre-season.

Southampton broke their transfer record over the course of the summer, which points to proper ambition to retain their place back in the Premier League.

In Tony Pulis&apos;s eyes, probably not. The Stoke manager used his programme notes last Sunday to stress the importance of strengthening but after years of heavy investment the club has spent carefully.

Martin O&apos;Neill wanted to add goals and trickery to his team and did so in the shape of Steven Fletcher and Adam Johnson, while also pruning an overblown, poorly balanced, squad.

Paying \u00a32m for Michu, the highest scoring midfielder in La Liga last season, could be the best signing of the summer and there is understandable excitement about the arrival of Ki Sung Yeung and the club-record deal that brought Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez to south Wales on deadline day.

But it was strikers in absentia who hogged the limelight. The Liverpool manager admitted he would never have loaned Andy Carroll to West Ham United had he foreseen Friday&apos;s non-transfer deadline day and will consider an Anfield return for Michael Owen. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger appeared mildly irritated as he entered the Anfield press room having been made to wait an age to review Arsenal&apos;s first win of the season by Rodgers&apos;s inquest into Liverpool&apos;s shambolic end to the transfer window. Wenger was lucky he was not kept waiting all night. A rift has opened between the Liverpool manager and the club&apos;s owners, Fenway Sports Group, after they refused to offer more than \u00a34m to Fulham for Clint Dempsey 24 hours after Carroll&apos;s exit and Rodgers&apos;s diplomacy could not disguise it. Asked if he would have sanctioned Carroll&apos;s move knowing what was to come on Friday, Rodgers said only: &quot;No.&quot; Asked how confident he was that a replacement was coming in when he allowed Carroll to go, he said: &quot;Very.&quot; It was the admission that Owen is under consideration eight years after leaving Anfield and four months after being released by Manchester United that showed the desperation that now prevails. &quot;Any player that I believe can improve the squad I will look at. No question,&quot; added Rodgers. &quot;We have a very small group \u2013 19 players trained [on Saturday], with young players amongst that. I cannot say no.&quot; Owen has been offered a two-year contract worth a basic \u00a31.5m a year by Stoke and can sign at any time as a free agent. Didier Drogba is not an option at presentas his contract with Shanghai Shenhua has not been cancelled. How Arsenal revelled in Anfield&apos;s problems. Off the pitch, their supporters chanted &quot;Andy Carroll, he would have scored that&quot; as Jonjo Shelvey squandered a late chance. On it, the summer signings Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla scored Arsenal&apos;s first league goals of the season while Theo Walcott, a player Rodgers had hoped to sign and will make a renewed attempt for in January, sat on the bench throughout. Liverpool had their moments and three penalty claims denied by the referee, Howard Webb, but otherwise no complaints at a merited defeat. This may not be the free-flowing, expansive Arsenal side of old but their midfield trio of Abou Diaby, Mikel Arteta and Santi Cazorla dominated their opponents and a third clean sheet of the season supported Wenger&apos;s conviction that the potential for vast improvement exists. Rodgers, by contrast, has yet to record a league win as Liverpool manager and this is the club&apos;s worst start after three games since 1962. Whatever the ramifications from Liverpool&apos;s non-event of a transfer deadline day, Rodgers started with a potent lineup improved from last Sunday&apos;s draw with Manchester City by the return from suspension of Daniel Agger and the full debut of Nuri Sahin. Fabio Borini put efforts high and wide, Agger should have done better with a free header from a Steven Gerrard corner and Raheem Sterling spun and shot against the outside of the post after a knockdown from the Liverpool captain. Gerrard&apos;s attempt at a first-time pass to Luis Su\u00e1rez deep into Arsenal territory was to have damaging consequences, however. Podolski intercepted it and played a good ball through to Cazorla before sprinting half the length of the pitch for the return. Cazorla, calmness and awareness personified, delivered the return Podolski&apos;s effort deserved and the German international buried Arsenal&apos;s first league goal under Reina into the far corner of the goal in front of the Kop. Olivier Giroud then wasted a clear chance to open his Arsenal account before Cazorla put the game beyond Liverpool. Again it was easily avoidable. The Spain international compounded a bad week for Liverpool and Reina \u2013 guilty of a poor error against Hearts in midweek \u2013 when he exchanged passes with Podolski and tried his luck with a shot hard and low. The ball flew under his compatriot&apos;s grasp and in. Rodgers said: &quot;The goals we conceded had nothing to do with systems or style, or the tactical element. We gave the ball away for the first goal and didn&apos;t do well enough to stop the shot. The second goal, we had enough bodies behind the ball to defend the goal. These are the hard yards you have to put in early on but I wouldn&apos;t change it for anything.&quot; Liverpool had appealed loud but in vain for second half penalties when Per Mertesacker wrestled with Su\u00e1rez and when the ball hit Thomas Vermaelen&apos;s arm, but rarely threatened a recovery. It was, in the grand scheme of things, the least of Rodgers&apos;s concerns. As he explained: &quot;It is a learning process for the owners as well. They have come in and invested well over \u00a3100m and then they have made the change for whatever reason and one of the most iconic figures in the club&apos;s history has left. They made the change and made a big commitment to have me here for the longer term. &quot;I have a group of people I worked well with and the owners have been very up front and honest with me. I have no problem with that. There are obviously one or two things we need to iron out but the owners have been very honest and haven&apos;t misled me in any way whatsoever. There are operational things we need to sort out and if we do that, that will help us in the next transfer window. &quot;I have spoken to people back in America since Friday. They have my thoughts. We move on and will reflect on it next week. The reality is not a lot is done in January but we certainly need help.&quot; He would not expand any further. &quot;It&apos;s gone,&quot; said Rodgers on the issue of Carroll, who can be recalled by Liverpool in January. The optimism and tranquillity he had hoped to find at Anfield has vanished too.

But not the skanky plastic garbage peddled by Maccy D&apos;s, KFC and their ilk. Instead, I might have a crisp, lightly browned dosa (rice and lentil crepe) with coconut chutney for breakfast, pav bhaji (bread rolls with a buttery vegetable hash) for lunch and chaat (a spicy mix of potatoes, yoghurt, onions, tomatoes, cilantro and crispy bits) for a snack. Usually, these will cost me about Rs 50 (about 50p), less than a McDonald&apos;s veggie burger, which goes for Rs 59. They will be healthier, tastier, fresher. The recent announcement by McDonald&apos;s that it is launching a veggie restaurant in India had me bellowing &quot;What fresh hell is this?&quot; It&apos;s the culinary equivalent of selling ice to Inuits. Inuits may not have more than a hundred words for snow \u2013 apparently it&apos;s an urban myth \u2013 but I can assure you that Indians have many more than a hundred varieties of veggie fast food, not just a plain one-size-fits-all potato patty. Oh, I have tried McDonald&apos;s veggie offerings, the ones carefully created for my primitive brown taste buds after years of research. Once. The dull McAloo Tikki burger is not a patch on the infinitely more delicious crispy alu tikkis with tamarind chutney found at any street vendor. Their McSpicy Paneer is a cop-out, falling back on that bland veggie standby: paneer. It&apos;s the insipid nut roast of India, the tofu of timidity. Cleanliness, you say? Nope. Even if you are a foreigner with a stomach like tissue paper, you are better off eating piping hot, fresh dosas from a busy street vendor than you are eating stale fast food. India has always had homegrown chains of veggie fast food joints which are every bit as clean and quality conscious as McDonald&apos;s, perhaps even more so. And I&apos;d rather give my money to a small business owner than a McCorporation. But hey, I am not going to sermonise. Or even tell you, Morgan Spurlock-style, that veggie burgers are killing you slowly. I don&apos;t need to. After almost 16 years in India, McDonald&apos;s has just over 250 outlets here, which, in such a massive country, is pocket change. I suspect that Indians are smart enough to know which side of their pav bhaji is buttered. Sure, broke students and tubby kids hankering after plastic toys will continue to eat there, but there will also be plenty like me who shun the Golden Arches in favour of a truly happy and tasty meal. \u2022 Kavitha Rao is a Bangalore-based journalist Andrew Tobert: I&apos;m lovin&apos; it      There are few more powerful symbols than the Golden Arches. For me, they represent at once the homogenising influence of market forces, the evil of industrialised agriculture, the obesity crisis. And the last time I was truly happy. McDonald&apos;s, from the first time I crossed its air-conditioned threshold, has offered a place of sanctuary and calm. The smell of whatever-that-smell-is wafting through the air and the happy children, joyous with additives swirling around their blood streams. This is where I&apos;ve had my best thoughts, my most cherished memories. This is where I can truly be me. And I&apos;m not alone. From Shanghai to Chicago, kids, pensioners, lawyers and students come and are welcome. However much people might not want this to be true, McDonald&apos;s is the global restaurant \u2013 the place that unites humanity. You might find better, cheaper food elsewhere, but that&apos;s not going to convince Parisian school kids or London lawyers coming back for more. I used to go three times a week (and yes, dear readers, I was a fat child). I wasn&apos;t just lovin&apos; it, I was stalking it on Facebook, and naming our soon-to-be-children. But three months ago, my life changed for ever. I became vegetarian (something about climate change and global hunger, but I forget the details). My place of solace was now closed off. Of course when I walk by a restaurant, it looks as it always has. As I stand on the street corner, I see people laughing, enjoying themselves. I want to go in, and share the things that make us human. But I know I can&apos;t, the temptations will be too much. The Chicken Selects, the Big Mac, the fries (I could go on), so delicious and so stunningly cheap. I miss them. A lot. But I made my choice, and I must accept the consequences. So there&apos;s me, outside. An outcast in a meat-eating world. But perhaps not for much longer. That&apos;s why a McDonald&apos;s veggie restaurant in India fills me with unadulterated joy and hope. Yes, there are haterz, there always are. And to them I say, whatevs. Indians won&apos;t all become obese overnight, and their cuisine isn&apos;t going to suddenly disappear. Maybe Indian vegetarians, like their meat-eating peers the world over, watch McDonald&apos;s ads and think &quot;you know what, that looks cool&quot;. And isn&apos;t that a wonderful thing? That we live in a world where people can pick and choose the best of global culture, regardless of where they were born? McDonald&apos;s is the global emancipator. May its benevolence spread far and wide. But first, could the veggie outlets spread to London? Say, Hackney, E9. Then I won&apos;t feel a stab of jealousy every time I pass a branch. And maybe then I can stop resenting being a vegetarian, and start actually enjoying it.

This was, in principle, an easy experiment to do, the apparatus simple and the &quot;correct&quot; answer of 9.81 ms\u20132 known to each and every one of them. How could it go wrong? The catch was that they were asked to measure this quantity with an accuracy of 1 part in 1,000 \u2013 in other words, to get that second decimal place right. In practice, very few of them managed to get their experiments (using a compound pendulum) working that precisely. Values of over 10 ms\u20132 were far from uncommon, although generally that was because they&apos;d forgotten how to use a calculator because of the stress of the unfamiliar and daunting new surroundings; or maybe they&apos;d been up all night getting to know their new college neighbours over a few drinks. The primary aim of the experiment was to teach the students about errors: where they turn up and their different manifestations. Since the experiment had intrinsically various sources of error, they also had to get to grips with how to deal with accounting for them all adequately; they needed to be able to estimate whether or not they had got close to the requested &quot;1 part in 1,000&quot; accuracy. It was combining the errors that used to throw the students more than anything else, leading to some of their answers being so wildly wrong. Beyond actually doing these calculations, the conceptual take-home message we wanted to convey was the difference between systematic and random errors, since these turn up all over the place \u2013 in practice way beyond the undergraduate physics laboratory. Random errors are the ones with which people tend to be familiar. In this particular experiment, involving timing the swing of a pendulum accurately, there is an obvious source of error arising from how fast your reflexes are and how accurately you can judge the precise moment at which to stop the stopwatch at the end of one swing. Timing over more swings reduces the contribution of this random error to the precision with which the fundamental quantity, the period of a single swing, can be determined. As long as the stopwatch is accurate, that should be that. But when it came to the distance measurements, all we supplied were crude wooden metre rules that were often rather beaten up by previous generations of students \u2013 maybe they were warped, maybe worn away at the ends so that the first millimetre was missing. In this case, as well as the random error, a systematic error could be present which, however many times they did the measurement and however meticulously, would lead to inaccuracy if not taken into account. These sorts of error are pernicious if not spotted; they are also depressingly common. The story about &quot;faster than light neutrinos&quot; earlier this year was a case in point. As soon as the Italian team published their apparently extraordinary results, admittedly with many warnings that they feared there might be an undetected problem with the data, everyone started looking for where a systematic error might lurk.  It could have been in the measurement of the precise distance between the source of the neutrinos and the data collection point \u2013 a total distance of around 730km. If this distance had been mismeasured by a mere 20 metres (one part in 40,000), the result could have been rationalised.  In fact the source of the problem turned out to be a combination of two electronic faults: a dodgy connection causing the time measured to be shorter than it should have been, partially compensated by the oscillator underpinning the timing ticking slightly too slowly, lengthening the time by a small amount. These two effects led to a small but ever-present error in the timing. Repeating the experiment many times made no difference, which was why the team were misled into believing the neutrinos really might be travelling faster than light. They felt they had checked everything carefully before they went public. In fact they hadn&apos;t.  As I say, such systematic errors are pernicious and ubiquitous. In this case it also cost the team leader his job. But systematic errors turn up away from physics experiments in ways that can also trick the unwary. Academics and universities are constantly being &quot;measured&quot; in various ways. These measurements are as likely to be systematically inaccurate as any other, yet they can imply a spurious accuracy that can in turn affect both policy and funding.  For instance, the distribution of money between university teaching and research is based in part on the responses from academics to a Time Analysis Survey. The aims are laudable, the motivations of academics no doubt equally so, and yet no one is actually going to sit down and attribute each moment of the day precisely; indeed it would be totally impracticable to do so.  As a result, numbers are produced with random errors arising from uncertainty as to how different tasks fit under the different headings (of which there are many) and because it&apos;s hard to account accurately for exactly how long was spent on each. But there are also systematic errors present because (since we as academics don&apos;t count very precisely) we may round up and down in different ways for different tasks because of what we internally expect we should be doing. As for those frequent league tables ranking universities \u2013 within the UK or internationally \u2013 these have a different kind of systematic error in so far as you really have to read the small print to know what is actually being measured. As a result, with several newspapers producing their own ranking, it is possible for most Russell Group universities to be able to say they are in the top 10 in one list or the other.  Internationally, one much quoted example \u2013 which university administrations may put much store by \u2013 is the Shanghai Jiao Tong, a league table that is heavily weighted towards research. It includes factors such as the number of university Nobel prizewinners, but basically doesn&apos;t take into account the quality of teaching provided and other factors important to incoming students such as expenditure on libraries. It won&apos;t, therefore, be really very useful for an aspiring undergraduate to use. But they may well not appreciate that the things they care about are systematically absent, if they simply look at the headlines. My message is simple: when reading figures that look convincing and precise, you should always stop and question what, if anything, is missing. The need for accountability by government from the higher education sector means collectively we are constantly being measured in ways that may or may not have any precision.  For a warped metre rule, it is easy enough to carry out a calibration against a steel ruler much more resistant to distortion and destruction than the wood. For many other situations, no such simple remedy exists.", "tags": ["Physics", "Science policy", "Science", "Higher education", "Research", "Research funding", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-06T11:30:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/06/andy-murray-atp-world-tour-finals", "sentences": ["After the US Open, Murray will have ranking points to defend \u2013 he claimed a clean sweep in Asia last year winning in Bangkok, Tokyo and Shanghai \u2013 before he heads back to London."], "title": "Andy Murray's US Open progress secures place in ATP World Tour Finals", "article": "Andy Murray&apos;s US Open quarter-final victory over Marin Cilic has guaranteed him a place in the ATP World Tour Finals at the end of the year.

JLR has expanded rapidly in its home UK market in recent years, adding 8,000 jobs owing to strong demand from markets such as China and the US. Its chief executive, Ralf Speth, said the Indian-owned company had to &quot;go where the markets are&quot;. Speaking as JLR launched a new Range Rover built in Solihull, Speth said the next JLR plant will be near Shanghai if it receives approval from the Chinese government. &quot;That is absolutely clear \u2013 the next one will be outside the UK,&quot; he said. Speth added that plans to open an assembly plant in Brazil, similar to a JLR facility in India, where parts are shipped over and assembled, had been stymied by regulatory problems. &quot;We really intend to go to Brazil and do something there. At the moment it is on hold because of the regulatory schemes, in terms of taxes and duties,&quot; he said. Speth declined to comment on reports that the Tata conglomerate, JLR&apos;s owner, is also interested in opening a car plant in Saudi Arabia. Tony Woodley, the former joint leader of the Unite trade union, has raised concerns that JLR&apos;s expansion plans appear to be focused on the Bric nations, but Speth said JLR had underlined its commitment to the UK in recent years, including the introduction last month of 24-hour shifts at its Halewood plant on Merseyside. JLR owns three car plants in the West Midlands and Merseyside and has announced plans for an engine plant in Wolverhampton. &quot;Two and a half years ago we discussed closing plants here in the UK and I am happy we did not do so,&quot; said Speth. However, he refused to commit himself to further expansion in the UK. &quot;A new plant is a huge investment, a huge commitment.&quot; The Chinese project is a joint venture with China&apos;s Chery and will see JLR launch a new car alongside its own products. Speth said a \u00a3370m upgrade of JLR&apos;s manufacturing facilities had enabled the birth of the fourth-generation Range Rover, which was unveiled on Thursday night in London. The Range Rover Sport was JLR&apos;s biggest seller last year, when the company sold more than 314,000 vehicles, up 29% on the previous year.

Taras Grescoe is proud to be \u2013 in Thatcher&apos;s estimation, at least \u2013 a failure. Although he can drive, the Canadian author, who is in his mid-40s, has never owned a car. And he is not alone. Half the population of cities such as New York, Toronto and London do not own cars. Every day some 155 million people take the underground. And although being a straphanger in North America may be,\u00a0as Grescoe shows, a &quot;depressing experience&quot; due to underfunding and bad planning, elsewhere public transport \u2013 particularly in cities \u2013 is enjoying a renaissance. The heyday of the car has passed. In this passionately argued and important book, Grescoe takes the reader on a whistle-stop tour of world cities and their transport systems. He accuses the private car of destroying cities, turning streets into kill-zones for the vulnerable, polluting the air and burning up increasingly scarce fossil fuels. Although the scope of Straphanger is global, it clearly targets car-loving, gas-guzzling North America and the statistics he cites are truly shocking. In the US \u2013 &quot;the most extravagantly motorised nation in the history of the world&quot; \u2013 vehicles now outnumber drivers by five to four. Los Angeles, once hailed as an &quot;autopia&quot;, is now the most congested city in the US with drivers wasting 72 hours a year stuck in traffic jams \u2013 Americans now spend nine years of their lives sitting in their cars, and the pollution they produce kills 30,000 US citizens each year. But change is in the air. In 2009, the total number of cars in the US shrank. In its early days in office, the Obama administration conjured up visions of a new golden age of public transport, offering funding for ambitious rail and subway schemes. Streetcars, which used to be the main mode of public transport in American cities, are being reintroduced in such unlikely places as Houston and Denver and, in 2010, public transport use reached a 54-year high. In this suburban nation, people are also moving back into the cities. Recently released figures from the 2011 US census show that many of the largest cities are now growing faster than their suburbs, the first time this has happened in a century. This trend is being led by young Americans, many of whom are also choosing not to learn to drive but are instead relying on bicycles and public transport. Even New York&apos;s billionaire mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is now known as the &quot;straphanger mayor&quot;, riding the subway a couple of times a week. Although, as Grescoe notes, he is taken to the subway stop by chauffeured SUV. Surprisingly for a book about public transport, London is not one of the cities Grescoe visits. Indeed the city is only mentioned for its &quot;criminally expensive&quot; tube tickets, the failed experiment of privatisation in 2003 and the lack of air conditioning (&quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;). Today more than a billion passenger journeys a year are made on the London Underground, a figure equalled by the subway system of New York and the Paris M\u00e9tro. Although Shanghai didn&apos;t open its first line until 1995, its rapidly expanding metro has now become the longest subway network in the world and Moscow&apos;s underground is one of the busiest, carrying nine million people a day, a figure matched only by Tokyo. Grescoe stops off at all these cities. It was in Paris that Blaise Pascal invented modern urban public transport in 1662 with the &quot;carosses \u00e0 cinq sols&quot;, carriages that ran along five fixed routes in the city, although sadly only for the gentry. Today the M\u00e9tro &quot;is the most ingenious and efficient transit network ever built&quot;. Parisian subway trains have been using autopilot technology since the 1970s but now fully automatic trains are being introduced. Grescoe is impressed by Shanghai&apos;s subway. Yet above ground the people have swapped bikes for cars, as they embrace a consumerist lifestyle. The result is congestion and pollution: the air in the city&apos;s streets has become a health hazard. Moscow&apos;s roads are also choked: it is &quot;traffic hell&quot;. But its palatial Metro, built in the 30s, is &quot;designed to ennoble and uplift the long-suffering straphangers of the world&quot;. In the Russian capital it&apos;s the only way to travel. In Tokyo he visits Shinjuku, with some 3.5 million commuters passing through every day. In comparison, the busiest station in the US is New York&apos;s Penn Station which handles a paltry 600,000 commuters. Grescoe is right to marvel at the &quot;fantastic clockwork&quot; of Tokyo&apos;s transport system: it is &quot;the world&apos;s best example of a transit metropolis \u2026 a city built, and now kept running, by its trains&quot;. Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, former mayor of the Colombian capital Bogot\u00e1, which revolutionised its public transport with a bus rapid transit scheme, makes a powerful point to Grescoe: &quot;I believe a city is more civilised not when it has highways but when a child on a tricycle is able to move about everywhere with ease and safety.&quot; In too many places multi-lane highways have sliced through the cityscape, destroying communities and creating barriers between districts. But the act of driving also fundamentally changes the way people use the city. Inside cars, people are insulated from the sights and sounds of the city and isolated from other citizens. By contrast, public transport is a democratic and a social experience. In Tokyo someone tells Grescoe: &quot;To use public transport is to know how to cooperate with other people, how to behave in a public space.&quot; Good public transport is essential to the success of any world city. Grescoe argues that North America has fallen far behind Asia in its public transport infrastructure, and it &quot;will be paying the price, in terms of lost competitivity, for decades to come&quot;. This is a warning for every city. But even in North America a quiet revolution is taking place in the way people travel. And this is happening in cities everywhere, as people from Philadelphia (the city with the highest percentage of Americans who commute on foot) to Copenhagen (&quot;the world&apos;s most bikeable city&quot;) realise that the car is no longer an indispensable part of urban life in the 21st century. \u2022 PD Smith&apos;s City: A Guidebook for the Urban Age is published by Bloomsbury.", "tags": ["Society", "Books", "Culture", "London Underground"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-07T10:52:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/09/rodney-uren-obituary", "sentences": ["Headhunted by Foster&apos;s office, he went to work on the interior of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters, which won awards all over the world, and was also part of a team that designed a table and workstation system which now sit in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York."], "title": "Rodney Uren obituary", "article": "My father, the architect and designer Rodney Uren, who has died of lymphoma aged 63, left a profound mark on the cities of London, Bilbao, Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.

Environmentally sensitive and beautifully engineered and detailed, it expresses many of Rodney&apos;s design ideals.

He grew up in the grassy open countryside of Geelong, in Victoria, south-east Australia, before the city&apos;s main industrialisation. Rodney started studying industrial design locally at the Gordon Institute of Technology, where the syllabus was strongly biased toward Bauhaus principles. Headhunted by Foster&apos;s office, he went to work on the interior of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters, which won awards all over the world, and was also part of a team that designed a table and workstation system which now sit in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Endlessly innovative, Rodney constantly sketched, designed, painted and created cartoons. Most recently he wrote the libretto for a musical, Masterpiece, and a novel, The Train Salesman. He was a gifted, self-taught guitarist who in his youth led a group called the Reigning Cats and Dogs. An extraordinary man, he will be remembered for his originality, creative spirit, sense of humour and kindness.

Being her must be truly exhausting. Her starring role in a Shanghai play has come to a close, but there&apos;s a new contemporary dance production; a television talkshow to host; guest spots as a judge on a TV talent contest; and three young children to mother. That&apos;s just this autumn. She has crammed much more into her life, partly thanks to the fearsome military discipline forged as a colonel in the People&apos;s Liberation Army performance troupe. She may be the only acclaimed contemporary dancer capable of blowing up a bridge. Though she is just 43, Jin&apos;s life has spanned numerous roles, two continents and, most famously, both genders. &quot;All over the world, it&apos;s very tough for people to accept it,&quot; she says of her gender reassignment surgery. But in China, which remains in some ways highly conservative, her frankness is almost unique: &quot;Homosexuals are like a small island. Transgender [people] are a tiny island.&quot; This is not a complaint. For one thing, Jin does not believe in them. &quot;I\u00a0hate whining. If you want to do it, do it. If you&apos;re doing it and complaining \u2013 what a pathetic life.&quot; For another, she believes that having had the surgery makes her &quot;more privileged, special and stronger, because I have a wider angle in looking at society and life&quot;. Her career has earned her plaudits from Li Yinhe, a sociologist and one of the best-known advocates for LGBT rights in China, who says, &quot;She is still discriminated against by society, but she is very brave in facing it. She has a good family and successful career; her achievements have made her an icon.&quot; &quot;I chose the stage, then dance chose me,&quot; Jin says while whacking on makeup in her dressing room. As a young boy, Jin joined the entertainment troupe of the army. All the performers had to undertake the PLA&apos;s routine training and young Jin struggled with grenades and machine guns, too big and unwieldy for his slight hands and body. The dance classes were equally harsh, with instructors physically contorting the children&apos;s bodies until they were flexible enough. &quot;In western culture, you&apos;d call it complete child abuse. In China, that&apos;s the culture: you want to be the best? You do it.&quot; Were they beaten? &quot;If you made a\u00a0mistake? Of course!&quot; With only one visit home each year, homesickness added to the pressure. &quot;I&apos;m still benefiting from the discipline of military training. I have a performance tonight but at 9am tomorrow I&apos;ll be back in the [dance] studio training again. Even the way I take my dance company \u2013 that&apos;s about discipline. Nobody breaks my rules,&quot; she adds. &quot;Big trouble.&quot; After saying this she flashes a lovely smile. She studied contemporary dance in New York. But the lessons outside the studio proved as important as those inside: &quot;If you ask what I am proud of \u2013 I am only proud that once I was 19, when the government sent me to the US, I took charge of my own life. Everything I do I choose \u2013 no matter how tough or whatever failure.&quot; It took her years to make the hardest choice. Even as a small boy, Jin knew that &quot;something was wrong. I so envied my sister. I felt I should be her.&quot; Unable to make sense of the feelings, he sublimated them for years. For a while after moving to New York, he thought he might be gay. Finally, that childhood sense reemerged, &quot;a weird feeling in myself \u2013 that I should be a\u00a0woman&quot;. To Jin&apos;s surprise, her conservative parents accepted her decision without question; her father had always felt there was something different about his child. But her life story has the mythic outlines of a movie (&quot;Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar is a good friend of mine. One day he will make a movie out of my life.&quot;) There was, of course, a twist. She woke from her operation to discover that the nerves of one leg had been badly affected. Doctors warned she would walk with a limp. &quot;Oh. My. God. The first moment I realised my leg was damaged, I wanted to jump out of the building. I thought my life was finished,&quot; she says. &quot;But after three, four days, I thought well \u2013 this is another test.&quot; She was on stage within three months. Next came the adoption of three children. A few years later, she sat next to a German businessman on a flight from Shanghai to Paris. Heinz-Gerd Oidtmann rang her the next day; though he took a few days to digest the news that Jin had been a man, they\u00a0soon became a couple. Oidtmann calls her a &quot;control freak&quot;, she jokes; and she has struggled to adapt to his European mindset: &quot;I&apos;ve tried to learn to take a holiday. After three days I feel guilty.&quot; As for the children, who are usually kept away from iPads, &quot;rubbish&quot; TV and junk food, &quot;They get very close to Daddy. When Mummy&apos;s travelling, he takes them to KFC \u2026&quot; She does not look too worried at the prospect. For all her talk of discipline, her eldest son, now aged 12, will soon head to boarding school in the UK because &quot;the Chinese education system sucks \u2026 The first thing kids learn is: obey.&quot; Few would wish to cross Jin. She called a fellow talkshow guest \u2013 a celebrity who criticised his wife for telling people he had hit her repeatedly \u2013 a &quot;filthy and selfish man&quot;. She&apos;s a judge on the Chinese equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing, but is scathing: &quot;In the UK they really work at it. Over here it&apos;s second- or third-class movie stars who just want the exposure and work for a maximum of one week. It&apos;s really low-quality dancing.&quot; Now she has her own debate show, which airs on a Hong Kong station rather than the heavily censored mainland channels. But she picks her topics carefully: &quot;I&apos;m not against the party [and] I know the laws \u2013 but I can talk about social issues.&quot; Officials trust her because &quot;they know I know the borderlines&quot;, she says. Besides, what better way to demonstrate the changing face of China than via an outspoken transsexual former colonel?

The streets of Chinese cities which were once chock-a-block with graceful cyclists are now clogged with snarling traffic jams. But the bike has not been completely relegated to the rubbish bin of China&apos;s history. On the drive into the centre of Shanghai from the airport, the long lines of traffic would make it easy to believe that most Shanghainese have abandoned their once beloved home-brand Flying Pigeon and Forever bikes for an Audi or a BMW. However, while a luxury car is undoubtedly the most desired symbol of wealth, the average salary last year in Shanghai was 52,655 RMB (\u00a35,226) leaving even a basic model out of reach for most residents, and millions still use pedal power to get around the city. Prior to moving to Shanghai, I was an avid cyclist and had romantic notions of pedalling shoulder to shoulder with hordes of cycling comrades and humming Katie Melua&apos;s Nine Million Bicycles. The reality is a lot more chaotic and certainly not for the faint-hearted. The car is king of the road in Shanghai and cyclists have been relegated to the bottom of the vehicular food chain, second only to pedestrians. While I&apos;ve been assured traffic rules do exist in Shanghai, the only rule that I&apos;ve been able to work out is that the bigger you are, the less you have to pay heed to these rules. Red lights are invisible to many bus and car drivers who sail straight through, ignoring the crowds of pedestrians trying to cross the road and honk at cyclists in the bike lanes to get out of their way. There are also motorbikes and electric bikes, called e-bikes, to contend with too. E-bikes, or silent killers as they have been nicknamed by a friend, make virtually no noise so unless you have your wits completely about you and eyes in the back of your head, you don&apos;t know when one may be about to crash into you or run you off the road. With its many bike lanes, Shanghai initially looked like a city that was relatively bike-friendly. However, the cars are now the priority of the city&apos;s road builders and cyclists are banned from many of the larger and busier roads. But undeterred, many cyclists simply take to the footpaths and hurtle down them paying no heed to pedestrians. I&apos;m not alone in finding cycling in Shanghai daunting. Monica Chen moved to Shanghai three months ago from Changzhou in Jiangsu province and cycled at first but gave it up after two months. &quot;Cars are not scared of you, they don&apos;t care about the traffic lights. Those riding the electronic bikes too. Almost every day I see a traffic accident. It is also difficult to find a place to park a bike because it is easy for it to be stolen,&quot; she said. While cycling in Europe has become fashionable again, in Shanghai many of those who cycle do so because it is the only form of transport they can afford. The bike and the car are apt symbols of the widening gulf between rich and poor in China&apos;s cities. &quot;It&apos;s not that you like cycling, you have to, you have no other choice, you have no other transport,&quot; says Tony Pan who works as a cook. In Europe he says it might be easier for people to buy cars, but in China, especially in Shanghai &quot;it is even difficult to buy the licence plate, they are expensive&quot;. Because it had started to rain heavily, Tony invited me into his apartment to continue our bike conversation. He has been cycling since he was a child in Shanghai and he says there are many more cars now &quot;because there are more and more rich guys here&quot;. &quot;But the gap between the poor and the rich is still very big. The living environment is too different,&quot; he says gesturing around his tiny, cramped apartment with not enough room to stand up in. Despite the crazy traffic, the apparent lack of safety concerns and the eye-stinging pollution, I&apos;m glad I took to the roads on two wheels rather than four. Nothing beats cycling for soaking up the atmosphere and the delicious smells from roadside dumpling vendors. And after a few weeks of getting used to the traffic, I discovered that the chaos is a functioning chaos. Just a few days ago I almost fulfilled my romantic notion of cycling in Shanghai as I trundled along a narrow tree-lined street in the former French concession. I smiled at my fellow cyclists, had the time to notice a little noodle shop I want to try and caught laughter coming from group of old men in pyjamas playing a streetside game of majong. And all of a sudden my reverie was broken by a loud beep as a car narrowly missed hitting my back tyre. \u2022 Jennifer Duggan is a freelance journalist based in Shanghai, who also contributes to the Irish Times, BBC World Service, and Irish Independent", "tags": ["Cycling", "Fitness", "Life and style", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-11T10:25:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/transfer-rumours-liverpool-fernando-llorente", "sentences": ["Meanwhile, Arsenal are seeing if they can&apos;t salvage Didier Drogba from Shanghai Shenhua, who appear to be disintegrating."], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Liverpool in for Fernando Llorente?", "article": "&quot;OLYMPSICK&quot; barf the Sun today, adding with a retch: &quot;England flops KO Games joy.&quot; What a spoilt childish nation the Sun think we live in, a land where folks lurch continually between euphoria and outrage, their moods swinging like Tarzan on a vine of idiocy amid a jungle of complexity.

This is just one segment of the best TV show I&apos;ve ever seen about food. I&apos;d hazard it&apos;s the best one ever made. A Bite of China began airing in May on the state broadcaster there. CCTV is better known for its obliging communist propaganda and unwatchable soap operas than for anything this sumptuous and beautiful. Thirty of the country&apos;s most respected filmmakers worked for more than a year filming the seven 50-minute episodes. They shot throughout the country, from the frozen lakes of the north-east and the bamboo forests of Liuzhou to the frenetic chaoses of Beijing and Hong Kong. As always, the people are the most interesting part: an old woman looking for matsutake mushrooms on pathless mountainsides (starts at 0.52), a family making kimchi in the Kingan mountains (1.54), a fisherman catching barracuda for his supper, a Shanghai woman filling her bathtub with live crabs to make drunken crab (31.10), drowning the creatures in wine and storing them in earthenware. But though the programme explains that the lives of many of its subjects are difficult and that the people are poor, it stunningly captures ways of life that are evaporating in modern China. Each episode adopts a theme: preserving by salt, pickling or wind, staple foods, the &quot;gifts of nature&quot; or &quot;our rural heritage&quot;. The filmmakers explore the central idea using examples from across the country. Perspective shifts from the macro \u2013 helicopter shots of neon cities or canopied mountains rearing out of lakes \u2013 to the micro \u2013 a single bamboo shoot pushing through the earth. There are plans to screen A Bite of China in 20 countries including Germany and the USA, but the show is only available on YouTube at the moment. The amateur translation can be a bit ropey. (Elderly people enjoying food: &quot;Even though their tastebuds are in degeneration phase, they still remember their hometown deliciousness.&quot;) And there&apos;s some irony in the fact that YouTube itself is banned in China. But what I love most about the programme is that it never patronises its subjects or viewers. It takes for granted the fact that what it has to show is worth watching, and devotes itself instead to making the final cut look as ravishing as possible. It&apos;s not, strictly speaking, a cookery programme, though we see a lot of people cooking and there&apos;s a recipe book tie-in (currently available only in Chinese). Instead it&apos;s educational in a more traditional, Reithian sense. It&apos;s perhaps the food TV equivalent of The Ascent of Man or Lord Clark&apos;s Civilisation or the best of Attenborough. British food TV has had its moments, but has never attempted anything like this. And it&apos;s impossible, having watched a couple of episodes of A Bite of China, not to feel a little humbled or even ashamed when you turn to your own country&apos;s food TV output and find Sophie Dahl and the Hairy Bikers.", "tags": ["Chinese food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Food TV", "China"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-12T11:40:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/13/cost-iphone-5-foxconn-factory", "sentences": ["Now the Shanghai Evening Post has published a detailed diary of working life at the Foxconn production plant by undercover journalist Wang Yu."], "title": "The real price of an iPhone 5: life in the Foxconn factory", "article": "Any committed foodie will wax lyrical about the value of provenance \u2013 the integrity of the food, the care and craft behind creating it. How long, then, before this middle-class preoccupation with quality, traceability and plain goodness of the things we buy extends into technology? We suspend our ethics when Apple launches a new phone. That unboxing is a virgin moment, as if the phone morphed inside the box from the tiny sparkling seed implanted by Jonathan Ive. Slide your finger through the\u00a0 Designed In California seal and your phone takes its first breath\u2026 It&apos;s a supreme piece of packaging design, but the reality is far from an immaculate conception. Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturer of iPhone, has faced a steady stream of criticism and concerns from poor working conditions to suicides. Now the Shanghai Evening Post has published a detailed diary of working life at the Foxconn production plant by undercover journalist Wang Yu. He lasted 10 days in the plant, seven of which were in training, and three on shifts &quot;marking placement points on the back plate&quot;. Foxconn recruited 20,000 new workers in March to meet its production targets for iPhone 5, and has to produce 57m in one year, Wang&apos;s report stated. No doubt much of the nuance has been lost in this translation by micgadget.com, (who bafflingly signed off from this piece by saying how excited they were about seeing the new iPhone 5) but Wang complains of having to work on 3,000 phones during a 10-hour shift, paid only 27 yuan ($4.27) for two hours&apos; overtime. &quot;An iPhone 5 back-plate run through in front of me almost every 3 seconds. I have to pickup the back-plate and marked 4 position points using the oil-based paint pen and put it back on the running belt swiftly within 3 seconds with no errors. After such repeat action for several hours, I have terrible neckache and muscle pain on my arm. A new worker who sat opposite of me gone exhausted and laid down for a short while. The supervisor has noticed him and punished him by asking him to stand at one corner for 10 minutes like the old school days. We worked non-stop from midnight to the next morning 6 am but were still asked to keep on working as the production line is based on running belt and no one is allowed to stop. I&apos;m so starving and fully exhausted.&quot; Dormitories smell of rubbish, sweat and foam, and the reporter wrote of cockroaches in the wardrobes and dirty bedsheets. chinalaborwatch.org reports at least 18 suicides at Foxconn plants in two years, and as a result dorm windows have been barred, which gives the impression of a prison. The various facilities include a gym, canteen, hospital, library and playground, which Wang claims are under-resourced or rundown. Employees are told that if they set off the metal detectors in the high security production floor they will be sacked on the spot, and claims one employee was dismissed for carrying a USB charging cable. &quot;When I walked into the production floor after passing through the metal detector door, I heard loud sounds of machinery engines and a very dense of plastic smell. Our supervisor warned us: &apos;Once you sit down, you only do what you are told.&apos; The supervisor finally present us the back of the iPhone 5 and shows it to all of us and said: &apos;This is the new unleashed iPhone 5 back plate, you should be honored having the chance to produce it.&apos; This is very far from being only Apple&apos;s problem, of course. Foxconn manufactures parts for just about every other consumer tech firm too (the company&apos;s most recent corporate social responsibility report from 2010 cites 935,000 employees, so it is enormous), including HP, Sony-Ericsson, Amazon and Dell. It makes the Kindle and Wii as well as iPhones and iPads, and until recently made Xbox consoles. There have already been pledges this year by Apple, as Foxconn&apos;s highest profile client, and Foxconn to improve housing and working conditions, followed by the latest concerns over the use of student labourers to help meet production demands. The Guardian has asked Foxconn to comment. Samsung too is facing allegations of abuse and poor working conditions in its production plants including hiring 16- and 17-year-olds - again battling to meet deadlines for new devices. As long as there is massive demand, so suppliers will fight to cut costs and deliver those products as cheaply as they can. As consumers, our own attitudes towards the quality and the true price of those products is the one thing we can try to address.

Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest after surveillance ships entered the area around the island group \u2013 known as the Diaoyu to China and Senkaku to Japan \u2013 which is controlled by Japan. Vessels from the two countries radioed each other with warnings to leave the waters. There were signs of the row spilling over at street level: a Japanese man in Shanghai was reportedly injured when hot noodles were thrown into his face\u2013 the sixth such attack in recent days. Brad Glosserman, executive director at Honolulu&apos;s Pacific Forum CSIS, told Reuters: &quot;The dangers of miscalculation are real.&quot; Taylor Fravel of the security studies programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said: &quot;Neither side wants to see the situation spiral out of control, but both felt that they had to act. We should be concerned, but it has not yet crossed a point of no return.&quot; The island group is surrounded by rich energy resources and fisheries. The sovereignty dispute reignited when both Chinese and Japanese activists landed there last month and protests broke out in several Chinese cities, with attacks on Japanese cars and businesses. It became even more fraught when Tokyo&apos;s nationalist governor Shintaro Ishihara said the city would buy and develop the uninhabited islands from their private owners, who are Japanese. The central government then arranged to buy them, despite Beijing&apos;s protests. &quot;From the Japanese side it was the best outcome\u00a0\u2026 Ishihara is extremely rightwing and ultra-nationalist and if he controlled these islands there is no telling what he might do with them. It seems almost like he wants to provoke China on this. The Japanese government clearly does not,&quot; said Ian Storey, an expert on maritime issues at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. Although Chinese vessels have entered the area before, their voyages have not been announced. This time the foreign ministry in Beijing said the ships were there to conduct maritime surveillance and that China was carrying out a mission of &quot;law enforcement over its maritime rights&quot;. Japanese foreign minister Koichiro Gemba told reporters: &quot;We lodged a strong protest and also we made a strong case that the Chinese side should leave from the territorial waters around the Senkaku islands. &quot;I&apos;d like to underscore that we should never let the situation escalate and we have strong hopes for the Chinese to respond in an appropriate and calm manner.&quot; Kyodo news agency reported that the Chinese ships withdrew from the disputed waters on Friday afternoon. China is Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner. But deep-rooted popular mistrust endures, fuelled by memories of the brutality of the Japanese occupation in the 1930s and 1940s. Complicating matters further is the impending leadership change in China and a looming election in Japan. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, warned that the possibility of military conflict could not be eliminated. &quot;Chinese leaders actually talk tough and act carefully, but sometimes it&apos;s out of your control. Chinese public opinion has become so powerful. They have to talk very, very tough. By doing so, they will help enhance the tensions,&quot; he told AP. With popular feeling running high, Beijing saw small scale anti-Japanese protests on Thursday and Friday. One shopping centre in the capital was showing images of anti-Japanese demonstrators and the Diaoyu islands on its giant screen, rather than the usual entertainment videos. The phrase &quot;the Diaoyu Islands are China&apos;s&quot; appeared almost 2.5m times over 24 hours on the popular Sina Weibo microblog, although it was outnumbered three-fold by references to the iPhone 5. Earlier this week, one man even set fire to his own Honda vehicle in protest against Japan. Some Chinese travel agents have reportedly cancelled tours to Japan and Japanese businessmen told Reuters that officials have asked firms to cancel or postpone public events and major sales promotions.

Riot police with shields and batons sealed off the compound, sporadically clashing with demonstrators who chanted and waved Chinese flags and placards. A handful rushed past a police barricade but were quickly removed by plainclothes officers. Hundreds took to the streets in other cities around China, with reports of attacks on Japanese-owned businesses. Japan already controls the uninhabited islands, which it refers to as the Senkaku and China calls the Diaoyu, but announced plans to buy them from their private owners this week. Hundreds of paramilitary police, ordinary officers and security guards initially struggled to maintain order at the embassy in Beijing, but later marshalled protesters into smaller groups that marched up and down the closed-off road, chanting anti-Japanese slogans and pumping their fists. A few in the youthful crowd bore pictures of Mao Zedong and banners and placards ranged from the provocative \u2014 &quot;For the respect of the motherland, we must go to war with Japan&quot; \u2014 to the more polite: &quot;Behave yourself, Japanese!&quot; Another observed: &quot;The Japanese people are friendly, the Japanese government are dogs&apos; dicks.&quot; Some recalled the atrocities committed by Japan when it occupied China in the 1930s and 1940s. &quot;We&apos;ve always hated Japan. Japan invaded China and killed a lot of Chinese. We will never forget,&quot; protestor Liu Gang told Reuters. While China rarely allows street protests, it has a history of tolerating anti-Japanese demonstrations. &quot;I think the government is encouraging this,&quot; one protester, who gave his name as Uda Chen, told Reuters. &quot;They could have stopped all of us approaching when we were at the subway station. The government has taught us to be anti-Japanese at school, so if they want us to stop it would be like slapping their own mouths,&quot; he added. Around the corner, police guarded Japanese restaurants, which had hung up Chinese flags and signs reading: &quot;The Diaoyu Islands belong to China&quot;. China&apos;s state news agency Xinhua and Japan&apos;s Kyodo news agency reported sizeable protests in cities, including Xi&apos;an, Nanjing, Qingdao and Kunming. Microbloggers and Japanese media reported outbreaks of violence, including attacks on a Japanese-owned department store in Changsha and restaurants in Hangzhou. In Shanghai, police sealed off the consulate but allowed small groups at a time to approach and protest. Protests broke out in China last month after Chinese and then Japanese activists landed on the islands. But tensions escalated when Tokyo&apos;s nationalist governor, Shintaro Ishihara, announced a plan to buy the islands and build on them. The central government then said it would buy the group but leave them undeveloped, hoping to stave off conflict with China. Both governments face popular nationalist pressure, particularly given the impending elections in Japan and this autumn&apos;s leadership transition in China. But experts say both are keen to avoid a major confrontation. While China sent surveillance vessels into disputed waters on Friday, it withdrew them after a few hours.

This type of job seeking \u2013 though it might make you feel you&apos;re being proactive \u2013 can only get your application into the same pile as everyone else. Instead, writing a speculative application directly to an organisation can be a quicker and more direct route into a job. Researching the company (to understand how your interests and skills meet their needs) takes time, but the result is that you&apos;re more likely to know if you&apos;d be a good match. This means that you&apos;ll come across more confidently at a meeting with a decision-maker. There&apos;s always the risk that your letter goes unanswered or you receive a rejection, and it&apos;s perhaps the fear of this that puts people off. But it&apos;s also a strategy that puts you more in charge of your job search, and allows you to uncover opportunities that might not have previously existed. Understand what you have to offer You need to be clear about why someone would want to meet you. What can you bring to the company? Write down your key strengths and skills, and find examples where you add value. Don&apos;t oversell yourself (this can backfire and damage your credibility), but try to answer these questions: \u2022 What is your expertise?\u2022 What have you achieved for other companies using your key strengths? Do your research Find out everything you can about the company. You&apos;ll need to know how it&apos;s performing, who the competitors are, and plans for expansion or growth. You can then work out how your background and expertise might be valuable. Research who is the best person to write to. Ideally you want to reach someone with hiring authority \u2013 and that&apos;s unlikely to be HR. Find the name of the head of department, or the managing director if it&apos;s a smaller company. You can find names on LinkedIn (follow the company there), from your network, or in industry publications, which often have an &apos;on the move&apos; type section. Write your application around the company and their needs Bear in mind the &apos;what&apos;s in it for me?&apos; principle. Link your strengths (and career interests) to the company&apos;s requirements. Use your research to do this effectively. Show, don&apos;t tell. Rather than just saying you&apos;re effective or goal-oriented, give examples of how what you did in the past has brought results and solved problems. Your aim at this stage is to pique someone&apos;s interest so that they invite you in for a meeting. In most cases you won&apos;t need to include your CV (although you can include links to your personal site or LinkedIn profile). Delivery is important Letters are almost always opened, making them perhaps a better choice than an email. Alternatively, get inside help. If you already know someone within the company, you can ask them to hand-deliver your letter. Example of a speculative application First line \u2013 introduction and why you are writing. For example: &quot;I visited your stand at the Expo fair and was very interested to hear of your plans to expand into the Chinese market.&quot; What you offer (include a relevant achievement if possible): &quot;Following my graduation, I spent a couple of years in Beijing and Shanghai with the British-Chinese Chamber of Commerce helping to market a range of products. I learned first-hand the particular challenges of this market, but also the strategies that were successful. For example, through one campaign involving trade-fair participation and sponsorship, I helped secure a multi-million pound deal for a medical equipment manufacturer. &quot; Why you are interested: &quot;Since that time, I have maintained many links within China, and I&apos;m eager to explore opportunities that would combine my marketing expertise and knowledge of the region.&quot; Call to action: &quot;I would be interested to discuss ways in which my skills could help drive your expansion into the Chinese market, and I look forward to hearing from you.&quot; Yours sincerely (name) This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

I was tasting a new sort of ceviche, the seafood salad served across Latin America, in Amaz, a new Amazonian restaurant opened by Pedro Miguel Schiaffino, one of Lima&apos;s leading chefs. To a European palate, fruit with uncooked fish might seem outrageous but in Peru, it is logical. The banana replaces the steamed sweet potato commonly served with ceviche to soak up the tangy juices. The creative take on Peruvian and jungle classics at Amaz (Avenida La Paz 1079, +51 1 221 9393, amaz.com.pe, \u00a330 a head) means the simplest dishes \u2013 such as tacacho, mashed and fried green bananas, with cecina, dried pork, both Amazonian staples \u2013 drip with unexpected layers of flavour. For most visitors to Peru, local fare used to mean roast guinea pig, nibbled en route to Machu Picchu. The idea of coming here specifically to eat would until recently have elicited bafflement, if not derision. But Peru, whose economy is booming, has come a long way in the past two decades, since the nadir of macroeconomic meltdown and a bombing campaign in Lima by Shining Path terrorists. Its cuisine has come even further. Schiaffino is one of a generation of chefs who fled to train abroad before returning to reclaim their rich gastronomic heritage. To visit Schiaffino&apos;s first restaurant, Malabar (Calle Camino Real 101, +51 1 440 5200 (malabar.com.pe), and those of Peru&apos;s other top restaurateurs, Rafael Osterling and Gast\u00f3n Acurio, is to hear a melting pot of Latin American accents, as foodies revel in this culinary revolution. Acurio is the chef who kickstarted Peru&apos;s gastronomic boom, seeking out ingredients and recipes from the humblest of cooks. Osterling&apos;s flagship restaurant, Rafael (San Mart\u00edn 300, +51 1 242 4149, rafaelosterling.com, from \u00a335 a head), is regarded by some as Lima&apos;s finest. A signature dish is suckling goat stewed in Madeira wine, served with tacutacu, Afro-Peruvian rice and beans, and fried plantains. Peru has long had spectacularly original and varied cuisine, influenced by Italian, Chinese, Japanese, African and, of course, Spanish traditions, blended with techniques and flavours of indigenous foods. Disparate topography has provided Peruvian cooks with an unrivalled natural pantry, including tropical rainforest, the altiplano, and some of the world&apos;s most prolific and diverse fish. Traditionally, Peruvian cooking was enjoyed at home, while fancy restaurants offered foreign food. The change since the turn of the millennium has been breathtaking. Peruvians of all classes now take huge pride in their cuisine, while young people flock to study at a growing number of culinary schools. &quot;Other than our pre-Colombian heritage, food is our greatest source of national pride and identity,&quot; says Ericka La Madrid, who runs Delectable Peru (+51 987 375867, delectableperu.com), which offers gastronomic tours of Lima from \u00a340 a head.

Acurio&apos;s championing of Peru&apos;s street cuisine and small-scale farmers has given him rock-star status. &quot;Normally, good cooking is seen as elitist, but here it is the other way around,&quot; he tells me. &quot;There is no high cooking or low cooking here.&quot; Acurio says tourists should not get hung up on Lima&apos;s burgeoning reputation for haute cuisine but try out more modest restaurants and street stands, where you can buy a men\u00fa (set meal) of two or three courses for as little as five soles (about \u00a31.20). Typical fare might include papa a la huanca\u00edna, slices of boiled potato in a cheesy, yellow chilli sauce, estofado, a stew of chicken, tomatoes, peas and carrots, and steamed or fried fish.\u00a0 If you&apos;re set on eating guinea pig, try the version at Astrid y Gast\u00f3n, which the menu describes as having visited Beijing before travelling to Shanghai.

This is regardless of what fashion cards Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel and Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton play when they unveil their designs for next season. Industry insiders say Slimane and Simons, working at two of the most formidable houses, are likely to usher in a new era of fashion. Simons made his mark with a well received haute couture show in July. Some of these designs made it onto the red carpet when Marion Cotillard wore a grey tweed strapless pencil dress at the Toronto film festival while at the Emmys Julianne Moore chose a canary yellow, long sleeved gown. But so far, the only indication of the new Saint Laurent direction has been an image of Gwyneth Paltrow carrying a leather bag, dubbed the Duffle. Both designers started out in menswear with minimalist tendencies and a youthful spirit. But Simons has form in womenswear. During his recent tenure at Jil Sander, he took his clean aesthetic and imbued it with a gloriously modern femininity. He also created talking-point pieces for the catwalk. In an era of fashion blogging and immediate gratification, Simons&apos; shopper bags, inspired by supermarket carrier bags, and netted beanie hats for Sander, were endlessly photographed and written about. It is a trick he may replicate at Dior. Slimane has not been under the catwalk glare since he bowed out at Dior Homme in 2007 after creating an influential formula of skinny tailoring with a rock &apos;n&apos; roll edge. The designer does have a previous attachment to the house of YSL. He worked in the menswear studio between 1997 and 2000, and the late Saint Laurent himself attended Slimane&apos;s Dior Homme debut. In a recent interview with Paris Vogue, he said he wanted to evoke the late designer &quot;without ever quoting him, at least not directly&quot;. Clues to his plans for the label are mounting. Slimane accepted the role under the proviso he could perform an overhaul. A new typeface emerged in July while last week in Shanghai, a refitted store was revealed. An introductory black and white ad campaign, shot by Slimane, a successful fashion photographer in his own right, depicts a topless tattooed male model with a women&apos;s high-heel clad foot resting on it. These images suggest the designer is planning to toy with Parisian sexiness plus a dash of rock &apos;n&apos; roll for his debut on Monday. Belgian designer Dries Van Noten might not radically change the gear of fashion but he is a designer with a loyal following. Both Selfridges and Liberty report the brand is doing swift trade on the shopfloor. Once again Van Noten produced clothes that looked effortless, wearable and modern. Shown in an industrial space with concrete floors and white wrought iron pillars, the first model (seen left) wore a sheer check shirt layered over a white vest with a below-the-knee skirt heavily embellished with 3D flowers that looked like rosettes. The outfit was finished with a pair of white frame sunglasses that brought to mind Kurt Cobain. Outfits had a cool, slouchy feel that hinted at 1990s grunge without ever seeping into overkill. A gorgeous silkscreen poppy print skirt, for example, was matched with a plaid shirt. Dreamy chiffons were worn over trousers. A shimmer of metallic ran through some outfits while chunky silver chain necklaces finished off others. A Superstar version of The Carpenter&apos;s hit Close to You fuzzed on the soundtrack. &quot;Contrasts,&quot; said Van Noten backstage. &quot;Menswear with womenswear but more spontaneous this time, a more thrown together approach.&quot; Lucien Freud was named as an inspiration for the colour palette while he confirmed there was a deliberate grunge factor to the show. &quot;A pyjama jacket perhaps instead of a shirt, the Sonic Youth soundtrack,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Paris fashion week spring/summer 2013", "Saint Laurent", "Fashion weeks", "Paris fashion week", "Fashion", "Life and style", "France", "Europe", "World news", "Hedi Slimane"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-26T16:32:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/sep/28/matthew-williamson-fashion-designer", "sentences": ["In the next two months, the pair will visit Lagos, Shanghai, Qatar, Hong Kong, Dubai and Rome on business."], "title": "Matthew Williamson: 'I'm such a clich\u00e9'", "article": "As I walk up a street of grand wedding-cake villas not far from Primrose Hill in north London, it is not hard to spot where Matthew Williamson lives. Aside from a few houses painted in peeling pastels that are a throwback to the area&apos;s more bohemian past, the style is uniformly bankers-who-brunch. Lots of immaculate black ironwork and bay trees standing in sentry pairs. It is late morning, a precious day of September sunshine, but all is glossy and frozen, as if liberally sprayed with Elnett. And then I hear music drifting from one of the huge open bay windows. A string of Indian silk\u00a0stuffed birds, trinket of a million 1990s gap years, spins gently in the breeze, and beyond I can see a white marble Eero Saarinen table crammed with peace lilies and an enormous Murano glass ashtray. On the white walls are a\u00a0Cameroonian juju headdress in Tango orange and a Jimi Hendrix poster in vintage psychedelic font. The mantelpiece is crammed with bell jars, Mexican votive candles and vintage frames of pinned butterflies. The man who invented boho-glamour, who convinced perfectly sane British women to spend their salaries on dressing like Sienna Miller on her way to a post-yoga beach party, lives in an apartment that is, satisfyingly, exactly\u00a0how I&apos;d\u00a0imagined it. This is the Matthew\u00a0Williamson aesthetic come to life: bright colours, dressed-up, an unjaded appreciation of pretty stuff and a hazy, cheerfully glamorised version of laid-back hippy chic. I\u00a0buzz, and the door opens. &quot;Hiya,&quot; Williamson says, his accent and choice of greeting still unmistakably Mancunian, 24 years after he left his home town for Central Saint Martins. &quot;Come in,\u00a0sit down, would you like a\u00a0cup of tea?&quot; It is 15 years since Williamson burst on to the scene with Electric Angels, a catwalk debut that took him as close to overnight success as the relatively small-fry world of British fashion gets. It was 1997, and out of the dying embers of grunge and minimalism came Williamson&apos;s visual explosion of Indian pinks and Ibizan attitude. Fifteen years later \u2013 and in triumphant defiance of\u00a0the odds on longevity for 25-year-olds who find\u00a0instant fame and start hanging out with supermodels \u2013 Williamson is still a bold-faced name on the London fashion week schedule, with\u00a0a team of 47 and flagship stores in London, New York and Dubai. He is celebrating his anniversary with a short film starring Sienna Miller, eight Royal Ballet ballerinas and a corps de ballet of models and It\u00a0girls. The film, made in a 19-hour day of filming at the grand Cotswold house of Aynhoe Park, tells the story of the past 15 years from the point of view of a 15-year-old Matthew, dreaming his career. It ends with his mum, played by Andrea Riseborough, standing at the bottom of a staircase and &quot;shouting me down for my dinner, and a boy who looks like a 15-year-old me who&apos;s fallen asleep on the bed, reading Vogue&quot;. As a child, Williamson was confused when his sister said she wasn&apos;t sure if she wanted to be a\u00a0nurse or a teacher. &quot;How could you not know? It was always so obvious to me. There was never any question. As soon as I knew what a fashion designer was, I knew that&apos;s what I\u00a0was going to do.&quot; He says that this &quot;came from my relationship with my mother, who I just absolutely adore \u2013 always have. In what was quite a grey, industrial, middle-class environment, I watched how she used fashion to make herself feel better, to brighten things. And I\u00a0suppose seeing how fashion did that for her, in some subliminal way I\u00a0wanted to make beautiful clothes as a way of enriching her life.&quot;     Williamson's spring/summer 2013 show. Photograph: Rex    His father, who had named him after Sir Matt\u00a0Busby, would buy him Christmas gifts of\u00a0football\u00a0boots; he never wore them. &quot;I knew I\u00a0couldn&apos;t be that archetypal northern male teenager, which was difficult. That was partly why I was so determined to get down to Saint Martins.&quot; During Williamson&apos;s student years, his\u00a0dad accepted &quot;that my being different wasn&apos;t something that had to be suppressed, or shunned. He&apos;s brilliant, my dad.&quot; Around his neck, Williamson wears a gold pendant he was given on his 40th birthday last year, which is engraved &quot;MW, love forever, Mum &amp; Dad&quot;. Neither of his parents has missed a single catwalk show during his 15-year career. &quot;Nor an after-party,&quot; he adds, raising an eyebrow. He is very funny, in the Mancunian way: more dry asides than punchlines. Listening to the tape after the interview, he keeps making me laugh, but there are no actual jokes to transcribe. That was why his friends urged him to make a film with humour: &quot;I didn&apos;t want it to just be whimsical footage of girls wafting around in gorgeous dresses, because that&apos;s been done to death.&quot; Saint Martins didn&apos;t quite turn out to be the haven the teenage Williamson was expecting. &quot;I\u00a0was 17, the youngest on a course of 60, and I was a bit too young for it. It was very unstructured, and I was a\u00a0fish out of water, with everyone else doing conceptual fashion and me looking at photos of Rio carnival.&quot; In fashion folklore, Williamson leapt straight from Saint Martins to the Electric Angels catwalk show of September 1997, when the industry packed into a tiny studio to watch models including Kate Moss, Jade Jagger and Helena Christensen parade the 11 outfits that would make Williamson&apos;s name. But the real sliding-doors moment of his career came before, the night he met Joseph Velosa, his one-time lover and lifelong best friend and business partner. Home for the weekend from college, Williamson was in a Manchester bar: &quot;And this is the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays days, so everyone&apos;s in cagoules, and this guy walked in \u2013 very handsome, crisp shirt, white teeth...&quot; They fell in love and Velosa, who was studying for a philosophy degree, transferred from Manchester to King&apos;s College London to be with him. After Saint Martins, Williamson took a job at Monsoon, where the trips to India crystallised his aesthetic and his determination to have his own label. He handed in his notice, and he and Velosa headed to India. After buying standby tickets, they had \u00a390 in their backpacks. In India, they had some sample garments made, and &quot;when we got back to London it was Joseph who was pushing me, saying, &apos;You need to show those to Vogue.&apos; Like any couple in love, we were proud of what the other did.&quot; So Williamson picked up Vogue, and looked down the masthead. &quot;I\u00a0had no idea how I should do this. I\u00a0saw the name [fashion editor] Plum Sykes and I\u00a0thought that was such a nice name, so I sent her a postcard.&quot; Sykes called him up, he took in his clothes and they made their way into the pages of\u00a0Vogue, and on to a shoot for Tatler, the day after which Jade Jagger called up asking if she could keep the skirt. Velosa, who answered the phone, told her no, but said she could buy it. (&quot;I\u00a0was like, &apos;Give me the bloody phone \u2013 she can have the skirt!&apos;&quot;) Williamson and Jagger met up, hit it off, and when he mentioned doing a show, she offered to ask her friend Kate Moss to model with her. &quot;Kate came round and we sat on my bedsit floor and ate a McDonald&apos;s, and she pointed to the pink and turquoise dress and said, &apos;I&apos;ll do the show if I\u00a0can wear that.&apos; She saw something in the clothes. She&apos;s always had her eye on the next thing.&quot;     Kate Moss (second right) and Jade Jagger (right) model Matthew Williamson's debut collection in 1997. Photograph: PA    The model cast elevated industry reaction to\u00a0the show, turning buzz into hype, but a\u00a0misconception that annoys him is that having supermodel chums was how he got famous. &quot;Those girls weren&apos;t my mates at that point, at all. They just did the show because they liked the clothes.&quot; The importance of Jagger and, later, of his model-muse Sienna Miller is nothing by comparison with that of Velosa, he says. The\u00a0pair split as a couple after 12 years, but\u00a0&quot;we\u00a0still have a\u00a0brilliant relationship. I\u00a0definitely wouldn&apos;t be where I am without him. He&apos;s probably more important in our success than me. And\u00a0anyway, he&apos;s my best friend. I\u00a0want to know him for ever.&quot; If he could save one possession from a\u00a0fire, he says, it would be the watch he wears, a present from Velosa. The same quality that has brought Williamson success \u2013 a crystal-clear identity that centres around Ibiza, India, colour, jetset and glamour \u2013 has also brought him angst. &quot;At times it is suffocating and frustrating. People have such preconceptions of what we&apos;re about that even when there&apos;s nothing Indian or ethnic in the collection, they still put the same things in the reviews. I&apos;m not putting out on the runway things that are changing the shape of fashion. I know that, and I&apos;m cool with that. But there&apos;s still an enormous amount of skill involved. I like to look on the brighter side of things, but that doesn&apos;t mean there&apos;s no thought process. It&apos;s like a\u00a0butterfly wing: the beauty may look flighty and natural, but it&apos;s incredibly precise and ordered.&quot; There is solace to be found in the fact that, although there will be long periods when sexy party dresses are cold-shouldered by the grandes dames of fashion, the customer still wants them. For his collection at this month&apos;s London fashion week, &quot;I thought, sod it, people bang on about India whatever I do, so instead of fighting it, I&apos;m going to do India.&quot; Critics liked it almost as much as the buyers, who have never wavered. The dream to become a famous fashion designer having come true, Williamson is in uncharted territory \u2013 &quot;This is as far as my plan went. So, now what?&quot; He describes his life as &quot;at a\u00a0nice level of fame. Fashion&apos;s quite niche, so it&apos;s all on a very manageable level. If I&apos;m queueing in Starbucks, someone might come and say hello and ask for a picture. I love it when that happens. How brilliant, that someone wants a picture of me?&quot; Together with Velosa, he owns 52% of his business. In the next two months, the pair will visit Lagos, Shanghai, Qatar, Hong Kong, Dubai and Rome on business. Williamson is &quot;on a break&quot; from his latest beau, the model Stephen Baccari, &quot;so I&apos;m a one man and his dog, at the moment,&quot; he says. We both turn to admire his glossy American cocker spaniel, who has been lounging on an Aztec throw in a corner of the sofa. I ask her name. &quot;Coco,&quot; he says. As in Chanel? &quot;Yes, which is tragic, I know. I&apos;m such a clich\u00e9.&quot; He laughs, sounding perfectly content.", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-28T22:01:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/sep/29/travel-awards-2012-winners", "sentences": ["This year&apos;s winner is Sofitel, the French-based luxury chain with 130 hotels spanning London to Shanghai and with hotels at St James, Heathrow and Gatwick."], "title": "Travel Awards 2012 winners", "article": "Best UK city For some, 13 is an unlucky number.

But despite gloomy predications, by January 2012 the numbers were just 4% below those for the previous year, an extraordinary recovery in large part thanks to the tireless efforts of the Japan Tourism Agency to promote the country abroad and to welcome back tourists with the &quot;Japan: Thank You&quot; campaign.

Best ethical travel award \u2013 chosen by Guardian Travel editors     Best ethical travel award goes to Wild Frontiers, who run trips to some of the most exciting and difficult-to-reach places in the world, such as Afghanistan. Photograph: Ric Ergenbright/Corbis    Winner: Wild Frontiers Having worked with Wild Frontiers on many stories over the years we were amazed to realise they hadn&apos;t yet won one of our editorial awards. Where were our manners? Here is a tour operator offering some of the most fascinating, unusual and carefully executed adventures on the planet, and one which cares deeply about the impact its tours have on the regions and people they encounter. Founded by Jonny Bealby in 2002, the operator quickly amassed a team of like-minded travel obsessives and employed truly special local guides, with the primary aim of enabling passionate travellers to visit the most spectacular but difficult-to-reach corners of the world, in comfort and safety. To learn what astounding times can be had on these holidays, you only have to read the features we have run over the last year or so, about horseriding in Georgia, desert-camping in Oman, or, from the new family-friendly Wild Child collection, a Maasai-run safari in Kenya that writer Kevin Rushby and his young daughter adored. That many of Wild Frontiers&apos; most exciting destinations \u2013 Syria, Yemen, Libya, \u2013 have recently been inaccessible is a tragedy, but we know the company and its devoted clients will be one of the first to jump back in to help those whose tourism businesses have been damaged or lost. Indeed it was the first back to Pakistan after 9/11, the first back into Kashmir, and the first to run commercial trips into Afghanistan, where it offers a tour of the Band-i-Amir lakes by pedalo among other things \u2013 just one example of the unique yet authentic and, of course, joyful experiences this company can provide. As he has launched new trips, Jonny has frequently linked up with local NGOs, such as the Hope Foundation in Calcutta, the Mines Advisory Group in Cambodia and Children of the Caucasus in Georgia. To help facilitate the company&apos;s ethos of responsible and sustainable travel, which it has been committed to from the off, it established the charitable Wild Frontiers Foundation in 2009, to channel funds to these projects and its own. Clients can visit these projects if they want to, and Wild Frontiers automatically carbon offsets every client&apos;s international flight, when booked through them. Best UK hotel This category has been dominated by UK-based boutique chains Hotel Du Vin &amp; Bistro and Malmaison for the past decade as well as the Hoxton, which has won for the past two years but now slips out of the top 20. This year&apos;s winner is Sofitel, the French-based luxury chain with 130 hotels spanning London to Shanghai and with hotels at St James, Heathrow and Gatwick. The brand&apos;s stated aim is to balance the French touch with local features and design. 1 Sofitel 2 Hotel Du Vin &amp; Bistro 3 Malmaison 4 YHA5 Marriott Best overseas hotel Hyatt Hotels and Resorts climb eight places to win the day, while last year&apos;s winner the Dubai-based Jumeirah group slips out of the rankings. The company has come a long way since founder Jay Pritzker bought the Hyatt House motel adjacent to the Los Angeles International Airport in 1957 \u2013 the Chicago-based company now has 492 properties in 45 countries.

Why have its customers been inspired to vote for it this year? Well, it could be the friendly, well-trained staff that cater to their every whim, the free ski hosting around the resorts&apos; pistes or the hot-tubs, saunas and pools in many properties. Peak Retreats, which has won for the last three years, has dropped into second place. 1 Ski Olympic 2 Peak Retreats 3 Le Ski 4 Erna Low 5 Inntravel Best cruise line Viking River Cruises tops the charts with the highest rate of satisfaction from its customers, just beating off Swan Hellenic and Cunard.

Maintaining the top spot from last year it held off the similarly luxurious Emirates and Virgin Atlantic who came second and third respectively. 1 Singapore Airlines 2 Emirates 3 Virgin Atlantic 4 Malaysia Airlines 5 Air Canada Best business airline Another win for Singapore Airlines. This is the third year \u2013 it also won in 2009 and 2010 \u2013 at the top of this category. Business class travellers with this line can expect a full flat bed on long-haul flights, and there is a new medium-haul option, with an inclined flat seat. Air New Zealand maintained its runner-up position from last year. 1 Singapore Airlines 2 Air New Zealand 3 Swiss 4 Cathay Pacific 5 Delta Airlines Best ferry company As Bryan is no longer quite up to topping the charts, we had to let the award go to Calmac/Caledonian MacBrayne. Almost as sexy and stylish as the 70s Roxy Music popstar, this company does its rocking across the waves of the Little Minch and North Minch, between the west coast of the Scottish mainland and the Hebridean islands, Mull and Skye. 1 Calmac/Caledonian MacBrayne 2 Northlink 3 North Sea Ferries 4 Wightlink 5 Brittany Ferries Best train company Eurotunnel has remained at the top or near the top of this category for several years now, and this year it wins, even though the tunnel itself still hasn&apos;t been extended to any countries other than France \u2026 maybe one day.

The winning Audi trio, driving the No1 car, who have also taken victories at the Le Mans 24 Hours and the Six Hours of Silverstone this season, are now 13.5 points ahead of McNish and Kristensen in the No2 car, with two races at Fuji in Japan and Shanghai in China remaining. The single Toyota entry driven by Alex Wurz and Nicolas Lapierre, which made another strong start in Bahrain after the team&apos;s debut win at the last round in S\u00e3o Paulo, lost time in the third hour to replace faulty illuminated number indicators on the side panels putting them seven minutes behind. Technical rules requires the numbers to be visible throughout the race. A strong recovery, including scoring the fastest lap of the race, was however ultimately undone after contact with the Strakka racing HPD damaged the suspension at the end of the fifth hour putting the car out of the race. Britain&apos;s Alan McNish had qualified the No2 Audi on pole and he made a clean start while Wurz jumped the No1 Audi, which was also on the front row of the grid, to take second place at the first corner. The No2 Audi, struggling with over brake issues however, had to surrender the lead to a charging Wurz just 13 minutes in, as the Toyota continued to show the impressive pace it had demonstrated in Brazil, quickly pulling out the 30-second lead that the TS030 super-capacitor petrol hybrid would require had it continued, because of the car&apos;s greater fuel consumption over Audi&apos;s diesel flywheel-based hybrid, the R18 e-tron quattro. It was another signifier that Toyota&apos;s endurance racing entry is offering real competition this year and that they will be genuine championship contenders next year, despite the failure to finish at this day-night race in Bahrain. The technical issue that would go on to stymie the Toyota&apos;s push was nowhere to be seen for the championship leaders in the No1 Audi, however, who went on to complete a trouble-free run to take the chequered flag, while its sister car lost further time with a puncture and front bodywork changes due to headlight problems. But the result did still represent the first one-two finish for the German marque since Le Mans, after Toyota had managed a second at Silverstone and the win in Brazil. Behind the two Audis, the Strakka HPD of Jonny Kane, Nick Leventis and Danny Watts took the final podium place in LMP1, the team&apos;s best finish in the WEC. The GTE Pro Teams&apos; championship was wound up with another victory for the dominant AF Corse Ferrari driven by Giancarlo Fisichella and Toni Vilander (standing in for usual driver Gianmaria Bruni). The team&apos;s fourth victory in a row since Le Mans also secured the Manufacturers&apos; Championship for Ferrari, seeing off Aston Martin with two races to go. The British marque had started strongly form pole but suffered with an exhaust problem and finished a lap down in second. In LMP2 the Pecom Racing Oreca of Nic Minassian, Pierre Kaffer and Luis Perez took the class win, in front of the championship-leading Starworks HPD, which had dominated the race but lost two laps in the final hour after a starter motor problem.

Welcome to the Sunny Times polo club, one of three to have opened in China, in the latest sign that the pastimes of the prosperous are finding a niche in the people&apos;s republic. The day is hazy, but usually the club&apos;s polo pitch offers impressive views of the mountains near the Great Wall, a two-hour drive out of Beijing. Visitors arrive in a fleet of Jaguars and Range Rovers for British Polo Day, a series of weekend jaunts designed to push polo as a soft-power tool. &quot;Polo is exploding in China,&quot; says Ben Vestey, managing director of British Polo Day. &quot;China is very much on the radar in a way that it wasn&apos;t two years ago.&quot; Polo, once a Tang dynasty (AD618-906) sport, was seldom played in China by the 1970s. Now, however, clubs are thriving in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Xia Yang, founder of Sunny Times, welcomes the resurgence. &quot;Polo started in China, so I wanted to open the gate for Chinese polo,&quot; said Xia, a property developer who was inspired to get involved in the sport after watching a documentary which featured Prince Charles at a match. Invitation-only events provide valuable networking opportunities but, above all, polo is an expression of ultimate luxury for those who have everything. &quot;In the west, polo is said to be an aristocrat&apos;s sport,&quot; Xia said. &quot;We don&apos;t have aristocrats in China, but we do have a lot of people who have got very rich very quickly. I want to encourage them to behave like gentlemen, and playing polo is part of that.&quot; This week, the Tianjin Goldin Metropolitan polo club will hold the inaugural Fortune Heights Super Nations Cup 2012. Professional teams from Hong Kong China, the US, England, Argentina and South Africa will play in a tournament hosted by the Federation of International Polo and the Tianjin Sports Bureau. Membership at the Metropolitan, which opened in 2010, starts at 380,000 renminbi (\u00a337,407), rising to 1.18m renminbi for the ownership of a polo team. Facilities include a five-star hotel, 14 restaurants, bars, and lounges, a spa, and air conditioned stables for pampered foreign-imported horses tended to by expats. Attendance at the Super Nations Cup is by invite only. But some critics suggest polo may be a fleeting fad designed to flaunt wealth or an opportunity to invest money in vast property schemes centred on the clubs. Knowledge of the game remains patchy. Back at the Sunny Times, a small crowd of Chinese spectators opposite the VIP tent wave national flags and hold giant images of foreign players flown in to teach and, in this tournament, represent China. &quot;There was lots of cheering last year,&quot; recalls one English polo player who took part in the games. &quot;Although not necessarily at the right moments.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-30T13:06:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/30/breast-cancer-examine-myself-lumps", "sentences": ["A large study in Shanghai of 266,064 women aged between 30 and 64 years of age found that those given breast self-examination instructions had the same numbers of cancers detected, and no reduction in the number of deaths."], "title": "Breast cancer: should I examine myself for lumps?", "article": "Nearly 900 women in the UK are  diagnosed with breast cancer each week. Yet according to a new report from Avon, a third of 2,000 British women surveyed never examine their breasts. Avon&apos;s Breast Promise campaign has teamed up with a psychologist to come up with tips to encourage women to regularly check their breasts. Daughters should be taught to check their breasts from 12 or 13 years of age, and be told it is as important as caring for their skin or hair. You should tell your family you will be checking your own breasts once a month, and set an automatic alarm on your phone to remind you. Or should you? Is examining your breasts useful? The solution We&apos;d all like to think women can help themselves to detect breast cancer but research from the Cochrane Collaboration, which adds up the results of lots of studies, says there is no evidence that self-examination works. In fact there is evidence it does more harm than good. Breast self-examination causes anxiety and can provide false reassurance, if women miss cancers. There has never even been agreement on the right way for women to examine their breasts. A large study in Shanghai of 266,064 women aged between 30 and 64 years of age found that those given breast self-examination instructions had the same numbers of cancers detected, and no reduction in the number of deaths. Women who examined their breasts had more biopsies for harmless lumps, which can cause scarring of the breast. What may be more useful is encouraging women to be aware of what their breasts look and feel like normally, rather than getting them to do a thorough regular examination. Being &quot;breast aware&quot; is preferred to self-examination by Cancer Research UK. This means looking out for changes in the nipple (a pulling inwards, bleeding or rashes), puckering of the skin, a lump or thickening that feels different, any change in the shape of the breast, how it hangs or if one breast becomes larger. Most cancers are found by women themselves (screening by mammography only finds one third to a half of breast cancers), the majority of whom don&apos;t practise self-examination but are aware of changes in their breasts. It&apos;s not clear from their report if Avon is suggesting women should self-examine or become breast aware. The report focuses on getting women into a habit of checking breasts. But they do seem to advocate monthly checks for which there is no evidence. As the authors of a paper in the European Journal of Cancer wrote, breast cancer support organisations should recognise their responsibilities. &quot;Intense promotional activity such as breast cancer awareness month every October results in dismayed clinicians finding their clinics overcrowded with the worried well to the detriment of patients with breast cancer.&quot;", "tags": ["Breast cancer", "Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Society", "Cancer research", "Medical research", "Science", "Cancer", "Health"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-30T20:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/01/innovation-advertising-daniele-fiandaca-cheil", "sentences": ["We grew it from 22 people in London to more than 300, with offices in London, Madrid, Milan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney and New York."], "title": "Careers talk: Daniele Fiandaca, head of innovation, Cheil", "article": "Hi Daniele, can you tell us a little bit more about Cheil and your role there as head of innovation?  Until recently Cheil UK has been one of London&apos;s best-kept secrets. It&apos;s a 100-strong integrated advertising agency \u2013 my job there as head of innovation is to make sure we stop being a secret and grow beyond our original Samsung heritage with new clients. That means working hard to build a culture that fosters innovation and ideas. It also means staying on top of current trends, understanding any impact they could have on our clients and their communications issues, and consequently delivering better ways to solve problems for them. Before Cheil I ran a global digital marketing agency called Profero with two friends. We grew it from 22 people in London to more than 300, with offices in London, Madrid, Milan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney and New York. I left to run my own consultancy for 18 months, and then joined Cheil. What does your average day look like? Fortunately, there&apos;s no such thing as an average day (one of the reasons I left Profero after 10 years is because all of a sudden I found I was constantly doing the same things). Now my days will comprise of anything and everything including work on client briefs, team brainstorms, new business meetings, internal team talks and external recruitment interviews. And I always make an effort every week to meet someone interesting, preferably at lunch or for a quick drink after work! What are the biggest challenges to your job and how do you overcome them? My biggest challenge is figuring out where to focus my energy; my role inevitably means there&apos;s so much I could cover, but not enough time to cover it. Lists are my saving grace \u2013 I&apos;ve become much better at using them to prioritise, and working closely with my boss and peers to bounce ideas around also helps to maintain perspective. What first made you want to work in advertising? Not many people know this, but my first work in advertising was actually starring in a TV commercial (it was for a series of karaoke tapes from Italian publisher Fabbri Editori and I&apos;m thankful there was no YouTube in those days). That was my first taste of the energy that&apos;s inherent in this business, but my big break came when I was looking to leave PwC (I started my career as an accountant) and one of my best friends asked me to join his little digital advertising agency. I was extremely lucky to get that opportunity \u2013 that agency was Profero \u2013 and I&apos;ve never looked back since. What&apos;s do you think is the key to being a good at what you do as head of innovation? Innovation for me is about finding better ways to solve problems as well as opening up opportunities that weren&apos;t there previously. It&apos;s left brain and right brain working in sync to create compelling and practical solutions. My business background coupled with my agency experience allows me to really marry an idea with solving a business problem in that way. One of the big attractions of Cheil is that it&apos;s unavoidably integrated, which means ideas aren&apos;t limited by a media discipline or channel. The other key ingredient is an interest in people, something which I&apos;ve always had \u2013 it&apos;s this inherent curiosity about what motivates people to make decisions that also helps in my role. Finally, you need to be a self-starter because a lot of the time, it really is up to you to create opportunities. What would you say your management style is? When I was 18 years old my parents let me manage their restaurant for 6 months, with very little interference. That experience taught me a lot, with the most notable lesson being: give people the room and space to make their own decisions and mistakes while still giving them direction and support when they need it. I hope that&apos;s how I manage. My expectations are high, certainly, and I can be quite tough, but I always try to be fair too. This approach clearly isn&apos;t for everyone but I hope I foster good team communication, and people enjoy working with me. What online resource can you not do your job without? That&apos;s impossible to answer because I&apos;m constantly online and hungry for ideas and inspiration. But if push really came to shove, I&apos;d hate to lose the people I follow on Twitter. What in advertising is really exciting you the most at the moment? No question, it&apos;s the fact that social media has changed the communications landscape forever, and we still don&apos;t really know what the long term impact will be. The one sure thing is that ad land is going to have to change accordingly, despite the fact that insight into people and their behaviour, coupled with ideas and creativity, will always be at its heart. Where do you see advertising and digital marketing in the next 5 years? Wow! I&apos;m not sure I really know where it&apos;ll be in the next 6 months, but I am convinced that any distinctions between advertising and digital marketing will be gone forever \u2013 everything will be digital (in my mind, it already is). We&apos;re also going to have similar issues with the distinction between digital, mobile and social very soon. What three tips would you give to a advertising professional or graduate looking to get to where you are? Be curious, work hard (but have fun), and get out there and meet people Any last words?  I&apos;m with Confucius: &quot;Love what you do and you&apos;ll never work a day in your life.&quot; Daniele Fiandaca is head of innovation at Cheil \u2013 follow Daniele on Twitter @yellif To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, sign up for free membership to the Guardian Media Network.

Plastic bottles can be sold for 1 mao (less than $0.02). For many older Chinese people, this is their retirement plan. The basic pension is just 55 yuan ($8.75) a month, forcing thousands to collect rubbish to make ends meet. Filial piety is the first of the five Confucian bonds that have traditionally tied Chinese society together; caring for one&apos;s parents in later life is a child&apos;s duty. But these bonds are being broken by China&apos;s rapid development. Life expectancy in the country has soared and the fertility rate has plummeted, putting a heavy financial burden on the next generation. China&apos;s fertility rate stands at 1.6, far below the 2.1 needed to sustain a growing population. In 2007, there were 167 million people over the age of 60, a number expected to grow to 480 million by 2050. The ratio of working-age adults to pensioners is 3:5, but thfigure is expected to fall to 2:1 by 2035. The one-child policy puts pressure on the second and third generations of only children. A couple who are both only children will have four parents to care for between them, and their children could potentially have four parents and eight grandparents to look after. Neighbouring countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, face similar problems. But these countries are already developed; China is unique in that it is getting old before getting rich. To tackle this problem, the Chinese government introduced a rural pension plan in 2009 and a new urban pension plan in 2011. Before 2009, only 30% of the population had a pension; now, 55% are covered (664 million people). Looking at the numbers, the pension plan appears to be a success \u2013 240 million people have signed up for the rural pension since it was introduced. But pensions vary from city to city, from urban to rural areas, and from public to private sectors. Last week, China announced plans to reform its pension system after a report published by the Bank of China and Deutsche Bank showed an 18.3tn yuan ($2.9tn) deficit in its social security fund in 2013. If nothing is done, this gap will widen to 68.2tn yuan ($10.9tn) by 2033. Part of the government&apos;s plan is to raise the retirement age, which at the moment is 60 for men, 55 for women working in white-collar industries, and 50 for blue-collar female workers. But 93.3% of the 450,000 respondents to a poll on the People&apos;s Daily website were against the idea, while only 2.4% were in favour. This puts the Chinese Communist party in an awkward position, not least because some of the most high-profile corruption scandals in China involved social security funds. In 2006, five Shanghai officials were sacked for misappropriating a third of the city&apos;s 10bn yuan social security fund. China also operates a dual-track system. Private sector workers pay 8% of their salary into the pension pot and their employers contribute another 3%. The government covers all public sector pensions, which are linked to government salaries rather than inflation, as government salaries rise faster than inflation.

Not so director Rian Johnson. He agreed to transplant the plot of his latest sci-fi blockbuster to another continent \u2013 from Paris to Shanghai \u2013 in order to gain lucrative Chinese funding. The switch paid off: this weekend Looper became the first new Hollywood film to make more money in its opening weekend in China than the US, provisional figures suggest. &quot;I&apos;m thrilled the movie did so well in China. I don&apos;t think any of us expected those kind of numbers. It&apos;s fascinating to watch that market emerge and crazy to suddenly be part of the story,&quot; Johnson said. He insisted shifting the action from France to China was not a creative sell-out, but &quot;gave us production value we&apos;d never dream of&quot;. He added: &quot;In many ways Shanghai was a more natural setting for a sci-fi movie than my beloved Paris.&quot; The film, which was shot for just $30m (\u00a318.5m) and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis as two versions of a futuristic hitman, made an estimated $21m on debut in the US. But according to Deadline it is likely to return $23m-$25m in China. The change in location, along with a number of other concessions, allowed Johnson&apos;s tale of time-travelling hitmen to become a US-Chinese co-production, allowing it to bypass strict rules on the number of foreign films shown in Chinese cinemas. Only 34 foreign features are allowed to be shown in Chinese cinemas each year. Co-productions, however, are exempt from this strict quota system, giving them a huge advantage in the world&apos;s most populous nation. Looper&apos;s stunning performance is sure to encourage other directors to tweak their work in order to appeal to the increasingly lucrative Sino audience, said Robert Cain, a producer and entertainment industry consultant who has been doing business in China since 1987. &quot;We will see far more of this in the future,&quot; he said. &quot;Like everywhere else in the world, Chinese people like watching films set in places they know, starring people who look like them.&quot; During a five-day visit to Beijing last month, Titanic and Avatar director James Cameron said he was looking very seriously at the possibility of a co-production with China. He said he was visiting the country on a fact-finding mission to &quot;find out what restrictions need to be met, find out what content guidelines need to be met, and find out the economic incentives are&quot;. The 3D re-issue of Cameron&apos;s Titanic earlier this year became the first Hollywood film to perform better in China than the US on opening. It ended up grossing $154.8m in China, compared with $57.9m in the states. More co-productions are likely after China announced in May it was to build a $1.27bn Hollywood co-production film studio. Doing business in China means dicing with the country&apos;s strict censor board. Earlier this year, the baddies from Men In Black 3 were excised from the China edition after the censors took offence at the fact they were all Chinese. Portraying any public official in anything other than a glowing light was a risk in China, said Cain: &quot;Police officers are always honest people of integrity who always catch their man. Tthere is no bloody crime in China, no homosexuality, no nudity and no &apos;excessively terrifying scenes&apos;. Horror is very difficult in China. You can&apos;t have ghosts or gore, no demons or monsters.&quot; With a potential 1.34 billion cinemagoers, China this year overtook Japan to become the biggest foreign market for Hollywood films. Twenty-five thousand screens are set to be installed in the country over the next five years, many with the latest 4k digital technology. China has also become the fastest growing IMAX market in the world, already home to 78 IMAX cinemas, six times as many as the number in the early 2010. And the country is launching its own version of IMAX technology, called DMAX. Already China boasts the third largest annual box office returns in the world. In 2011 alone, it rose by an annual rate of 18% to 12bn yuan (about \u00a31.22bn). China&apos;s spiralling demand for movies is propping up the ailing US box office \u2013 last year Chinese cinemagoers helped offset a drop in the US box office of 3.5% to $10.2bn, the lowest return in 16 years. It&apos;s easy to sum up what sort of film goes down well in China, said Cain. &quot;Action, number one. Action, number two \u2013 and action, number three.&quot; Film critic Craig Skinner said Hollywood &quot;spectacle&quot; films with simple plots do best in China. &quot;Films which are visually impressive and not too hard to digest perform well at the box office in China \u2013 plots which do not require the viewer to be familiar with certain cultural aspects,&quot; he said, citing Avatar as an example of a universally understood story which became the highest grossing movie in China in 2010, raking in 540m yuan ($85.6m) in only 15 days.

A middle-aged woman in red leggings shimmied to the\u00a0beat of a campaign song blasting from speakers.

He casts politics as an existential contest between good and evil, the oppressed and the oppressor. The next battle is on Sunday, when he seeks a third term to extend his 14-year rule to 2019. There is a clenched tension in the streets, for no one knows what will happen. Some polls give the president a wide lead, others show him trailing. Wild rumours fill the air: Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s family is selling its cattle herds and trucks in anticipation of fleeing to Cuba; pro-Ch\u00e1vez militias are preparing to seal off parts of Caracas; the opposition is planning to assassinate Ch\u00e1vez. Nonsense, but people are worried enough to stockpile water, batteries, tinned food and toilet paper. The election will decide the fate of Ch\u00e1vez, 58, and his revolution. Lose, and the revolution dies. Win, and it survives, but only for as long as the leader has a pulse. Ch\u00e1vez, Gabriel Garcia Marquez once noted, had &quot;a body of reinforced concrete&quot;. His energy was superhuman, his appetites prodigious. He drank more than 30 shots of sweet, black coffee daily, fuelling a routine that included 3am phone calls to ministers and aides. No longer. Cancer treatment has bloated and debilitated the comandante. After his diagnosis Ch\u00e1vez changed the slogan &quot;Fatherland, socialism or death&quot; to &quot;We will live and we will win&quot;. All references to &quot;muerte&quot; in official discourse have been expunged. &quot;There will be no death here, we must live,&quot; he instructed. But few believe his claims to be cured of a disease whose exact nature and location remains a closely guarded secret. Some palace insiders whisper it is terminal. The revolution hangs by a thread. There appears to be no plan B, no successor. Ch\u00e1vez surrounded himself mostly with mediocrities, valuing loyalty over competence or, it turned out, honesty. With the chief ailing they look lost. A rally in Catia, a Ch\u00e1vista bastion near the presidential palace, Miraflores, was abruptly cancelled in disarray. The foreign minister, Nicolas Maduro, put on a brave face but a microphone caught his murmured words: &quot;Que cagada.&quot; What a fuck-up. Not elegant but if Ch\u00e1vez loses it will be the campaign&apos;s epitaph. Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s absence from many rallies has given him the air of Banquo&apos;s ghost. He hovers in the form of television appearances, and occasional, relatively brief public appearances, an echo of the man who used to barnstorm the country and wade into crowds. Winning the election under such circumstances would be a triumph, and he may well pull it off, but it will not shake off the sense of fin de regime. His legacy will be debated for decades, much as people still argue over Juan Peron in Argentina. Many outsiders made up their minds long ago. There was Ch\u00e1vez the dictator who jailed opponents, sponsored terrorists and left his people hungry. And there was Ch\u00e1vez the hero who empowered the poor, deepened democracy and stood up to the US. While based in Caracas for the Guardian from 2006 to March this year I\u00a0would hear both versions on trips abroad. Dublin, Shanghai, San Francisco, it didn&apos;t matter where, opinion was polarised and passionate. And completely depressing. This was Venezuela of fantasy, a cartoonish projection, each side parroting simplicities and distortions as revealed truth. The reality was more complex and fascinating but if I broached oil dependency, or details that determined the fate of the revolution, eyes would glaze over. Few wanted to hear nuances of political economy. They wanted tales of the demon or gospels of faith. There was, arguably, a duality to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The poor boy from the plains who loved to sing and tell stories rose up army ranks and attempted a bloody coup in 1992 against an unpopular but democratically elected government. Six years later he took Miraflores via the ballot box but in power created a personality cult, abolished term limits, curbed private media and put the armed forces, legislature, judiciary and state oil company, PDVSA, under his personal control. He turned a blind eye to Farc guerrilla camps near the Colombian border and hailed the likes of Mugabe, Gaddafi and Assad as brothers. But the same president was adored by millions of his people, won free (if not always fair) elections, survived a US-backed coup, accepted electoral defeat (a 2007 referendum), spent oil revenues on health clinics, literacy courses and social programmes, slashed poverty, devolved power to communal councils, stood up to George Bush over Iraq, encouraged regional pride and assertiveness across Latin America and did it all with charisma and flair. The occasional clowning and buffoonery which grabbed headlines concealed a shrewd, sophisticated political mind. Ch\u00e1vez, in other words, was \u2013 is \u2013 a hybrid: a democrat and autocrat, a progressive and a bully. His &quot;Bolivarian revolution&quot;, named after the 19th-century revolutionary Sim\u00f3n Bolivar, has embodied these contradictions. What, then, has it wrought these 14 years? For Ruth Guerrero, a Chavista canvasser in Petare, a hillside slum in eastern Caracas, the answer was simple. &quot;Hope.&quot; The 56-year-old mother of three grew up poor and unemployed, unable to follow a yen for learning. Thanks to &quot;Mision Robinson&quot;, an adult education course, one of myriad social programmes, Guerrero obtained a law diploma and now earns $380 a month teaching at a Bolivarian university. &quot;Before that I had lived a life full of injustice. Ch\u00e1vez has been my teacher and leader.&quot; Guerrero&apos;s effort to hand out leaflets garnered little attention from passers-by, however, and she feared friends and neighbours would abandon Ch\u00e1vez. Polls show Petare voting for the opposition. &quot;I&apos;m worried. I keep telling them that the president doesn&apos;t like rubbish in the streets, or potholes, or insecurity, that he wants us to tackle them together.&quot; Guerrero was referring to the single most damning critique of the revolution, one that has nothing to do with Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s democratic credentials. Venezuela is falling apart. In the case of infrastructure, literally. Roads are crumbling, bridges falling, refineries exploding. A wheezing power grid condemns much of the country to rolling blackouts. Public hospitals, with a few exceptions, are dank, dingy affairs where patients must supply their own bedsheets, bandages and food. Prisons are filthy and riven by violence which claimed 500 lives last year. To massage statistics there was a tacit deal between authorities and some gang leaders to hang victims so they could be counted as suicide, a mid-ranking penal official told me. She had armfuls of documentation and grisly photographs. &quot;But how can I use it? If I do, I&apos;ll be fired, lose my pension and then be prosecuted.&quot; Murder rates have more than doubled, filling morgues and making Caracas deadlier than Baghdad, reflecting an underfunded, politicised judicial system. Kidnappers, sometimes in league with police, snatch victims from cars, shopping malls, university campuses and bus stops. A recent security plan did not reassure \u2013 by some counts it was Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s 20th such initiative. Lack of security is one reason so many young Venezuelans are emigrating, giving Caracas the melancholy nickname City of Farewells. The economy is not falling apart. It is growing about 5% this year, with unemployment of around 8%. It is, however, warping. Under Ch\u00e1vez Venezuela, which claims bigger oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, has seen prices leap from $9 a barrel to over $100, gushing about $980bn through PDVSA. Ahistoric bonanza begging a big question: where is the cash? Social programmes and subsidies \u2013 you can fill a car&apos;s petrol tank for around 50 cents \u2013 account for some, as do arms purchases and (mostly stalled) infrastructure projects. But much vanished. Ch\u00e1vez is no Mobutu. He did not build palaces in the jungle to store pink champagne. He did, however, create a tangle of economic controls which let opportunists in government, and those with friends in government, siphon off billions of public money. Few outsiders grasp how profoundly restrictions such as Cadivi \u2013 a currency control agency that tried to shore up the ever weakening Venezuelan bolivar \u2013 perverted the economy and spawned a class of high-rolling parasites nicknamed &quot;boligarchs&quot;. Ch\u00e1vez occasionally complained about them but let them get rich as long as they supported the government. Their revolution has been one of dodgy bond issues, government contracts and currency manipulation, yielding yachts, Rolexes and Hummers. They pay fashion designers such as Giovanni Scutaro, who used to dress Ch\u00e1vez, astonishing sums for outfits. &quot;When people from the United States and Europe come here and see our weddings, they go: &apos;Wow, so much money.&apos; There is no equilibrium between perceptions from afar and the reality of what is happening inside the country,&quot; Scutaro says. Last week a Reuters investigation detailed how more than half of public investment churns into secretive funds controlled by Ch\u00e1vez with no oversight by auditors or congress. One fund, called Fonden, swallowed about $100bn. Some was spent on white elephants \u2013 an abandoned newsprint factory, a &quot;city of aluminum&quot; \u2013 and on ill-fated investments in Ecuadorean bonds and Lehman Brothers-issued derivatives. In a functioning, accountable democracy this would be a huge scandal but Venezuela&apos;s government \u2013 plus state prosecutors and media \u2013 ignores it. &quot;That is not Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s money. That money belongs to 29 million Venezuelans and as such the information should be available to everyone,&quot; said Carlos Ramos, an opposition legislator. Harassing the private sector \u2013 investment evaporated amid expropriations \u2013 and bungled management of multiplying state enterprises translated into shrivelled agriculture and industry. Huge imports to fill the gap, though you would never guess it from Orwellian rhetoric trumpeting &quot;food sovereignty&quot; and &quot;manufacturing independence&quot;. The result is increased dependence on oil, now accounting for 96% of export earnings versus 80% a decade ago. That is why so many Venezuelans end up on pavements selling knick-knacks (they are counted as employed), or watching the clock in decaying state enterprises. This does not add up to collapse. There are always petrodollars to stuff into cracks. But analysts say that, regardless of who wins the election, Venezuela faces a grim economic reckoning. The economy is growing now only because of a splurge in government spending and borrowing, mostly from China. In the headquarters of PDVSA, his office overlooking Avenida Libertador, one of Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s top oil officials told me that the boss started as a pragmatist but turned ideological after opponents tried to oust him in a 2002 coup and general strike \u2013 soon after which oil revenues began booming. Then, in hushed tones of heresy: &quot;It was a historic opportunity that was wasted. He doesn&apos;t understand economics. Ch\u00e1vez doesn&apos;t know how to manage. As a manager he&apos;s a disaster.&quot; Venezuela&apos;s revolution has no gulags, no torture chambers, but in wasted potential lies tragedy. Here was a sublimely gifted politician with empathy for the poor and the power of Croesus \u2013 and the result, fiasco. Neither side likes to acknowledge it but the revolution is in many ways a continuum of oil-fuelled populism dating back half a century, notably that of the giddy, spendthrift 1974-79 administration of Carlos Andres Perez, the mercurial president Ch\u00e1vez tried to overthrow in 1992. The difference is Ch\u00e1vez had even more money, more power, more showmanship. It was easy to overlook the blunders while he strutted the stage, singing and dancing, blowing kisses, riding a bike, a horse, a tank, holding court from his desk, blending folk tales with ideological thunder, commandeering airwaves to talk and talk, sometimes for eight hours straight, oratorical marathons which exhausted aides, paralysed opponents and sucked up the oxygen. If Ch\u00e1vez were healthy he would have walked this election, his skills of enchantment steeled, as ever, by control of state resources and institutions. Instead, he has rationed his public appearances and relied on television to simulate the magic of old while his youthful opponent, Henrique Capriles, bursts into villages, towns and cities denouncing their dilapidation. When visiting the Caruachi hydro-electric plant to whip up support Ch\u00e1vez suffered the indignity of being heckled by workers demanding unpaid wages and the restoration of collective-bargaining rights. His microphone failed and a back-up sound system transmitted what sounded like shouts of &quot;justicia&quot;, justice, at which point state television cut the broadcast. A nation accustomed to highly choreographed presidential events with handpicked audiences gasped at the glimpse behind the curtain. Ch\u00e1vez can boast genuine accomplishments. He put poverty and social exclusion at the forefront of debate. He made millions feel they had an ally in government. And he called time on US browbeating in Latin America. But the price was high. Gutted institutions, a caudillo (strongman) cult, economic dysfunction. After a recent spate of bad news \u2013 a prison riot, a collapsed bridge, an oil refinery accident \u2013 Ch\u00e1vez reached for a telling metaphor. &quot;The show must go on.&quot; Maybe it will, maybe he will win, and live to rule. But what cost the spectacle? \u2022 Rory Carroll&apos;s book about Ch\u00e1vez, Comandante, will be published next March by Canongate in the UK and by Penguin Press in the US.

It is doubtful, however, whether any of these events receive quite the level of political backing that Beijing Design Week does. At the opening ceremony last weekend, Beijing&apos;s mayor and an auditorium full of government apparatchiks applauded through a televised marathon of speeches, bouquet presentations and dance performances. What did all this pomp signify? That design deserves the full treatment of the Communist party propaganda machine. In 2006, China&apos;s premiere, Hu Jintao, famously declared that he wanted to see the country move from &quot;made in China&quot; to &quot;designed in China&quot;. That top-level rhetoric has resulted in a wave of design weeks, biennials, museums and, above all, educational institutions. With 1,500 dedicated courses, China has more design students than any country in the world. The problem is that it also prompts a &quot;how far have they got?&quot; probing from western observers keen to look beyond the cliches of Chinese design \u2013 cliches about a culture of copying and a lack of independent thinking. Even among Chinese designers, the implicit pressure from on high is engendering a spiel fatigue. &quot;We want to forget about this &apos;made in China/designed in China&apos; slogan and just get on with it,&quot; says designer Naihan Li. And get on with it they have. In Caochangdi, a district renowned for its community of artists and designers, Li has opened up her home to exhibit her Crate series of furniture. Everything from her sofa to her entertainment system is designed as a foldable crate so she can move house at the drop of a hat. With Caochangdi under threat of demolition, it&apos;s a comment on the migratory life of a young creative in a city that is developing too fast for a stable domesticity. Of course, by redeveloping such creative neighbourhoods the government is working against its own policy of nurturing new talent, but there you go.     Streets ahead ... Urban Carpets, part of the Instant Hutong project by Marcella Campa and Stefano Avesani    In one of the neighbouring blocks of Caochangdi, two Beijing-based Italian architects are taking on similar issues. Marcella Campa and Stefano Avesani have been mapping the city&apos;s hutongs, the traditional alleyways that are rapidly being demolished to make way for highrises. Turning their maps into carpets, they&apos;ve been hanging them in hutong neighbourhoods so that residents can see a streetscape that is too fine-grained to feature on official maps, and may disappear before they ever do. One such neighbourhood is Dashilar, an area near Tiananmen Square that the government is actually interested in preserving. For Beijing Design Week it is hosting dozens of pop-up exhibitions by local and international designer-makers. There&apos;s an interesting exhibition of zine culture \u2013 with the government monitoring the internet so closely, hand-printed pamphlets appear to be flourishing. Indeed, most of the work in Dashilar has a craft dimension to it. There is no industrial or product design, nor any sign of China&apos;s fearsome manufacturing muscle. The same is true at the 751 design park, a former power plant in the famous 798 cultural district. Here the emphasis is on reinterpretations of Ming chairs and other traditional Chinese furniture. It is not the stuff of a thrusting nation with ambitions to be a global design powerhouse. You wonder whether the clapping politicos at the opening ceremony knew what an embryonic and craft-orientated scene they were pumping up. Given that Beijing Design Week&apos;s self-proclaimed goal is to develop home-grown industries, brands and talent, it would have been encouraging to see more links being fostered between young designers and Chinese manufacturers. Or is it still true, as Lorraine Justice notes in her book China&apos;s Design Revolution, that most Chinese clients only want &quot;copies of products that have been successful on the market instead of orders for fresh \u2026 untested products&quot;? Or perhaps BJDW is symptomatic of China&apos;s highly regionalised design cultures, with industrial design focused in the southern cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and branding and domestic products located in Shanghai? Beijing, in contrast, is better known as a centre of art, furniture and fashion. &quot;The difference between the regions can be quite stark,&quot; says Aric Chen, BJDW&apos;s American-Chinese creative director. &quot;And Beijing has a higher degree of consciousness about what Chinese culture is. Designers here are really asking themselves how to express traditional applied arts and philosophy in a new way. China spent a lot of time destroying its own culture, and it&apos;s still rediscovering what it used to be and figuring out what it means now.&quot;     Hot seat ... paper-pulp chairs designed by Chinese design studio Pinwu    The luckiest of these designers may get to sell their wares at Wuhao, an exclusive boutique hidden in the hutongs of the Dongcheng district. Occupying a courtyard house that belonged to the last empress, Wuhao only sells work by Chinese designers and caters to a new elite&apos;s taste for luxury that is less cliched than Swiss watches and Italian furniture. Here you&apos;ll find delicate flatware and searching furniture, such as Xiao Tianyu&apos;s Ming-style chair backs plunged into soft poufs, or Pinwu&apos;s paper-pulp chairs. And what of the tens of thousands of design students graduating in China every year? At the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing&apos;s top design school, I meet Fei Jun, an associate professor who runs the media lab. His interaction design students produce slick iPad apps and go on to get good jobs, but he worries that most graduates are not so lucky. In fact, one of the reasons why design is the second most popular subject in the country is that the standard of entry is so low. &quot;We joke that even some medical schools have design departments,&quot; says Jun. On the other hand, he says, &quot;We can joke about it but we&apos;re seeing progress, and that&apos;s why we&apos;re optimistic.&quot; As any interaction designer would, Jun finds BJDW a little conservative for his tastes but he&apos;s encouraged by the way a younger generation of designers is getting involved. And it is clear that the event privileges a young scene \u2013 many of these designers are still in their 20s, and are keen to shake off any stereotypes being imposed on them, either by westerners or the Communist party. More independent-minded than their predecessors, this is China&apos;s design future. And things are moving fast here. &quot;The change even since I came here four years ago is really dramatic,&quot; says Chen.", "tags": ["Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "Craft", "Exhibitions", "China"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-04T16:17:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/stop-bashing-bankers-ken-livingstone", "sentences": ["What I&apos;ve always said to the mayors of Shanghai and Mumbai is \u2013 if you want to be a great international financial centre, you&apos;ve got to allow about 30% of the population to be foreigners."], "title": "Is it time to stop bashing bankers? | Ken Livingstone and Anthony Fry", "article": "Banker bashing is still a national pastime following the financial crash and Libor-fixing scandal. But could we be approaching a time when we have to acknowledge that banks might be good for Britain? Former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who earlier this year quipped, &quot;Hang a banker a week until the others improve&quot;, takes on investment banker Anthony Fry. Aida Edemariam referees. Anthony Fry: If you&apos;re in my position, you have to start with some admissions. The majority of banks were extremely poorly managed. They completely failed to promote the right culture within their organisations. They failed to protect their corporate reputations. And those things contributed to the irresponsible behaviour of a minority of people. But when you think about the number of people who have been extremely hard-working, honourable, and doing a very good job, we run the risk of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Ken Livingstone: The majority of people who work for banks aren&apos;t that well paid and had no role in the financial collapse. But the last 200 years of capitalism has been a cycle of banks taking terrible risks, catastrophic collapse, tight regulation, and 50 years on, seducing politicians to removing the controls. Let&apos;s have a Glass\u2013Steagall (the separation of investment and commercial banking, introduced under Roosevelt) for modern\u00a0times \u2013 that&apos;s essentially what Miliband&apos;s come out for\u00a0this week. Aida Edemariam: As mayor, you presided over the biggest financial boom in London&apos;s history; the City spilled out into Mayfair, Savile Row, along the South Bank to the Shard. It changed London. KL: There are huge benefits. What I&apos;ve always said to the mayors of Shanghai and Mumbai is \u2013 if you want to be a great international financial centre, you&apos;ve got to allow about 30% of the population to be foreigners. Because that&apos;s what New York and London&apos;s got. AF: It also has an acceptance of the rule of law \u2013 though one of the reasons that antagonism towards the banking community has lasted so long has been that to date not a single person on either side of the Atlantic has been penalised, other than at the margins. I agree with Ken \u2013 I think that being a financial centre brings benefits. AE: For the average person? Really? AF: The most remarkable thing about the Olympics was that all 204 nations had a community in this city. Never before has that happened. That is, partly, because London is an attractive place for large numbers of people to come, despite some massive social problems. AE: However international London gets, wherever people come from, they have to live somewhere. In the boom, Ken, it became a city where no working-class person could live in the centre. The middle class is just hanging on. That&apos;s a\u00a0strange legacy for a\u00a0socialist mayor. KL: That&apos;s not the fault of the bankers. AE: It&apos;s an effect of what bankers did. KL: That&apos;s the fault of politicians. We used to build, in Britain, over 200,000 homes a year, and about half were council housing. Thatcher stopped building. Blair carried that on. So throughout the 1980s and 90s we were building about half the homes we needed to, to cope with the demand. That&apos;s why prices have gone through the roof. AE: But it&apos;s not just that. There has been\u00a0so much money, bankers&apos; bonuses going into housing stock. KL: We have a shortage of supply, so the price will rise. The way to deal with that is either a vast regulatory system like something out of the old Soviet Union, or you just build more housing. AF: There are lots of ironies about the crisis. There was one bank that supposedly had the best structure for making sure the interests of investors, depositors and so forth were aligned, and that was Lehman Brothers \u2013 which I worked for briefly \u2013 where more than half of people&apos;s compensation was paid in Lehman stock, which you had to hold. No matter what you did, clerical, secretarial, the janitor, you got Lehmans stock. When Lehman Brothers collapsed they were the biggest losers. So you&apos;ve got to be careful. The bonus question is twofold. As you start realigning, you end up with unintended consequences. Again, coming back to politicians \u2013 they ran with the hares and hunted with the hounds. The fact is, in the early 2000s, big cash bonuses were being taxed at 50%. This was a windfall for the treasury. I would argue that successive politicians failed to invest the monies they were getting in sustainable ways. If you have a growing population and you don&apos;t have many houses, you will end up with a house boom that is worsened by bonuses, but not created by bonuses. KL: Part of the problem is politicians. We, for political reasons \u2013 and Blair carried on with this \u2013 were encouraged to buy. We encouraged borrowing. AE: When you say politicians you&apos;re including yourself? KL: Oh no, I never did. Every single one of the 13 budgets I produced \u2013 five at the GLC, the rest as mayor \u2013 every one was balanced. We only ever borrowed for investment \u2013 things like Crossrail. Revenue budget was always in balance. If I&apos;d been given the powers of the chancellor, this would be a different economy. My real damnation of the Blair-Brown government is that they didn&apos;t build homes for people to live in, and they neglected our manufacturing. AF: Like it or not, governments are going to need banks to get the cash flowing. We need thousands of homes. That&apos;s just a fact. We must find a way of moving on, because perception is driving reality. The debate is getting lost in extreme language. Words like cesspit \u2026 AE: Or hang the bankers \u2026 AF: Indeed, but I took that as Ken&apos;s wit. AE: You both keep talking about regulation, but for the person in the street it&apos;s neither here nor there. For them, nothing has changed, or it&apos;s got worse, they&apos;ve lost their job or their benefits. AF: The banks didn&apos;t say to governments, go off and borrow X amount of the GDP every year! Governments did it for a variety of reasons, quite a lot of which were political. If they borrowed money and supported programmes that put money directly into people&apos;s pockets, as opposed to investing in infrastructure, the inevitable result was that they borrowed too much money.

Having won his first grand slam title at the US Open last month, he knew that getting back into the swing of things on the regular Tour would take a bit of time and so it proved as the Scot suffered his first defeat since \u2013 a 6-3, 6-7, 7-6 loss to Canada&apos;s Milos Raonic in the semi-finals of the Japan Open in Tokyo. Murray had hammered Raonic on his way to victory at the US Open and it will have irritated him to let slip a match in which, having been outplayed early on, he had led 4-1 in the deciding set and held two match points at 6-5 on the Raonic serve. It will be a consolation that Raonic, who is ranked 14th, but who is an outside bet to clinch one of the remaining places for next month&apos;s Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in London, played one of his best matches. The Canadian has been nicknamed The Missile for his huge serve and he deserved his win. &quot;He played well behind his first serve,&quot; Murray said. &quot;That made it tough for me. There was always going to be a bit of residue from the last few months.&quot; Murray missed a regulation backhand on the second match point that will have riled him, but it is unlikely to be a defeat that lingers long. The world No3 played well enough throughout the week to know his game is in good shape and, in the remaining weeks of the season, he intends to build on his triumphs in New York and at the Olympics, where he won gold. &quot;I&apos;m happy with the way I&apos;ve fought in my matches,&quot; said Murray, who was in a jovial mood throughout the week and whose game, for the most part, had the confidence of a man whose burden has been lifted. &quot;My focus has been very good. I wanted to make sure I kept the momentum going, I want to keep that up for the rest of the year.&quot; That focus slipped a little against Raonic, who showed why so many people believe he could be the next man to challenge the top four of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Murray and Rafael Nadal. The 21-year-old, who moved to Canada from Montenegro when he was three years old, did not let Murray dictate as he had done in New York; instead, he came forward whenever he could and grasped the initiative. Murray spoke this week about how satisfying his US Open triumph had been \u2013 and not just because the questions about emulating Fred Perry no longer apply \u2013 but because he had found\u00a0a way to win even when he wasn&apos;t playing at his absolute best. His final against Djokovic was played in cold, windy conditions, but Murray showed he could cope with the occasion. In the past, Murray has flip-flopped between trying to play well in every event or just focusing on the grand slams and felt people criticised him either way. The addition of Ivan Lendl as coach at the start of the year helped him to believe in himself more and now every time he steps on the court he wants to be ready to win the tournament. Murray hopes his new attitude will help him to claim more grand slam titles and, in time, the No1 ranking. His defeat in Tokyo cost him a few points but he still has 4,000 points to play for, up to\u00a0and including London, where he will be a favourite to win the title for the first time. The first task will come in Shanghai, where he arrived on Saturday, trying to win\u00a0the title for the third year in a row. Having got the soreness out of his body, he said he expects to play well in Shanghai, where he begins against either Bernard Tomic of Australia or Florian Mayer of Germany. &quot;When I haven&apos;t played for a few weeks, the first couple of matches seem to be a little bit harder, but once you get through them my body tends to feel better,&quot; he said. &quot;So I&apos;m glad I got a lot of matches in this week and I&apos;ll be feeling good for Shanghai.&quot;", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-06T14:37:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/07/how-do-we-fix-this-mess-robert-peston-review", "sentences": ["And &quot;understanding&quot;, again, is the key word for the future: understanding that one version of capitalism has failed, understanding that we have to boost banks&apos; reserves, regulate their borrowing, get a handle on the casino markets that stretch from Shanghai to Leadenhall Street."], "title": "How Do We Fix This Mess? by Robert Peston and Laurence Knight \u2013 review", "article": "Here&apos;s the thing, as Robert Peston compulsively remarks online, on air and in print: how come many acclaimed experts \u2013 Gordon Brown, Alan Greenspan, Hank Paulson, Fred the Shred and Merv the Swerve \u2013 got it so calamitously wrong? How come they were all credit-crunched in 2008 and 2009? Even Peston wasn&apos;t infallible. He could see desolation arriving but not to a precise schedule, not so that he could raise his voice in BBC editorial meetings and demand a special timber-shivering spot on Today. This mess caught everyone flat-footed \u2013 and by far the best half of his book is explaining how and why. Peston, to be fair, did know that something was drastically wrong. He got his famous Northern Rock scoop because he&apos;d spotted that the Rock \u2013 overleveraged, overborrowed, overconfident that the good times would roll on for ever \u2013 was patently vulnerable once confidence wobbled. He was waiting for the Bank of England to lurch to the rescue: his exclusive was rooted in analysis. But he&apos;s utterly right \u2013 here&apos;s another thing! \u2013 to turn some of his fire on journalists themselves, on the dogs that\u00a0didn&apos;t bark. Begin with newspaper editors who &quot;rarely knew much about business and the economy and couldn&apos;t have cared less&quot; about the continuing yarn of who was up or down on the stock market that day. Ask where, apart from the very specialist press, you could find any coverage of bond markets, derivatives, foreign exchange markets and, crucially, debt markets. &quot;For years all this borrowing and lending was thought of as the equivalent of a sewage system or an electricity grid \u2013 necessary but dull.&quot; Yet suddenly the sewage started to swill down Threadneedle Street as the grid went up in flames. Peston, from his earlier stints on the Investors Chronicle and the FT, was more up to speed than most. He&apos;d followed the mushroom growth of foreign exchange trading, bond markets, the whole derivatives industry offering you a speculative punt-cum-malign insurance hedge bet on &quot;the weather in the Caribbean, the unemployment rate in Japan, the risk of political unrest in China&quot;. Make that $43\u00a0trillion of unallocated loans, around 61% of global GDP. Set these swirling currents of funny money flowing across the world each morning against the shrinking reserves that banks were required to keep liquid and guard against very rainy days, and anyone who understood the true situation could see big, big trouble\u00a0building. But who, in reality, spotted such looming\u00a0peril? You can excuse the FT a few boots, give a nod of approval to a small group of watchful pundits; but the list of those who seemed asleep at the wheel is jolting. The press didn&apos;t sound the alarm; MPs couldn&apos;t tell their credit default swaps from the holes in their socks; the Treasury and its dominant minister \u2013 &quot;No more boom and bust&quot; \u2013 looked idiotic the moment the tsunami struck. The feted CEOs of the City&apos;s great financial institutions were as far off the pace as any. Maybe greed \u2013 and the fact that the more leveraged you were the fatter the profits you could make, and then pay yourself \u2013 blinded them to the risks they were taking. But maybe, too, they didn&apos;t fully comprehend how exposed that left them. Maybe, like so much of a Britain gorged on easy credit over two decades, they didn&apos;t understand the state they and we were all in. And &quot;understanding&quot;, again, is the key word for the future: understanding that one version of capitalism has failed, understanding that we have to boost banks&apos; reserves, regulate their borrowing, get a handle on the casino markets that stretch from Shanghai to Leadenhall Street. It isn&apos;t just bankers&apos; bonuses or City pay scales in general that matter. It&apos;s understanding what&apos;s going on so that we can control it better \u2013 and there&apos;s the rub. Do we understand the arcane but decisive markets any more clearly than we did a decade ago? Does George Osborne exude a detailed mastery of his brief, or Ed Balls convince us that just a little more juice would help the engine tick back towards former glories? Have we absorbed the harsh lessons \u2013 here repeated \u2013 about borrowing more today than we can possibly pay back tomorrow? (See homilies about kick-starting growth that, in truth, can probably be forgotten for another 10 years or more). There&apos;s a chilling moment Peston recalls from Sir Mervyn King&apos;s Today lecture this year, where the Governor says frankly that &quot;we should have shouted from the rooftops that a system had been built in which the banks were too important to fail&quot;. It&apos;s almost a mea culpa, says Peston: but not quite. &quot;For it was prefaced by &apos;with the benefit of hindsight&apos; \u2013 and when any of us say &apos;if I knew then what I know now&apos;, we are excusing ourselves, not apologising.&quot; It&apos;s sensible to say that Peston has less to apologise for than many, and to add that his discursive, conversational but entrancingly fact-studded trip around the disaster zone ought to be mandatory reading for anyone who wants to have a voice in where we go from here. Peston and his more shadowy co-author, Laurence Knight, have performed a signal service. But it is also fair to say that their description of how we got into this mess is much more compelling than their prescriptions for how we get out of it, which tend to be now conventional calls for more rigid regulation, more visionary leadership, more public acceptance of hardship and toil. Well, yes: with the benefit of hindsight, that&apos;s all fine and dandy. But as a way out of the swamp it doesn&apos;t seem overwhelmingly convincing. Peston&apos;s last chapter \u2013 rather obviously added near close of publisher play \u2013 is all about rigging the Libor rate and the horror of Barclays. Did he, or anyone else, see that coming when he started on chapter one? And if not, how do we expect to clear away the debris of the past? We may know, in infinite, grisly detail, what Andrew Mitchell said to a policeman in Downing Street, stuff we can debate over a pint without breaking sweat. But when the real stories seize us by the throat, are we any less in the dark than before?", "tags": ["Business and finance", "Financial crisis", "Banking", "Economics", "Financial sector", "Politics", "Bank of England", "Barclays", "Northern Rock", "Alan Greenspan", "Libor", "Mervyn King", "George Osborne", "Robert Peston", "Books", "Ed Balls", "Business", "Politics", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-06T23:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/08/beijing-air-quality-monitor", "sentences": ["US consulates in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu also post readings of the cities&apos; air quality on Twitter."], "title": "Beijing air quality to be better monitored", "article": "Beijing authorities have completed a network of monitors that will more accurately measure air quality in the smog-ridden city after being pushed into it by public pressure and pollution reports from the US embassy. The Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Centre said on Saturday that another 15 monitoring stations had begun releasing real-time data on small particulates known as PM2.5. The tiny pollution particles that may result from the burning of fuels in vehicles and power plants can penetrate deep into the lungs, so measuring them is considered a more accurate reflection of air quality than other methods. Chinese citizens have prodded their government into publishing more detailed pollution data since the US embassy started publishing PM2.5 readings taken from its rooftop on Twitter. Beijing started releasing PM2.5 data in January. It now has 35 monitoring stations set up in central Beijing and its suburbs, including near tourist favourites Tiananmen Square, the Temple of Heaven and the Beijing botanical garden. The monitors will run for a three-month trial, and then the city&apos;s environmental protection department will formally use PM2.5 to evaluate the city&apos;s air quality, rather than relying on the larger particles it currently measures. White mist sat stubbornly among the capital&apos;s skyscrapers on Sunday as people travelled home on the final day of an eight-day public holiday that had brought with it mostly blue skies as industry shut down. &quot;Is it fog or is the PM2.5 higher than normal?&quot; Zhao Yiyi, at Beijing airport, wrote on the popular microblogging site Sina Weibo. She added&quot;: &quot;Such air quality, it&apos;s horrible.&quot; Just after lunchtime, the US embassy, which measures the air from its rooftop, tweeted that the PM2.5 reading, at 137 micrograms per cubic meter, was unhealthy. The Beijing environmental monitoring website reported a similar reading from a nearby station for that hour, but it didn&apos;t interpret the data. Guidance on the website suggested that such a reading would be termed satisfactory if it became part of the daily air quality roundup. The US embassy rates pollution levels according to a US Environmental Protection Agency standard, which is more stringent than that used by the Chinese government. Appearing frustrated with the dueling standards, the Chinese government told the embassy to stop publishing the data in June. It said it wasn&apos;t fair to judge Chinese air by American standards because China is a developing country and noted that US environmental guidelines have become more strict over time. US consulates in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu also post readings of the cities&apos; air quality on Twitter. Last month, the US ambassador to China indicated that its remaining consulates in Shenyang and Wuhan would also monitor air pollution levels. &quot;We&apos;ve been criticised by the Chinese government for having such a monitor, but we feel it&apos;s a duty \u2013 our duty to inform our dependents and our Americans of the air conditions there so they can make appropriate decisions regarding the health of their children and themselves,&quot; Gary Locke said, according to the transcript of the event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, DC. &quot;We&apos;re expanding this to all the different consulates throughout China.&quot; Explaining PM2.5 to the audience, Locke said: &quot;It&apos;s the really invisible stuff that can really cause a lot of damage to respiratory systems and health. It&apos;s almost akin to being exposed to secondhand smoke constantly, or even smoking several packs a day.&quot;", "tags": ["Pollution", "Environment", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-08T09:54:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/oct/08/socal-enterprise-network-daily", "sentences": ["Guizhou to transform rural credit cooperatives into banks China Daily: Guizhou province is gearing up to transform 25 rural credit cooperatives into commercial banks by the end of the year by attracting external funds, the Shanghai Securities News reported on Monday."], "title": "Social enterprise network daily: Monday 8 October", "article": "Time to sharpen your act for a new NHS commissioning world Social Enterprise Live: The significant changes in healthcare commissioning have been well documented and debated.

Yes, that China! A nation that will, within, five years, overtake the US as the world&apos;s most powerful economy. Which is already the world&apos;s largest exporter of goods, has a population of 1.3bn people, more than 100 cities of one million people, a standing army of 1.2m and after 3,000 years of civilization is all set to dominate the current century economically and culturally. And which, more importantly, also invented the battered pork ball and the prawn cracker, something that must never, ever be forgotten, even as the tide of irreversible historical ascent turns our attention to more trivial matters. &quot;[Lampard] has always told pals he is more interested in a challenge than money,&quot; the Sun adds, which, on balance, and faced with the chance to earn \u00a31m a month for taking a few free kicks and occasionally turning up at the opening of a vast rural wing nut production facility, makes him seem less rather than more like a normal guy like you and me. The LA Galaxy are also keen. Also in The Sun Harry Redknapp is &quot;on Rangers alert&quot;, which involves dropping into a crouch position and walking backwards around the kitchen very slowly, eyes narrowed, occasionally wheeling around ready to get Shaun Wright-Phillips in a headlock.

Also, &quot;Redknapp, 65, has a proven track record of beating the drop&quot;. It certainly sounds tempting, particularly as &quot;influential figures at the club know they have to act swiftly&quot; (NB actual quotes from influential figures not included). Elsewhere, Liverpool are favourites to sign the Torino defender Angelo Ogbonna who is 24 and would cost \u00a316m and Reading are still keen on Burnley striker Charlie Austin. In the Mirror Birmingham are considering very politely asking the ex-Manchester United scamp Ravel Morrison if he wouldn&apos;t mind stopping kicking a ball against their front windows and, you know, going away, they really don&apos;t want to have to ask again and no, no, really it&apos;s fine, you take your time, ha ha, yes they&apos;re just going inside for a bit to cry and peer through the curtains. Morrison has yet to start a match for Lee Clark or, as far as The Mill can remember, pretty much anyone. He does, though, probably have a really flash car. The Mirror also reports that Roberto Mancini is still fiddling with his hair and casting a series of smouldering sideways glances in the direction of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid goal machine Radamel Falcao. The Colombian, who is valued at \u00a345m in City Money, has recently been quoted as saying &quot;I used to watch the Premier League on TV as a kid. Players like Roy Keane, Eric Cantona, Zola, and Asprilla at Newcastle&quot;. Yes yes and the English ones too. Players like Nicky Butt, Rob Lee and Dennis Wise. According to the Daily Mail Arsenal are &quot;lining up a swoop&quot; for Crystal palace It-boy Wilfried Zaha, who could be a replacement for Theo Walcott in the galloping utility striker-disappointment role. Walcott is still unsure whether to sign a new \u00a375,000-a-week deal. The Mill pictures him looking at his new \u00a375,000-a-week deal, sniffing it, circling it, scuttling away from it, then back, then away again, picking it up and veering off in an unexpected direction, then dithering around it for a bit, before eventually falling over somewhere near the corner flag while Ars\u00e8ne Wenger does his &quot;seated-crucifixion&quot; touchline frustration pose. Zaha would cost \u00a312m. On Goal.com Manchester City are still keen on signing Stevan Jovetic from Fiorentina. Jovetic, who is 22-years-old and a Montenegrin international. He&apos;s available for \u20ac30m and scored four goals in his first six league games this season and already looks like a decent fit for the three-rows-back-behind-David-Platt-looking-glazed-in-a-beanie-hat role. Juventus have also expressed an interest. And still on Goal.com Rafael Marquez, now of the New York Red Bulls, says touchline dreamboat Pep Guardiola, currently working in a Kibbutz laundry in southern Israel, would be &quot;perfect for Arsenal&quot;.

The escalation also turns &quot;sexually motivated touching&quot; into a sex crime with the possibility of jail time. I applaud lawmakers&apos; effort to address this critical issue, but I am not convinced that harsher punishments for sexual harassment on the subway will yield the desired effect. The most lamentable aspect of taking public transportation as a woman is enduring the unsavory boys and men who exploit the shared space and put our safety in jeopardy. Masturbation, sexual assault, rape and whatever you call what this guy was doing are the more invasive (not to mention illegal) behaviors that disrupt our journeys. Women understand that most men don&apos;t engage in this brand of sexual violence, and we applaud the many men who take action to disrupt this injustice when it occurs. But the number of guys who are doing these things is sizable enough to make most women suspicious and uneasy during our commutes. Subway harassment isn&apos;t only a problem for women in New York City: Boston, Chicago and, recently, Washington, DC have all implemented ad campaigns to raise awareness about the issue and encourage riders to report incidents. And across the globe in Beijing, a furious debate erupted in August after the Shanghai No 2 Metro Operation Company issued a public statement blaming harassment on women who wear sexy clothing. Transportation in cities in Egypt, Japan and India have women-only sections, where the hope is that separation might actually equal increased public safety. Still, the problem persists across cultures and national borders. By the time women become teens, we are intimately familiar with the dangers that come with entering public space. (Though, let&apos;s be real, our homes, schools and workplaces aren&apos;t that safe either.) We&apos;ve been harassed and assaulted. We&apos;ve been dismissed by police after being harassed and assaulted. We&apos;ve been harassed and assaulted by police. We&apos;ve been blamed by judges after being harassed and assaulted by police. We&apos;ve been jailed for defending ourselves against harassment and assault. For women, as a Bengali idiom deftly states, there&apos;s a tiger on land and a crocodile in the water.  When lawmakers cut taxes on the wealthy that fund public transportation, it results in service decreases that mean riders spend more time in the transit system. It also leads to layoffs of transit employees who could be monitoring safety and holding violators accountable for infractions. Instead, crime is increasing in the New York City subways, not because our laws aren&apos;t tough enough already, but because the ones that exist aren&apos;t adequately enforced. Hence, my skepticism about the effectiveness of the newly proposed legislation. A statement from Public Advocate Bill de Blasio&apos;s office reads:   &quot;The City Police Department receives over 1,000 complaints a year for public lewdness or forcible touching.&quot;  Only 1,000 complaints? In 2011, the New York weekday subway ridership averaged 5.3m. With millions of women taking the subway every day, the number of complaints police receive seems implausibly, worryingly low. According to a 2007 survey about sexual violence in the subway conducted by the Manhattan borough president&apos;s office, only 4% of people who are sexually harassed on the subway report the incident. This finding fueled a citizen-led advocacy effort that prompted public service announcements on buses and trains. But five years later, the numbers still strongly suggest that a majority of violated riders do not make formal complaints. In a climate where Republican elected officials make scientifically unsound statements about &quot;legitimate rape&quot; and blame an 11-year-old gang rape victim &quot;because she was dressed like a 21-year-old prostitute&quot;, it&apos;s no surprise that victims of sexual violence choose to remain silent. They may post blurry cellphone photos on blogs with semi-anonymous stories of outrage, but precious few resort to the institutional mechanisms that have been established to ensure their safety. Until we get to the root of what the barriers are and take the steps necessary to remove them, creating harsher legislation is simply spinning wheels. Some groups, like Collective Action for Safe Spaces (Cass), are already leading the way by drawing on local expertise and creating strategic, community-driven, innovative solutions addressing the issues that impact on one&apos;s willingness to report a crime. Recognizing street harassment as a complex and multifaceted issue: Cass takes a comprehensive approach by combining direct services, online and offline advocacy, grassroots movement-building and education and training. It works in coalition with other likeminded organizations in our nation&apos;s capital, and it is creating a model that can be adapted elsewhere in the US and the world. Our right to be secure in public spaces is at the forefront of justice movements all over the globe. It&apos;s exciting to know that, one day, this blight affecting us all will come to an end, not as a result of tougher laws, but because concerned citizens are standing up and demanding the right to live more dignified lives.", "tags": ["US crime", "Women", "US news", "World news", "Rape and sexual assault", "Law", "New York", "US domestic policy"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-09T16:34:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/10/football-transfer-rumours-wilfried-zaha", "sentences": ["After Tuesday&apos;s &quot;Chinese takeaway&quot; analogy to herald rumours of Frank Lampard&apos;s possible summer move to Shanghai Shenhua or Beijing Guoan, the Sun&apos;s punning reaches illogical depths this morning, topping the R\u00e9my story with &quot;We Loic him&quot;, which works only if you have a pronunciation impediment."], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Wilfried Zaha to Liverpool, Arsenal or City?", "article": "There&apos;s quite a lot for Brendan &quot;OK&quot; Rodgers to get his teeth into this morning as the Channel 5 Friday night star, the possessor of an end-of-sentence verbal tic to rival Gordon Ramsay&apos;s &quot;yes&quot;, Rafael Nadal&apos;s &quot;no&quot; and Cheryl Cole&apos;s &quot;like&quot;, joins the rest of Britain in its national pastime of querying the worth of the BBC&apos;s Alan Shearer.

The Mirror has the latest leak from the colon crime Being: Liverpool, announcing that the next instalment contains Rodgers&apos;s pre-match talk before the West Bromwich Albion game. He tells his squad that he is holding three envelopes in which he has written the names of the Liverpool players and members of staff who, because they have fought everything, will let him down that season. &quot;Make sure you&apos;re not the one in the envelope,&quot; he says. Yikes. Does he now have four with Pepe Reina&apos;s name added? One name that won&apos;t be in the envelope next season is the former Wigan defender Andreas Granqvist. The Genoa player had been linked with a move to either Milan or Internazionale in the summer but is now hoping Liverpool come calling with a \u00a35m bid in January. Sky Sources, or more accurately/astonishingly a named Sky Source, Gianluca Di Marzio, broke the story. Finally on Liverpool, they&apos;re not going to let Arsenal have a free run at Crystal Palace&apos;s Wilfried Zaha and allow the Gunners to sign their first Wilf since Rostron. Manchester City, however, are also flirting with the Z-man. If they are priced out of a bid, Rodgers may turn instead to Hamburg&apos;s South Korea forward Son Heung-min, reports the Mail. Hang on, it also says here that Liverpool&apos;s long-term interest in Mesut Ozil will be thwarted, as will Manchester United&apos;s, by the player&apos;s desire to stay at Real Madrid. Sadly there is no word on their long-term interest in Lionel Messi and Carlos Slim.

Skyfall thinks it knows how: by laying out the bunting and putting on a show; by booking a delicious villain in Javier Bardem&apos;s high-camp terrorist and arranging a glorious globe-hopping jaunt\u00a0for the revellers. All of which works terrifically well up to a point. Except that Skyfall then falls prey to a common failing of many 50th birthday bashes: it allows sentimentality to cloud its judgment and loosen its tongue. In so doing, it risks blowing James Bond&apos;s cover for good. Ably directed by Sam Mendes, Skyfall \u2013 the 23rd official 007 outing \u2013 is at its finest during a bruising, tumultuous opening half, fired by an electrifying pre-credits chase scene and a script that nods shrewdly to the Wikileaks furore. Cyber-terrorists have stolen a hard drive containing a complete list of Nato operatives that they proceed to leak online, in weekly instalments, five names at a time. Back in London, M (Judi Dench) is facing pressure to quit and her HQ on the Thames has gone up in smoke. In the meantime, the trail has led 007 (Daniel Craig) from the bazaars of Istanbul to the casinos of Shanghai to an abandoned island off the coast of Macao where the obligatory Bond baddie seems positively (almost suspiciously) delighted to be caught and brought to justice. Craig, as ever, makes for a splendidly authoritative Bond, even when he&apos;s suffering a crisis of faith and scowling at his reflection inside dirty mirrors. But he&apos;s matched beautifully by Bardem&apos;s playful, jubilant turn as the silken Raoul Silva, who sets out to turn 007 against M (&quot;Mummy&apos;s been very bad&quot;) and quite possibly take her place. Audaciously, Skyfall&apos;s most sexually charged moment comes not with the femme fatale at that gaudy casino but during the extended interrogation scene, as Silva runs his fingers across Bond&apos;s bare chest, then reaches down to part his legs. &quot;What&apos;s your regulation training for this?&quot; Silva teases him. &quot;What makes you think it&apos;s my first time?&quot; 007 shoots back \u2013 a tacit reminder that he went to Eton after all. These smart, sure-footed antics set us up nicely for a devastating finale. And yet I couldn&apos;t help feeling that Mendes&apos; hitherto sinuous, satisfying vehicle veers worryingly into the rough during a mishandled final section on a Scottish grouse moor that effectively doubles as Memory Lane. By this point, the makers of Skyfall have taken the bold decision to open Bond up \u2013 to probe at the character&apos;s back-story and raise a toast to his relationship with M. Yet this touchy-feely indulgence proves to be a mistake, in that it paves the path to soft-headedness, nostalgia and (worst of all) jokey banter with Bond&apos;s bearded old retainer. Don&apos;t they realise that 007 has always been at his most convincing when he&apos;s at his crudest and least adorned; when he&apos;s serving as a blank canvas for macho fantasy; the dark angel of our disreputable natures? At one stage, fighting to keep her job before a parliamentary select committee, M refers to Bond as a necessary evil: a creature in the shadows fighting creatures in the shadows.

His 6\u20134, 6\u20134 victory over the top dog, Roger Federer, took him to the verge of winning the Shanghai Masters for the third straight year, and if anything it was more dominant than the scoreline suggests. Such is the Scot&apos;s confidence, it seems like he is improving almost by the week. Having shrugged off a cold on his way to the semi-finals, the world No3 outgunned Federer with a hugely powerful performance, much as he did when beating the Swiss to win Olympic gold in August. The inner calm earned by winning his first grand slam title at last month&apos;s US Open is visible in all elements of his game and Federer, probably the greatest player of all time, was a distinct and distant second best. These are heady days for British tennis. Three weeks after Laura Robson became the first British woman to reach a WTA Tour final since 1990, Heather Watson matched her effort by reaching the final in Osaka. The 20-year-old was due to take on Chang Kai-cheng of Taiwan in the early hours of Sunday morning, trying to become the first British woman to win a singles title since Sara Gomer in 1988. In final in Shanghai, Murray faces Novak Djokovic, the man he beat in New York. The Serb is in pole position to end the year as No1 and only an injury to the Serb or something spectacular from Federer is likely to deny him his goal. On Saturday, everything that was spectacular came from Murray as he outplayed Federer with a brand of tennis he is now beginning to produce on a regular basis. In the first game, the 25-year-old hit three thunderous groundstrokes to break serve, setting the tone for a match in which Federer was on the back foot throughout. He has always maintained that the match is &quot;on his racket&quot; against Murray, that he is the one dictating. Things have changed. At the Olympics, Murray produced a serving masterclass to deny him; on Saturday, it was a series of brilliant returns and groundstrokes that left the maestro reeling. &quot;I went for it like I did the last few times I played against him,&quot; Murray said. &quot;He didn&apos;t serve that well so I was able to be very aggressive on his second serve. He maybe slowed down his first serve a little bit, so I was able to take a few more chances on the first serve. Obviously that helped.&quot; Murray leads their meetings 10-8 and there is clearly something about him that gets under Federer&apos;s skin. When Federer wanted to go off in the first game of the second set due to a few spots of rain on the court, Murray looked bemused. Both men knew Federer was struggling for answers. Murray had won the first set with the purest of hitting, helped by poor serving from Federer, who, having got the early break back, coughed up three straight double faults to drop serve for a second time in the fifth game. Murray saw out the set with relative ease. That first game of the second set saw Murray push for the kill, but Federer saved seven break points to hold. It might have been a turning point, but from 2\u20132 and with Federer 40\u20130 up on serve, Murray reeled off a string of brilliant returns to get the vital break. At 5\u20134, the players had to wait almost 20 minutes while the roof was closed because of heavier drops of rain, but a nerveless Murray closed out the match. Watson&apos;s run in Osaka is a timely reminder that there is not just one British woman on her way to becoming a top player. Robson has been tipped as a star ever since she won junior Wimbledon in 2008, while Watson has lived in her shadow despite being 18 months older and having broken into the world&apos;s top 100 first. Victory in Osaka would take Watson above Robson in the rankings once more, both of them around the No50 mark. Watson is a superb athlete and hugely consistent; Robson has immense power and great timing. Both are on the up.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-13T14:48:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/14/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-live", "sentences": ["Second set: Murray 7-5, 1-1 Djokovic* Murray, by the way, is trying to win the Shanghai Masters title for a third straight year.", "The Shanghai patrons are shouting &quot;&quot;Novak, Novak.&quot; They want a third set.", "Is it still 2011 is Shanghai?&quot; parps Gary Naylor."], "title": "Andy Murray v Novak Djokovic \u2013 as it happened | Katy Murrells", "article": " Um. So I wasn&apos;t supposed to be doing this. We only decided to do this 10 minutes ago after I walked into the office five minutes late. And Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic have already negotiated their way through most of the first set quicker than you can say &quot;Sunday shambles at the Guardian&quot;, with Murray having just broken and about to serve for the set at 6-5 up. The break was greeted with much racket-smashing by Djokovic, but that&apos;s about all I can tell you. So excuse the lack of formalities/preamble. And please go easy on me/us. It is Sunday morning after all ...  Before Murray serves for the first set, there&apos;s still just about enough time to say Britain&apos;s really rather good at tennis. News on Heather Watson&apos;s win at the Japan Open is here \u2013 the first WTA singles title for a British woman since 1988. Hopefully news of a second British win will follow ...  Murray wins the first set 7-5!Ace, 15-0. Djokovic nets a backhand, 30-0. 30-15. Unreturned serve, 40-15, to bring up the double set point. Djokovic saves the first by pinging an unstoppable backhand down the line, the pair duke it out from the back of the court on the second and the error eventually comes from Djokovic! A short forehand at net goes well wide. Murray takes the first set in an hour and 14 minutes. The Sky commentators are saying it was a first-class set of tennis. I&apos;ll have to take their word for it. And an email. &quot;Hooray!&quot; cheers Siobhan Cavanagh. &quot;I&apos;ve just been swearing loudly at the bloody Guardian for covering the semi-final and not the final. One thing you can say for us liberal pinkos \u2013 we pull it together in the end.&quot;  Second set: *Murray 7-5, 0-1 Djokovic (*denotes next server)A little bit of court sweeping there in the break, just to get rid of the remaining pieces of Djokovic&apos;s smashed racket. So what response from the Serb, in this the first meeting between the pair since Murray finally shook that Fred Perry-sized monkey off his back in the US Open final 33 days ago? The red mist seems to have gone for Djokovic, as he holds comfortably, to 15.  Second set: Murray 7-5, 1-1 Djokovic* Murray, by the way, is trying to win the Shanghai Masters title for a third straight year. There&apos;s a sniff of danger for him at 0-30, but some big serves get him out of trouble. 30-all. Another brings up game point, 40-30. And another out wide gives him the game. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack. &quot;They should have tournament when the players are as hungover as i am right now,&quot; says Ross Rawley. &quot;I would pay top dosh to see that.&quot; Not a bad idea Ross \u2013 though considering Murray is teetotal you may have to spike Murray&apos;s drink first. And perhaps you could slip Djokovic a big dose of gluten too, just to make it a level playing field?  Second set: *Murray 7-5, 1-2 DjokovicA wonderful game of cat and mouse on the first point, with some slicing and dicing and drop shots and lobs and top defence from both players. But eventually Murray, on the back foot and slightly off-balance, blinks on the backhand. 15-0. And Djokovic comes through to hold to 15.  Second set: Murray 7-5, 2-2 Djokovic* Murray&apos;s serving is mightily impressive here. A couple more Exocets and a few stray Djokovic returns secure a regulation hold. And want some Heather Watson quotes after her win earlier? Sure you do:  I was in the changing room afterwards, changing my clothes, and I thought to myself, &apos;Did I really win?&apos; So it&apos;s just starting to settle in. I&apos;ve worked so hard for this moment my whole career \u2013 that&apos;s why I practiced so hard, ran all those miles and lifted all those weights, for moments like this. Britain has been breaking quite a few records recently, so I&apos;m happy I could break another one today. I&apos;m proud to do this for my country. I was already thinking about how I was going to cry in the locker room! [when she faced four match points against her] But after I saved the first one, I just took it point by point. I&apos;m really proud of myself for getting through that.   Second set: *Murray 7-5, 2-3 Djokovic There&apos;s not much giving on the Djokovic serve right now either. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, 15-0. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, 30-0. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, 40-0. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, 40-15. Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce, game, as Djokovic steps into the court to finish things off with a vicious cross-court forehand strike.  Second set: Murray 7-5, 3-3 Djokovic* Some Murray murmurings at 30-15, after he nets: &quot;WHY? WHY? WHY?&quot; His monologue seems to do the job as he get to 40-15, but then double faults. Cue more mutterings. It does the trick again, as he sends an ace down the T, before swatting the spare ball in his pocket back to Djokovic&apos;s end with disdain. Back to you, Nole ...  Second set: *Murray 7-5, 4-3 Djokovic A chance for Murray at 15-30. The two send each other back and forth and left and right on the next point, and Djokovic flunks a backhand into the net! Incredible movement from Murray. 15-40, the first break points of the second set. Murray needs just the one, as Djokovic scampers forward but can only net a forehand volley under extreme pressure.  Second set: Murray 7-5, 5-3 Djokovic* Djokovic has Murray on a piece of string at 15-0, and after dragging him back and forth Murray eventually makes the error. 15-all. Murray throws in a couple of short balls on the next exchange, but Djokovic can&apos;t take advantage. 30-15. Unreturned serve, 40-15. And another missile out wide sees Djokovic loop long, leaving Djokovic needing to hold serve to stay in the match ...  Second set: *Murray 7-5, 5-4 Djokovic &quot;Watching these two guys play is to know the meaning of the phrase &quot;war of attrition&quot;!&quot; says Abhay Phadnis. &quot;I like the &quot;bounce, bounce...&quot; to describe Djokovic&apos;s service game - that ball does indeed seem to bounce interminably!&quot; Speaking of that Abhay ... cometh the crucial moments, cometh some even longer Djokovic ball bouncing. It does the trick though, the highlight at 30-15 a drop volley from the Serb at full stretch. Lovely stuff. Djokovic holds to 15, so Murray will serve for the title.  Second set: Murray 7-5, 5-5 Djokovic* Djokovic appeals to Hawk-Eye on the first point, but he needn&apos;t have bothered. 15-0. Murray lassos a lethal forehand, which draws the Djokovic error. 30-0. A beautiful lob from Murray and a back-tracking Djokovic pulls off a between-the-legs shot, and the Serb eventually prevails after using every trick in the book, finishing things off with a drop shot and a raised first and grin. He&apos;s still smiling. 30-15. And now he seems inspired. Some brutal hitting and it&apos;s 30-all. Another fantastic point and it&apos;s Murray who prevails, 40-30, match point.  But Murray goes short and Djokovic pounces. Deuce. Djokovic takes the paint off the baseline on the next point \u2013 brave, brave hitting \u2013 and it&apos;s advantage Djokovic, break point. Murray overcooks a loose forehand and there&apos;s the break. This one hasn&apos;t finished yet ...  Second set: *Murray 7-5, 5-6 Djokovic Now it&apos;s Murray&apos;s turn to throw this racket around, but unlike Djokovic, he stops short of smashing it. Djokovic, inspired after saving that championship point, holds to 15, while Murray, rattled, needs to regroup. And fast. The Shanghai patrons are shouting &quot;&quot;Novak, Novak.&quot; They want a third set.  Second set: Murray 7-5, 6-6 Djokovic15-0. 30-0. Djokovic, as if to give himself a bit more energy, skips back to the deuce court. He needs that extra energy on the next point, as Murray has him scampering all over the shop. Djokovic is again forced into a between-the-legs shot, but this time, it doesn&apos;t come off. 40-0. 40-15. Game. It&apos;s tie-break time.  Second set tie-break: *Murray 0-1 DjokovicA Djokovic ace ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 0-2 DjokovicThe first mini-break as Murray flunks a backhand into the net ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 1-2 Djokovic*But Murray sends down a strong serve to get on the board ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 1-3 Djokovic*After a cagey start by both players in the rally, Murray attempts to pull the trigger but misfires on the forehand ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 2-3 DjokovicBut Djokovic, who&apos;s struggling to get his first serves in at the moment, doubles! We&apos;re back on serve ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 3-3 DjokovicA stray forehand from Djokovic and they&apos;re all square as they change ends ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 3-4 Djokovic*The pair trade cross-court missiles before Murray mixes things up with a lob, and Djokovic calmy dispatches a drop volley. Advantage Djokovic once more ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 4-4 Djokovic*But Djokovic can&apos;t take advantage of the advantage, as he makes the error ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 5-4 DjokovicMurray pounces on the second serve with a brutal backhand down the line, and he&apos;s got two serves for the title ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 6-4 DjokovicA quite incredible point, Djokovic throws everything but the kitchen sink at Murray, but it all comes back. Murray has two championship points ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 6-5 Djokovic*Murray appeals to Hawk-Eye after his first serve it called out, nothing giving. The second serve goes in, another lengthy exchange ensues, and this time Djokovic unleashes a vicious inside-out forehand ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 6-6 Djokovic*Murray nets. And shouts. That&apos;s three championship points that have been and gone now ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 6-7 DjokovicHow superhuman is Djokovic in these big moments? It&apos;s now set point to the Serb ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 7-7 DjokovicNow it&apos;s Murray&apos;s turn to indulge in some lengthy ball-bouncing. He then rushes to the net and the pressure draws the Djokovic error. Phew.  Second set tie-break: Murray 8-7 Djokovic*Djokovic&apos;s return is called out. But it wasn&apos;t. They&apos;ll replay the point. This time Djokovic attempts a backhand pass down the line, but it never looked like dropping in. So Murray has a third championship point in this breaker, and a fourth overall ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 8-8 Djokovic*Again, absolutely nerveless from Djokovic as he pings a winner past a stranded Murray ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 8-9 DjokovicAnd an unforced error from Murray hands Djokovic set point ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 9-9 DjokovicBut you can guess what happens, right? We&apos;re all square again. This has echoes of the tie-break they duked out in New York. That ended 12-10 in Murray&apos;s favour. More of the same today, please ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 10-9 Djokovic*Once again, Murray is a point away ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 10-10 Djokovic*Djokovic nets the first serve. Murray looks to have the initiative after Djokovic sends down his second serve, but Djokovic turns defence into attack and we&apos;re all square. Again.  Second set tie-break: *Murray 10-11 DjokovicNow it&apos;s set point Djokovic. And I must confess I&apos;m regretting deciding to do a point-by-point commentary on this tie-break ...  Second set tie-break: *Murray 11-11 DjokovicNow it&apos;s Murray&apos;s time to produce with his back against the wall ...  Second set tie-break: Murray 11-12 Djokovic*To all the world it looks like Murray will bury the winner, but he misses! A fourth set point to Djokovic ...  Djokovic wins the second-set tie-break 13-11!And it&apos;s fourth time lucky, as Djokovic whips away a forehand drive volley winner. After Murray had five championship points. Cue much jumping up and down from Djokovic, Serbian shouting and fist pumps. Just like the US Open final they contested last month, this one is going the distance ...  Third set: Murray 7-5, 6-7, 1-0 Djokovic*Phew. I could do with a quick break, but no time for that. On to the final-set denouement. My colleague Rob Smyth has just emailed in, wondering whether there&apos;s ever been a sport where the elite standard is as high as it is in tennis right now. A very good question. The levels shown by the Top Four at the moment is nothing short of remarkable. It&apos;s not only the standard of their play, it&apos;s their superhuman athleticism and stamina as well. Murray holds comfortably, by the way, to get his name on the board first in the final set.  Third set: *Murray 7-5, 6-7, 1-1 DjokovicDjokovic could do with finding a few more first serves, he&apos;s putting himself under a little more pressure than he&apos;d like, but he squeezes through to 30. And a suggestion from Gwen James: &quot;As the Guardian messed you around when you got in, I vote for you doing all Andy Murray&apos;s finals live from now on - then you (and the bosses) can plan ahead.&quot; I like your logic Gwen. It would certainly make Sunday mornings slightly less stressful.  Third set: Murray 7-5, 6-7, 2-1 Djokovic*Now it&apos;s Murray&apos;s turn to flirt with a little danger. 40-30 quickly becomes deuce. But deuce turns into advantage Murray. And advantage turns into game. Murray skips back to his chair, decides it&apos;s time for a quick shirt change, and we&apos;re still on serve. The Proclaimers&apos; 500 Miles is blasted around the stadium, which seems kind of appropriate considering the effort these two are putting in.  Third set: *Murray 7-5, 6-7, 2-2 DjokovicAt 30-15, Murray&apos;s sliced backhand skids into the net. 40-15. Murray looks like he&apos;s got his eye in on Djokovic&apos;s serve, but he can&apos;t quite control the return, and that&apos;s the game. &quot;Wow. The standard of these guys continues to rise. What a couple of years we&apos;re in for,&quot; says @5livetennis on Twitter, to reinforce what Rob and I were saying a few games back.  Third set: Murray 7-5, 6-7, 3-2 Djokovic*A lengthy exchange at 30-15 has both players gasping for air \u2013 the length of their shots, pace and control quite remarkable after nearly three hours of play. Djokovic prevails, 30-all. The net cord then goes Djokovic&apos;s way, as Murray&apos;s forehand skips off the tape and flies wide. 30-40, break point. A great second serve averts the danger, deuce. Cross-court blow after cross-court blow follows, Murray eventually lands a killer punch, leaving Djokovic on his derriere on the court. Advantage Murray. And he rattles off the next point to take the game.             Third set: *Murray 7-5, 6-7, 3-3 DjokovicDjokovic holds to 15, as Murray prods a backhand return long. A tired-looking shot. Djokovic uses the end of the game as an opportunity to stretch his legs out too. And a racket-smashing interlude, courtesy of James Lanman: &quot;Just seen a replay of Djokovic&apos;s racket pulverisation in slow motion \u2013 beautiful as it was I don&apos;t think Baghdatis&apos;s slow, measured four-racket-in-a-row smash at the Australian Open is ever likely to be beaten for overall drama \u2013 the way he works the crowd is brilliant, as ever.&quot;  Third set: Murray 7-5, 6-7, 3-4 Djokovic*Even if Djokovic&apos;s legs are a little heavy, he&apos;s still coming up with some probing and punishing shots on the forehand side. 15-40, and it&apos;s two break points to Djokovic. A weary forehand into the net from Murray from mid-court and it&apos;s first blood to Djokovic in the decider. The Serb is ahead for the first time since the opening set. A careless service game that from Murray. &quot;Only seen one game \u2013 Murray surrendered serve sheepishly. Is it still 2011 is Shanghai?&quot; parps Gary Naylor.  Third set: *Murray 7-5, 6-7, 3-5 DjokovicThe 2012 Murray v2.0 is back, as he digs a volley out of his heels to go 15-30 ahead. Djokovic nods and claps appreciatively. A nice touch from Djokovic, and what touch Murray showed with that shot. But 15-30 soon becomes 30-all, which soon becomes 40-30, before Murray keeps himself in the game with a punishing return. Deuce. Advantage Djokovic. And an ace \u2013 only Djokovic&apos;s third of the day \u2013 secures the game. Murray will now serve to stay in the championship.  Djokovic wins 5-7, 7-6, 6-3!From 15-all, Murray is left stranded by Djokovic&apos;s return. 15-30. A ridiculous drop shot from Murray, which didn&apos;t look like it would clear the net, somehow drops into court, before skidding viciously into the tramlines. 30-all. But Murray goes for broke on the next exchange, and it&apos;s 30-40, Djokovic&apos;s first championship point \u2013 having saved those five against him. Djokovic nets the return, deuce. Advantage Djokovic, a second championship point. A lengthy, lengthy exchange ends with an inside-out forehand winner from Murray. Deuce. Advantage Murray. But no it&apos;s not, Djokovic appeals to Hawk-Eye and his return was in. They&apos;ll replay the point. And it&apos;s advantage Djokovic again. Murray goes high and wide and Djokovic comes back from the dead to win.  So another astonishing match between these two friends and rivals, as Djokovic gains a measure of revenge for his defeat in the US Open final. He&apos;s now won seven of the nine Masters titles, and he continues to hunt down Federer in the battle to finish the year as the world No1. After Heather Watson saved four match points to win earlier, it was a case of those five missed match points for Murray. Yin and yang and all that. But British tennis is in rude health right now, as is the men&apos;s game. And it&apos;s only three weeks until the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 swing around. It should be a fantastic climax to the season. Thanks for your emails, see you later.

Official sources indicated that they might be willing to &quot;acknowledge&quot; China&apos;s claim for the first time, a calculated move to allow the Chinese to save face and defuse tensions. It remains to be seen whether the scandal-weakened Chinese side would accept this, faced as they are with a delicate leadership transition in November and a population whose fury has helped put pressure on Japan but may prove difficult to rechannel. Chinese people&apos;s long-standing animus toward their erstwhile colonial overlord is, of course, very real. Yet Chinese rage against Japan, as performed, resembles a poorly sutured wound that the Chinese state can tear open and let bleed when expedient \u2013 though which the authorities sometimes hurry to stitch up again lest they risk losing control. Being in Beijing, Shanghai, and elsewhere in China this past September reminded me more than once of the Two Minutes Hate scene in Orwell&apos;s Nineteen Eighty-Four, and even of Hate Week itself. Winston, the novel&apos;s wretched protagonist, describes the Two Minutes Hate as a &quot;hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness&quot; where one &quot;could not help sharing in the general delirium&quot;. Groups of co-workers unleash a brief torrent of ritual patriotic abuse each morning in dystopian London, snarling and screaming at the despicable figures of the enemy that flash on a big telescreen. Comparisons between present-day China and the soulless, dreary totalitarian socialist state immortalised in Orwell&apos;s masterpiece are difficult to sustain after seeing clutch after clutch of Chinese teenagers, dressed in the latest quasi-Japanophile fashion, walk down a mobbed Beijing pedestrian shopping arcade nibbling at bouquets of candy floss and prattling on as if the phrase &quot;commodity fetishism&quot; had never crossed their young lips. Yet the blistering anti-Japanese media campaign I witnessed upon my arrival in China bore a close resemblance to the organised &quot;hate&quot; that Orwell so memorably described. Chinese TV, for example, featured cartoonish portrayals of rightwing Japanese wannabe powerbrokers attempting to inflame the territorial dispute. Of course, it seemed to matter little that many such reactionaries in Japan are widely seen as out-of-touch and occasionally as buffoons. (Though wary of Chinese intimidation, Japan&apos;s population is, nearly seventy years after WWII, about as truly pacifist as I&apos;ve encountered in the industrialised world.) Other menacing video depicted imposing American naval carrier groups, suggesting that just out of view on China&apos;s coast lurked sinister forces bent on further predatory operations against islets there. Tellingly, the Chinese navy chose this juncture to unveil its first aircraft carrier, refurbished after purchase from the Ukraine. Chinese warplanes are apparently not yet capable of landing on the carrier, but the move played well with Chinese audiences and sent an aggressive message to China&apos;s rivals. In rather comical solidarity, Chinese networks also started broadcasting weather reports for the Diaoyu Islands, as if any day now Chinese holidaymakers might lounge on a steep, rocky shoreline overlooking the area&apos;s shark-infested waters. The tacitly state-sanctioned venting of spleen against Japan certainly came easily to a lot of Chinese, many raised since childhood to look askance at things Japanese. Thousands participated in protests, during which Chinese pelted the Japanese embassy in Beijing, and consulates elsewhere, with eggs, bottles, rocks, and other missiles. Angry mobs in a range of cities vandalised Japanese businesses there and called for boycotts of Japanese products. Such bigotry, while no doubt sincere, could lead to absurd outcomes. For example, a group of taxi drivers accused one of my friends (a European woman with light brown hair, blue eyes and fair skin) of being Japanese and refused her fare. The occasional puzzling rumour that &quot;Japanese people&quot; were in town \u2013 meaning us \u2013 circulated around during our time there. Perhaps xenophobia takes what it can get. The Chinese authorities&apos; historical tendency to unleash, then rein in, such demonstrations of anti-Japanese sentiment is, fittingly, prefigured in Orwell&apos;s prose as well: after all, such hate &quot;could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp&quot; \u2013 and could even be directed toward China&apos;s politburo itself. Though this summer&apos;s xenophobic venting may have proven useful, the chances are that, in the runup to the party&apos;s 18th national congress on 8 November \u2013 inaugurating a tense, once-a-decade leadership transition \u2013 the state will choose stability over frenzy. Ironically, this coming period could have been a &quot;Nixon to China&quot; opportunity for Beijing. The deep scars of wartime memory notwithstanding, Chinese and Japanese economic partnership has proved highly compatible and profitable in recent years. Though extremely unlikely in practice, if the new Chinese leadership sought rapprochement, the two nations could, potentially, even deepen co-operation to reverse slowing growth in China&apos;s economy and revitalise Japan&apos;s anaemic one. I believe the will exists on the Japanese side, however weary they are of Chinese bullying. Perhaps the biggest obstacle remains the &quot;blowlamp&quot; of nationalist Chinese opinion itself. After years of stoking the furnace of Chinese public outrage \u2013 to diplomatic and political advantage \u2013 Chinese leaders might find it difficult to avoid the blowback.", "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-14T17:49:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/14/novak-djokovic-andy-murray-shanghai", "sentences": ["That can rarely have seemed more true than on Sunday when Andy Murray came within a whisker of winning the Shanghai Masters title for the third time only for Novak Djokovic to snatch it from his grasp."], "title": "Novak Djokovic roars back to deny Andy Murray in epic Shanghai final", "article": "The last point, so the cliche goes, is the hardest one to win. That can rarely have seemed more true than on Sunday when Andy Murray came within a whisker of winning the Shanghai Masters title for the third time only for Novak Djokovic to snatch it from his grasp. Five times he stood at match point against the man he defeated to win his first grand slam title at last month&apos;s US Open, and five times the Serb dashed his hopes with nerveless, courageous tennis. After three hours, 20 minutes of another scintillating contest, Murray was beaten 5-7, 7-6, 6-3. He looked livid. In the aftermath of his US Open victory, Murray had spoken about dealing with pressure and how he generally has no trouble finishing off matches. The irony was not lost on the Scot after he failed his task at 5-4 in the second set and after losing a tie-break of high quality and even higher drama, he was eventually worn down in the third set. &quot;I had been joking about when you talk so much about serving matches out, it&apos;s bound to happen at some stage [that you fail],&quot; Murray, the world No3, said. It was the second week in succession that he had lost from match point up \u2013 last week it was Milos Raonic in Tokyo who performed the great escape \u2013 but Djokovic hit four winners and on the fifth he forced a mistake from Murray. &quot;It&apos;s not like I threw the match away,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t make any real glaring errors or anything. When I had my chances, he just served very well and hit a couple of lines when he needed to.&quot; These two men do not deal in the mundane. Once Murray had immediately recovered an early break, they laid into each other, ripping returns and groundstrokes and turning each other&apos;s service games into a nightmare. The first set contained seven breaks but it was Murray who got the vital one for 6-5, prompting Djokovic to smash his racket in anger before the Scot served it out. Some of the shot-making was laughably good. As at the US Open, the two traded missiles from the baseline. As he had done against Roger Federer in the semi-finals, Murray&apos;s shots had that extra bite, with one forehand return clocked at an incredible 104mph. Murray broke for 4-3 in the second set with a brilliant passing shot and two games later he served for the match. It looked over when the Scot stood at 30-0 only for the match to turn on a moment of magic from the Serb. Chasing back a perfect lob from Murray, Djokovic chose to hit a between-the-legs shot \u2013 a &quot;tweener&quot; \u2013 which is usually the sign of desperation. It went in and after working his way into the rally, he hit a perfect drop shot to win the point. Djokovic responded with a raised fist and, revitalised, he broke back. Both men held to force a tiebreak and as in the first set of their US Open final, it was an epic. At 6-4, Murray looked home but for once the Scot dropped the ball short and was punished. Somehow, when his back is against the wall, Djokovic is able to produce his best, and four more times he saved match points with pure brilliance. Murray saved three set points himself but finally Djokovic clinched it 13-11 with a wrong-footing drive volley. This time Murray&apos;s racket took a beating and Djokovic looked the fresher. As the pain of being so close to victory spread to his body, the Scot tried to shorten the points but the Serb stayed strong and when Murray netted a forehand, he had the break for 4-3. Murray saved two match points with big serves but sent a backhand long to give Djokovic victory. The Serb is now almost certain to end the year ranked No1 and there is no denying that he will deserve it. Surely no one plays better when up against it and with so few ranking points to defend, he seems certain to overtake Federer. Murray must now decide whether it is wise to put himself through the rigours of scheduled events in Basle next week and then in Paris the following week before returning to London for the season-ending Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. &quot;It was a disappointing one to lose,&quot; Murray said. &quot;[But] I&apos;ve lost tougher matches than that before in the biggest events.

After Andy Murray&apos;s triumphs at the Olympics and the US Open, where he broke a 76-year men&apos;s grand slam drought, Watson snapped a 24-year winless streak by beating Chang Kai-chen of Taiwan 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 for the first of what promises to be many titles to come. &quot;I was in the changing room afterwards, changing my clothes, and I thought to myself, &apos;Did I really win?,&apos;&quot; said the 20-year-old, who won $37,000 (\u00a323,000) and is set to break into the world&apos;s top 50 for the first time on Monday. &quot;It&apos;s just starting to settle in. I&apos;m proud to do it for my country and to represent them. Recently, we&apos;ve been breaking quite a lot of records so I&apos;m happy I could break another one today and hopefully I can break some more.&quot; Three weeks ago, the 18-year-old Briton Laura Robson almost pipped her to the post when she reached the final in Guangzhou, China, only to fall in three sets. Watson looked to be heading the same way when Chang served for the match in the third set but she dug deep to save four match points and then clinched victory in a nail-biting final-set tiebreak after three hours, 11 minutes. &quot;I&apos;ve worked so, so hard for this moment, throughout my career,&quot; Watson said. &quot;That&apos;s why I ran all those miles and lifted all those weights, for moments like this.&quot; Born and raised in Guernsey, Watson has trained in the United States, at the Nick Bollettieri academy, since she was 12, part-funded by the Lawn Tennis Association. Bollettieri was the man responsible for discovering Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Monica Seles and Anna Kournikova and Watson is another success story for the American. Watson and Robson are seen as the future of women&apos;s tennis in Britain and the LTA must be hoping that the two players, good friends off the court, could lead to a surge in girls playing the sport, helped not only by their tennis but their outgoing personalities, too. &quot;I didn&apos;t think about that but I&apos;d like to inspire the younger generation to play tennis and to follow their dreams and work hard,&quot; Watson said. &quot;I think I can do that through my tennis by achieving things and showing them that anything&apos;s possible.&quot; Watson will leapfrog Robson in the rankings on Monday , at No50 to Robson&apos;s 52, and the pair are well placed to head towards the top 20 next year. Robson, who does not turn 19 until January, reached the fourth round of the US Open while Watson made the third round at Wimbledon this summer. The bookmakers are already taking bets on who will be higher in the rankings next year and Watson says their friendly rivalry \u2013 they appeared together in a Gangnam-style video with fellow players last week that has gone viral on YouTube \u2013 is spurring each of them on to bigger and better things. &quot;Knowing Laura did so well in China a few weeks ago definitely motivated me this week,&quot; Watson said. &quot;But it&apos;s great we&apos;re really good friends off the court as well.&quot; While Watson came out on top after an epic battle, Murray was unable to make it a double celebration when he was edged out 5-7, 7-6, 6-3 by Novak Djokovic in the final of the Shanghai Masters on Sunday. The world No3 Murray had five match points in the second-set tiebreak but Djokovic survived and clinched victory after three hours, 21 minutes, a small measure of revenge for his defeat by the Scot in the US Open final last month. &quot;It&apos;s a disappointing one to lose,&quot; Murray said. &quot;But I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll recover from it pretty\u00a0well.&quot;", "tags": ["Heather Watson", "Tennis", "Sport", "Andy Murray"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-14T18:55:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/16/weekly-sport-diary-heather-watson", "sentences": ["That afternoon Andy Murray lost in three high-class sets to Novak Djokovic in the final of the Shanghai Masters, passing up five match points on the way, but still creating history as two British players appeared in finals on the same day for the first time ... ever."], "title": "Heather Watson is first British woman to win WTA singles title since 1988", "article": "An apology: this column may have given the impression it considered British tennis to be a flatlining, cash-splurging irrelevance.

The name refers not to a bricks-and-mortar establishment but to a collective of chefs who are, aptly enough, young, ambitious and healthily iconoclastic. They make fleeting appearances at unconventional venues, keeping fans in the loop on Twitter. If you caught them last summer at a disused office building in Canary Wharf, or on the roof of a car park in Peckham where they reimagined dishes for a Turkish ocakbasi grill, count yourself lucky: these events have acquired semi-legendary status in the London food world. Last October, we had a chance to get to know James Lowe and Isaac McHale a little better when they settled down for a six-month residency above the Ten Bells pub in Spitalfields. Here, they had a chance to cook food that was inventive and daring without being flashy in a room that had none of the hush and formality you associate with fine dining (you had to cross the crowded floor of the pub and climb a narrow, creaky staircase to get to it). Since then, they&apos;ve been touring their talents around the world, to Mexico City, Shanghai and New York, where last month they did a successful turn at the prestigious Le Fooding event. For all their unconventional working habits and punkish attitude, however, the Young Turks are not quite as radical as they sound. They became chefs the usual way, paying dues in high-pressure kitchens, albeit rapidly. Thirty-three-year-old Lowe cooked at La Trompette and the Fat Duck before becoming, at 26, head chef at St John Bread &amp; Wine. McHale, 32, worked at the Ledbury in west London for five years and did a stint at Noma in Copenhagen. A third member, Ben Greeno, also worked at Noma, but dropped out of the Turks to work for David Chang at Momofuku Seiobo in Sydney. The Young Turks formed when Lowe, McHale and Greeno were invited separately to guest-chef at the influential Loft Project supper club in east London. &quot;We shared views on the London food scene and food in general,&quot; Lowe tells me. &quot;Each of us was keeping a close eye on what was happening abroad \u2013 in the States and Japan and around Europe \u2013 whereas many British chefs were still very inward-looking.&quot; &quot;We had various ideals,&quot; says McHale. &quot;Eating more vegetables, paring things back a bit, sharing ideas instead of being secretive.&quot; Reclaiming neglected British ingredients and updating antique recipes were other areas of common ground. One of Lowe&apos;s most successful dishes, when the Young Turks returned to the Loft in spring 2011, was a very traditional British pairing of beef and oysters, but served raw with chickweed. Although founded on honest food philosophies and serious talent, the Young Turks had astute marketing: the swaggering identity and the shrewd use of social media guaranteed column inches as well as bookings. Both are now working on solo projects. McHale is preparing to open a permanent restaurant at Shoreditch Town Hall in January \u2013 he&apos;s calling it the Clove Club. Again, social media has proved invaluable to his progress: using the crowdfunding website Crowdcube, McHale raised \u00a3250,000 from 50 donors to help get the project started. Meanwhile, he has kept the Ten Bells restaurant going. It&apos;s no longer officially a Young Turks operation \u2013 young ex-Ledbury chef Giorgio Ravelli is in charge of the kitchen \u2013 but some of McHale&apos;s dishes, including his justly famous buttermilk chicken and pine salt, are still on the menu. James Lowe took the summer off to do a chef&apos;s Grand Tour \u2013 &quot;China for a month, Taiwan, Italy for a few weeks, Copenhagen, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia&quot; \u2013 and and now he too is looking to start up a restaurant of his own in east London. Does this signal the end of the Young Turks? No, McHale says, though he admits the relationship may change. &quot;It was never a till-death-do-us-part arrangement, it was a springboard to us finding our own sites. It went better than we expected \u2013 but we have to be true to our own identities and do our own things.&quot; Young Turks projects will continue to happen \u2013 they will be cooking in Turin at the end of October \u2013 albeit less frequently, and McHale and Lowe remain enthusiastic about their alliance. According to McHale, last month&apos;s Le Fooding extravaganza in New York was &quot;the most fun foreign event we&apos;ve done. We were nervous when we started doing them but now it&apos;s less nerves, more enjoyment \u2013 and it helped that everyone seemed to have heard of us.

Even by the unsubtle standards of studio tentpoles, the marketing push for Skyfall has been a long-haul assault, stretching far beyond the standard (if especially ubiquitous) bus-side billboards, and trailers that have been on rotation since the spring. Though not a man averse to material pleasures, Bond himself might balk at the amount of promotional tie-ins being attached to his name this time around. The new film raises the bar for onscreen product placement, from 007&apos;s Tom Ford-tailored suits to Q&apos;s Sony Vaio hardware, as well as offscreen alliances ranging from Coke Zero to perfume retailers. (Yes, if you&apos;ve always wanted to smell like Bond \u2013 presumably not after an intense chase sequence \u2013 the option is yours.) His new tipple of choice, Heineken, has proved an ongoing sticking point with fans, particularly after a big-budget ad that actually roped Daniel Craig into the action. However, with the Dutch beer having stumped up over \u00a328m for the privilege of seeing Bond sip from a green bottle in an early scene \u2013 coolly covering almost a third of the film&apos;s estimated \u00a393.7m ($150m) production budget in the process \u2013 the producers are willing to endure that indignity. Craig himself has been a diplomatic spokesman on the issue, acknowledging that their reliance on brand associations is &quot;unfortunate,&quot; before countering: &quot;This movie costs a lot of money to make [and] nearly as much again to promote, so we go where we can.&quot; That quote is about as close as we&apos;re going to get to learning the film&apos;s actual marketing budget, given Sony Pictures International&apos;s customary reluctance to divulge such details. It would be a grey area in any case, since it&apos;s more difficult than usual to tell where this film&apos;s marketing begins and ends \u2013 particularly in this year of the Bond films&apos; golden anniversary, when any number of external forces are collaborating to sanctify the franchise as a great British institution. 007 practically received a knighthood in his amiably goofy skit with the Queen in July&apos;s Olympic opening ceremony \u2013 a stunt that may not have had Skyfall&apos;s enigmatic name anywhere on it, but pointedly raised awareness of the agent&apos;s return to a global audience of a billion. Indeed, while few of Bond&apos;s brands of choice \u2013 the venerable Aston Martin notwithstanding \u2013 are British, much of the marketing has worked towards underlining his UK heritage. Most prominent in this regard is a joint campaign with VisitBritain, which will be using the film to hawk British tourism to international audiences through viral and print advertising, as well as its first ever cinema ad, all united under the slogan &quot;Bond is Great \u2026 Britain.&quot; That&apos;s hardly an incidental affiliation for a film that, unusually for latter-day 007 entries, was largely shot on home soil in the wake of budget cuts at MGM, which filed for bankruptcy in 2010: climactic scenes may take place in London and the Highlands, but keen-eyed Londoners will also notice the capital doubling for Shanghai elsewhere. It may not look it, but the high-gloss, name-heavy Skyfall came in significantly cheaper than 2008&apos;s \u00a3125m Quantum of Solace. The budget may be lower this time around, but the stakes are arguably higher. With a UK gross of almost \u00a351m and a global total of around \u00a3369m, Quantum of Solace fell short of the numbers attained by the series&apos; first Craig-led outing, Casino Royale, in 2006. It was far from a flop, but it disappointingly failed to build on its predecessor&apos;s gutsy brand reinvention \u2013 except, that is, in China, where it significantly outpaced the previous film. Industry journalist Ian Sandwell, who recently studied the film&apos;s release strategy for trade magazine Screen International, describes the film&apos;s Shanghai-set sequences as the film&apos;s &quot;ace in the pack&quot;: given the vast Chinese market&apos;s sympathy toward blockbusters with local involvement, the decision to locate a major stretch of Skyfall&apos;s action there is no accident. With Skyfall looking to right the ship and exceed Casino Royale&apos;s global gross, the marketing materials haven&apos;t taken many chances, with posters chiefly highlighting the 007 brand and not bothering to name its starrier-than-usual cast or its unusually A-list director Sam Mendes, the first Oscar-winner to helm a Bond film. Sandwell believes this focus on fundamentals is the right approach: &quot;This could be a reaction to the perception of the Craig era to date, where perhaps the grittiness might have attracted the Bourne fans, yet alienated the Bond diehards. Skyfall&apos;s marketing has primarily been aimed at reassuring the traditional audience that they haven&apos;t been forgotten.&quot; So far, Skyfall is tracking well enough to suggest that the approach has paid off, buoyed by one factor the marketing men couldn&apos;t control: the overwhelmingly positive reviews that greeted its first screening nearly two weeks ago, which had some excitable journalists even predicting Oscar glory. The Guardian&apos;s box office expert, Charles Gant, tweeted a prediction that the film will top Casino Royale to become the highest-grossing Bond film at the UK box office. That appears to be the expectation in the US too: the number-crunchers at BoxOffice.com are forecasting a Stateside gross of $216m.

Not the American dream mind you, Liu is living her own creation \u2013 the Chinese dream. We meet at her luxurious high rise apartment in a swanky mid-town neighbourhood of Shanghai. Down on the street below gleaming shop windows display eye-wateringly expensive luxury goods to China&apos;s rapidly expanding middle class. Fragments of the old China still exist \u2013 visitors stumble upon the occasional historic site \u2013 but for the most part China is systematically bull-dozing the old and building the new. And that&apos;s why Liu is here. Born in America to Chinese parents, Liu grew up in the States. She graduated from MIT with a bachelor&apos;s degree in electrical engineering and computer science. After a few years in Silicon Valley followed by a short stint at McKinsey &amp; Co as a management consultant, she relocated to China, because she believes it&apos;s where she can make the most difference. Liu sees herself as a bridge between China and US. Speaking both languages and understanding both cultures puts her in an ideal position, she says, to facilitate collaboration \u2013 hence Juccce, the Joint US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy \u2013 but &quot;the place to practice sustainable living is China,&quot; she insists. &quot;China is half way through a 40-year urbanisation project, 350 million people will move from the countryside to the city \u2026 we&apos;re becoming richer and China&apos;s consumption is rising.&quot; Liu is determined that China will not follow the American path of mass consumption. She recognises that if every Chinese person begins to consume like an American its game over for the planet, but if newly wealthy Chinese families want to buy bigger houses in the suburbs, a car and a refrigerator, how will she stop them? Experts predict that China&apos;s 300 million-strong consuming class is going to rise to 800 million by 2025 \u2013 that&apos;s two and half times the total population of the US. Liu&apos;s idea \u2013 which she says is win-win for businesses and the planet \u2013 is to sell them a different dream. Liu is working with the advertising moguls Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and branding experts Ogilvy to create the China Dream concept. Rather then telling people \u2013 &apos;don&apos;t consume,&apos; they will be told &apos;consume this instead&apos;: &quot;You make something else sexy rather than telling them what they can&apos;t have.&quot; Instead of the big house in the suburbs with his and hers SUVs, the Chinese dream will promote high rise urban dwellings with well-integrated public transport. Of course having made urban living sexy it also has to be made possible, so another part of Juccce&apos;s work is teaching government officials about environmentally friendly city design. Chinese state officials are trained in specialist academies and Juccce is one of a very few outside organisations that is allowed to teach courses in these academies. To date Juccce has trained 322 mayors and government officials about green finance, lower energy buildings, and integrated public transport, Liu says, but &quot;that&apos;s still slow if you have 20,000 large cities to go through,&quot; so they are now in the midst of developing an e-learning course for public officials so they can spread the word a bit quicker. Key to this is finding best practice from around the world and translating it into Chinese. Juccce&apos;s contacts book is nothing short of stellar and Liu is an inveterate name dropper. Richard Branson is an honorary member of Juccce&apos;s committee, as is James E Rogers, the chief executive of America&apos;s largest electricity company Duke Energy, and there are photos of Liu with Bill Clinton which can be accessed via their website. Juccce is &quot;the perfect channel for foreign companies and experts who want to access [China&apos;s decision-makers]. We want to work with them too \u2013 it&apos;s just win-win. Juccce is good at creating those win-win situations. It&apos;s good for China, it&apos;s good for foreign companies, it&apos;s good for the citizens,&quot; Liu says. When Liu co-founded Juccce in 2007 she identified four major drivers affecting energy use in China: the grid, industry, urbanisation and consumption. Taken in that order the number of people you need to influence to make change happen increases, she told me. In general, because of its top-down governance, influencing the implementers is much easier in China. Juccce&apos;s first major project was to promote the uptake of the smart grid. Lui was savvy enough to recognise that to make that enormous change she only needed to convince a tiny number of people. Because there are fewer decision-makers, it&apos;s easier to identify them and coral them whereas in the US to do the same thing you would have to identify the chief executives of 3,000 energy companies, as well as the legislature. &quot;In China there are about four people you need to speak to about utilities,&quot; she said. The same is more or less true of Chinese industry: &quot;In industry there&apos;s a very small handful of top state owned enterprises and they all report up to the same ministry entities so they are very easy to identify.&quot; Liu set Juccce up as a 10-year project in 2007. Five years in she has already made significant inroads into influencing the four tipping points \u2013 grid, industry, urbanisation, consumption \u2013 that she identified as her targets. As she says herself, the first part of the road was relatively easy since she started with the easiest wins. Will she fend of the encroachment of the American dream into China and succeed in supplanting it with Juccce&apos;s own Chinese dream? Only time will tell. But Liu has successfully rallied a lot of the key decision-makers behind her, and that&apos;s good start. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

With Blighty subject to a kinghell ballyhoo concerning a mooted breakaway union for black footballers, Barton is alarmed at the lack of players publicly declaring their allegiance and called on the &quot;more vocal&quot; ones to speak up. OK, he&apos;s got himself in a muddle straight away there, but let&apos;s hear him out. &quot;Hopefully, some of the more vocal and less notorious amongst us, raise their heads from below the PR department desk. #manupffs,&quot; tweeted Barton before stating his own opinion that a split would be misguided and the current Professional Footballers Association is &quot;a great &apos;UNION&apos; its done great things for players of all races and creeds over the decades&quot;. But here&apos;s the rub, he also thinks the PFA big cheese Gordon Taylor is &quot;like a fat, festering old king too drunk on power to notice that his meal is a rotting corpse of maggots&quot;. Despite firing off several more tweets, Barton did not elaborate on his disdain for Taylor, or maybe he did but the Fiver couldn&apos;t bring itself to sift through all of Barton&apos;s outpourings. Instead we will just wonder aloud whether it is anything to do with Taylor&apos;s comments on Barton following the latter&apos;s meltdown at Manchester City on the last day of last season. &quot;I just feel he&apos;s his own worst enemy,&quot; quoth Taylor at the time. &quot;It&apos;s recurring and he&apos;s getting to the later stages of his career and it does get very exasperating and frustrating.&quot; Taylor has not yet responded to Barton&apos;s latest outburst but did today deliver a six-point plan aimed at tackling racism in football, with proposed measures including stiffer penalties for abusers and the implementation of a NFL-style Rooney Rule to ensure greater opportunities for black coaches and managers. If Taylor has felt moved to lash together this manifesto in just a couple of days in reaction to the prospect of a breakaway, perhaps the would-be splitters are right to think forming a lobby group would give them a lot of power.

I had always assumed that each item in that section was either a Bit or a Bob, but now it appears that each item is both a Bit and a Bob. Indeed, I had whiled away many an evening speculating as to which of the stories was a Bit and which was a Bob. In many cases, it seemed to me that certain stories were most definitely Bits, with others certainly Bobs. Now I have learned that each story contains elements of Bittage and Bobbery (or is that Bittery and Bobbage? One for the pedants, I&apos;ll wager). Now it looks like all my time has been wasted.

But it is only in this storming new Bond movie that her M has really been all that she could be. Under the stylish direction of Sam Mendes, Dench's M is quite simply the Bond girl to end all Bond girls. Watching this, I thought: of course. How could I have missed it? The real tension isn't with Moneypenny, but with the boss herself. Now M is an imperious, subtly oedipal intelligence-matriarch with the double-O boys under her thumb. She's treating them mean. She's keeping them keen. And she is rewarded with passionate loyalty, varying with smouldering resentment. It's a combination with its own unspoken eroticism, and it has also created the conditions for one of the most memorable Bond villains in recent times. M&nbsp;demands more and more from her agents, with less and less concern for their safety. At one stage, 007 actually appears in M's apartment, late at night, after a difficult stretch in the field. Following a curt exchange, weary and somewhat hurt, Bond says he will find a hotel. \"Well, you're not staying here,\" is M's superbly timed and exquisitely hurtful reply. \nThe 50th anniversary of the big-screen Bond was the right time to pull off something big. Skyfall is a hugely enjoyable action spectacular, but more grounded and cogent than the previous and disappointing outing, Quantum of Solace. It finds the right position on the spectrum between extravagance and realism: what I think of as the imaginary line running from Bond's invisible car in Die Another Day and Peter Guillam's Citro\u00ebn DS in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. \nWe kickstart the movie with an uproarious chase scene in Istanbul featuring 007 and Bond's glamorous colleague Eve, played by Naomie Harris. As well as revving up the film, this pre-credit sequence, with its cataclysmic finale, showcases a great new Bond theme song from Adele, Basseying those vocals mightily, and conveying the camp combination of Bond's machismo and strange and preposterous vulnerability. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nDaniel Craig's Bond (above) looks older, more careworn, slightly more jug-eared. This is a Bond who has something to prove, and who could be damaged goods, physically and even mentally. Even at his lowest, however, he is still capable of pulling off a very scary drinking trick involving a scorpion. But now he must face one of his tastiest adversaries ever \u2013 the chilling Silva, played by Javier Bardem. Silva makes his first entrance from far away, a virtual dot on the horizon, giving a sinuous speech about what happens when rats fight each other. Gradually, his unsettling face comes into focus \u2013 quite a visual coup from Mendes and his cinematographer, Roger Deakins. Silva is intensely blond, in both his hair and eyebrows, a Nordic-baddie effect that is weirdly complemented or counteracted by his Spanish accent. He has a very funny, sinister habit of wincing and tsk-ing with an aesthete's disdain, when 007 insists on foiling his plans. Various pundits have compared Bardem's appearance in Skyfall to Julian Assange and Jimmy Savile. For me, he looks like a malign James Hunt, or a psychopathic, shorter-haired version of bluesman Johnny Winter. But the point is that Bond has the same hair colour. This is a blond-on-blond faceoff, and both Craig's 007 and Bardem's villain look like the 21st-century descendants of Robert Shaw's peroxide Spectre baddie Grant in From Russia with Love. Silva is cut from the same cloth as 007 in many ways, and they have an emotional backstory with M. Yet despite the apparently new hi-tech dimension promised by Silva's evil skills in cyber-terrorism and computer hacking, this is not a futuristic Bond. More like back to basics, and I'm not sure Mendes is particularly inspired by Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight movies. The scene in which 007 steps suavely into the shower with delectable S\u00e9v\u00e9rine (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe) could have happened at any time in the last half-century. \nAs with all Bond movies, you will need a sense of humour to go with the flow, and the flow does not involve a plot in the boringly normal sense of the word: more the impressionistic effect of scenes and moments and performances \u2013 and an entertaining one comes from Ben Whishaw as the gadgetmeister, Q. In recent years, Bond fans have had to tolerate some appalling product placements: fortunately, Bond's one appearance with a certain type of lager here is with his hand firmly over the logo. The biggest commercial branding is, I suspect, for a country, China: there are massive setpieces in Shanghai and Macau, and as with the recent sci-fi thriller Looper, a shrewd financial consideration may have been involved. \nBut what a rush! From the opening in Istanbul to the final siege shootout in the Scottish Highlands, this film is a supremely enjoyable and even sentimental spectacle, giving us an attractively human (though never humane) Bond. Despite the title, he is a hero who just keeps on defying gravity.", "tags": ["James Bond", "Action and adventure", "Thriller", "Daniel Craig", "Judi Dench", "Javier Bardem", "Ben Whishaw", "Naomie Harris", "Film", "Culture", "Skyfall"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-25T13:34:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/wen-jiabao-wealth-new-york-times", "sentences": ["A former government colleague of Wen&apos;s, who spoke anonymously, told the Times: &quot;In the senior leadership, there&apos;s no family that doesn&apos;t have these problems...His enemies are intentionally trying to smear him by letting this leak out.&quot; A US diplomatic cable obtained by Wikileaks, dating from 2007, quoted an executive in Shanghai as saying: &quot;Wen is disgusted with his family&apos;s activities, but is either unable or unwilling to curtail them.&quot;  In March, the prime minister made a point of telling reporters at his annual press conference that he had &quot;never pursued personal gain&quot;, adding that while he had faced criticism, &quot;history will have the final say&quot;."], "title": "New York Times blocked in China over Wen Jiabao wealth revelations", "article": "Chinese authorities have blocked the Chinese website of the New York Times and most access to the main website after it revealed that the extended family of premier Wen Jiabao has controlled assets worth at least $2.7bn (\u00a31.67bn).

According to professor Kellie McElhaney, founder of the Centre for Responsible Business at University of California, Berkeley&apos;s Haas School of Business, companies that empower women are more likely to be companies that act sustainably. A research paper written by McElhaney and Sanaz Mobasseri found that businesses with more women on their board of directors are more likely to: manage and improve their energy efficiency; measure and reduce their carbon emissions; reduce their packaging impacts; invest in renewable power; improve access to healthcare in developing countries; have strong partnerships with local communities; offer products with nutritional or health benefits; proactively manage human capital development; offer transparent financial products; have anti-corruption policies and programmes; have a high level of disclosure and transparency; and avoid controversies such as accounting fraud, price fixing, criminal behaviour among top executives, controversial customer practices and insider trading.  But why is this? It&apos;s a topic for hot debate and there are probably as many opinions as there are commentators. Do men have inherently unsustainable ways of acting in the world? Does testosterone fuel the exploitation of our planet and its people? Are women our best hope for creating a sustainable future? Elle Carberry, co-founder and managing director\u00a0of the China Greentech Initiative believes that women may be drawn to sustainability because of its social angle. &quot;From all my 20 years in business, I have met more women in this area than in others [areas of business],&quot; she says. &quot;Be it in China or the United States.&quot; She adds: &quot;It does strike me that women come to this with a view about society and business. In China, women also appear to be playing an increasingly important role in sustainability and for one Chinese woman in particular, this &quot;view about society and business&quot; turned her into the wealthiest self-made woman in the world. Zhang Yin, also known by her Cantonese name Cheung Yan, is the founder and director of Nine Dragons Paper, a recycling company that buys scrap paper from the US, imports it into China, and turns it mainly into cardboard for use in boxes to export Chinese goods. In 2006, she topped the list of the richest people in China and by 2010 her $4.6bn (\u00a32.9bn) fortune placed her ahead of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and JK Rowling. She has said that she built her entire business empire on some simple advice that she received in Hong Kong in 1985: &quot;Waste paper is like a forest \u2013 paper recycles itself, generation after generation.&quot; Peggy Liu, co-founder of the Joint US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy (Juccce), is working to create a China Dream concept to divert China away from a mass consumerist path and is targeting high-level officials to spread her message and give foreign companies and experts access to China&apos;s decision makers. Carberry believes that &quot;the markets associated with China going green might be some of the biggest markets ever.&quot; She approached the head of General Electric (GE) in China in 2008 and asked if he would support a knowledge sharing platform and network to help accelerate the scaling of clean technology. &quot;He jumped at the idea immediately,&quot; she recalls. &quot;And when I asked him why he was so keen, he said, &apos;in China the opportunity is too big, the problem is too urgent and China is too complex. We can&apos;t do it alone. \u00a0We all \u2013 GE, Dow, Bayer and others \u2013 see a piece of it, but none of us see how the whole thing comes together&apos;&quot;. \u00a0And so the China Greentech Initiative was born. Today, the platform pulls together information on cleantech, checks and analyses that data and brings together a network of interested companies, policy makers and organisations to identify opportunities.\u00a0It certainly seems to be working. According to the 2012 Ernst &amp; Young ranking of country attractiveness for renewable energy investments, China leads the world, ahead of the US and Germany. Yin and Carberry are just two of many such pioneering women taking on sustainable business in China. Others, to name but a few, include Jin JiaMan, director of the Global Environmental Institute, Chen Zhili, chair of the China Women&apos;s Federation, Li Chun Mei, founder and general manager of Wealth Environment Engineering Co, and Anne Myong, chief operating officer of Walmart, who realised the lack of leadership on CSR and is now devising a clearer strategy. However, Kaying Lau, country director for the Global Reporting Initiative in China, says despite these role models, millions of women are still under-represented. But with more high-profile role models, the hope is that more will be empowered to join the sustainability revolution. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

For Allan McNish, becoming a recognised world champion has long been a goal in a career that already boasts a huge number of impressive wins and although facing a tough task here in Shanghai, he will be pushing to the last to keep this dream alive. McNish, who drove in F1 for Toyota in 2002, has already won the Le Mans 24 Hours twice, in 1998 for Porsche and 2008 for Audi, and his post-F1 career has been fully committed to racing for the latter team. The partnership has yielded the endurance classic win and three American Le Mans Series titles as well \u2013 tough, closely fought championships, deserving recognition. Yet, although Audi have put their weight behind the sport since 1999 and have won Le Mans 11 times since 2000, after the demise of the World Sportscar Championship in 1992 there has simply been no world title to win in endurance racing. That changed when the FIA, in co-operation with Le Mans organisers the Automobile Club de l&apos;Ouest, created the WEC last year. It was a championship the FIA&apos;s president, Jean Todt, was keen should be part of his organisation&apos;s portfolio. It incorporates competitive action on the track and promotes the development of new road car technology in racing prototypes, pushing manufacturers to combine high speed with maximising fuel efficiency and reliability. Both Audi and Toyota have entered hybrid cars this year at the very front end of the grid. Despite a difficult start, Todt can judge that it has been a success: aside from the usual huge numbers at Le Mans, crowds of more than 30,000 attended the races at Silverstone, Spa and Fuji. Peugeot, who had been involved with endurance racing for five years and won Le Mans in 2009, had been expected to compete in the new championship but pulled out just before it began due to economic difficulties. Toyota responded, stepped up their development and joined mid-season, taking an impressive win in only their third race, in Brazil, while Audi remained committed to entering two cars to fight for the world title. The championship has come down to this final race in Shanghai but it is McNish&apos;s rivals in the sister Audi that have the advantage. After victory with Dindo Capello and full-time season partner Tom Kristensen at the opening race, the 12 Hours of Sebring, McNish has yet to win again this year. It leaves the trio of Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler, who won both this year&apos;s and last year&apos;s Le Mans 24, 16.5 points ahead in the title race, a gap that means McNish knows he must win in China and hope there is some daylight and other competitors between himself and his rivals. &quot;I come here with one thought in mind and that is to win the race,&quot; he says. &quot;If you win the race, you&apos;ve got a chance, if you don&apos;t win the race you&apos;ve got less chance. That&apos;s all we focus on. We don&apos;t focus on the other car. We focus on winning the race and see what comes out of it.&quot; It is a determined response that is typical for a racing driver for whom it is all about the racing. No one wants McNish behind them on the grid because they know he will be fighting from the off to make a pass. But the season has still not quite come his way yet. &quot;Every time we&apos;ve been in close with a shout, something has happened that pulled it back from us. It&apos;s been a bit frustrating more than anything else,&quot; he says. Bahrain was a good example: leading from pole, a brake balance issue meant second was the best he could manage. Yet this is a seasoned driver, mature enough to know that this is part and parcel of going racing. &quot;We&apos;ve just got to try and get everything right as much as we can do for this race,&quot; he says. &quot;The competition is tight, not only with the sister car but also with Toyota.&quot; The competition can lead to over-analysis, he admits. &quot;You go home and think: &apos;What do we have to do? How can we turn it around?&apos;&quot; Like all the great drivers, however, these are variables and a debate he knows brings nothing to the track and are quickly dismissed. &quot;I don&apos;t believe in luck,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ve just got to keep your head down and keep doing the things you were doing before.&quot; McNish will be hoping that on Sunday, it will be enough and that the season will be book-ended with wins and, just possibly, that world championship. Yet, even if it is not, there is no more determined a racing driver and no doubt he will be back next year, his title dream entirely undiminished.", "tags": ["World Endurance Championship", "Le Mans Series", "Sport", "Motor sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-26T14:50:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/new-york-times-problems-wen-china", "sentences": ["But last August, News Corporation announced it was selling its controlling stakes in three of its Chinese television channels to a domestic private equity fund based in Beijing and Shanghai."], "title": "NYT's little problem in big China", "article": "China is the world&apos;s biggest market but for western media firms trying to expand it can be a bruising experience, with even the biggest names such as Rupert Murdoch and Google having come a cropper. So it was perhaps inevitable when the New York Times (NYT) decided to launch a Chinese language website in June that it would at some point fall foul of the censors. But it did so in spectacular fashion on Friday when the government blocked access to the site, accusing it of trying to &quot;smear&quot; the country&apos;s name. Its crime was to publish an article claiming that the family of the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, had accumulated massive wealth \u2013 a handsome $2.7bn (\u00a31.67bn) \u2013 during his time in power. China swiftly blocked access to the paper&apos;s websites and censored searches for the NYT as well as the names of Wen&apos;s children and wife on China&apos;s main Twitter-like microblogging service, Weibo. A foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said the paper &quot;smears China&apos;s name and has ulterior motives&quot;. The media group responded by saying it would &quot;ask the Chinese authorities to ensure that our readers in China can continue to enjoy New York Times journalism&quot;. The NYT hired 30 staff for its Chinese website, most of whom are working as translators and editors, and publishes about 30 articles a day on national, foreign and arts topics, in addition to editorials. Two thirds of the content is translated from the paper and a third is written by Chinese editors and local freelance journalists. The US paper was unlikely to follow Google&apos;s initial approach when it launched in 2006 and censor its content but diplomacy would be needed to re-establish its service, said William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the Oxford Internet Institute. &quot;It will be impossible for China to stop people seeing this story even by censoring the site because there will be so much re-posting of the story from elsewhere. So I don&apos;t think censorship can be totally effective. This particular article will be more circulated and better known because of the censorship of the New York Times,&quot; said Dutton. He said the Chinese had become more effective at filtering stories but adopted a two-faced approach to criticism. &quot;It is OK for someone to protest in China, but not in Tiananmen Square; it is OK to criticise China, but not OK to criticise the prime minister. This is a symbolic reaction, more of a political stance. &quot;Strategically, how do the New York Times deal with it? Every publication has to figure out how they accommodate the law of the country they are in and if nobody loses their temper and takes time to figure out how and why this happened, then maybe they can figure out a way to climb down without losing face,&quot; said Dutton. Google found itself in a similar situation when it launched in China in 2006 with censored search results. In the face of a barrage of criticism over censorship in 2010, it defied the authorities&apos; warnings and started to redirect mainland Chinese users to its unrestricted Hong Kong website. Rupert Murdoch also gave up his dream of piping Chinese TV to every home in the country. Over a period of almost 20 years, he travelled regularly to China and assiduously courted its leaders, in the hope of creating a truly global satellite network. But last August, News Corporation announced it was selling its controlling stakes in three of its Chinese television channels to a domestic private equity fund based in Beijing and Shanghai. The Financial Times and Murdoch&apos;s Wall Street Journal also run Chinese-language services, with the FT boasting 1.7 million users, and the New York Times will still be hoping to provide them with vigorous competition.", "tags": ["China", "Internet", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Google", "Technology", "Rupert Murdoch", "Media", "New York Times", "US press and publishing", "Newspapers", "Wen Jiabao", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-26T18:59:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/26/china-wen-jiabao-revelations", "sentences": ["But that is what a new leadership must do, if it is to transform a society &quot;unstable at the grass roots, dejected in the middle strata, and out of control at the top&quot;, which is how some Chinese scholars apparently described their country at a recent conference near Shanghai."], "title": "China: a new leaf? | Editorial", "article": "Of the two big political transitions ahead of us next month, it is clear which will receive most attention and be the easiest to read. The US presidential election, in spite of some uncertainties about Mr Romney&apos;s real position on many issues, is a straightforward and dramatic electoral contest. It will be comprehensively covered everywhere, and its outcome exhaustively analysed. The replacement of China&apos;s leadership at the 18th party congress, a couple of days after the American vote, is, by contrast, already foreordained. It looks like Chinese business as usual, and will be an almost entirely opaque process, as unclear in its implications after it is over as it is before it has begun. Yet it is arguably the more important of the two. This is not because China is a bigger power than America, which it is not, and which it may never become. It is because China&apos;s accumulated problems are so numerous and its need for reform and renewal so evident that the course its leaders set in the next five years could be more critical for the world than the choices a single American president will make in the four years at his disposal. Ever since it became possible to talk about Chinese politics in something like western terms, outsiders have hoped for reforms that will take the country in the direction of the rule of law and democracy, and reduce its dependence on a combination of nationalism and consumerism as a source of legitimacy. So have many, although it is unclear how many, Chinese. These expectations have usually been disappointed, because both the party and the people in China are frightened of too much change \u2013 the party because it worries that it will lose its grip, and ordinary people because of the memory of the chaos and cruelty of earlier times. However angry they are about official corruption and mismanagement, they fear any lurch into the unknown. Corruption is a key to many aspects of the Chinese situation. As the distinguished British sinologist Roderick MacFarquhar recently argued, high-level Chinese corruption is not just theft. Together with the export of assets abroad, and the despatch of sons and daughters to foreign schools and universities, it suggests that the party brass lacks confidence in the future. Mao and the other earlier leaders had won the war against the nationalists, created a pervasive and effective party apparatus, and spread an ideology which was widely accepted. All of this is now in the distant past, to the point that, as MacFarquhar writes: &quot;Globalising one&apos;s assets\u2026 makes sense as a hedge against risk.&quot; The revelations in the New York Times this week about the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, will undoubtedly find their way past the state&apos;s information filters, and their impact will be the more severe because he has been a relatively popular leader. The expulsion of the disgraced Bo Xilai from the party and, yesterday, from parliament, for, among other offences, corruption, is hardly likely to convince a sceptical populace that China&apos;s leaders are ready to clean up their act. But that is what a new leadership must do, if it is to transform a society &quot;unstable at the grass roots, dejected in the middle strata, and out of control at the top&quot;, which is how some Chinese scholars apparently described their country at a recent conference near Shanghai. Similarly, Deng Yuwen, a senior editor at one of the party&apos;s journals, has argued that the achievements of the last decade of growth may be outweighed by its failures, especially the &quot;failure to nurture and grow a middle class&quot;. The most serious failure of all, as the Chinese writer Yu Hua has said, is the erosion of political belief and meaning to the point where, as he suggests, the phrase &quot;the people&quot; has become &quot;nothing more than a shell company, utilised by different eras to position different products in the marketplace&quot;. Put that way, there is indeed a long way to go in China.", "tags": ["Wen Jiabao", "China", "Communism", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US elections 2012", "US politics", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-26T19:12:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/china-wen-jiabao-family-wealth-revealed", "sentences": ["A former government colleague of Wen, speaking anonymously, told the New York Times: &quot;In the senior leadership, there&apos;s no family that doesn&apos;t have these problems \u2026 His enemies are intentionally trying to smear him by letting this leak out.&quot; A US diplomatic cable obtained by Wikileaks, dating from 2007, quoted an executive in Shanghai as saying: &quot;Wen is disgusted with his family&apos;s activities, but is either unable or unwilling to curtail them.&quot; In March, the premier made an emotional defence of his tenure during his annual press conference, saying history would have the final say and stressing that he had never pursued personal gain."], "title": "Wen Jiabao's \u00a31.68bn family wealth: China furious at US expos\u00e9", "article": "China has lashed out at a US newspaper report that premier Wen Jiabao&apos;s family has amassed vast wealth worth at least $2.7bn (\u00a31.68bn), censoring the New York Times website and questioning the paper&apos;s motivations. The story said Wen, widely seen as the humane face of China&apos;s top leadership, was not directly linked to the holdings. But the association with such a fortune was in stark contrast to the man-of-the-people image he has cultivated. A foreign ministry spokesman said the report &quot;blackens China&apos;s name and has ulterior motives&quot;. Censors blocked the paper&apos;s Chinese language website, at least partially obstructed access to its main site, and banned microblog searches for New York Times in English and Chinese. &quot;China manages the internet in accordance with laws and rules,&quot; spokesman Hong Lei told reporters when asked why the sites were inaccessible. The detailed account, based on company and regulatory filings, said several of Wen&apos;s relatives had become extremely wealthy since his ascent to the top leadership, controlling assets whose total worth is more than the GDP of Burundi. In many cases their holdings were obscured by layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, colleagues or business partners. The report is damaging not only to Wen, but also to the Communist party. It has faced months of unwelcome scrutiny while preparing for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition \u2013 mostly thanks to the scandal surrounding disgraced leader Bo Xilai and his wife Gu Kailai&apos;s conviction for murdering a British businessman. On Friday Bo was expelled from the country&apos;s legislature, as expected, paving the way for his prosecution. He has been accused of corruption and abuse of power. There has been a spate of revelations about wealth amassed by people around other senior figures. Authorities blocked the Bloomberg website earlier this year after it exposed the multi-million dollar assets held by the extended family of Xi Jinping, heir-apparent to the presidency. It has also reported that Bo&apos;s relatives accumulated at least $136m in assets. The top leaders &quot;are like paranoid, flying eagles,&quot; said Edward Friedman, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. &quot;If you are looking up they look like the most powerful creatures in the world. But what they see is what a long fall it would be. I think in their consciousness it is very much about all the things that could go wrong.&quot; He added that, at least among politically-conscious people in urban areas of China, there seemed to have been a tremendous shift in mood since 2008, with patriotic pride and suspicion about the west giving way to a growing sense that the regime does not care about them. Steve Tsang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Nottingham, said of the US report: &quot;It&apos;s the kind of story where the leadership is united.&quot;Wen is implicated, Bo down \u2026 Who&apos;s next? Part of the arrangement is that someone leaving power is still protected after he leaves office, so that the system will continue.&quot; Given the bad blood known to exist between Wen and Bo, many anticipate supporters of the latter will seize on the report with glee. Others wonder if it may reduce Wen&apos;s future influence. Although he is due to retire as premier, former leaders still play a significant role in the party&apos;s decision-making. Many people \u2013 particularly among the elite \u2013 had been aware of rumours about Wen&apos;s relatives. But the scale of the reported assets is striking and the timing highly sensitive. While one Sina Weibo user described the report as a shock, another wrote: &quot;Looking at the numbers, I think it is still conservative.&quot; Both remarks were swiftly deleted, as were other references to the New York Times story. A BBC News report on the piece was also blocked in Beijing. Censorship means many in China will remain unaware of the US account. Wen has repeatedly urged China&apos;s leaders to ensure their families and associates do not abuse government influence, and pushed for officials to disclose the assets of their immediate families. Declarations are not public and the New York Times said four-fifths of the assets it found were held by relatives not covered by party rules, including his mother and various in-laws. A former government colleague of Wen, speaking anonymously, told the New York Times: &quot;In the senior leadership, there&apos;s no family that doesn&apos;t have these problems \u2026 His enemies are intentionally trying to smear him by letting this leak out.&quot; A US diplomatic cable obtained by Wikileaks, dating from 2007, quoted an executive in Shanghai as saying: &quot;Wen is disgusted with his family&apos;s activities, but is either unable or unwilling to curtail them.&quot; In March, the premier made an emotional defence of his tenure during his annual press conference, saying history would have the final say and stressing that he had never pursued personal gain. Substantial holdings in the name of Wen&apos;s mother and other relatives were held via an investment vehicle run by a wealthy businesswoman close to Wen&apos;s wife, Zhang Beili. Duan Weihong told the New York Times the investments were her own. She sought a low profile so had asked relatives to find others to hold the shares on her behalf. They had &quot;by accident&quot; chosen the premier&apos;s relatives. Zhang Beili, who is rarely seen with her husband, works in the diamond trade. Their son Winston Wen runs New Horizon Capital, one of China&apos;s biggest private equity funds. His wife Yang Xiaomeng told the New York Times: &quot;Everything that has been written about him has been wrong. He&apos;s really not doing that much business any more.&quot; The Times said members of Wen&apos;s family declined to comment or did not respond. Separately, the Brookings Institution said the brother of the man expected to replace Wen \u2013 vice premier Li Keqiang \u2013 should be moved from his senior post at China&apos;s state-owned tobacco monopoly. Li oversees public health as part of his duties.

The team, who have been improving throughout the latter part of the season and have been on top so far in China this weekend, continued their strong form, beating their nearest rivals Audi to top spot for Sunday&apos;s race by one 10th of a second. It is the team&apos;s third pole in the six races they have entered this year after Kazuki Nakajima took top spot at the last race in Fuji and Wurz claimed Toyota&apos;s first since they returned to endurance racing this year, at S\u00e3o Paulo. Both of which were converted into wins for the Japanese marque. Of the leading LMP1 prototype class, the two Audis and the Toyota all went out at the very start of the session with Britain&apos;s Allan McNish in the No2 car (alongside Tom Kristensen) looking to begin the attempt to make up the 16.5-point deficit to the championship leaders Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler in the sister No1, by taking pole. However, having set the initial fastest lap, McNish was bettered by Wurz on only his second lap with a time of 1min 48.273sec, one tenth clear of the Audi and the fastest lap of the weekend. In warm but overcast and humid conditions the Toyota had already gone quickest in two of the three practice sessions and was expected to have the edge in the final, quickest-lap runs on Saturday. Having set fast times early on, however, none of the major players opted for runs later in the session, preserving tyres for the opening stint of Sunday&apos;s six-hour race. Lotterer took third place, three tenths back, but will be untroubled by starting from the second row, aware that a finish in fifth place or better will be enough to take the drivers&apos; championship. &quot;We know we have to put in a good performance to beat the Audis in qualifying and the TS030 Hybrid was better today than the driver to be honest,&quot; said Wurz. In Brazil I got the perfect pole lap but here I didn&apos;t have the best last sector and lost a few tenths.&quot; &quot;From the long runs yesterday we looked competitive but the traffic fell pretty well for me. It is going to be close; I expect nothing different than another hard fight like we had in Fuji.&quot; McNish, too, was expecting a tough battle with the Toyota but to maintain any chance of taking the championship remained focussed on the win. &quot;I know that the challenge from Toyota in the race will be very strong. It was a surprising qualifying session,&quot; he said. &quot;To qualify on the front row of the grid is always good but I didn&apos;t expect to be so close to pole-position.&quot; &quot;Tom and I are still in the fight for the championship and our aim tomorrow is clear \u2013 to win the race,&quot; he added. Ominously for Audi, however, the low-grip circuit here in Shanghai is likely to suit the Toyota, which is easier on its tyres over race distance but, while the Japanese team will be looking for their third win this season, attention will be focused on which of the German team&apos;s driver lineups can add the drivers&apos; title to the manufacturers&apos; championship they claimed earlier in the year. A tight battle in the LMP1 privateer category, where the top three were within three one hundreths of a second, was won by JRM&apos;s Karun Chandhok who took fourth place on the grid ahead of Neel Jani in the Rebellion Lola. In LMP2, James Rossiter took pole for Lotus, their first of the season and in GTE Pro Darren Turner in the Aston Martin claimed the top spot.", "tags": ["World Endurance Championship", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-27T11:27:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/28/skyfall-james-bond-review", "sentences": ["Bond is eventually sent to the exotic east \u2013 Shanghai and Macau, glitteringly affluent after staid London \u2013 to track down the villain."], "title": "Skyfall \u2013 review", "article": "Fifty years ago this month, the first James Bond movie, Dr No, opened at United Artists&apos;s West End showcase, the London Pavilion in Piccadilly Circus, a former Victorian music hall. United Artists no longer exists as a major production company and the cinema became a shopping arcade a quarter of a century ago, but the franchise goes on. For the first time in more than a decade, the final credits confidently tell us there will be a new Bond film soon. Though produced by children of the American who launched Dr No, the Bond series is now a British institution with a global reach greater than our former empire, and the latest addition, Skyfall, was given its world premiere not in a movie house but at the Royal Albert Hall. In certain senses, it is more British than ever, not only in its predominant use of UK locations but in its relationship to national traditions. The patriotic opening ceremony of this summer&apos;s Olympics sealed the pact between Buckingham Palace and showbusiness when the current Bond, Daniel Craig, was accompanied on a mission by the Queen, concluding with a parachute jump into the Olympic Stadium. It is now virtually impossible to look at Bond&apos;s superior, M, as other than a stand-in for the Queen, especially as the regal Judi Dench came to the Bond series after impersonating Elizabeth I and Victoria. M seems now a code letter for majesty. This 23rd canonical Bond picture is possibly the best, challenged only by the 2006 Craig version of Casino Royale, which was at last able to draw on the text of Ian Fleming&apos;s first and best novel. It has two of the same writers who worked on Casino Royale and the last Bond picture, the disappointingly frenetic Quantum of Solace, and although they&apos;ve invented their scenario, it is true to Fleming and the series while making interesting additions. Returning to Britain to work on it are director Sam Mendes, all of whose pictures have been made in America, and the outstanding British cinematographer Roger Deakins, who&apos;s been working for years in the States, principally for the Coen brothers, but also for Ron Howard and Mendes. The movie begins with a protracted chase by car, motorcycle and train in Turkey which ends with the serious, tight-lipped Bond failing to retrieve a list of MI6&apos;s special agents around the world and plunging down a gorge as precipitous as the Reichenbach Falls. A somewhat premature verdict of missing presumed dead is announced, but, like Holmes, he returns, somewhat depleted, only to be dispatched to find the ludic villain who has penetrated MI6&apos;s computers and planted a bomb that wrecks a whole floor of the department&apos;s Millbank HQ.           M contemplates a room full of her employees&apos; coffins draped in union flags and we realise that this is a Bond film that, for much of the time at least, takes death seriously. The explosion has driven MI6 underground to occupy the austere bunkers created by Winston Churchill when the country had its back to the wall in the second world war. Here, Bond is restored and reinstated, under the supervision of stiff-necked intelligence co-ordinator Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), an establishment figure redeemed in Bond&apos;s eyes by his having been an SAS captive of the IRA who never cracked. Bond is eventually sent to the exotic east \u2013 Shanghai and Macau, glitteringly affluent after staid London \u2013 to track down the villain. Here, he consorts with two alluring Bond girls, one black and dependable (the wisecracking MI6 agent Eve, played by Naomie Harris), the other Eurasian and expendable (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe). After seeing off some minor hoodlums, one of them in a pit patrolled by komodo dragons, he discovers the villain, a laughing lunatic called Silva (Javier Bardem), a suave Hannibal Lecter type whose motive is revenge against MI6 for not appreciating him. Unlike his predecessors, who lived in Renaissance mansions and worked in state-of-the-art subterranean silos, Silva&apos;s an austere figure living in supposedly polluted ruins on a remote, deserted island. Most of the rest is set in Britain. In London, Bond contemplates changing times and his own future while scrutinising Turner&apos;s The Fighting Temeraire during a rendezvous in the National Gallery with the new, young, computer-savvy Q (Ben Wishaw), who provides for his logistical needs. M, in mortal danger from Silva, recites Tennyson&apos;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; (&quot;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&quot;) to give her strength for the fateful showdown with her relentless nemesis. This is staged in the bracing Highlands, ancient home of the Bond family (their 16th century mansion is called Skyfall). It&apos;s the sort of place where British sporting heroes such as Buchan&apos;s Richard Hannay and the protagonist of Geoffrey Household&apos;s Rogue Male would once repair to confront their enemies. To get there, Bond digs out the Aston Martin DB5 (first seen in Goldfinger) and M jokes about not wanting to be ejected. There&apos;s some lazy repetition in Skyfall, the badinage is often perfunctory and Bond is as usual captured too easily and too easily escapes. But overall it&apos;s admirably staged, has a suitably sombre look, and the oddly moving final scenes have an elegiac grace and a tragic sense that the end of On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service only hints at. At the centre, Craig manages to get out of the shadow of Connery. He&apos;s the only Bond so far who might also have played Alec Leamas, the downbeat hero of le Carr\u00e9&apos;s The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. Alongside him, Judi Dench suggests she could have played Smiley, which is more than one could say of Stella Rimington.", "tags": ["James Bond", "Daniel Craig", "Thriller", "Sam Mendes", "Film", "Culture", "Skyfall"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-27T23:16:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/28/toyota-shanghai-audi-championship", "sentences": ["Toyota dominanted in the final round of the FIA World Endurance Championship here in Shanghai but it was the Audi trio of Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler who took the ultimate glory by winning the drivers&apos; championship \u2013 the first to be awarded since Derek Warwick and Yannick Dalmas won for Peugeot in 1992, the last time the title was contested.", "It had come down to the final race but only a major error or mechanical failure could have cost the championship leaders the title in Shanghai since, ultimately, the hard work had already been done.", "There has been no more fierce competitor for the title than Britain&apos;s McNish, who was determined to take the fight to the chequered flag but finished content that he and Kristensen had done all they could in Shanghai."], "title": "Toyota dominate in Shanghai but Audi drivers secure championship", "article": "Toyota dominanted in the final round of the FIA World Endurance Championship here in Shanghai but it was the Audi trio of Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler who took the ultimate glory by winning the drivers&apos; championship \u2013 the first to be awarded since Derek Warwick and Yannick Dalmas won for Peugeot in 1992, the last time the title was contested. The trio in the No1 car had a 16.5-point lead over the drivers of the sister No2 Audi, Allan McNish and Tom Kristensen, so were comfortable going into the final race, but a strong finish was still required in the final round to seal their win. It was provided in emphatic, if unspectacular, style with a solid third place behind the sister car, claiming the title by 13 points for them and for Audi, who have already taken the manufacturers&apos; championship. It had come down to the final race but only a major error or mechanical failure could have cost the championship leaders the title in Shanghai since, ultimately, the hard work had already been done. After a slow start at the first round in Sebring \u2013 the perfect season-opener for McNish and Kristensen, who won at the US endurance classic \u2013 Lotterer, Tr\u00e9luyer and F\u00e4ssler have rarely strayed from the front. In the six races that followed they have won three, including Le Mans for the second year in succession, and have come second in three \u2013 results due in no small part to Leena Gade, who set a milestone here by becoming the first female race engineer to win a world championship. Importantly, too, none of the missed wins was to their Audi driver rivals but to Toyota, who had begun the season three races in and were thus out of contention for the title. Their top-two run ended here at the eighth race but it was of no consequence: third was enough and there were to be no errors committed looking for unnecesary positions. Which made for a flawless but not particularly inspiring race for the champions, as it was for the leading field as a whole. This is not to diminish the achievement of Toyota, whose victory by just under 59 seconds after six hours racing in the hands of Alexander Wurz and Nicolas Lapierre, was exemplary. It is their third win in the final four races of this season, all of them from pole \u2013 an extraordinary achievement for the team who returned to sportscar racing only this year and even then only six races ago at Le Mans. Their advantage here, as it has been at previous races, was pace. From the start the TS030 was just under a second quicker than both Audis, who had no answer as Lapierre streched his legs in the opening stint. By its first stop on lap 22 the petrol hybrid, thirstier than its Audi diesel hybrid rival the R18 e-tron quattro, had a lead of almost 20 seconds and after the cycle of stops the gap was still 16 seconds. As with the last round at Fuji the Audi would make one fewer stop but it was not enough to make a difference. By the fifth stop the Toyota, making the most of its advantage in passing slower cars, had enough of a gap to go into and out of the pits without surrendering the lead and, easier on the tyres at this low-grip track, was also able to double-stint rubber at the end to increase the lead. For Lotterer, however, third was enough. &quot;It&apos;s been a fantastic season,&quot; he said. &quot;Just a little off in Sebring, from then on it was really great. We have a good partnership here, its fantastic to share. Our crew, our mechanics are really bonded with us, so its fantastic to have this first world championship as a reward.&quot; Wurz, however, understandably, was keen for the fight to continue. &quot;We want to win the world championship,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to win Le Mans. Today has hopefully shown that we are on it. When we came to China we wanted to give it our all and it was the perfect race.&quot; Asked if they were favourites for next year, he replied with a smile: &quot;Of course we are&quot;. There has been no more fierce competitor for the title than Britain&apos;s McNish, who was determined to take the fight to the chequered flag but finished content that he and Kristensen had done all they could in Shanghai. &quot;Ideally we would have liked to get into the lead but that wasn&apos;t possible,&quot; he said. &quot;Nicolas got a good start and he just pulled away, more in traffic than on pure lap speed. That was the maximum we could achieve today: we were on the limits from the begining to the end of the race.&quot; With no alarms and surprises the top three came home as they had begun the race but it suggests a real fight is on for next season. Toyota, who will be expected, if financial considerations allow, to bring two cars to next year&apos;s championship, have laid down a mighty marker to Audi, far more threatening in that they have been so quick, so soon, than the challenge offered by Peugeot in their recent five years of competition. Audi, who finally have two world titles in their hand and in the record books to mark their dominance of endurance racing over the past decade, will be eager to defend both against such strong competition. There was disappointment for the leading privateer team, Rebellion Racing, after Neel Jani and Nicolas Prost had a gearbox problem and were forced to stop on track eight minutes from the end, denying them third place in the drivers&apos; championship, which was taken by Wurz and Lapierre. The privateer class in the race was taken by the sister rebellion car of Andrea Belicchi, Harold Primat and Cheng Congfu in fourth place, while ADR-Delta took the flag in LMP2 and the Aston Martin of Stefan Mucke and Darren Turner claimed their first win of the season in GTE Pro.", "tags": ["Sport", "World Endurance Championship", "Motor sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-28T22:28:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/29/audi-allan-mcnish-toyota-endurance", "sentences": ["Audi had already won the manufacturers&apos; championship, but third place at the Shanghai International Circuit was enough to secure Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler the drivers&apos; title, beating McNish and Tom Kristensen in the sister car by 13.5 points.", "&quot;Alex said it, they are favourites,&quot; said McNish just after coming off the podium for his second place in Shanghai.", "It starts in April and we&apos;re thinking about it already.&quot; 2013 World Endurance Championship 14 April 6 Hours of Silverstone 4 May Hours of Spa-Francorchamps 22/23 June 24 Heures du Mans 31 August 6 Hours of Sao Paulo 22 September 6 Hours of Austin 20 October 6 Hours of Fuji 10 November 6 Hours of Shanghai 30 November 6 Hours of Bahrain"], "title": "Audi's Allan McNish wary of Toyota as preparations for 2013 begin", "article": "Britain&apos;s Allan McNish expects another tough battle for the FIA World Endurance Championship next year, after the season ended with Audi taking the drivers&apos; title here in China on Sunday but with rivals Toyota ominously dominant in the latter part of the year.

Had Europe fallen to defeat at Medinah, negative scrutiny would have fallen the way of their captain, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal. (plenty of it actually did, but that was before the most memorable singles turnaround in living memory). Ultimately, then, Rory McIlroy&apos;s near-missed tee time and Olaz\u00e1bal&apos;s selections over the Friday and Saturday could be brushed aside or, in the Northern Irishman&apos;s case, laughed off. Depending on your point of view, Olaz\u00e1bal had either proved what an inspirational captain he could be by Sunday evening, or shown that the significance of the role can routinely be given too much weight. The case of Peter Hanson&apos;s role at Medinah, though, has come back into focus during recent days. Hanson admirably held off the strong challenge of McIlroy to claim the BMW Masters in Shanghai, a cheque for \u20ac888,561 (\u00a3716,000) and, suddenly, second place in the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai standings. Heading into the final set of events on that money list, including this week&apos;s HSBC event in China, Hanson trails McIlroy by about \u20ac800,000. That isn&apos;t an unsurmountable gap for a man clearly in form and still of a mind to prove Olaz\u00e1bal wrong. Think back to Saturday morning at Medinah. As foursome matches took place elsewhere on the course, Hanson and his caddie played a few holes in isolation as a practice session. Hanson signed autographs and was only informed of results elsewhere by those, perhaps bemused, fans. When Hanson was told he would play no part, either, in the fourball session, his disappointment got the better of him. He had played only 14 holes on Friday, with Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson condemning Hanson and Paul Lawrie to a heavy defeat. When BBC Radio 5 Live&apos;s microphone was placed in front of Hanson on Saturday afternoon, he couldn&apos;t mask his frustrations. To paraphrase the Swede, he essentially claimed his hard work in making the Ryder Cup team appeared a waste of time. Hanson did, of course, reappear for the singles, losing to Jason Dufner, with the 35-year-old all-but ignored by those seeking testimony of Europe&apos;s stunning victory thereafter. This wasn&apos;t quite akin to the scenario of Andrew Coltart, who featured in only the singles \u2013 and lost to Tiger Woods \u2013 during Europe&apos;s 1999 loss at Brookline. But for Hanson, this was clearly and understandably a blow to his morale during his second Ryder Cup appearance. It was also probably an unnecessary one given that Hanson finished third in this year&apos;s Masters, tied seventh in the USPGA Championship and had won the KLM Open in the build-up to the Ryder Cup in Chicago. That success marked his fifth European Tour title and a victory only bettered by last weekend. By the time Hanson landed in Scotland, for the Dunhill Links Championship early this month, he had barely cooled down. He confirmed he &quot;might not send&quot; Olaz\u00e1bal any Christmas cards. Hanson added of his Saturday heartache: &quot;I didn&apos;t take it very well, but I took it for myself. I didn&apos;t let it go out over anyone else. I just locked myself in a dark room and stayed there for a couple of hours. I didn&apos;t damage the team, and that was the main thing. &quot;You kind of forget about it pretty quick, but having come into the Ryder Cup playing so well, winning and preparing myself for six weeks and then not getting to play, it hurts for a while. I haven&apos;t spoken with Olly about it since. We didn&apos;t have the time and I didn&apos;t want to bring it up when we were celebrating.&quot; Instead, Hanson has channelled his energies more positively. Rounds of 66, 64, 70 and 67 saw off McIlroy by a shot in Shanghai. What followed? A more thawed-out Ryder Cup analysis, which must be taken in the context of celebration. &quot;With the Ryder Cup, it is so great just being part of it,&quot; Hanson insisted. &quot;I mean, everybody reads the newspapers and like I said, I got the question, if I was disappointed not to play on the Saturday, and I said I was. &quot;I think as an individual sportsman, we want to play. I mean, it&apos;s just the thing that when you are part of such a good team as we had this time, it&apos;s hard to get a spot. The only thing I can do is, like I said, keep working on my game and try to get better, and if I qualify for the future Ryder Cups, hopefully I can play a few more matches.&quot; Hanson deliberately underplayed his future ambitions with those words.

I&apos;ve improved a hell of a lot since riding for Mr Charlton and over the last couple of years, but I wasn&apos;t that bad before, it was just about getting the\u00a0break. &quot;I think it will benefit Dundonnell to be racing around a couple of turns. He&apos;s quite a highly strung horse, so you have to keep a lid on him early in a race and a couple of turns gives you a chance to get him relaxed and get a bit of cover.&quot; Dundonnell may be the best chance of a British-trained winner at this year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup, although the European challenge as a whole includes horses like Excelebration, the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner, and Freddy Head&apos;s Moonlight Cloud, who run in the Mile, and Shareta and St Nicholas Abbey, who will contest the Turf. Richard Hannon also saddles a likely favourite for Britain in Sky Lantern, who runs in the Juvenile Fillies&apos; Turf on Friday. European-trained horses could be the main danger to Dundonnell too, in the shape of Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s George Vancouver and Artigiano, who runs for Godolphin. &quot;I had a look at the track this morning and it&apos;s going to be fast, so you need a horse with a turn of foot that can also break well and get a position on the turn,&quot; Doyle said. &quot;But the Europeans all have to improve [to beat us], even if we don&apos;t, and he&apos;s been improving all year. If he improves again, then he&apos;s going to be a major player.&quot; Dundonnell jogged gently around the turf course on Tuesday morning, while other European challengers to go out onto the track included the French-trained Moonlight Cloud, Shareta and Ridasiyna, who runs in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, the penultimate race on Friday&apos;s card. It was a relatively chilly early morning at Santa Anita, but as soon as the sun rose above the mountains, the temperature started to climb under a typically cloudless sky. It was hard to believe that another part of the same country was in a state of emergency as a result of superstorm Sandy, but, had this year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup been staged at Belmont Park in New York, as once seemed likely, it would surely have been washed away. As it is, several New York-based horses, including Todd Plethcher&apos;s Shanghai Bobby and Dreaming Of Julia, the favourites for the Juvenile and Juvenile Fillies&apos; respectively, have been unable to travel to the west coast as yet. Both are expected to make the trip on Wednesday, along with Wise Dan, the second-favourite for the Mile, who is stabled in Kentucky and whose arrival has also been delayed.", "tags": ["Breeders' Cup", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-30T19:54:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/nov/01/art-national-trust", "sentences": ["He took part in this year&apos;s Shanghai Biennale, in the British Art Show 7 in 2010, and he has also exhibited in Paris, London, Turin, Vienna and New York."], "title": "Artist takes up residence at the Queen Mother's ancestral home", "article": "Earlier this year the Swedish artist Tris Vonna-Michell was &quot;in residence&quot; at the National Trust&apos;s Gibside property on the outskirts of Gateshead.  The residency has resulted in an installation called Ulterior Vistas, which can be seen at the Baltic until November 11.     Tris Vonna-Michell: source material for \"Ulterior Vistas\".  Courtesy of the artist.    Ulterior Vistas consists of two slide projectors showing mainly monochrome images of parkland and rural scenes, played in a darkened room with a sound track consisting of a chanted monologue with musical background. In the monologue we hear:  a driven sales agent is orating a prospectus based on grand 18th Century English landscape garden design for an unidentified client, perhaps a venture capitalist. He is soliciting a global perspective characterised by appropriation of cultural heritage in order to cultivate a desirable public persona for his client. Aside from offering an array of landscape gardening solutions and attributes he also proposes more abstract features such as synthetic spirituality and symbolic gestures of generosity.  The effect is somewhat reminiscent of Edith Sitwell&apos;s Fa\u00e7ade, which she recited from behind a curtain designed by John Piper with musical accompaniment by William Walton.     From Tris Vonna-Michell's Ulterior Vistas.  Pic by Colin Davison    The main house at Gibside has been largely uninhabited since the 1920s, and is now just a romantic ruin. The house belonged to local mine-owner George Bowes, whose only daughter Mary Eleanor carried his estates into the Lyon family, adding her surname to theirs. She was the great-great-great-grandmother of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, and rumour has it that it was partly paying the costs for her wedding to the future George VI that forced the Bowes-Lyons to abandon Gibside. While at Gibside, Tris Vonna-Michell stayed in the Grade I listed gothic Banqueting House, which was restored from dereliction by the Landmark Trust - which now lets it out as a holiday cottage. The house was built for George Bowes in 1751 by Daniel Garrett \u2013 who also designed the magnificent Palladian stable block, where George Bowes kept his 35 horses in considerably greater comfort than the people who worked in his mines.     From Tris Vonna-Michell's Ulterior Vistas.  Pic by Colin Davison    Other features of the estate include the Chapel, which doubles as a mausoleum for George Bowes, and the Statue of British Liberty, standing proudly on her 146&apos; high Doric column - taller than Grey&apos;s Monument in Newcastle, which she can probably see across the Derwent and Tyne valleys. The statue and its column are at the end of the Long Walk -a wide avenue of beautiful mature oaks, limes and sycamores. The reliably prolix Augustus Hare visited in 1862, saying:   Gibside was a beautiful place. The long many-orielled battlemented house was reached through exquisite woods feathering down to the Derwent. A tall column in the park commemorates the victory of George Bowes \u2026 over Sir Robert Walpole at a Newcastle election.   He adds that the chapel is &quot;a beautiful building externally, but hideous within, with the pulpit in the centre.&quot; Tris Vonna Michell has been shortlisted for the 2012 $100,000 Hugo Boss Prize, which is being decided at the Guggenheim Museum in New York this week. He took part in this year&apos;s Shanghai Biennale, in the British Art Show 7 in 2010, and he has also exhibited in Paris, London, Turin, Vienna and New York. Tris Vonna Michell&apos;s Ulterior Vistas is on at the Baltic until November 11.

Ferries stop running, trains are immobilized, and in several boroughs, fires rage out of control. &quot;New York&quot;, a reporter at the New York Times marvels, is as &quot;completely isolated from the rest of the world as if Manhattan Island was in the middle of the South Sea.&quot; Seeing their city utterly paralyzed by an act of nature, officials who tour the blacked-out neighborhoods immediately call for a massive investment in better transportation. The tempest in question was not Hurricane Sandy, but the &quot;Great White Hurricane&quot;, a blizzard that, in the early days of March 1888, wreaked havoc on the eastern seaboard and brought 22in of snow and 80mph wind gusts to New York City. The storm also brought an end to two decades of dickering about infrastructure: from then on, electrical cables and telegraph cables would be buried, and the elevated trains on the avenues, whose steam engines were extinguished by the gale, would be replaced by a weather-proof underground railroad, on the lines of the one already running in London. But the most lasting impact of the Blizzard of &apos;88 was the building of the IRT, the first line in what would become, in the 20th century, the world&apos;s most extensive subway system. Never again would the great city of New York allow itself to be paralyzed by a simple act of nature. Now, as the Army Corps of Engineers flies in 250 pumps to drain tunnels filled floor-to-ceiling with water, and service haltingly resumes on 14 of the city&apos;s 23 subway lines, New Yorkers are being reminded of how completely they have come to rely on public transport for going about the day-to-day business of their lives. On any given day, 95% of commuters get to Manhattan&apos;s central business district not by car, but by foot, bicycle, or buses and trains \u2013 mostly the latter. (Realizing this, and to forestall a carmaggedon of gridlock, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has wisely announced that only vehicles with three or more occupants will be allowed in to Manhattan until Friday night.) Rail transportation is the sine qua non of Manhattan: it keeps the economy of the city, the state, and the entire north-east thrumming. It doesn&apos;t take an urban planner to realize that if you shut it down, even for a couple of days, New York City will turn into Podunk. After touring scenes of devastation in Queens, Governor Andrew Cuomo pledged:  &quot;We will rebuild the subway system and we will build it better. That&apos;s what New York is all about.&quot;  Let&apos;s hope he keeps his word. As it stands, New York is pitiably lagging behind other global cities when it comes to expanding, or even maintaining, its subway and commuter rail networks. Even as ridership surpasses 1.6bn trips a year, a record since the postwar boom years, the subway continues to rely on early industrial-age technology. Consider, for example, the metal flanges in Union Square that snap into place as squealing trains arrive (to compensate for a marked curve in the platforms); the analogue signals that prevent dispatchers from boosting the frequency of trains; and the Depression-era relays that, as one commentator told me, &quot;look like the switchboard at the Grand Hotel&quot;. For decades, New York&apos;s subway was the only one in the world that was actually losing track mileage. Now, happily, tunnel-boring machines are again at work beneath the streets: the 7 line is being extended into the far west side, by all of one stop, and if all goes well, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway will be up and running, maybe, by 2016. (A simple replacement project for an elevated line scrapped in 1942, it should have been completed a half century ago.) Meanwhile, Shanghai \u2013 a city where commuters can ride a 268mph magnetic levitation to the airport \u2013 has taken only 17 years to build itself a metro system that now surpasses New York&apos;s as the largest in the world. There&apos;s no question that New York&apos;s legacy transit system faces huge challenges. Even when there is no storm surge to cope with, pumps have to operate day and night to keep the estimated 13-15m gallons of water a day that routinely infiltrate tunnel walls from overwhelming the system. (Fortunately, this may be New York&apos;s last serious case of tunnel flooding. On the eve of Hurricane Sandy, the department of homeland security was testing giant inflatable plugs that would swiftly close off tunnels in case of terrorist attacks or future storm surges; see this video.) In New York, trains still cross the Hudson and East Rivers through tunnels that were dug with pickaxes by Irish, Italian and African-American &quot;sandhogs&quot;, who lost their lives by the dozens in caisson failures and explosions. Yet, there are other metropolises \u2013 among them Paris, London, and Berlin \u2013 that face similar challenges. The difference is, they&apos;ve managed to improve and expand their vintage metro systems. New York has a lot of catching up to do. In 1968, under then Mayor John Lindsay, the newly-created MTA announced plans that would have expanded the subway network by 20%, including new lines to Queens and the Bronx, and a subway spur to JFK airport. The financial crisis of the 1970s put paid to the plans, and the city is nowhere near achieving what, in any other major city, would have been a routine network expansion. And now, at a time when some politicians are making political hay out of natural disaster, it&apos;s well to remember that the chief impediment to truly sustainable transportation for American cities continues to be blinkered partisanship. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is being praised for his handling of the aftermath of the hurricane, but he&apos;s also the reason that, when Sandy blew in, New Jersey&apos;s only rail link across the Hudson River consisted of two easily flooded, century-old, single-track tunnels.  Because the Republican governor was determined to keep a campaign promise not to raise the state&apos;s very low gas tax during his campaign, he exaggerated the cost of &quot;Access to the Region&apos;s Core&quot; plan, thus killing a project that would have given his constituents faster and more reliable rail access to the jobs in Lower Manhattan. Not to mention brand new, non-leaky tunnels for all New Yorkers. The Great Blizzard of &apos;88 brought an end to the dark ages of transportation in New York, a period typified by the rotund Boss Tweed, whose financial interests in horse-car companies had long kept the city mired in congestion, and stalled any progress on the digging of an underground railway. With any luck, the legacy of Hurricane Sandy \u2013 the Great Blow of &apos;12 \u2013 will be serious and sustained commitment to the only transportation that will keep New York running, day-in, day-out.

There was not much for the Europeans to celebrate overall, in fact, with just one winner on each of the two days, but the successes of Rosie Napravnik, on Shanghai Bobby, and above all Wise Dan&apos;s victory in the Mile, with a real champion&apos;s performance, were also truly memorable.  Hope you enjoyed it too. Greg Wood at Santa Anita, signing off.  5.53pm: Both Mucho Macho Man and Fort Larned got a great reception from the crowd as they came back in front of the stands. Mucho Macho Man could not have done any more, and the rest of the field were distant spectators as the two of them went at it, but Fort Larned simply refused to crack. 5.46pm: Breeders&apos; Cup Classic result: 1. Fort Larned, 2. Mucho Macho Man, 3. Flat Out. Great stretch duel between the first two but Fort Larned was never headed by the runner-up. Really brave win. 5.40pm: At the gate for the Classic. Hope everyone has enjoyed the day, and that the losers manage to get out of trouble in the last. Though not all of them will, obviously.  5.34pm: There&apos;s nothing like the excitement before Zenyatta ran here three years ago of course, but Game On Dude is favourite at 7-5 as he tries to go one better than last year. Mucho Macho Man is 5-1, Flat Out is 7-1, and it is 9-1 bar. Three minutes to post. 5.30pm: Ten minutes to post for the Classic, and here comes Tony Bennett. Sadly, the sound check for Tony seems to have been done by the same person who set up the wifi here yesterday, and no-one can hear anything. Unfortunate, to say the least.  5.20pm: Animal Kingdom ran a huge race in the Mile and and Rafael Bejarano, his jockey, believes it could have been a different story with a little more luck in running.  &quot;They were going so fast early and I was stuck down inside,&quot; he said. &quot;I had no choice. Then I had to go in and out of horses. When I finally got to ask him, he gave me a huge kick. I only wish I could have asked him earlier. The winner got first jump on me. If it is the other way around, it might have been a different finish.&quot; 5.09pm: A cute doggie has just been asked to pick the winner of the Breeders&apos; Cup Classic, live on the big screen. He went for Brilliant Speed, presumably because he liked the name.  5.06pm: Charles Lopresti, the trainer of Wise Dan, is in the interview room.  &quot;Every time I do something with him, he amazes me,&quot; Lopresti said. &quot;He&apos;s a good shipper, a good horse, he has a good level head, he&apos;s just really easy to deal with.  &quot;It really hasn&apos;t hit me yet. It&apos;s an incredible accomplishment, but it&apos;s really just the horse. He&apos;s done things in the morning that you just don&apos;t believe, and you work all your life to have a horse like this.&quot; 4.45pm: What a performance by Wise Dan. It was never really in doubt, he travelled supremely well behind the strong pace, charged into the lead at the top of the straight and powered home from there, giving St Nicholas Abbey no chance to launch a response. That was magnificent.  4.41pm: Breeders&apos; Cup Mile result: 1. Wise Dan, 2. Animal Kingdom, 3. Obviously. New course record time. 4.35pm: The pace is going to be strong from the start here as Obviously seems sure to set a searching gallop. The trick for the jockeys on the big players will be deciding when to play their hand, as much as finding the room to do it.   4.31pm: They are on the track for the Mile, all looking well and ready for the challenge. Wise Dan is now the narrow favourite at 9-5, Excelebration still at 2-1.  4.28pm: And so to what is, for the Europeans at least, the race of the meeting: Excelebration and Moonlight Cloud versus Wise Dan in the Mile. Wise Dan and Excelebration are currently trading at 2-1 joint-favourite on the machine, with Moonlight Cloud at 5-1. Animal Kingdom, who is, lest we forget, last year&apos;s Kentucky Derby winner, is a 6-1 chance, though he has not seen a racecourse since February. Graham Motion, his British-born trainer, has done brilliantly to get him back to a track at all. Victory would be an extraordinary achievement. 4.11pm: That will have knocked quite a few people out of the Pick6. Trinniberg, an absolute picture of a strong, muscular dirt sprinter, was just under 14-1 on the PMU.  4.03pm: Breeders&apos; Cup Sprint result: 1. Trinniberg, 2. The Lumber Guy, 3. Smiling Tiger.  3.54pm: They are out on the track for the Sprint, Amazombie is the narrow favourite in a very open race at 4-1, just ahead of The Lumber Guy at 9-2. Coil is another leading fancy at 5-1, and it&apos;s 7-1 about Jimmy Creed.  3.43pm: Shareta in particular was a little slow to stride, while St Nicholas Abbey ran quite wide in mid-division down the back stretch. Little Mike, normally a front-runner, was settled just behind the pace on the rail, but always with plenty of running room. Trailblazer stormed around the outside on the home turn, but his challenge petered out in the stretch and from a furlong out, there was never going to be enough time for the leading Europeans to reel in Little Mike.  3.36pm: Disappointment for the Europeans, but that was a well-judged ride by Ramon Dominguez as Joseph O&apos;Brien, on St Nicholas Abbey, and Christophe Lemaire both struggled to recover from poor early positions. They were charging after the winner down the straight but never looked like getting to him, and it was Point Of Entry who laid down the strongest challenge in the closing stages.   3.23pm: Breeders&apos; Cup Turf result: 1. Little Mike, 2. Point Of Entry, 3. St Nicholas Abbey.  3.18pm: At the gate for the Turf. We have Shareta, St Nicholas Abbey and, ahem, Trailblazer in the Pick6.  3.14pm: Here they come for the Turf, led out by Point Of Entry, the US-trained favourite. St Nicholas Abbey looks very well, so too Shareta. Trailblazer, from Japan, was very fractious in the preliminaries but has consented to join the rest of the field. He has looked several grapes short of the full bunch all week, so all respect to Yutaka Take for just about keeping him under control. I wouldn&apos;t want to go within 50 yards of him myself. 3.07pm: Rosie Napravnik is in the interview room. &quot;He&apos;s got so much heart, he just turns it on automatically. It&apos;s not something that a lot of horses can do.  &quot;I&apos;m really excited to see how good he gets, because I don&apos;t think anybody really knows yet.  &quot;Even when he&apos;s a little lost out there I&apos;m trying to encourage him as much as possible, but it&apos;s his competitive nature when he sees other horses come up next to him, the heart that he has. He just wants to win.&quot; 2.45pm: That was an extraordinary race, and a remarkable performance by Shanghai Bobby to see it out all the way to the wire after helping to set some very fast early fractions. Rosie Napravnik, his jockey, got it just right in becoming only the second female jockey to win a race at this meeting, but she looked sure to be swallowed up by the closers halfway down the stretch. Somehow, from somewhere, Shanghai Bobby kept finding more. And did it without the assistance of Lasix, too.  2.42pm: Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile result: 1. Shanghai Bobby, 2. He&apos;s Had Enough, 3. Capo Bastone.   2.30pm: Coming out onto the track for the Juvenile. Two stand out here on form and in the betting, Shanghai Bobby and Power Broker, and both, happily, are in our still-alive Pick6 perm. Eight of the nine runners are coming off Lasix having run on it last time out, the exception being Fortify, in Godolphin blue for Kiaran McLaughlin. If Fortify wins and the favourites disappoint, the strong pro-Lasix lobby in US racing will use the result as a stick to beat the Breeders&apos; Cup with all the way to next year&apos;s meeting.  2.22pm: Mizdirection is owned by Jim Rome, a well-known talk show host on sports radio and Britain&apos;s very own Nick Luck has just done a silky-smooth job of presenting him with the trophy. It must have included a big bottle of booze as Luck finished by advising him not to drink it all at once.  2.10pm: What do I know indeed? That&apos;s rhetorical, by the way.  Mike Smith has just ridden his 17th Breeders&apos; Cup winner, coming with a strong run inside the closing stages to wear down Unbridled&apos;s Note. Starspangledbanner showed great early speed, starting quickly under Joseph O&apos;Brien and then tearing to the half-mile in 42.39 seconds, which is really shifting even allowing for the slight downhill gradient. He could not maintain it all the way to the line, but there is still plenty of life left in him yet, in racing terms at least.  2.03pm: Breeders&apos; Cup Turf Sprint result: 1. Mizdirection, 2. Unbridled&apos;s Note, 3. Reneesgotzip.  1.56pm: Aidan O&apos;Brien is being interviewed on the big screen in his trademark sunglasses. I&apos;ve often meant to ask him if he has lots of pairs of identical sunglasses, or whether he is just very good at looking after the one he has.  1.52pm: Starspangledbanner, the July Cup winner who failed to cut the mustard as a stallion, is the European runner here. He has the widest draw, but on Santa Anita&apos;s very odd downhill turf sprint track, that&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing, as they move to the right not long after the start. It would be one of the finest training performances that even Aidan O&apos;Brien has produced if Starspangledbanner comes back into the winners&apos; enclosure in 10 minutes&apos; time. His form since returning to training does not offer huge encouragement, though, and he is trading at 16-1 on track.  1.37pm: Next up here is the Turf Sprint, which marks the start of the Pick6 bet. I charted the British press corps&apos; romp to success in this bet in a live blog from this very spot four years ago, and while that was surely a once-in-a-lifetime afternoon, that&apos;s never likely to stop us trying to make it twice-in-a-lifetime.  The Turf Sprint looks a horrible race to start with, though. We&apos;ve got four runners in the perm, Corporate Jungle, Mizdirection, Unbridled&apos;s Note and Reneesgotzip, but it would be no surprise to go out immediately. Personally I&apos;d have taken out Mizdirection and put in the track-and-trip consistency of California Flag instead, but hey, what do I know?  1.22pm: Shackleford&apos;s race was as good as over when he stumbled coming out of the stalls. Tapizar was not the most obvious one to benefit, though, as he started at 15-1. Steve Asmussen is the winning trainer, Corey Nakatani the successful jockey. 1.18pm: Breeders&apos; Cup Dirt Mile result: 1. Tapizar, 2. Rail Trip, 3. Delegation.  1.14pm: Shackleford was distinctly boisterous in the paddock, though that&apos;s pretty much standard. Those such as my good friend and colleague Chris Cook who were concerned for his groom may like to know that he did at least pick up the best turned-out award.  1.09pm: Rajiv Maragh, Groupie Doll&apos;s jockey, is talking through the race in the interview room. &quot;You&apos;re the big favourite and expected to win, but you still have to get there. It&apos;s never easy until you pass the wire.  &quot;There were several scenarios that could have unfolded. One that I didn&apos;t want to see was Dust And Diamonds on an easy lead. When I saw that she wasn&apos;t, it let us sit back and be more patient. She&apos;s done that all year and now done that on the biggest stage. She is so consistent, she&apos;s obviously going to be champion.&quot; 1.05pm: Apologies for the short break, was writing up a longer report on George Vancouver&apos;s win which has now been filed and should be online soon.  Here it is 10 minutes to post for the Dirt Mile, with the runners coming out onto the track. Shackleford and Emcee - running for Godolphin&apos;s American arm and trainer Kiaran McLaughlin - are the joint-favourites at 5-2.  12.40pm: Very easy for the odds-on favourite, she was midfield behind a blistering pace and then took charge at the top of the stretch.  12.38pm: Breeders&apos; Cup Filly and Mare Sprint result: 1. Groupie Doll, 2. Dust And Diamonds, 3. Switch.  12.33pm: Not long to post time in the Filly and Mare Sprint, Groupie Doll is a hot favourite here at 3-5, with Dust And Diamonds next in the betting at 9-2.  12.32pm: O&apos;Brien feels George Vancouver is now in the reckoning for the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket next year, ground permitting.  &quot;He&apos;s a very good horse,&quot; O&apos;Brien said. &quot;His first two runs [with Joseph O&apos;Brien, his son, riding] were in very bad ground, then Joseph said we should go to DUndalk with him for the fast ground, and he won very easily. We knew that a mile would be fine for him even though he has loads of speed, but [fast] ground was what we were always hoping would make the difference.  &quot;Ryan rode him with real confidence, he had confidence in him from [riding him at] Deauville [in August] and he thought that this race and this track would really suit him. &quot;We always thought he could be a Guineas horse, ground is vital to him and today he showed that a mile is well within his compass next year, so we&apos;re delighted with him.&quot;  12.20pm Aidan O&apos;Brien and Ryan Moore are in the interview room.  &quot;The pace was quite steady in those races yesterday [the Juvenile Fillies&apos; Turf and Filly and Mare Turf],&quot; Moore said. &quot;When you go slow and all the horses are still travelling when you turn in, then it can be harder to find space, but you can make a bit more room when there&apos;s a bit more pace in the race.  &quot;I had a very smooth race, that&apos;s what you need in these sort of races. You need a bit of luck and things to work out for you and we had that today.&quot; 12.02pm: Good ride by Ryan Moore to take the Juvenile Turf on Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s George Vancouver, though it could be said that the only real difference between Moore&apos;s performance and those of Richard Hughes and William Buick on Friday was that he got a bit of luck. George Vancouver was travelling ominously well on the home turn, but was stuck on the rail just like Sky Lantern and The Fugue here yesterday. Halfway down the stretch, though, as James Doyle launched Dundonnell down the outside, Moore found a gap at just the right moment and grabbed his chance. George Vancouver quickened smartly, and though Noble Tune tried to run him down, Moore was not coming back.  The winner paid around 9-1 on the local PMU. Moore has just returned past the stands to the winner&apos;s enclosure, and from the look on his face, you wouldn&apos;t be able to tell whether he&apos;d just won a seller at Brighton or, as is actually the case, a race with a seven-figure purse. 11.53am: Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Turf result: 1. George Vancouver, 2. Noble Tune, 3. Balance The Books.  11.50am: Post time for the Juvenile Turf. Here we go for day two of the 29th Breeders&apos; Cup. Good luck to all, particularly the jockeys trying to weave their way around the tight inner turf track.  11.46am: They all looked pretty composed in the preliminaries, the sun is pretty high in the sky now but it&apos;s not quite as hot as it has been for some previous Breeders&apos; Cups here. There&apos;s a big crowd in Santa Anita&apos;s magnificent 1930s grandstand, and the atmosphere is really building.  11.44am: They are out on the track for the first Breeders&apos; Cup race, the Juvenile Turf. US-based Noble Tune is the narrow local favourite in the on-track betting, but most of the European challengers are relatively strong in the market. Dundonnell is 5-1, Artigiano is 7-1, George Vancouver is 9-1 and Fantastic Moon is 13-1.  11.27am: We are now about 20 minutes away from the first Breeders&apos; Cup race, still no scratches, and just time to thank the very excellent Jay Hovdey (a good man to follow on Twitter via @JayHovdey) for helping me to fill in a piece of my past.  Jay very kindly borrowed the Santa Anita form book from the main press room for me, as a result of which I can now say with certainty that my first trip to a racecourse anywhere in the world was on 18 October 1973, when I was eight years old.  I was in California on holiday, my dad was a racing fan and booked tickets for Santa Anita, and I&apos;ve always been able to remember the names of the horses he backed for me. Two minutes with the form book, and there they were: Moolah&apos;s Memory, an 80-1 chance that finished second-last, and Kings Flier, another outsider, who finished second and got me a chunky place dividend (which I spent on a new fishing reel). Jay, it turns out, would have been up in the press box that day as it was his first year out of college and he was just starting his career in racing. Thirty-nine years later, we&apos;re both here again, looking forward to another afternoon of action at this wonderful track.  Day two starts here 11.15am: It was a little before 8am when I arrived at Santa Anita racecourse this morning ahead of the second and most significant day of the Breeders&apos; Cup meeting and I can think of only one occasion in about 20 years as a racing reporter when I&apos;ve turned up at a track on a raceday any earlier than that. It was the Leopardstown Christmas meeting about eight years ago, the only flight I could get due to the festive rush was at about 5am from Gatwick and I got off the Aircoach at Leopardstown at about 7.15am. As I walked up to the track, it started to snow. It was freezing cold, I seemed to be the only person alive within 10 miles of the course, never mind awake, and I felt very, very alone. Which makes for something of a contrast with Santa Anita, where it is warm and cloudless, and there were plenty of people apparently onto their third or fourth beer of the morning by the time I turned up. The first race on the card here is at 10.05am local time and the first Breeders&apos; Cup race, the Juvenile Turf with Dundonnell, George Vancouver, Artigiano and Lines Of Battle going for Europe, is at 11.50am local, which is 18.50pm GMT. There are nine races on the card in all, culminating in the $5m Classic at 00.35am GMT, but the climax from a European perspective will be the preceding Mile, at 23.40pm GMT. Excelebration, so often the supporting act to Frankel but a top-notch miler in his own right, goes for Aidan O&apos;Brien while Moonlight Cloud represents Freddy Head, who won this race three times as a trainer with Goldikova and twice as a jockey on Miesque. Wise Dan, the best horse in north American on any surface according to Timeform, is the obvious danger. Tips for today&apos;s racing can be found here and a feature on the Breeders&apos; Cup&apos;s decision to ban the use of the anti-bleeding drug Lasix from the two-year-old races this year, and all the races next year, is here. There are no non-runners as yet in the Breeders&apos; Cup events, the main track is officially fast, while the turf course is firm. Everything seems in place for a great day&apos;s racing, in fact, at the most international event of the season. I even managed to sweet-talk the server at the Clocker&apos;s Corner canteen into making me a bacon-and-egg sandwich five minutes after it had officially closed, which takes some doing. &quot;OK, English,&quot; she said as she finally caved in. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want you telling the Queen on me, would I?&quot; The best news of all is that a password-protected wifi network called &quot;Media&quot; appeared on my list five minutes ago, which isn&apos;t working yet but might just mean that the farcical scenes of Friday may not be repeated this afternoon. Grown men and women were weeping into their keyboards with frustration as they tried to file blogs and copy to media organisations around the world using Santa Anita&apos;s open, public wifi network. It did not seem to have occurred to anyone at the Breeders&apos; Cup that, with every smartphone in every spectator&apos;s pocket trying to log itself on to this network automatically, it might prove difficult for us workers to do the same. If &quot;Media&quot; comes to the rescue, I&apos;ll be firing updates into this blog from around an hour before the first race as fast as my fingers (and print deadlines) allow. I&apos;ll try to push the button on 1-2-3s within 15 seconds of confirmation \u2013 beat that, Racing Post \u2013 and get quotes from connections and so on online direct from the interview room where possible. If we end up back on SA_Public_Wifi, the agent of Friday&apos;s misery, then all bets are off.

The freshly minted US Open champion arrives in London via Paris, where he was put out of his stride when losing for the third time in a row after holding match point (eight in all), a statistic he was at pains to put in context on Saturday ahead of his opening match on Monday against Tomas Berdych at the start of the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. The world No6 has inconvenienced him before but he was no match for his inventiveness in an absurdly wind-blown semi-final at Flushing Meadows, a memory that pleases Murray. Yet it was always asking a lot for him to carry the zest and sharpness of a major (where Novak Djokovic fell before him in the final), into the concluding stages of the Tour when he had already qualified for this tournament. &quot;I am aware how hard it is to finish matches off,&quot; Murray said of his recent blips. &quot;Some times it is going to go very well, some times it is not. Last week, I don&apos;t think I was focused as hard as I needed to be [when losing to the Pole from nowhere, Jerzy Janowicz].&quot; However, coming on the back of comments he made on the Asian swing of the Tour to the effect that he regards himself as an uncompromising front-runner, losing to Milos Raonic in Tokyo, Djokovic in Shanghai then Janowicz with victory all but in his pocket each time is at least cause for minor concern, despite his otherwise excellent form. Had he not closed out that dramatic New York final against Djokovic to break the most onerous hoodoo in British sport, Murray would be in a considerably more difficult place coming into the final tournament of the year, at least in the perceptions of an unforgiving media. But he trusted his talent and his legs to secure his greatest win and is determined to rediscover some of that energy before his Christmas break. Once this tournament is done, he will collapse in a dignified heap at the feet of the nearest back specialist to fix a chronic complaint that has some of its origins in the injury that forced his withdrawal from this tournament a year ago. With Ivan Lendl back at his side at the end of a long, physically draining and garlanded season, focus ought to be the least of the Scot&apos;s worries. It was not so much that Murray did not see the little-known but not so little Janowicz coming at Bercy (at 6ft 8in, the Pole is hard to miss); he has, after all, suffered against other lesser lights in a past thought to be well behind him. Yet modern tennis is such an intense undertaking, grief can arrive in seconds. From a distance, it seemed he was not alone among the game&apos;s leading players in blinking at the wrong time in Paris. So Murray might just feel more comfortable with his peers on home soil, especially given his conqueror&apos;s subsequent giant-killing of Janko Tipsarevic, followed by a less surprising win over the unseeded Gilles Simon on Saturday, to reach the final of the BNP Paribas Masters against David Ferrer. Janowicz broke into the top 30 from 69 in the world with that two-set win over the Frenchman and becomes the first qualifier to reach an ATP 1000 final in seven years. Unlike the world No100, Lukas Rosol, who shocked the ailing Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon with a one-off performance, Janowicz, at 21, seems to have substance to his game. In that context, Murray&apos;s loss to him in three sets can be viewed as a hiccup rather than a full-blown embarrassment. After the rising of the sans-culottes in Paris, he is, after all, sharing space in a tumbril filled with the bodies of the chastened elite, among them Berdych, eliminated by Simon, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Tipsarevic, who also lost to Janowicz. Add to that the wounded Roger Federer, absent in Paris but probably still fuming after losing to Djokovic in Basel the week before. Federer surrendered his world No1 ranking to the Serb in that match and cannot get it back until next year, a fierce blow to the Wimbledon champion&apos;s self-esteem after a fulfilling 2012. There is a lot of wounded pride on both sides of the draw, some of it self-inflicted, much of it down to the physical demands of 11 tough months of tennis, and just a little because a couple of upstarts at the penultimate tournament decided not to roll over in the presence of greatness. In the other match on Monday, Djokovic plays Tsonga in the evening. The draw pitched Murray into the A Group alongside Djokovic, Berdych and Tsonga (seeded 7). On the other side are Federer, the defending champion, fourth seed David Ferrer, Ddel Potro (6) and Tipsarevic (8). It matters little. Getting through the round-robin is tough, although there are judgments to be made. As Murray pointed out, Federer is supreme indoors on a hard court and Del Potro is taking a shine to the surface too, preferring Europe inside in the early winter to the clay of south America. (He is worth a bet here.) It was pointed out, redundantly, to Murray that a British player has never won this tournament. Those who had forgotten Fred Perry&apos;s heroics of the 30s were saying the same thing in New York until recently.

Ryan Moore, the winner&apos;s jockey, enjoyed a little more luck in running than Richard Hughes and William Buick on the beaten favourites Sky Lantern and The Fugue on Friday, and that made all the difference as George Vancouver was able to stamp his class on the race and beat the US-based runners Noble Tune and Balance The Books. Dundonnell, trained by Roger Charlton and ridden by James Doyle, launched a challenge at the top of the stretch but faded to fourth, while Godolphin&apos;s Artigiano, from Mahmood al-Zarooni&apos;s yard in Newmarket, was sixth. Moore was travelling well on the home turn but, like Buick and Hughes, he was against the rail and in need of running room. The pace in the race had been generous from the start, however, thinning the field slightly and offering him a little more space to work with. Moore got the split he needed around the furlong pole, and George Vancouver quickened immediately into a decisive lead. &quot;Ryan gave him a super ride and he has been crying out for fast ground all year,&quot; O&apos;Brien said. &quot;His dad [Henrythenavigator] was the same, and all the Henrys [sons of Henrythenavigator] have been the same, and we have been destroyed with soft ground in England all year. &quot;His first two runs [with Joseph O&apos;Brien, the trainer&apos;s son, riding] were in very bad ground, then Joseph said we should go to [the all-weather track at] Dundalk with him for the fast ground and he won very easily. &quot;We knew that a mile would be fine for him, even though he has loads of speed, but ground was what we were always hoping would make the difference. Ryan rode him with real confidence, he had confidence in him from [riding him at] Deauville [in August] and he thought that this race and this track would really suit him.&quot; This was O&apos;Brien&apos;s seventh Breeders&apos; Cup success and a fourth for Moore, the pair having won the same race 12 months ago with Wrote. &quot;The whole way around, I was able to save him up,&quot; Moore said. &quot;He travelled very easy and he had a small gap but there was that much more there that he had plenty to go through and actually I was in front a little bit too soon on him. &quot;Yesterday, when horses were steady in those races, horses were still travelling turning in and that&apos;s when it&apos;s hard to find more room. There was a bit of pace today and you can make a bit more room for yourself when you have a bit more pace in the race.&quot; George Vancouver may now be prepared with next year&apos;s 2,000 Guineas in mind, though the ground would need to be fast for him to show his best form. &quot;We always thought he could be a Guineas horse,&quot; O&apos;Brien said. &quot;Ground is vital to him and today he showed that a mile is well within his compass next year, so we&apos;re delighted with him.&quot; Starspangledbanner, a former winner of the July Cup and Golden Jubilee Stakes, ran an excellent race for O&apos;Brien in the Turf Sprint, but he could not maintain a searing early pace all the way to the line and faded in the closing stages to finish 10th behind Mizdirection. &quot;I said to Joseph, if he&apos;s rocking, let him rock,&quot; O&apos;Brien said. &quot;His best performances have been over five and six furlongs, so maybe this six-and-a-half is just a bit too far, but we can have some fun with him next year.&quot; Rosie Napravnik became only the second female jockey to ride a winner at the Breeders&apos; Cup meeting with a brilliant performance on Shanghai Bobby in the Juvenile.

In 1971, after more than 18 months of work, the Roskill commission recommended that a four-runway airport to serve London be built at Cublington, near Aylesbury. When Michael Noble, then minister for trade, opened the debate on the commission&apos;s findings in the Commons, he said of its authors: &quot;I hope that they may draw some comfort from one of my hon friends who said that the fact that he totally rejected their conclusion did not in any way diminish his admiration for the way in which they had done their work and presented their report.&quot; Their plan, of course, never got off the drawing board. Committing the Conservatives to blocking a third runway at Heathrow was a key plank of David Cameron&apos;s strategy to detoxify the Tory brand and prove that he would put polar bears before sharp-suited businessmen. It was also built on political expediency \u2013 he needed to win Conservative seats in the area. Further, it was a recognition that the building of a third runway would hurt Britain&apos;s then leading role in reducing global carbon emissions But with the economy trapped in a deep malaise Cameron is having a rethink. There is a strong lobby that suggests that UK plc needs extra airport capacity in order to boost future economic prospects. Also, the UK is on track to meet its Kyoto targets, albeit partly because of economic weakness. There is, too, an argument that the tax system may be a better way of reducing the number of unnecessary flights than a ban on building new runways. Flight travel is simply too cheap compared with rail fares \u2013 this is the fault of a tax system that gives an advantage to airlines. George Osborne now firmly believes that if the UK really wants to build an economy that can properly connect with the rest of the world it needs more airport capacity. But the economic case is being driven largely by self-interested parties, not least British Airways, the British Airports Authority and the bodies that represent them. It will be a crucial part of the Davies commission to identify the economic benefits a new airport or runway would deliver. Multinational companies make inward investment decisions on the basis of a whole range of factors, including the skills of the workforce, the strength of the currency and the generosity of state support for industry. Whether the chief executive can jet in direct from Chicago or Shanghai may be a marginal consideration. However, those advocating the development of a hub airport may have a case. If Britain allows its one airport that comes close to being an international hub to become ever more clogged up while Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Madrid and Paris become transit points for Europeans, including enterprising Brits, wanting to get to the fast-growing economies of China, India or Brazil, there is a risk that economic opportunities will be missed, ambitions stunted, jobs lost. However, if any British government is to press the case for extra airport capacity, it needs to make a convincing case for continuing to meet its ambitious carbon emissions target. As this paper said in 2008: &quot;It will require a radical programme of wave and wind turbine construction, nuclear industry expansion and the building of underground vaults to store the carbon dioxide that currently pours from the nation&apos;s coal, oil and gas power plants.&quot; Unfortunately, there is absolutely no evidence that this government&apos;s energy policy is fit for that purpose. Indeed the government&apos;s desire to pursue a dash for gas as a future energy strategy is precisely the wrong direction of travel. Even if the case for a hub airport is established, Heathrow is not the only answer: Heathrow already creates all-but-unbearable noise, pollution and disruption for unlucky residents, and its transport links are groaning. Of those affected by noise pollution in Europe, 30% live in and around Heathrow. Is it really sensible to build more airline capacity in the middle of a major population centre? There is a plausible case that bringing in as many planes as possible \u2013 the proposed estuary airport \u2013 over sea instead of hundreds of thousands of rooftops makes more sense. As importantly, a giant new airport would provide a powerful economic boost for an area where unemployment is high. Although characterised, until now, as a Boris Johnson vanity project, there is support from politicians of all persuasions to the east of London to try and create a hub \u2013 in all senses \u2013 which would address the historical inequalities and poverty to the east of the capital. There is no easy solution. Davies will need wisdom and a good dose of political nous to weigh up the issues \u2013 the financial and environmental costs and any economic advantages. He should use his authority to seize the initiative and insist that the question of airport capacity in the UK be settled sooner rather than later.

Had Fort Larned&apos;s determination faltered even for a moment, Mucho Macho Man would have brushed him aside but he held on to a narrow lead all the way to the line. Earlier there was Shanghai Bobby, who looked beaten for all money in the Juvenile when the pack advanced to swallow him up, yet somehow he rallied to keep them at bay. And, though it was painful for the Europeans, Wise Dan&apos;s course-record run to victory in the Mile, ahead of Excelebration and Moonlight Cloud, was another outstanding individual performance in a season that has already seen plenty. Among the riders Mike Smith became the most successful jockey in Breeders&apos; Cup history thanks to his win on Royal Delta in Friday&apos;s feature, the Ladies&apos; Classic, and Brian Hernandez, Fort Larned&apos;s rider, recorded his first victory at the meeting in its most important race, and on his birthday too. Rosie Napravnik was the best story of all, though, as the leading female rider in the United States may now have a chance to become the first woman to win the Kentucky Derby, assuming Shanghai Bobby gets to post for the Run For The Roses next year. With attention focused on Napravnik after the Juvenile, however, one point that was perhaps overlooked is that Shanghai Bobby not only produced one of the most courageous victories in the history of this race, but that he did it without the assistance of Lasix. The ban on the use of race-day medication over the course of the 2012 and 2013 Breeders&apos; Cup meetings, starting with the two-year-old races at this year&apos;s event, is a source of anger and frustration for many American trainers. In Europe the administration of Lasix, which helps to prevent horses from bleeding in their lungs at moments of maximum effort, is baffling to many since we, and the rest of the racing world, get along fine without it. In America, however, there is scarcely a trainer left who can remember a time before the use of Lasix became standard practice for pretty much any given horse, on any given day. Every single older horse which ran at Santa Anita on Saturday, including European-trained visitors like Excelebration, Moonlight Cloud and Starspangledbanner, was &quot;treated&quot; with Lasix before racing. Next year, though, assuming that the Breeders&apos; Cup organisation stands its ground, the (L) on the racecard that marks a dose of Lasix will, in the case of almost every local horse, be replaced by (LX), to show that it raced on Lasix last time out and is coming off the drug for the Cup. Lasix is so deeply ingrained in the American sport that a medication-free meeting in 2013 will be one of the more significant moments in the history of US racing. Shanghai Bobby&apos;s race seemed to offer hope that coming off the drugs might not be too difficult after all. But Mark Casse, a Canadian-based trainer who has been one of the most outspoken critics of the Lasix ban, would not agree. Spring In The Air, his runner in the Juvenile Fillies&apos; on Friday, bled during the race and Casse was later quoted as saying that, while he had been &quot;disappointed&quot; by the Lasix ban before the meeting, he is now &quot;just downright mad&quot;. Casse looked ahead to next year, too. &quot;You go doing that to the older horses, who knows what&apos;s going to happen?&quot; he said. &quot;Twice I&apos;ve seen horses fall and collapse from bleeding too badly. Isn&apos;t that going to be nice? Will they be really proud a horse falls and kills a rider or kills some other horses?&quot; It is worth noting that Casse also suggested that the filly&apos;s owner &quot;considered&quot; withdrawing his runner Dynamic Sky from the Juvenile on Saturday \u2013 but in the end, decided to run. A two million dollar purse that has been a target all season is a difficult thing to duck on a matter of principle. The debate will continue, however, over the next 12 months, raging ever more fiercely as the 30th Breeders&apos; Cup approaches. From the perspective of racing as a whole the hope must be that within three or four years everyone will start to wonder what all the fuss was about. The Cup races will have winners, those winners will have foals and the long, slow process of breeding out Lasix-dependency from the US thoroughbred will have started. The road from here to there, however, may well be a painful and tortuous one.", "tags": ["Breeders' Cup", "Horse racing", "Sport", "US sports"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-04T17:35:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/04/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-new-era", "sentences": ["When Murray \u2013 who conquered Djokovic so memorably in New York for his breakthrough slam \u2013 was asked if this sharing of the spoils, as well as the recent upsets of the game&apos;s elite in Tokyo, Shanghai, Basel and Paris, provided convincing evidence of sustainable change, he demurred, although he clearly relishes his jousts with Djokovic.", "I was incredibly focused in Shanghai [against Djokovic] and just did not manage to get it."], "title": "Are Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic ready to confirm a new era?", "article": "Rafael Nadal ought to be limbering up in Greenwich in anticipation of a much anticipated comeback from knee injuries that might yet cruelly shorten his glittering career. Instead, the Spaniard wisely chose to sit out the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, the end-of-season gathering of the game&apos;s best eight players, to give his 26-year-old bones the longest rest they have had from the game since his suspect ankles first sent distress signals to the rest of his legs in 2005. So much has happened in that time. Nadal established himself as the greatest clay-courter of them all and engaged in a personal duel with Roger Federer that enthralled the public and froze out their rivals from all but a handful of the biggest prizes. They might resume proceedings at the Australian Open in January, but, for the first time, there are genuine doubts about their hegemony, voiced most recently by Boris Becker. Forecasting a power shift in tennis is a fraught exercise, confounded by the flickering genius of Nadal and Federer, but the signs are building at the end of the most unpredictable year in the men&apos;s game since 2003 that Becker might have got it right: the new heavyweights are Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic. That is not to disregard the man with 17 grand slam titles, of course, and Federer&apos;s enduring thirst for glory will be manifest again when he begins the defence of his title in Greenwich this week. Indeed, when one writer suggested last week that the 31-year-old darling of the tennis fancy might be showing evidence of slippage after losing to Juan-Martin Del Potro in Basel two weeks ago, he was buried in opprobrium from incensed bloggers and tweeters. When seven of the eight players were introduced to diners at a charity dinner at the High Court in London on Saturday night, it was clear Federer will never lack for admirers. Murray and Djokovic \u2013 two of four different slam winners this year, alongside their more decorated peers \u2013 are understandably cautious about subscribing to the revolution. When Murray \u2013 who conquered Djokovic so memorably in New York for his breakthrough slam \u2013 was asked if this sharing of the spoils, as well as the recent upsets of the game&apos;s elite in Tokyo, Shanghai, Basel and Paris, provided convincing evidence of sustainable change, he demurred, although he clearly relishes his jousts with Djokovic. &quot;Nearly all the matches I have played with him this year have been incredibly close,&quot; he said. &quot;The two matches at Dubai and Miami were not that close but all of the other ones could have gone either way, including the one at the Olympics. There were a lot of long games and, in the second set especially, he had chances. &quot;The US Open, the Australian Open, they were so close. I would not say either one of us has especially had the upper hand this year. They have been incredibly physical matches, very, very tough. I hope it is the same again this week.&quot; So, is this the new era of tennis? &quot;It might be a bit too soon to say that. I think the rankings would suggest that it has not changed too much. Over the past few years, a lot of players have been at the top of their games ... obviously, [David] Ferrer, [Tomas] Berdych, [Janko] Tipsarevic. All of the guys that have been coming through in the last couple of years have been of a similar style of play. They have been huge guys, with big games, big serves, who have caused numerous upsets but have maybe lacked a bit of consistency to make that final breakthrough to the top eight. &quot;To me, [Federer losing to Del Potro in Basel] is not a major surprise. When it happens in the slams, when that starts happening more regularly in the slams, that is when you would see that guys are making a big breakthrough.&quot; Murray has had challenges of his own to deal with, not the least of them giving up eight match points in three recent defeats. &quot;I know that stuff can happen to anyone. I was incredibly focused in Shanghai [against Djokovic] and just did not manage to get it. I think I had one on my serve. &quot;Against [Milos] Raonic in Tokyo, against one of the biggest servers in the game, that was also on his serve. The one that is disappointing for me is last week [losing to the Polish qualifier Jerzy Janowicz in Paris], because I just rushed and wasn&apos;t thinking really. I thought the match was won. I don&apos;t think I will take anything granted here, that&apos;s for sure.&quot; Between January, 2002, and September, 2003, tennis had eight different grand slam title winners, a period commonly characterised as &quot;The Window&quot;.

In contrast to those strongly contested events, however, this was a bloodless coup, Ghizao easily beating one other finisher after his main rival, Kumbeshwar, had fallen early on. On this day last year Ghizao was well fancied for the Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter but performed disappointingly and fared no better thereafter. He was achieving his first success in almost two years, having started third-favourite for the 2011 Arkle. &quot;It&apos;s just what that horse wanted. He had a few issues last year,&quot; said Dan Skelton, Nicholls&apos; assistant. &quot;It was to do with recauterising his palette and then he had a vein/arterial problem. Life was very complicated for him for a while. This turned into a bit of a non-event, we still don&apos;t know what sort of level of form we&apos;re at and we haven&apos;t really got a plan.&quot; Ghizao is one of eight Nicholls entrants in the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham a week on Saturday but Skelton would not be drawn on whether he was likely to run. The yard&apos;s other runner on this card, Black Thunder, faded as though in need of the run and there is just a suspicion that the same might be true of Edgardo Sol, Nicholls&apos; representative in Exeter&apos;s big race on Tuesday. &quot;Last year he took a run before he won, then he only just won and then he improved massively,&quot; Skelton recalled. &quot;Whether that&apos;s part of his profile, wanting his first run, we&apos;ll see tomorrow, but we&apos;ve done as much as we can with him, bearing in mind there is a long season ahead.&quot; Perhaps a more significant runner for Nicholls on Tuesday is Hinterland, a 16-1 shot for the Arkle, who makes his fencing debut. The trainer says he has schooled well. It was a good day for professionals from other sports here, as Golden Hoof, part-owned by the golfer Lee Westwood, won the opener and the Leicester Tigers prop Martin Castrogiovanni has a share in the promising Lisheen Hill, fourth in the second race. Westwood, who could not hold on to his lead in the WGC Champions event in China over the weekend, was represented by his agent, Chubby Chandler, who shares in the golfer&apos;s ownership of various horses. &quot;We&apos;re very much mug punters,&quot; he said. &quot;We get put into the right horses because of who Lee is, so when Nicky [Henderson, the trainer] finds us a couple of horses, you&apos;re pretty certain they&apos;re going to be all right. We put 10 or 15 grand into bits [of horses] and we always think we own them anyway. It&apos;s good for us to have a hobby. &quot;We&apos;ve not had many winners but we had one in South Africa on Saturday. They come along like London buses.&quot; Chandler appears to expect another good showing when Ballyalton, given by Westwood to his father for Christmas, makes his hurdling debut at Southwell next Monday. Chandler made a point of praising Tony McCoy, one of the beaten jockeys in Golden Hoof&apos;s race, just for turning up, his face still heavily plastered after being kicked by a horse at Wetherby on Friday. &quot;That just shows what he&apos;s like,&quot; Chandler marvelled. &quot;Just amazing, absolutely amazing.

From the Czech&apos;s side of the net Murray \u2013 bouncing from foot to foot, swivelling his torso side to side in mid-air, eyes blazing, nostrils flared \u2013 must have looked like the original Raging Bull. But it is a fair bet that his coach Ivan Lendl, court-side for the first time since the US Open and inscrutable as ever, will have viewed Murray&apos;s body language with all the affection Al Silvani reserved for Jake LaMotta on those nights in the Garden when all was straight. Murray has not been this pumped up since the fifth set at Flushing Meadows this summer when he bullied an exhausted Novak Djokovic from tramline to tramline to win his first slam title. He has faltered here and there since in less glamorous surroundings but, in sight of the season&apos;s end, the adrenaline looks to be flowing again. In a packed arena hotter than a desert tent Murray was a ball of pugnacity when it mattered. If the crowd did not sustain the energy of the standing ovation they afforded their new hero on his entry, it was partly due, surely, to the warm air pumped into the room to kill the November chill. He took two hours and eight minutes to knock out Berdych, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, starting fast, losing his way, then finishing strongly, a pattern familiar to his caravan of chroniclers. Murray plays on Wednesday against Djokovic, who beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6, 6-3 in the evening match. It was tight most of the way, with sustained passages of excellence, and Murray will probably have a tougher time of it than when he rolled the Serb at the Olympics. Murray conceded after beating Berdych that blowing eight match points in three recent defeats concentrated his mind in the final moments on Monday. &quot;I was thinking the reasons why that had happened,&quot; he said. &quot;The match against Djokovic in Shanghai [when he lost in the final after holding five match points], I didn&apos;t feel like I did loads wrong. The one last week [losing to the 69th-ranked Pole Jerzy Janowicz in Paris], I said I was disappointed with. I rushed, didn&apos;t concentrate and focus as hard as I needed to. That was why I got broken. So today I focused on every point. I got myself pumped up. I took my time and served it out well.&quot; If there was cause to celebrate, there was room, too, for pause to analyse. While Murray&apos;s first-serve accuracy of 55% dipped below the accepted norm, he still managed to win every point on that first delivery in the deciding set, as Berdych&apos;s spirit and focus faded. Perhaps more significantly, 11 of Murray&apos;s clean winners came on the forehand, his new knockout punch, and only two from his trusty backhand. The first of those backhands arrived on his opening strike of the match, a devastating howitzer down the line off a second serve, and most of the subsequent signs in the early exchanges pointed to a routine win, as Murray&apos;s Czech opponent scrambled to save five break points in the first 25 minutes. But the switch went off in Murray&apos;s head. He dropped serve in the sixth game with a limp forehand into the net and let Berdych escape to 5-2 before regrouping, then coming again in the second set. The mood and tempo (but not the temperature) changed radically as Berdych cranked his power up in a mild panic and blew a couple of break points in the first two games. &quot;The biggest moment,&quot; Berdych said later, &quot;was at 1-1 when I had break point and hit a forehand just out. Who knows? An early break after winning the first set \u2026&quot; It was that indiscretion that revived Murray, who moved with conviction to 4-1. After 45 minutes, eight minutes longer than the torpor of the first set, he had drawn level. The numbers suggested Berdych might be favoured to close it out in the third; coming into the tournament, he was 12-6 this year in deciding sets, compared with Murray&apos;s 9-7 (2-3 since the US Open). Counterbalancing that statistic, this was also Murray&apos;s 12th win this year from a set down, &quot;comebackability&quot; matched only by Roger Federer. But this game is not all about numbers. The rhythm, disjointed as it was, favoured Murray&apos;s adaptability, invoking memories of how he made subtle shifts of power and placement to control the howling gale that roared through their semi-final at the US Open. There was not a whisper of a breeze inside the humid cauldron here, yet no lack of sweat-making moments. When Murray broke to go 2-1 up a quarter of an hour into the third set Berdych&apos;s ever-solemn features told a tale of missed opportunities.

Now he enjoys a free lunch with classmates. Like tens of millions of households in China, his family are farmers who live on meagre profits from the crops they can spare and wages sent back by relatives working in cities hundreds of miles away. In a land now dotted with skyscrapers and designer stores, they are scraping by in one of the poorest areas, a remote part of south-western Guizhou province. As others prosper, they fall further behind. Yet in the past decade, a string of measures have offered some relief: the abolition of agricultural tax and tuition fees, the rolling out of medical insurance that reimburses most of their bills, a 55-yuan monthly (\u00a35.50) pension for Zhao&apos;s grandfather, and now the school lunches. &quot;Compared to rich people, our life is not that good \u2013 but it is much better than before,&quot; said Zhao&apos;s grandmother, Xu Zuxian. As China prepares for its leadership transition, state media hail a &quot;golden decade&quot; under the incumbents. Critics call it a lost decade, rife with wasted opportunities for the economic, social and political reforms the country needs. They say Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao have maintained high growth \u2013 not an insignificant achievement, given the wider global economic woes \u2013 but failed to tackle the problems now accumulating thanks to that model. Yet others believe that for all the disappointments, the administration is leaving behind what could yet prove a significant political legacy: building the skeleton of a welfare state and attempting to put a shelf below those at the bottom of society. &quot;The government invested a lot of money in ordinary people&apos;s living standards \u2026 China is starting to enter the &apos;welfare China&apos; stage, although it is still at quite a low level,&quot; noted Beijing-based scholar Deng Yuwen, in many ways an outspoken critic of the authorities&apos; record. Wang Dewen, social protection economist with the World Bank in Beijing, added: &quot;The government has done a great job.&quot; At the beginning, the social insurance programme targeted urban workers, but it gradually extended to migrant workers and introduced rural medical insurance and pension programmes. &quot;They have set up ambitious objectives \u2026 They have mobilised resources from the whole society to achieve them.&quot; A decade ago, 147 million urban employees and 55 million rural residents had pension coverage. Now 229 million urban employees are covered, and 449 million rural and urban residents; 124 million are already receiving payments. A few years ago, barely 20% of rural dwellers had medical insurance; now 96% of the population are covered. While inequality has soared over the past decade \u2013 the gap between town and country has expanded, with rural dwellers enjoying less than a third of average urban incomes on official measures and perhaps as little as a fifth according to experts \u2013 research by Tony Saich of Harvard University found that satisfaction with the government had actually gone up between 2003 and 2011. Strikingly, significant increases were seen among the poorest and the wealthiest. &quot;When we started, those in the poorest categories were least satisfied with the local government,&quot; Saich said. &quot;That&apos;s where I think things like the dibao [a subsidy for the poorest] and some kind of medical insurance have improved their view.&quot; How much credit Hu and Wen deserve is a matter of opinion; their predecessors began some programmes and other leaders would presumably have sought to address the problems that emerged with China&apos;s development. &quot;But you also have to look at the individuals,&quot; said Saich. &quot;Hu has not spent most of his career in the glitziest parts of Shanghai and Beijing; he&apos;s been in quite poor areas \u2026 [I once heard] Wen say: &apos;I can&apos;t guarantee that I&apos;ve been to every county in China, but I can guarantee that I&apos;ve been to every poor county.&apos;&quot; The significance of their legacy will depend on how their successors build upon it. &quot;There&apos;s been a foundation, but there is a long way to go,&quot; said Dorothy Solinger of the University of California Irvine. As an expert on the dibao, she points out: &quot;The whole programme remains miserable and very, very stingy.&quot; The urban expansion of the dibao was made under the previous leaders, she notes, and the urban poverty line \u2013 which is set in each city \u2013 worked out nationally at 15% of urban average disposable income last year, down from the high 20s a decade ago. Even at existing payment levels, there are obvious funding problems. The pensions of current retirees are being paid by new workers, for instance, said David Kelly, research director of Beijing-based consultancy China Policy \u2013 and the demographics are working against the system. China is ageing rapidly and its workforce is shrinking. In 2000, there were six workers for every person over 60. By 2030, there will be barely two. Authorities must also address broader issues. Corruption and incompetence need to be tackled to ensure funds reach their intended beneficiaries: &quot;There are already cases of fraud and fingers in the till,&quot; warned Kelly. Many also believe that creating a proper welfare state will require a long-awaited overhaul of the hukou, the household registration system that defines people as urban or rural and allocates their rights to services such as education accordingly. At present migrants \u2013 and their children, who inherit their parents&apos; status \u2013 in effect become second-class citizens in cities. &quot;It&apos;s the hardest thing to touch because it involves popular sentiment. City dwellers don&apos;t want a wave of people coming to share the same benefits as them,&quot; warned Kelly.

It&apos;s so obviously immoral that you could easily assume this was a malevolent, Shirley Porter-style episode from the height of Thatcherism. It is, instead, the policy of a local authority that has 60 Labour councillors out of 60 and a high-profile Labour mayor \u2013 a one-party state. The London borough of Newham \u2013 the borough in question \u2013 recently made the news when it transpired they had asked a housing association in Stoke-on-Trent to rehouse hundreds of those on its massive waiting list. The association refused, but it was unclear what the leaked request really meant \u2013 was this political theatre on the part of the Labour council, drawing attention to what Tory policy was forcing it to do? That was what Sir Robin Wales, the mayor of Newham, claimed. Or was it a desperate response by a cash-strapped local authority that hoped nobody would notice? Anyone who knows the borough well might be inclined to think it was something else \u2013 the continuation of a policy of gradually forcing out poorer residents in favour of affluent incomers. Newham would hardly be alone in that, as councils from Southwark to Manchester spent the 2000s eagerly rebranding themselves as business-friendly metropoles \u2013 but few looked quite so enthusiastic. Newham is the sixth poorest borough in England, but since the 1980s it has also played host to part of London&apos;s docklands \u2013 namely the new developments on the former Royal Docks, such as the ExCeL centre, City airport, Barrier Point and innumerable &quot;quayside&quot; luxury flats, enjoying water in front and the flightpath above. As if to make its allegiance to the new Newham clear, in 2007 the council moved its headquarters to the Royal Docks, to an immense, business park-like PFI hangar, at a safe distance from any but the most executive residential areas. It&apos;s closer to City airport&apos;s runway than the high streets of West Ham, Stratford or Forest Gate. Newham is also a borough that has seen the building of huge quantities of new housing in recent years. It&apos;s in two distinct parts. Along Stratford High Street, a sub-Shanghai speculative skyline has taken shape on both sides of a dual carriageway, with hundreds of new units of tiny flats, most of them quickly snapped up by buy-to-let investors, many of whom were based, aptly enough, in China. The other is the Olympic Village \u2013 most of the Olympic venues were in Newham. This is a somewhat better-planned enclave, currently closed to the public while it is transformed into flats courtesy of its new owners, Qatari Diar. Newham might want to shift its tenants to the Potteries, but it has enough new, often publicly funded, housing to clear its waiting list. The Olympics&apos; building project was 80% state-funded, which is worth remembering when we&apos;re told that we &quot;can&apos;t afford&quot; new council housing anymore \u2013 can&apos;t afford, even, to maintain what there is of it left. Which brings us to the exchange of council estate for Russell Group campus. The Carpenters Estate, a development of terraces and flats built in the 1960s, is right in the midst of the new high-rise clusters of Stratford High Street, many of which dwarf the old towers. Like other estates in newly lucrative areas, it is midway through being &quot;decanted&quot;, with no guarantee of social, let alone council, housing on the residential parts of the new campus \u2013 which will be for UCL. This is one of the richest and most powerful universities in the country, with some of the strictest access criteria \u2013 so it is hardly likely to be &quot;inclusive&quot; for the local poor, if there will be any left in the immediate area afterwards. Here in Stratford, all the usual reasons for destroying council housing fall apart. How to argue it&apos;s for the residents&apos; own good when local campaigners fiercely oppose it? How to claim high-rise living is unviable and undesirable when dozens of new high-rises are being built all around it? How to claim clearance is for the residents&apos; own good when the blocks are structurally sound? How to claim the area needs to be more &quot;diverse&quot; when it&apos;s one of the most multiracial places in the world? How to claim there&apos;s no money, when the publicly funded Olympic Village is only up the road? How to claim refurbishment of the estate would be too expensive when the recent refurbishment of Newham&apos;s dockside HQ cost \u00a3111m? How to avoid the conclusion that Newham wants one kind of people out, and another kind of people in? That raises another question: why? For UCL, it&apos;s a no-brainer \u2013 a place with far cheaper rent than Bloomsbury, good links to the sundry &quot;hubs&quot; of Docklands and even an international rail connection. But what&apos;s in it for Newham? Unlike Shirley Porter&apos;s reign in 80s Westminster, the council can hardly be driven by electoral arithmetic, given that the old tenants are more likely to vote Labour than UCL students or Canary Wharf clerks. It&apos;s just the done thing, the common sense of contemporary local government. We might wonder what it would take to shock Labour councils out of this kind of casual, glazed-eyed Thatcherism.

In their seventh contest of the year, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic hit more highs and lows than a doo-wop band, and it was no less entertaining for that. This post Federer-Nadal shootout has the key ingredient of any genuine sporting head-to-head: uncertainty. There was plenty of it in Wednesday&apos;s match, which Djokovic won at the death, and there is no shortage of it every time they step on to a court. Pressed to back judgment with money, the prevailing sentiment might be with Murray on his favourite surface, indoors on a hard court \u2013 yet he lost to him the only other time they had met in such conditions, in Madrid five years ago \u2013 and anybody&apos;s guess on clay or grass. Under the lovely riverside tent in Greenwich, Djokovic won 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 in just over two-and-a-half hours to take a 2-0 winning log into the third and final match of the Group A round robin of the World Tour Finals against Tomas Berdych on Friday. He leads Murray 10-7 overall, 4-3 for 2012. Murray, who beat Berdych comfortably enough in the first round, must defeat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Djokovic&apos;s first-round victim, in his final match, but there remains the wickedly slim possibility that the maths could yet exclude him from the semi-finals. So, they left the O2 Arena in contrasting spirits, the winning Serb exalting in the continued flowering of their personal duel at the summit of the game, the losing Scot struggling to come to terms with 44 unforced errors and a return to the growl-and-despair mien that blighted his development en route to that unforgettable win over Djokovic in the final of the US Open. Berdych beat Tsonga 7-5, 3-6, 6-1 in the night match \u2013 and that put a scintilla of pressure back on Djokovic, who would have favoured a Tsonga win. Either way, as Djokovic and Murray reiterated yesterday, it is best to make the progress safe by winning every match. If that match was the needle-point on which this relationship now spins, serious jousting either side of it makes them about even for the year, with Murray moving out of Djokovic&apos;s shadow to prevail at the Olympics before his long-time friend hit back by saving five match points to win in Shanghai. As Djokovic charitably observed: &quot;He could have easily been sitting here as a winner of today&apos;s match.&quot; But he was not, although Murray contested the view that poor decision-making cost him the match. Asked if he regretted going for and bungling a high-risk serve-and-volley on break point at 3-2 in the second set, he said: &quot;He serve and volleyed on the break point in the game before and hit the back end of the line. I volleyed in the next game and missed the volley by a couple of centimetres.&quot; The unspoken suspicion was that he was thus indulging in what-you-can-do-I-can-do machismo, although he did not see it that way. &quot;When someone&apos;s blocking returns and chipping returns, normally you can get in close to net and make it hard. He chipped the return, so I got the return that I wanted. I would have liked it maybe a little bit higher, but there are decisions you make in matches. If they come off, you get told you&apos;re a genius. If you miss them, then you&apos;re an idiot. That was just one of those ones that didn&apos;t work today.&quot; Murray is no idiot. On Wednesday he might have wished for a few more moments of genius to go with those passages when his focus seemed to desert him, especially in the second set when Djokovic was roused from his first-set slumber. In the opening exchanges, Murray looked irresistible, moving with ridiculous ease into nearly every shot; thereafter, uncertainty invaded his ground strokes, his normally exquisite lob converted from killing winner to liability. The third set was tight, as both players acknowledged, but the ending was a frustrating mess for Murray. &quot;The last two minutes probably decided it,&quot; he admitted. &quot;He broke from 15-40, and then I had 15-40 next game and didn&apos;t break. So that was the moment that decided the match.&quot; Probably he is right. But that anxious passage did not exist in isolation. It was the culmination of a fight, many rounds of which were within Murray&apos;s grasp, three of which were snatched away from him at crucial moments. Still, there is the comforting near certainty that they will continue to test each other at the highest level in the biggest tournaments for several years to come, two prodigies, only a week apart in age, who have risen through the ranks together and, at 25, are operating near the peak of their powers. &quot;Of course it&apos;s special,&quot; Djokovic said. &quot;We know each other so well. The friendship goes back a long time, since we were 11 years old and more or less we developed into professional tennis players at the same time. Hopefully this rivalry will evolve and we can have many more great matches on the Tour.&quot; As close as it was, this match was not among their greatest contests. Given the extraordinary levels they reached in the semi-final at Melbourne this year, then in the final in New York, that is hardly surprising. If they touch those heights again, we will all be blessed. Jonny Marray&apos;s fairytale continues, meanwhile. The British Wimbledon champion and his Danish partner, Frederik Neilsen, secured a semi-final place by beating the title-holders Max Mirnyi and Daniel Nestor 7-6 (3), 4-6, 12-10 in and hour and 41 minutes. &quot;We were aware of the fact we were underdogs,&quot; Nielsen said, &quot;the lowest-ranked team, a special exemption due to a loophole.

Right now China&apos;s economic situation isn&apos;t very good. To fix this, the best method for China would be to open up its state-owned enterprises (SOEs), to break them down into private enterprises. If they do this then there will be a positive turn in the economy, and then they might have enough capital for actual political reform. If there&apos;s no reform, the consequences will be severe. Economic, political and social crises will all occur simultaneously and this will throw Chinese society into chaos.  Wen Yunchao, Hong Kong-based blogger known as Bei Feng     Wen Yunchao    The biggest problem isn&apos;t political reform, it&apos;s the economy. China&apos;s economic situation right now is terrible. Just look at southern China \u2013 the economy there is really bad there. They should break the monopolies of SOEs. They should also give the public a space on the internet for opinion polls. People are very unsatisfied with things, and if there are no major changes in the next few years, then public opinion, social protests, and political protests will all move beyond the government&apos;s control.  Li Bo, head of Friends of Nature, an environmental NGO in China     Li Bo    The environmental assessment of development projects should be much more open. The possible existence of risk for any project \u2013 technological and economic, or social and political \u2013 should be fully discussed before the project is implemented. Right now, according to the law, there is a process for environmental impact assessment. But the people who are in charge of executing these are only responsible to their seniors, not to the people under them. So these processes aren&apos;t very open, and their discussions aren&apos;t transparent. Because of this many projects are approved, and then their problems are only discovered afterwards. Like the recent PX incident \u2013 there&apos;s a lot of fear and rage. These things can really tear a society apart. Yan Anthea Zhang, strategic management professor, China Europe International Business School, Shanghai     Yan Anthea Zhang    The Chinese government has been encouraging indigenous innovation within the past five to 10 years \u2013 if we look at the number of patent applications, the number has gone up very quickly. But there are questions about patent quality. In China there are so many R&amp;D projects, but too much funding has been spent on fast, easy innovation projects instead of big, long-term, risky projects with great potential. Based on my research, filing a high number of patents can help a company get R&amp;D funding from the government, even if number of patents has no effect on post-intellectural property office performance. So there&apos;s a significant waste of capital, and the basic ability of Chinese companies might be overestimated.  Bo Zhiyue, senior research fellow, East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore     Bo Zhiyue    I think the first thing would be to do something about corruption in the Chinese Communist party, because it&apos;s so rampant. If they don&apos;t do anything about this, they will lose credibility very quickly. There are huge vested interests behind this corruption, and a lot of government officials and party leaders are a part of these vested interests. So they themselves are liable.If a politburo standing committee member such as Wen Jiabao is allegedly corrupt, then nobody else is immune from this problem. If committee members are also suspected of corruption \u2013 and if they don&apos;t do anything about it \u2013 there&apos;s going to be a deep crisis. Eventually the credibility deficit will become so huge that it could mean the collapse of the CCP as the ruling party. What should be the main priority for Xi Jinping?

Murray, a winner in their past two meetings, at the Olympics and in Shanghai last month, is desperate to not only go through to the final of the ATP World Tour Finals but to beat the world No2 in style. The memory of losing three grand slam finals to Federer, most recently at Wimbledon this year, is one he wants to make an historical irrelevance. David Ferrer beat Janko Tipsarevic 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 in the concluding round- robin match to ensure Murray and the Swiss play the evening semi-final; Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro and Novak Djokovic meet in the first. The Argentinian beat Federer 7-6, 4-6, 6-3 on Saturday afternoon with clinically applied power from the baseline, for the second time in a fortnight \u2013 another statistic to give Murray encouragement. It was a fine spectacle, littered with memorable moments, but maybe too many errors, 42 of them, unforced, from the racket of the loser. In perhaps the rally of the tournament, Federer and Del Potro exchanged scampering between-the-leg rescue shots from beyond the baseline in the ninth game of the first set, followed by an exquisite rally that Federer finished to hold for 5-4, going with serve. Both revelled in the applause and Federer even allowed himself a quiet smile at the changeover; it is good to see him enjoying his tennis after a little dip of spirits in Basel two weeks ago, when Del Potro beat him in front of his own fans. This was just as tight a contest as that final. By the time they got to the inevitable tie-break, only a fool or an optimist would make either favourite; as it happened, Federer&apos;s ice-cool demeanour cracked first as his backhand betrayed him and Del Potro took it calmly, 7-3. It is hard to gauge Del Potro&apos;s mood as he invariably looks woebegone, winning or losing, but he must have felt a surge of self-belief now against the player he beat in his biggest triumph, three long years ago at Flushing Meadows. Federer, he might have fleetingly thought, was there for the taking again. But it was not quite Roger, over and out, and the world No2 checked the assault with a quick break at the start of the second set. As he regrouped, he had still only lost two points on his first serve halfway through the set, none on his second \u2013 almost a replica of his efficiency against the Spanish roadblock, David Ferrer. Fittingly, he levelled the match at 6-4 with an ace. The next swing of the pendulum was as loose as the Federer backhand that went long and Del Potro was rejuvenated at 2-0, murdering his opponent from the baseline with raw power. He did not falter in closing out the match in a tick over two hours. &quot;I&apos;m so happy to happy to beat Roger again,&quot; Del Potro told the Federer-obsessed crowd at courtside, &quot;but thank you for your support.&quot; When the best players in the world are thrown together in three-set shootouts for a week at the end of a long season, the pitfalls are as obvious as the opportunities. Start slowly against Federer and the match could be over before your towel gets wet. Murray \u2013 who was not fussed who he would meet in the semis \u2013 knows that well enough. &quot;It&apos;s tough to come back if you do get off to a slow start,&quot; he said, &quot;especially against the best players in the world, so that&apos;s a little bit different from the majors.&quot; The only near-equivalent to that in the slams is the US Open, when the conclusion to the fortnight is concertinaed into a crazy schedule of intense matches, and the importance of fitness and stamina becomes even more obvious \u2013 as it was when Andy Murray outlasted Djokovic to win the title. It is impossible to underestimate the impact of that historic win \u2013 on Murray and the nation \u2013 although Murray sees his achievements at the highest level in more prosaic terms, as a technician rather than a romantic. &quot;Any time you win against the top players,&quot; he said, &quot;it gives you a confidence boost. The past few times I played against Roger and Novak, I&apos;ve had chances in all of the matches. It&apos;s not been ones where I&apos;ve gone out and been outplayed, or whatever. So I think I&apos;ve been playing the right way against them. Sometimes it&apos;s going to go your way, sometimes it isn&apos;t, but, if I make sure I do the right things on the court, then I&apos;ll get my wins against them and I hope that&apos;s the case at the weekend.&quot; Doing the &quot;right things&quot; varies, of course, depending on the opposition and there are few better strategists in the game than Murray, who targets Djokovic&apos;s body and Federer&apos;s mind, which makes the triangle of excellence in tennis so intriguing. While Murray appreciates the physicality of a fight with the Serb, he is equally inspired by matching wits with the Swiss \u2013 not that Djokovic is a tennis dunderhead, by any means. What helps him is the support of the crowd who, generally, have been tremendous ever since his lachrymose response to defeat by Federer in the Wimbledon final (misery quickly replaced by exultation at the Olympics a month later). &quot;Every time I&apos;ve come to the court it&apos;s been great,&quot; Murray said. &quot;I&apos;m sure the weekend will be a little bit different crowd [to the Olympics, where fans did not necessarily come from the sport&apos;s hardcore].&quot;I don&apos;t want to put too much pressure on myself. Whatever happens from now on, I&apos;ve had the best year of my life so I&apos;ll try not to be too disappointed if I don&apos;t win here. But it would be a great way to finish the year, that&apos;s for sure.&quot; That might be understated Dunblane humour, because there is a growing sense in the game that Murray has not just arrived at last but is here to stay for quite a long time. So then, which of his achievements does he consider the greater: the Olympic gold medal or the slam title? &quot;It&apos;s a tough one \u2026 when I won the Olympics, at that moment, that was obviously the biggest \u2026 also the mixed as well [with Laura Robson]. Winning the medals at the Olympics was incredible \u2026 when you&apos;re playing at the Olympics, you feel like you&apos;re part of a team.&quot; Selflessness is rare in sport and Murray is hardly devoid of ambition but, in the age of rampant introspection, it is comforting to hear him embrace his success as part of a wider agenda.", "tags": ["ATP World Tour Finals", "Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-10T18:02:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/11/andy-murray-roger-federer-live", "sentences": ["You can never truly be the favourite against Roger Federer, even if Murray has brutalised the Swiss genius in their last two matches, beating him in straight sets in the Shanghai Masters last month and in the Olympic final in August.", "First set: Murray* 2-0 Federer (*denotes server): Murray actually broke Federer in the first game in Shanghai as well and was then immediately broken back."], "title": "Andy Murray v Roger Federer \u2013 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg", "article": " Over the years, there have been people who have enjoyed nothing more than slagging off Andy Murray.

Yeah, those jibes look rather foolish now. Olympic and US Open champion? There&apos;s your loser. Another victory tonight and he&apos;ll be one match away from the perfect end to the perfect year. Murray has been in good form at the O2 this week as well, comfortable after a wee wobble against Tomas Berdych, desperately unlucky to lose to Novak Djokovic and supreme against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. He&apos;s hitting the ball sweetly off both sides, his movement is a blur and he&apos;s more or less cut out the mood swings that so often blighted him in the past.  The favourite then? Well, maybe not. You can never truly be the favourite against Roger Federer, even if Murray has brutalised the Swiss genius in their last two matches, beating him in straight sets in the Shanghai Masters last month and in the Olympic final in August. But you don&apos;t have to go too far back for Federer&apos;s last win over Murray, when he made the Scot cry in the Wimbledon final. Federer was in inspired mood that afternoon and when he clicks, sometimes you haven&apos;t got a prayer. He&apos;s been in decent enough nick this week as well, seeing off Janko Tipsarevic and David Ferrer before losing to Juan Martin del Potro yesterday. He was already through though and taking into account what happened to Murray under the Centre Court roof, Federer will fancy his chances of reaching tomorrow&apos;s final against Djokovic.  Play will start: Not before 7.45pm.  I was present for Murray&apos;s match against Djokovic on Wednesday and was rather irked that the crowd gave his Olympic win a bigger cheer than his US Open one. Some people.  An email. &quot;I really hope Andy is insisting on watching the Strictly results show before allowing play to start, yah?&quot; Simon McMahon says. He also needs to get this done before Homeland.  Here come the players. It&apos;s Murray who strolls out first, shortly followed by Roger Federer. He&apos;s wearing a headband. There&apos;s been a lot of that sort of thing on Sky Sports today. They both received a great ovation from the crowd, Murray just about edging it.  The coin toss. Federer chooses heads. It&apos;s tails. Ha! Ha ha ha! Murray decides to receive; he always backs himself to break given the quality of his returns.  Tok! Tok! Tockity tok! They&apos;re knocking up. Not long now.  First set: Murray 1-0 Federer* (*denotes server): It&apos;s Federer to serve first. In the Wimbledon final, Murray broke him in the first game, so he&apos;s after a quick start again. This isn&apos;t too bad either: he races into a 0-30 lead as Federer nets a backhand and then swipes one long. An ace calms the situation but Murray then earns two break points after outlasting Federer in a cagey rally, the Swiss flapping a forehand into the net. Federer saves the first, however, putting Murray under pressure with a pinpoint forehand down the line. But he can&apos;t save the second! A strong return from Murray puts him on the backfoot and another weak forehand goes into the net. We&apos;ve seen this before though.  First set: Murray* 2-0 Federer (*denotes server): Murray actually broke Federer in the first game in Shanghai as well and was then immediately broken back. So let&apos;s not get carried away. Although this is encouraging. After going 0-15 down, Murray outwits Federer with a stunning backhand into the right corner. What a lovely shot. A strong serve then makes it 30-all, before he forces Federer to hit long after a fierce cross-court backhand. Murray holds after Federer sends a forehand wide. That should eradicate any lingering nerves. &quot;Murray to win 6-3, 7-6,&quot; Simon McMahon, my co-commentator says. &quot;And just so you know, Fern and Artem went out in the dance off.&quot;  First set: Murray 2-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Murray is in the mood and is imposing himself on this match. There&apos;s nothing Federer can do about another coruscating backhand to make it 0-15 and then at 15-all, he sends a gimme of a forehand wide at the net. It&apos;s soon 40-30 though, more backhands wafting into the net. There have been quite a few unforced errors from both players. We go to deuce after a pounding Murray forehand, but some tricky serves from Federer get him on the scoreboard. There&apos;s definitely much more to come from Federer.  First set: Murray* 3-1 Federer (*denotes server): Has someone tampered with Federer&apos;s radar? He&apos;s missing shots you wouldn&apos;t normally expect him to, such as what seemed to be a simple enough forehand down the line to make it 30-0. Then he thrashes a forehand into the net after a netcord had left the ball in the middle of the court. A sitter and he couldn&apos;t convert. You know what I&apos;ve always said about Federer. Overrated. &quot;I always liked Murray&apos;s dry sense of humour and could put up with the bad language and bad body language on court because of his outstanding shot-making,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;I didn&apos;t think he&apos;d get a Slam though - too much scarring upstairs. Turned out I was wrong. Maybe, because it&apos;s 2012 and all that, he hasn&apos;t got the credit he deserves, because that US Open win was huge.&quot; I always thought he would win a slam. Yeah, check me out. He was clearly too good not to.  First set: Murray 3-2 Federer* (*denotes server): If Federer doesn&apos;t react, this could be over very quickly because Murray has him on the run at the moment. And usually it&apos;s Murray who has to do all the running. So far, he&apos;s been toying with Federer, pulling him up and down the baseline at will and he does so again to take a 0-30 lead. Federer doesn&apos;t like it though and after dragging himself level, he lets out a &quot;Come on!&quot; after a fine forehand down the line to go 40-30 up. He finishes off the game with a clinical backhand volley.  First set: Murray* 4-2 Federer (*denotes server): Federer has reacted, all right. At 15-all, he lets rip with a stunning forehand return to go 15-30 up. But Murray&apos;s not letting his focus slip and two excellent serves \u2013 the second an ace \u2013 makes it 40-30. Having done all the hard work though, Murray then drags a forehand well wide. Deuce. And then advantage Murray as he drops a slice shot before putting away an overhead backhand. Buoyed by that, he approaches the net again, finishing off the game with another volley.  First set: Murray 4-3 Federer* (*denotes server): More or less serving to stay in the first set, Federer gets into his groove, holding to 15 and winning the game with a glorious backhand volley. It only takes one loose service game from Murray.  First set: Murray* 4-4 Federer (*denotes server): Federer is giving Murray a bit of trouble when he targets his forehand as he does here to go 0-15 up. A spot of bother for Murray soon after, too, as he slices a backhand to give the Federer fans in the crowd something to cheer about at last. Murray&apos;s respond as Federer nets a forehand to make it 15-30. It looks like Federer has Murray where he wants him in the next point, only to net another forehand. Murray&apos;s speed around the court is slightly unsettling him. But then Federer changes it up with a chip and charge, and Murray surprisingly sends a shocking backhand miles long to give up his first break point. Federer smells blood, ramming a forehand down into the bottom-right corner, and Murray can&apos;t respond. We&apos;re level again.  First set: Murray 4-5 Federer* (*denotes server): Somehow Murray finds himself having to serve to stay in the first set. For the first time, Federer is up. And he&apos;s starting to play some sumptuous stuff.  First set: Murray* 5-5 Federer (*denotes server): Federer is purring now. He takes a 0-15 lead, running around a tame Murray second serve to put away a lovely forehand. So Murray responds with an ace. And then double-faults. Oh dear. Federer is two points away from winning the first set. Murray, on the edge now, makes it 30-all with a forehand that lands in by inches. That&apos;s the cue for him to go on the attack, and although Federer blocks back one smash, Murray makes no mistake with the next to make it 40-30. Murray hangs on as Federer drops a forehand wide.  First set: Murray 5-6 Federer* (*denotes server): Murray is struggling a bit when Federer hits the ball down the line to his forehand. He does so to good effect here to make it 30-15, before Murray slaps a forehand wide off a second serve. He finishes off the game with an ace down the middle. Murray thinks about challenging but after a look he decides against it. He&apos;ll have to serve to stay in the set again.  First set: Murray* 6-6 Federer (*denotes server): You could hear a pin drop inside the O2 with the set so delicately poised. Federer makes Murray&apos;s life that bit easier by getting his timing wrong on two forehands to make it 30-0 - although he then comes up with a moment of genius, an outstanding winner off his backhand. An ace from Murray makes it 40-15 though and the game is done when Federer slices a backhand into the net. A tie-break it is then.  First set tie-break: Murray 0-1 Federer*: Federer gets off to a fine start, putting away an unstoppable forehand.  First set tie-break: Murray* 1-1 Federer: A serve down the middle from Murray and Federer&apos;s forehand goes long.  First set tie-break: Murray* 2-1 Federer: Another serve down the middle and this time Federer&apos;s backhand dribbles into the net.  First set tie-break: Murray 3-1 Federer*: Federer hands Murray a mini-break with a woefully mishit backhand. That was terrible.  First set tie-break: Murray 3-2 Federer*: Murray can only net a wide serve from Federer.  First set tie-break: Murray* 3-3 Federer: A marvellous rally ends with Federer taking control with a brilliant forehand. Murray gets it back, but Federer pounces with a second forehand into the left corner and we&apos;re level again.  First set tie-break: Murray* 4-3 Federer: Murray just does enough with a backhand volley at the net. Positive play from Murray.  First set tie-break: Murray 4-4 Federer*: Federer responds well with an excellent serve out wide.  First set tie-break: Murray 4-5 Federer*: Federer gives Murray the chance, coming forward, but his forehand pass goes into the net.  First set tie-break: Murray* 4-6 Federer: The pair trades backhands for a while before Federer changes it up with a long forehand, forcing an off-balance Murray nets his forehand reply! It&apos;s two set points to Federer.  First set tie-break: Murray* 5-6 Federer: Murray changes his racket rescues one of the set points with a strong forehand. Federer has a serve now though.  Roger Federer wins the first set 7-6: He was probably never going to waste a set-point on his own serve. Another error from Murray, this time a backhand into the net, and the first set is Federer&apos;s. Murray will be furious his dip in the middle of the set let Federer back into it.  Second set: Murray* 6-7 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): An important hold for Murray, although it looked a bit dodgy when he lost the first point. Not by the end though, as he wins the game with a disdainful backhand. &quot;When you said earlier that Andy had to have this done in time for Homeland, you really meant in time for IACGMOOH, didn&apos;t you?&quot; Simon McMahon says. &quot;And don&apos;t pretend you&apos;ve no idea what I&apos;m on about.&quot; I have not got a clue what you&apos;re on about.  Second set: Murray 6-7 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer continues to attack the Murray forehand. It looks like the right tactic this evening. He holds to love.  Second set: Murray* 6-7 1-2 Federer (*denotes server): A new racket for Federer now. I wonder how many rackets these players turn up with for a match. Probably at least 62. Anyway, the game. Murray starts with one of those drop shots he loves. Federer tries to lob him, Murray puts a smash away. At 30-0, Murray then produces a risible drop shot but despite Federer whipping a forehand into the corner, Murray somehow reaches it and ends up winning the point. His retrieval skills are absurd sometimes. But all is not well. Somehow from 40-0 up on his own serve, he then plays a succession of ridiculously loose shots to give Federer a chance to break. And it&apos;s one he takes with aplomb, crunching a forehand into the right corner, from where Murray&apos;s weak backhand flops into the net. Federer won five straight points on the Murray serve there and he didn&apos;t have to do a lot. Tired minds at the end of a long year?  Second set: Murray 6-7 1-3 Federer* (*denotes server): Murray&apos;s clearly hoping he can make it in time for Homeland on Channel 4+1 at 10pm. He&apos;s not with it any more, as evidenced by a farcical drop shot into the net.  Second set: Murray* 6-7 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Murray stays in contention as he holds to love. That was a bit more like it there. Federer wasn&apos;t given a sniff, a fine forehand and an ace the highlights of the game. Maybe that will help him regain some of the focus he has lost.  Second set: Murray 6-7 2-4 Federer* (*denotes server): Some of Federer&apos;s second serves are remarkable. The amount of bounce and spin he gets on them. It makes it so difficult to return. It&apos;s just as well, really, because he&apos;s only serving at 51% on his first serve. But still holds to love.  Second set: Murray* 6-7 2-5 Federer (*denotes server): This is effectively match point. At 30-all, Federer goes for another chip and charge on the Murray serve. Murray tries to lob him but doesn&apos;t get enough height and Federer puts the smash away. Murray tries to beat Federer at his own game, but it&apos;s no contest: a pearler of a backhand pass from left to right means Federer will now serve for the match. He&apos;s got too much for Murray on an indoor court.  Roger Federer beats Andy Murray 7-6, 6-2: So here&apos;s Federer serving for a place in the final - and Murray makes it easy enough for him on the first point, battering a forehand way off target. Federer then makes it 30-0 with decisive play at the net, although Murray gives himself a smidgen of hope with a stunning return. Only a smidgen, mind you, because Federer quickly earns two match points with another winner with a volley. He only needs one though. Murray&apos;s return clips the top of the net and sits up nicely for Federer to end the contest with a forehand down the line.  So Roger Federer, not Andy Murray, will play Novak Djokovic in tomorrow&apos;s final. It didn&apos;t look like it would like this for much of the first set but once Murray let the advantage slip, the writing was on the wall. In the end, Federer was too good. Which is often the case. This was probably Murray&apos;s worst match of the week, but sometimes there&apos;s no beating Federer on an indoor court. Thanks for reading.

Federer, who played magnificently on Sunday night after a slow start, won 7-6, 6-2 to rapturous applause and reaches for his seventh title in the Barclays ATP World Tour finals on Monday night against Novak Djokovic, the Serb having earlier accounted for Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in three absorbing sets. For all that the notion of Swiss neutrality is an historical clich\u00e9 \u2013 and those waving the Red Cross flag were proud and entitled to cheer for their representative \u2013 the noise throughout most of the packed arena seemed inordinately in favour of the world No2 against Murray for the hour and a half it lasted. Indeed, from this perch it would not be unreasonable to put it at 60-40. Two incidents stood out. After breaking Federer in the first game of the match Murray dropped serve to allow him back into the contest and, when deep in a fightback at 5-4, was heckled in mid-serve. He double-faulted but held and said later it did not affect the result, although it did prompt a plea from the umpire for silence. Then, towards the end of an enthralling tie-break, trailing 4-6, Murray changed rackets and a tiny section of the ground whistled and booed, an unedifying spectacle. At other moments minor errors were cheered, his better efforts sometimes only politely received. It was not the sort of homecoming an Olympic gold medallist and US Open champion might have expected in front of what was a largely British audience. While the Scot might have thought he could count on at least something like a fair shake against the most popular player of modern times, he declined to complain about any perceived slight. &quot;Almost all the times when you play Roger anywhere in the world he gets great support,&quot; he said. &quot;He deserves that because of everything that&apos;s he&apos;s achieved.&quot; He was similarly philosophical about the result, as well as the slight tailing off in his remarkable season. &quot;I don&apos;t think the results have been that bad,&quot; he said, of tight defeats in Tokyo, Shanghai and Paris, &quot;or that I played poorly or not responded well to winning the US Open. I would have liked to have finished with a win, obviously. But it&apos;s been the best year of my career by a mile. So it would be silly to look back on that negatively, because I&apos;ve achieved things I&apos;ve never achieved before.&quot; All that said, Federer played on a different level towards the end of the first set and most of the second. Once the rhythm of his tennis grew, he was pretty much irresistible and Murray&apos;s tennis did not survive a brutal examination in a clinical finish. The beast in Djokovic, meanwhile, has been stirred. Even as he was handing out chocolates to journalists after qualifying, one guessed the charity would end right there. The Christmas gift to his regular inquisitors was a nice gesture by a most interesting man but there will be no sentiment in the final. The Serb arrived in London from Paris understandably preoccupied by worries about his father&apos;s health but encouraging news on that front looks to have cleared his mind and he was back to near his ruthless best on Sunday afternoon, content, relaxed and dangerous. The reinstated world No1 will be tougher to beat on Monday night than he might have been a week ago. This was tennis which touched the heights, two uncompromising ball strikers leaving nothing but sweat on the court, stretching muscle and mind to the limit in a tense three-setter that lasted two hours and 11 minutes. Djokovic won 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 pulling away. However, the Argentinian looked dominant in the first set and stayed on level terms until early in the second when, after a period of sloppy tennis, Djokovic came to life. The ball left his racket with more certainty, the near-misses of the first spell now clipped lines down the channels and deep, as the rush of a champion&apos;s desire coursed through him. &quot;I had a little, let&apos;s say, crisis from four-all in the first set to two-all in the second,&quot; he said, &quot;where I didn&apos;t feel so good on the court, struggling to find my momentum and my rhythm. Also, when mentally you&apos;re not confident and you&apos;re not in control of the match, your energy level drops. So I tried to be positive and push myself to fight for every point. I always believe I can come back.&quot; It should be some final.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "ATP World Tour Finals", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-11T23:22:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/12/the-fiver-john-terry", "sentences": ["Should he decide to go to China, Lampard would be the third player in recent Chelsea history to make such a move, with Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka both having blazed a trail to Shanghai Shenhua in the not too distant past."], "title": "The Fiver | A Chelsea pensioner's pain | Barry Glendenning", "article": "POJT&apos;S KNEE-KNACK AND A CHINESE TAKEAWAY The Fiver has always admired Plain Old John Terry. OK, that&apos;s not strictly true, but we have always admired him for being quite tough; as well &apos;ard as Wellard the pooch on EastEnders, in that episode where he wore a leather jacket, went down the Queen Vic and waved a sawn-off shotgun in Phil Mitchell&apos;s face. So when POJT was left whimpering like a baby after an accidental collision with Luis Suarez, beating the ground in agony and calling for the assistance of that doctor on Chelsea&apos;s bench who people often mistake for a masseuse or physio&apos;s assistant, it was fairly obvious he&apos;d got a fairly bad dose of knee-knack. So bad, in fact, that he had to be carried off on a stretcher before leaving Stamford Bridge on sticks with his leg in a brace. Although POJT was due to visit the hospital for a scan this morning, the Fiver was not invited to tag along, so we don&apos;t know yet what the prognosis is or how long he&apos;ll be out for, although Liverpool fans might have you believe he will probably be sidelined for exactly half the length of time Suarez would be if he&apos;d suffered the same injury. &quot;Hugs to Terry, I hope it&apos;s nothing serious,&quot; said the Uruguayan on Twitter yesterday, echoing the sentiments of Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo, who said much the same thing, except not on a social networking site and without the hugs. So, it fell to his fellow Chelsea pensioner Frank Lampard to hog the headlines, with rumours suggesting that the Chinese club Guizhou Renhe are planning a takeaway from Stamford Bridge and have their eye on No8 (never let it be said that standards are slipping \u2013 Fiver Ed). &quot;Yes, we are in contact with Lampard but so far nothing has been settled,&quot; said the club&apos;s deputy chairman Yang Xiayou in an interview with the Beijing TV station BTV-6, who may be asked to schedule an unpopular, low quality breakfast television programme for Lampard&apos;s fiancee to present, in a bid to help grease the wheels of any prospective deal. With Chelsea refusing to offer Lampard a contract extension of more than a year, the lure of Renhe could be strong, as it would offer the midfielder a last big pay-day, not to mention the opportunity to travel across the Beipanjiang River Railway Bridge, the highest of its kind in the world, before getting sozzled on maotaoi liquor, clambering into a barrel and floating over the magnificent Huangguoshu Waterfall, just to see what will happen next. Should he decide to go to China, Lampard would be the third player in recent Chelsea history to make such a move, with Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka both having blazed a trail to Shanghai Shenhua in the not too distant past. Notoriously easygoing and low maintenance, both players seem to have found the experience hugely agreeable. Drogba is rumoured to have fallen out with the club over money and has been linked with a move to Liverpool, while Anelka is suffering from his usual ennui and apparently yearning for the warm familiar embrace of West Ham manager Big Sam.

Unless he&apos;s a useless long ball merchant (which he almost certainly is), he&apos;ll likely still not get picked but he can at least make his mark on international football akin to that of Theme Pub O&apos;Gibson by declaring himself unavailable for &apos;selection&apos; because he&apos;s in a bit of a nark about not actually being selected, thus creating the myth that he&apos;s better than he is through no-one having actually seen him play for his country&quot; \u2013 Derek McGee. &quot;On the subject of Shaktar goalie Pyatov and the meaning of his name (Fiver passim), I&apos;d like to congratulate Geoff Saunders for only taking two days to read as far as half-time in this MBM.

Peterborough have transfer-listed and fined Gaby Zakuani, Tyrone Barnett, Emile Sinclair and Nathaniel Mendez-Laing for breaching club discipline.

Pictures from last week&apos;s International Industry Fair in Shanghai show them duelling with lightsabers, playing ping pong and dancing in lion costumes. One shows a female robot in a white wool coat shaking hands with a visitor. According to the Frankfurt-based International Federation of Robotics, China could become the world&apos;s biggest consumer of industrial robots by 2014, with demand reaching 32,000 units. Gudrun Litzenberger, the organisation&apos;s general secretary, has described China as the fastest-growing robot market in the world. China has many reasons to embrace industrial robotics. Robots can improve energy efficiency and perform operations that would prove impossibly complex for even the best-trained humans. But the most important reasons are shifting demographics and basic economics: China&apos;s working-age population is shrinking, sending labour costs spiralling upwards. &quot;There aren&apos;t many young workers coming off the streets to fill jobs at factories. That&apos;s why you&apos;re seeing factory wages going up, and factories struggling to hire trained staff,&quot; said Geoff Crothall, a spokesman for the Hong Kong-based China Labor Bulletin. &quot;It&apos;s not surprising that you&apos;d see greater focus on greater automation of production.&quot;     Nice to meet you. A robot greets visitors at the fair. Photograph: Pei Xin/Xinhua Press/Corbis    China&apos;s growing affluence and family planning laws have had dramatic effects on its workforce. Improved medical care has enabled older generations to live longer, and the one-child policy has effectively capped the younger generation&apos;s size. In 2000 there were six working-age citizens for each Chinese person aged 60 and up; 20 years from now, population experts predict, there will be only two. Young Chinese have no choice but to seek skilled, high-paying work to support their parents. They&apos;re better educated than their forebears, and less interested in menial assembly-line labour. Robots may fill the jobs they&apos;ve left behind. China still ranks low on the global robotic hierarchy, according to the state-run China Daily. Last year, there were 21 robots for every 10,000 workers in China, compared with a global average of 55. Japan has 339 robots for every 10,000 workers; Germany has 251. This is changing. The Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn has revealed plans to boost its fleet of industrial robots from 10,000 to 1m within three years. According to the company&apos;s CEO, Terry Gou, robots will replace workers for tasks such as spraying, assembling and welding.     An industrial robot demonstrates spraying at the 2012 fair in Shanghai. Photograph: Zhu Lan/ Xinhua Press/Corbis    Chinese officials have openly championed the industry&apos;s growth. The Shanghai municipal government has called robotics &quot;one of its major industries&quot;, wrote the China Daily. At a press conference on Monday the vice-minister for human resources and social security, Yang Zhiming, emphasised the need to &quot;upgrade equipment and technology&quot;. Where the government sees potential, Chinese firms see the potential for incentives. &quot;China needs to subsidise its own enterprises \u2013 to improve its own equipment manufacturing, and to make sure that its own enterprises can compete with foreign technology,&quot; said an employee of the Shanghai-based SIASUN Robot and Automation Company. The employee said SIASUN had not yet received subsidies from the Shanghai government, but that a deal may be in the works. Even outside the factory, robots \u2013 jiqiren in Chinese, literally &quot;mechanical people&quot; \u2013 have proliferated in China, many of them homegrown. China&apos;s National University of Defence Technology unveiled the country&apos;s first bipedal humanoid robot in 2000, after more than a decade of research. Chinese media lauded the block-headed robot as a technological advance, but its slapdash appearance \u2013 and the unfortunate placement of a protruding joint \u2013 made it the brunt of online jokes in tech-savvy Japan. A Chinese farmer, Wu Yulu, shot to fame in 2009 for building robots that could pull rickshaws, climb walls and light visitors&apos; cigarettes. One local television station dubbed him &quot;China&apos;s cleverest farmer inventor&quot;, according to Reuters. In 2010, a hotpot restaurant opened in coastal Shandong province with more than a dozen Star Wars-style droids as entertainers and hosts. In March, a Chinese restaurateur launched a line of \u00a31,200 robots that can slice thick-cut noodles out of blocks of dough. &quot;Following the market&apos;s increase in demand for talent, young people aren&apos;t willing to do such dirty, tiring work,&quot; the restaurateur, Cui Runguan, told Zoomin.TV. &quot;So not only in sliced noodle restaurants, but also in many other regards, we&apos;ll follow our technological development \u2013 and there will be many, many machines that can replace human labour.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Robots", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Technology", "Manufacturing sector"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-13T11:11:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/nov/13/student-recruitment-strategy-international-universities", "sentences": ["In fact, half of all HKUST&apos;s mainland China applications came from just four regions: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Liaoning."], "title": "Student recruitment strategy: four universities, five key questions", "article": "The key to a successful student recruitment strategy is thinking about &quot;what you communicate, to whom, and how,&quot; according to Richard Levin, executive director of enrolment services and university registration at the University of Toronto in Canada. &quot;Messages must be consistent and clear and authentic,&quot; he says. A university that asks itself the right questions is more likely to provide answers that students want to hear. What Levin sees the breadth of Toronto&apos;s academic offering, its vibrant student life, history, alumni and pleasant surroundings as highly marketable aspects \u2013 &quot;so those are the are the kind of messages we want to communicate&quot;. Once decided on the message, the next task for a university is to tailor that message to a variety of audiences. School pupils, transfer students, careers counsellors, parents and other family members all require a slightly different approach. &quot;The content of the message is dependent on the stage the person is at,&quot; says Levin. School pupils need introductory information to get them started whereas transfer students need to find specific details easily and quickly. To whom Dean Schmill, dean of admissions at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), says his university puts almost all of its energy into creating &quot;a website that offers an accurate picture of what our university is like and what it would be like to study here&quot;. The main feature of MITadmissions.org is its weblogs, personal accounts of the institution made by students which are left unedited by staff. &quot;It&apos;s important for us to have that honesty,&quot; says Schmill. &quot;It is more credible to prospective students because it is not always positive.&quot; Since MIT is oversubscribed, Schmill&apos;s team don&apos;t need to attend recruitment fairs or travel across the country to recruit. Their main job is outreach: communicating the range of scholarships available for potential students from poorer backgrounds who might otherwise be put off by MIT&apos;s fees. The web is key to this outreach &quot;since anyone can see it&quot;. How Web and social media are not only crucial tools in student recruitment, they have forcably sharpened the accuracy of university branding. There can be no estate-agent-style fudging of the facts with thousands of students out there who can expose any inflated claims with the touch of a tweet. On the plus side, the internet can also spread positive messages, as evidenced by a recent video viral from the University of Toronto. Hundreds of Toronto undergraduates put on costumes to make their own very watchable pop video. The Toronot Lipdub portrays the university as a fun and collegiate place to study in a medium that instantly appeals to school pupils \u2013 to date, it has had almost 15,000 views. Why Thinking about why you want to recruit is also important when designing your strategy, advises Ulla Gj\u00f8rling, international director at Aarhus University in Denmark. &quot;Our primary goal concerning recruitment, and also one of our core missions, is talent development,&quot; says Gj\u00f8rling, who sees any potential recruit as a potential long-term partner for the university. She is looking for what she and her colleagues call the &apos;Aarhus edge&apos;. &quot;We want to attract the right students and young researchers,&quot; she says. &quot;Our aim for these talents is that they stay at Aarhus University for an average of five years and that they remain in our network forever.&quot; For Gj\u00f8rling, good recruitment &quot;means building our network and increasing potential future collaboration&quot;. Where Potential for future collaboration is also first and foremost in the minds of applicants to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Applications to HKUST rose by 54% last year, applications from mainland China by 53% and from some Chinese provinces by as much as 75%. In fact, half of all HKUST&apos;s mainland China applications came from just four regions: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Liaoning. Professor Kar-Yan Tam, associate provost and dean of students, says location is a key marketing focus. Messages have been tailored to remind potential students of HKUST&apos;s position as a strategic gateway to China. Kar-Yan Tam describes the university as having &quot;strong East-West elements&quot; and attracting students from around the world because &quot;people view studying in Hong Kong as a good option to gain access to not just Hong Kong, but also to mainland China and the region&quot;. And don&apos;t forget: recruit the right staff Recruiting international staff has been a crucial part of HKUST&apos;s strategy. Kar-Yan Tam said &quot;over 80% of our professors obtained degrees from world top universities \u2013 Cambridge, Oxford, Stanford \u2013 we are glad of ripple effect from word-of-mouth recommendations.&quot; The university also has close to 200 overseas and mainland exchange partners and HKUST&apos;s senior staff certainly put the legwork in. The university&apos;s president, vice-presidents and deans have made numerous visits to Europe, the US, Canada, South Korea as well to high schools throughout mainland China. This year, HKUST participated in nine overseas education fairs and held information sessions at 102 high schools across 40 cities in 11 countries. With applications from Europe \u2013 in particular UK, France, Germany and Russia \u2013 doubling since 2011, the message seems to be getting through.

A hefty donation to a scholarship fund for poor students. Prominent seats at the women&apos;s finals at the China Open. From such apparently disparate strands, analysts discern a common theme: the re-emergence of China&apos;s former party leaders just as incumbents prepare to hand power to younger figures this week. When the 18th party congress opened last Thursday, the three generations took their places at the front of the dais in Beijing&apos;s Great Hall of the People. The anointed heir, Xi Jinping, commanded less attention than former general secretary Jiang Zemin, seated next to current leader Hu Jintao. Other elders further down the table were easily identified by their fading locks \u2013 though former premier Li Peng, with his startlingly black brows, is clearly still wedded to the dye used by those in office. The meeting, which concludes in Beijing on Wednesday, demonstrates the Communist party&apos;s attempts to institutionalise politics and contain the power of individuals. Introducing set terms and age limits was supposed to ensure smooth transitions. But the enduring role of retired leaders illustrates the limits of that project and the extent to which power in China is still about personalities and patronage. &quot;From Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin, to Hu Jintao, to Xi Jinping, the tradition carries on,&quot; said independent scholar Chen Ziming. While elders might not challenge the incumbents&apos; overall stance, said Chen, &quot;they do pay attention to key events \u2013 especially political reform, their historical reputation or evaluation, and their children or relatives&apos; career arrangements.&quot; Last year, 86-year-old Jiang was so low profile that a Hong Kong television station was forced to apologise for wrongly reporting his death, which had been widely rumoured. This year, he has met the Starbucks CEO, attended a concert and written a verse for his old school. Both People&apos;s Daily \u2013 the official Communist party newspaper \u2013 and a state television channel devoted coverage last month to former leader Li Lanqing&apos;s search for the sheet music to Moonlight and Shadows, from a Dorothy Lamour film. His patron Jiang had been able to write the song&apos;s tune and lyrics from memory, it noted. It was, surmised analysts, a not particularly subtle hint about his continuing vigour and alertness. Like former premier Li Peng&apos;s 3m yuan (\u00a3300,000) donation to a scholarship fund, and the attendance of another elder, Li Ruihuan, at the tennis match, such forays into the public eye are intended to signal that retired leaders are still around and active, say analysts. Russell Leigh Moses, a Beijing-based political analyst, said their role reflected the hierarchical nature of Chinese political culture and tendency to venerate the old \u2013 but also, paradoxically, the introduction of hard and fast retirement rules. &quot;They don&apos;t jump so much as are pushed \u2013 and they are not reluctant to push back,&quot; he noted. Feng Chongyi, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Technology, Sydney, argued that they mainly influenced personnel choices. Jiang is widely reported to have played a key role in the choice of the new politburo standing committee \u2013 the top political body \u2013 pushing out candidates favoured by Hu. &quot;The patronage networks are extremely important for the protection and promotion of senior officials in China. There are strong mutual demands between patrons and clients. Jiang and other elders are making desperate efforts to support their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s,&quot; said Feng. Not only do they want to protect their political legacies, but many also have families who have prospered in business \u2013 and whose fortunes could be made or broken by state policy. But Jiang&apos;s re-emergence may say as much about the party as about him. Some analysts think he has taken advantage of a vacuum; others see him as effect as much as cause, stepping in to voice broader frustrations with the current administration. The sense that reforms have stalled over the last decade &quot;helped Jiang Zemin rally a certain number of people; even leaders who didn&apos;t belong to the Shanghai clique and are not particularly close to him,&quot; said Jean-Pierre Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University. But, he warned, the intervention of elders contributes to the paralysis of the whole system, as vested interests accumulate. Xi boasts the advantages of a revered revolutionary family and the backing of Jiang, who is thought to have been critical in his elevation. Yet he will have two predecessors and many more elders in the shadows. &quot;Are [elders] going to trust Xi Jinping as the new CEO of China and remain as board members meeting every year or so to evaluate results?&quot; asked Cabestan. &quot;The more retired emperors you have got, the more complicated the game is.&quot; Chen said that in theory Xi could rule without consulting the elders, but that his style made it unlikely. &quot;None of the laws or regulations or people&apos;s opinions say he has to,&quot; he noted. &quot;But Xi was chosen to be the next leader because he fit the requirements and is after their minds.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Xi Jinping", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-14T08:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/14/footballtransfer-rumours-anelka-liverpool", "sentences": ["Finally on the &quot;Liverpool desperately need a striker front&quot;; Nicolas Anelka is supposedly keen on a return to the club having decided he has had enough of life at Shanghai Shenhua.", "One stumbling block for any club chasing Anelka may well be the \u00a3250,000-a-week salary he is earning in Shanghai, although the QPR owner, Tony Fernandes, is said to be willing to pay that having wasted, sorry ... spent a lot of money on funding Mark Hughes&apos;s new-look side already."], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Nicolas Anelka to return to Liverpool?", "article": "Wilfried is the name on many people&apos;s lips right now as the country, nay, the world, gets itself into a giddy frenzy over Zaha.

Chelsea&apos;s sporting director, Michael Emenalo. has apparently travelled to the Netherlands on a few occasions to watch Bony and has been impressed by what he has seen from the Ivory Coast international, who is the Eredivisie&apos;s top scorer this season with 12 goals. &quot;If they [Chelsea] want me, it would be a great honour. I would be glad to go to such a club,&quot; Bony, a former Sparta Prague player, is quoted as saying in the Czech newspaper Pravo. &quot;I love English football and wouldn&apos;t be afraid to play there. If Chelsea are interested in the winter and the clubs reach an agreement, then why not?&quot; The player has a contract with Vitesse until 2015 and would reportedly cost around \u00a38m to prize away from the Dutch club, with Liverpool, Everton, Aston Villa and Wigan also making eyes at the 23 year old. Bony, you will not be surprised to hear, is just one of many forwards linked with Liverpool at the moment, with the Merseysiders also said to be keen on adding Shakhtar Donetsk&apos;s Luiz Adriano to their shallow pool of goalscorers. The 25-year-old Brazilian has scored 45 times in 107 appearances for the Russian club and, along with compatriots Willian and Fernandinho, impressed English scouts during Shakhtar&apos;s two recent Champions League ties with Chelsea. Arsenal and Tottenham are also said to be tracking the player. And if Liverpool cannot get Adriano, there is always Domenico Berardi, the 18-year-old Italian who has scored three goals in 10 appearances for Serie B side Sassuolo and now is suddenly wanted by not only Brendan Rodgers&apos;s club but also by Manchester City, Manchester United, Southampton, Juventus and Roma. &quot;We have received accreditation requests to view our games in recent times from such English clubs such as Liverpool and Southampton,&quot; said Sassuolo&apos;s general director, Nereo Bonato, while Berardi&apos;s agent, Giuseppe Galli, has claimed there is &quot;real interest&quot; from the other clubs mentioned. Hmmm ... seeing really will be believing with this one. Finally on the &quot;Liverpool desperately need a striker front&quot;; Nicolas Anelka is supposedly keen on a return to the club having decided he has had enough of life at Shanghai Shenhua. West Ham and Queens Park Rangers are said to be interested in bringing the 33-year-old Frenchman back to England but Anelka wants to return to Anfield, where he spent a successful loan spell in 2002. One stumbling block for any club chasing Anelka may well be the \u00a3250,000-a-week salary he is earning in Shanghai, although the QPR owner, Tony Fernandes, is said to be willing to pay that having wasted, sorry ... spent a lot of money on funding Mark Hughes&apos;s new-look side already. Speaking of QPR, Joey Barton wants to make his loan move to Marseille a long-term deal. The 30 year old joined the French club at the end of August having caused more than a little fuss at Loftus Road and is loving life in Ligue 1 so much that he has no desire to return to these shores. &quot;If I were the one to decide, I&apos;d stay at Marseille,&quot; Barton is quoted as saying.

The presentation of the seven men in dark suits, at a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, offered little encouragement to the growing numbers pressing for economic, social and particularly political reforms in China. It was only the second orderly transition in the more than six decades since the founding of the People&apos;s Republic by revolutionaries including Xi&apos;s father. But it has been preceded by months of turbulence and sharp-elbowed political manoeuvrings. After five years as heir apparent, 59-year-old Xi gave a confident performance as he introduced his colleagues to the waiting media. The message was one of a clean start, with the outgoing leader, Hu Jintao, giving up the chairmanship of the central military commission immediately; his predecessor, Jiang Zemin, took two years to do so. Xi will be first among equals in the top decision-making body. Li Keqiang, who will replace Wen Jiabao as premier, has already served one term on the committee with him. It has been cut from nine members to seven, apparently to make decision-making more effective. Some think that may prove harder than expected because Jiang&apos;s influence has helped to win more places than expected for his proteges. But others say it is hard to draw a straight line between personal networks and policy choices or even between an individual&apos;s approach to different areas of policy; some of the new members are seen as financial modernisers even if politically conservative. The new body includes conservative figures such as Zhang Dejiang, who trained in economics in North Korea, and the propaganda official Liu Yunshan. The other members are Yu Zhensheng, party chief in Jiang&apos;s stronghold of Shanghai, Zhang Gaoli, in charge of Tianjin, and Wang Qishan, who has taken the discipline portfolio. That move has been variously interpreted as a sign that the party will get tough on abuses after years of promising to do so or an attempt to ensure his financial expertise does not lead to him overshadowing Li when the latter becomes premier. Crucially, two leaders seen as more sympathetic to reform, the Guangdong party secretary, Wang Yang, and organisation department head, Li Yuanchao, failed to reach the top body. Zhang Gaoli was impassive as he surveyed the audience from the red-carpeted platform, but other leaders smiled as Xi introduced them during the session, which lasted less than 20 minutes. All wore dark red ties bar Wang, who sported a blue tie. Kerry Brown of the University of Sydney argued that the outcome of years of political jostling was increased power for Xi within a &quot;dual core leadership&quot; with Li Keqiang. &quot;It is really the Xi-Li show. They are deeply networked individuals and both have a power base,&quot; he said. &quot;The others aren&apos;t ever going to take away from their glory if they get things right,&quot; he added, describing their colleagues as &quot;not particularly disruptive&quot;. All the new members of the body are older figures, meaning that under existing rules they should have to retire in five years&apos; time, while Xi and Li carry on to another term. But Zhang Jian, a political scientist at Beijing University, argued: &quot;I don&apos;t think the other five guys will just sit there \u2026 I expect to see perhaps a little bit more paralysis.&quot; Jean-Pierre Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University told Reuters: &quot;The leadership is divided. I&apos;m not saying that they&apos;re not going to try anything. It&apos;s easier for them to move to a new growth model. I think they agree upon that and that won&apos;t be the hardest task. But I see a lot of political paralysis in terms of changing the political system. I don&apos;t see any headway.&quot; In a deliberately opaque system that prizes consensus and continuity, it is impossible to be certain what Xi stands for and what his priorities will be \u2013 still less to know whether he will be able to carry out whatever plans he has in mind. After numerous scandals over corruption, most notoriously over former Politburo member Bo Xilai - now facing prosecution following his wife&apos;s conviction for murdering British businessman Neil Heywood - it was perhaps inevitable that Xi would have to address the issue of official abuses and growing public cynicism. &quot;Inside the party there are problems that need to be addressed, especially the problems of corruption, taking bribes, being out of touch with the people, undue emphasis on formalities and bureaucratism, which must be addressed by great efforts,&quot; he pledged. But there was no hint that Xi would embrace new methods of tackling the problems. Many believe greater transparency and accountability are needed to root out corruption. Xi also praised the &quot;bravery and wisdom&quot; of the Chinese people, yet went on to add: &quot;Our people love life and yearn for better education, stable jobs, more satisfactory income, greater social security, improved medical and health care and more comfortable living conditions and a more beautiful environment.&quot; Zhang Jian, a political scientist at Beijing University, said: &quot;He carefully did not mention people wanting more decisions in their own lives.&quot; He noted that Xi had portrayed the Chinese people as being concerned with food and housing but having &quot;no aspirations beyond material goods&quot;. Xi is not only the &quot;princeling&quot; son of a venerated revolutionary figure, Xi Zhongxun, but enjoys strong connections across the party and with the military thanks to his previous roles. His second wife, Peng Liyuan, is a famous military singer who was better known than her husband for many years. They have one daughter, who is currently studying at Harvard. As expected the standing committee is entirely male, although there are now two female members of the 25-strong Politburo thanks to the elevation of the Fujian party secretary, Sun Chunlan.

While Hu is determinedly anonymous, Xi is &quot;a big personality&quot;, according to those who have met him. Standing over 6ft tall, he is confident and affable. He boasts a ready smile and a glamorous second wife \u2013 the renowned People&apos;s Liberation Army singer Peng Liyuan. He has expressed his fondness for US war movies and, perhaps more surprisingly, praised the edgy independent film-maker Jia Zhangke. This is, in part, a generational and social shift. Xi is 59 and, like the other rising stars in Chinese politics, grew up in the era of reform and opening. While Hu&apos;s first visit to the US was in 2002, Xi and his peers have travelled frequently and several have personal links with the west. Xi&apos;s daughter is studying at Harvard and a sister is thought to live in Canada. And like many of his peers, he is a &quot;princeling&quot; \u2013 someone who has experienced both privilege and prejudice as the child of a powerful Communist party figure. Xi was born in 1953 to Xi Zhongxun, a Long March hero who later became a vice-premier, and Qi Xin. He grew up in the relative comfort of Zhongnanhai, the party elite&apos;s red-walled Beijing compound. Loneliness But when he was only nine his father fell from grace with Mao Zedong. Six years later, as the cultural revolution wreaked havoc, young Xi was dispatched to the dusty, impoverished north-western province of Shaanxi to &quot;learn from the masses&quot;. He spent seven years living in a cave home in Liangjiahe village. &quot;I ate a lot more bitterness than most people,&quot; he once told a Chinese magazine. He has described struggling with the fleas, the hard physical labour and the sheer loneliness. There is, of course, a well-established Communist iconography of learning to serve the people. But political commentator Li Datong suggests this &quot;double background&quot; has proved genuinely formative for princelings such as Xi and might even lead them to bolder policy-making. &quot;One aspect is their family background as children of the country&apos;s founders and the other is their experience of being sent to the countryside, which made them understand China&apos;s real situation better. It gives this generation a strong tradition of idealism and the courage to do something big,&quot; he said. Although he has openly criticised the cultural revolution, Xi embraced the party; in a WikiLeaks cable an academic who knew Xi as a young man suggested he &quot;chose to survive by becoming redder than red&quot;. Family links helped him to win a place studying chemical engineering at the elite Tsinghua University, followed by a post as aide to a powerful military leader, Geng Biao \u2013 the beginning of his useful People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) connections. Next came a more surprising move \u2013 his choice, says political expert Zhang Xiaojin \u2013 to an unglamorous post in Hebei province. He may have hoped to shake off suggestions of benefiting from his family name. It was as deputy secretary of Zhengding county that he visited Muscatine, a US town of 23,000 until now best known for its melons and Mark Twain&apos;s brief sojourn there in 1855. &quot;He was a very polite and kind guy. I could see someone very devoted to his work \u2013 there was no golfing on that trip, that&apos;s for sure,&quot; said Eleanor Dvorchak, who hosted Xi in her son&apos;s old room, where he slept amid football wallpaper and Star Trek figurines. &quot;He was serious. He was a man on a mission.&quot; Sarah Lande, who organised the trip, said his confidence was obvious even through a translator. &quot;You could tell he was in charge \u2026 he seemed relaxed and welcoming and able to handle things,&quot; she said. &quot;He had the words he wanted to express himself easily.&quot; The acquaintance who spoke to WikiLeaks claimed Xi always had his &quot;eye on the prize&quot; of a major party post. He transferred to southern Fujian province in 1985, climbing steadily upwards over 17 years. Most of his experience has been earned in China&apos;s relatively prosperous, entrepreneurial coastal areas, where he courted investors and built up business, proving willing to adopt new ideas. The former US treasury secretary Hank Paulson called him &quot;the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line&quot;. After the toppling of Shanghai&apos;s party secretary, Chen Liangyu, in a corruption scandal, Xi took charge of the city in 2007. Barely six months later his elevation to the politburo standing committee \u2013 the top political body \u2013 signalled that he was expected to succeed Hu. In October 2010 his appointment as vice-chair of the central military commission cemented his position. He describes his own thinking as pragmatic, and throughout his rise he has cultivated a down-to-earth image; in the provinces he ate in government canteens and often dressed down. In a burst of publicity shortly before his 2007 promotion his wife lauded his humble nature and devotion to duty, revealing that on their second date he warned her he would not have much time for family life. And in a system known for corruption, he also has a clean reputation. One friend told the LA Times the worst the paper was likely to find were overdue library books. But while Xi is well-liked and adept at glad-handing, he appears to give little of importance away. Even his popular wife has retreated into the background as he has assumed increasing prominence. The US ambassador, Gary Locke, recently observed that he was &quot;very personable&quot; but that US officials &quot;really don&apos;t know that much about him&quot;. Close association with particular policies or factions has its dangers. Becoming general secretary of the party, and thus leader of China, is &quot;an issue of who opposes you rather than who supports you&quot;, said Kerry Brown, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. Beyond his openness to economic reforms, Xi is known primarily as a figure who appeals to different groupings and as a safe pair of hands. &quot;In recent years he has taken care of large-scale events, including Olympics and anniversaries, and there haven&apos;t been any big mistakes. Xi has steadily been through these tests,&quot; said Zhang. In 2007 he leapfrogged Li Keqiang \u2013 until then seen as likely to succeed Hu, but seen perhaps as too much Hu&apos;s protege \u2013 as the consensus candidate in a system built on collective decision-making. Xi&apos;s networks are unusually broad, according to Brown: &quot;Provincially; through his family; and with the military through Geng Biao. His elevation is in the interests of the widest group of people and opposed by the smallest group.&quot; It is the same relatively small elite who will determine what he can do with the job. Liberal Some hope he shares his father&apos;s liberal sympathies: Xi senior was not only a noted economic reformer, but an ally of reformist leader Hu Yaobang. Some say he criticised the military crackdown on Tiananmen Square&apos;s pro-democracy protests in 1989. They say that grassroots organisations burgeoned during the vice-president&apos;s stint in Zhejiang, and there was progress in the election of independent candidates at local polls. But the Chinese Human Rights Defenders network has argued the province also saw &quot;zealous persecution&quot; of dissidents, underground Christians and activists: &quot;His track record does not bode well,&quot; it wrote. Other China watchers point to shattered hopes that Hu might prove politically liberal. Nor does Xi&apos;s confidence in overseas dealings necessarily indicate a more emollient approach to foreign relations. His most-quoted remark to date was made on a trip to Mexico in 2009: &quot;There are some well fed foreigners who have nothing better to do than point fingers at our affairs. China does not, first, export revolution; second, export poverty and hunger; third, cause troubles for you. What else is there to say?&quot; In any case, to read Xi as a man in sole control of the agenda is to fundamentally misunderstand the Chinese political system. He will be &quot;first among equals&quot; in the nine-member standing committee, say analysts. Hu and other former leaders will still exert influence; and 2011&apos;s five-year plan has plotted the immediate course. The system &quot;is in favour of moderation, and nothing can change quickly. Steady as it goes. The political rhythm first has to be installed \u2026 significant shifts will come later,&quot; said Dr David Kelly, director of the Beijing-based political thinktank China Policy. Some think Xi&apos;s networks may allow him to strike out more confidently than Hu. Others think he will struggle to win support for bold decisions needed to tackle the country&apos;s mounting challenges. &quot;I think he&apos;s a more instinctive and gut-driven politician and may surprise us. Others say the system and the vested interests around him are too strong,&quot; said Brown. His leadership will be shaped by his colleagues and framed by external forces. &quot;What&apos;s very important is the capacity to be on the right side of history,&quot; said Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution in Washington. &quot;He himself probably does not know what he will do.&quot; Pocket profile Born June 1953 Career His father was a revolutionary hero and a steady rise through party ranks, aided by expert networking, is set to take Xi to the very top. His family background has dogged him at times but also speeded him on his course. High point Emerging as heir apparent to Hu Jintao at the 17th party congress in 2007. Many had expected Li Keqiang \u2013 now expected to become premier \u2013 to take the position. Low point Coming last in the vote for membership of the central committee in 1997, amid hostility to princelings. Connections won him a place as an alternate. What he says &quot;Are you trying to give me a fright?&quot; (when asked by a reporter, in 2002, whether he would be a top leader within the decade). What they say &quot;He&apos;s more assertive than Hu Jintao. When he enters the room, you know there is a significant presence here \u2026 [But] when they rise through their hierarchy, it serves no purpose to indicate differences or even alternative directions.&quot; (Henry Kissinger)", "tags": ["Xi Jinping", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-15T09:21:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/15/china-xi-succeeds-jiang-communist", "sentences": ["The other members are Yu Zhensheng, party chief in Shanghai; Zhang Gaoli, in charge of Tianjin; and Wang Qishan, who has taken the discipline portfolio."], "title": "China unveils new faces but old policies as Xi takes over party and military", "article": "China unveiled its new leader on Thursday as Xi Jinping gained control of both the Communist party and the military for the next decade, with a speech and team of colleagues that gave no hint of a change in the country&apos;s course. It was only the second orderly transition since the founding of the People&apos;s Republic by revolutionaries, who included Xi&apos;s father. But the handover has been preceded by months of turbulence and sharp-elbowed political manoeuvring for places on the top political body. Former leader Jiang Zemin&apos;s influence seems to have produced a broadly conservative politburo standing committee, disappointing those who had been pressing for reforms. But Xi has 10 years ahead of him and some think his confidence and connections; his control over the military; the reduction of the committee from nine to seven seats; and the press of events might yet result in bolder decisions than seen under his predecessor, Hu Jintao. Though Xi&apos;s ascension was signalled five years ago, the public saw its full new leadership for the first time as the men in dark suits filed on to a red-carpeted platform in front of international media, under the glittering chandeliers of the Great Hall of the People. Chinese politics employs both spectacle and concealment: the demonstration of power \u2013 via the grandeur of the newly concluded party congress and the crush of journalists vying for shots on Thursday \u2013 yet the obfuscation of its workings. &quot;They actually operate in a way to deify the power \u2026 if you get to see how they talk and discuss things, it reduces the mystery of power,&quot; said Wang Zhengxu, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Nottingham. &quot;But they also want to communicate to the public that the central committee and its politburo are making decisions according to rules for the benefit of the public.&quot; No one can be sure what Xi stands for, still less what he will achieve as the first among equals. The scarcity of hard facts have also led to analysts noting, albeit mostly with tongues in cheeks, the relative size of chairs at the congress and the decision of one new leader to wear a blue rather than red tie. Xi, 59, gave a confident, relaxed performance as he introduced his colleagues. Li Keqiang, who will replace Wen Jiabao as premier, has already served one term on the committee with Xi. New arrivals include conservative figures such as Zhang Dejiang, who trained in economics in North Korea, and propaganda official Liu Yunshan. The other members are Yu Zhensheng, party chief in Shanghai; Zhang Gaoli, in charge of Tianjin; and Wang Qishan, who has taken the discipline portfolio. That move has been variously interpreted as a sign that the party will get tough on abuses or an attempt to ensure his financial expertise does not overshadow Li. The group is entirely male, although the number of women on the broader 25-member politburo doubled \u2013 to two. The Fujian party secretary, Sun Chunlan, has joined Liu Yandong. Two leaders seen as more sympathetic to reform, Guangdong party secretary Wang Yang and organisation department head Li Yuanchao, failed to reach the standing committee. But experts note that members seen as socially and politically conservative may still be open to financial modernisation and some economic reforms. Kerry Brown, of the University of Sydney, said the composition meant increased power for Xi within a &quot;dual-core leadership&quot; with Li Keqiang, describing their new colleagues as &quot;not particularly disruptive&quot;. All are older figures who would normally retire after one five-year term. But Zhang Jian, a political scientist at Peking University, argued: &quot;I don&apos;t think the other five guys will just sit there \u2026 I expect to see perhaps a little bit more paralysis.&quot; Xi sought to reach beyond the party to the public with a relatively conversational speech. After the scandal over former politburo member Bo Xilai \u2013 now facing prosecution following his wife&apos;s conviction for murdering British businessman Neil Heywood \u2013 it was perhaps inevitable he would have to address official abuses and growing public cynicism. &quot;Inside the party there are problems that need to be addressed, especially the problems of corruption, taking bribes, being out of touch with the people, undue emphasis on formalities and bureaucratism, which must be addressed by great efforts,&quot; he pledged. But there was no hint of a new approach to tackling the problems. &quot;It was powerful, down-to-earth, authoritative, and calm. He did not have empty conventional talk,&quot; said Li Weidong, a Beijing-based political commentator. &quot;I don&apos;t have any expectation of political reform. However, I have hopes of them improving normal people&apos;s lives, reducing the gap between the rich and the poor, and solving the problems that normal people are demanding [answers to] now.&quot; Xi said people yearned &quot;for better education, stable jobs, more satisfactory income, greater social security, improved medical and healthcare, and more comfortable living conditions and a more beautiful environment&quot;. Zhang Jian noted: &quot;He carefully did not mention people wanting more decisions in their own lives.&quot; Xi is not only the &quot;princeling&quot; son of a venerated revolutionary figure, Xi Zhongxun, but enjoys strong party and military connections across the party and with the military thanks to his previous roles. Hu waited two years to take over chairmanship of the central military commission from Jiang after becoming the party&apos;s leader, but Xi has already claimed the position.

It is the world&apos;s largest emitter of CO2 gases and 70% of China&apos;s rivers and lakes are contaminated. As such &quot;green&quot; hasn&apos;t really featured as a selling point for travel to the Middle Kingdom. Until now. A new retreat tucked among the bamboo forests and tea plantations of Zhejiang province \u2013 a two-and-a-half-hour journey from Shanghai \u2013 has become a highly comprehensive ecoresort. The Naked Stables Private Reserve has been built to provide sustainable tourism in some of China&apos;s prettiest countryside. The 60-acre reserve is trying to become the first resort of its size in Asia to achieve platinum certification in the US Green Building Council&apos;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design programme. Examples of smaller scale ecotourism resorts in China include the Red Capital Ranch (redcapitalclub.com.cn), which offers guests a private entrance to a wild section of the Great Wall and accommodation in 10\u00a0rustic standalone villas. In Xishuangbanna, southern Yunnan province, Yourantai Bed &amp; Breakfast (yourantai.com) is located on a former rubber plantation and promotes sustainability by using local carpenters and wood salvaged from old Dai minority village houses to recreate traditional Dai architecture. Yourantai aims to help restore bio-diversity in the area. But while eco-tourism and sustainability is gaining traction in China, it still has a long way to go.     Room at Naked Stables Private Reserve    When I visited Naked Stables, the first thing that hit me was the winter sunshine pouring through the windows of the reception hall. The second was the view: outside, beyond a wood-decked terrace, spacious lawn, and infinity pool, stretches a vista of lush green mountains. Naked Stables is the creation of Grant Horsfield, a South African determined to import the hospitality of his homeland. Asian influences are provided by his wife, Hong Kong-native Delphine Yip, a partner at a Shanghai architect&apos;s practice \u2013 she is the site&apos;s chief planner and architect. This is not Horsfield&apos;s first project, he also set up the Naked Home Village, consisting of eight converted homesteads, in nearby Moganshan in 2007. The couple worked closely with their neighbours to keep relations smooth: more than 150\u00a0local artisans and labourers were hired during Naked Stables&apos; construction phase, while a further 120 villagers from the immediate area work as staff. The idea came out of a\u00a0desire to provide an accessible beauty spot near Shanghai. &quot;I was surprised that if you don&apos;t play golf, there was nothing you could do to take you out of the city,&quot; said Horsfield. It is the South African atmosphere that prevails, from the stews served in the main restaurant to the cow hides that line the wood floors and sofas of the clubhouse. It&apos;s a theme that attracts both wealthy Chinese locals looking for a novelty experience and expats hungry for something more familiar; however, travellers to the country may find it disappointing that Horsfield has utilised so little from traditional China. By next summer it is hoped that 30% of the produce served in the restaurant will be organically sourced from the property&apos;s own gardens. Animals, including sheep, chicken, ducks, and water buffalo, will be reared to eat. There are even plans to reintroduce the endangered native Sika (or Spotted) deer. Sika deer were once endemic to China but the wild population is now less than 1,000 due to destruction of habitat and widespread hunting. At Naked Stables they will wander freely among the reserve&apos;s forest grounds.     Pool at Naked Stables Private Reserve    The result of such ambitious plans is a sort of safari-meets-upmarket-Center Parcs. Each villa is provided with a personal &quot;butler&quot;, cars are barred (guests are encouraged to walk or use electric golf buggies) and a series of activities, from horse riding to guided mountain hikes, kite-flying to yoga, are available. We stayed in one of the flagship Tree-Top Villas, perched on stilts among the foliage. Our villa&apos;s decor is Afro-minimalist, with vast high ceilings, tactile wood surfaces, and African-inspired hangings. Most decadent is a bath tub with views over a\u00a0huge canopy of woodland. The villas are designed to be highly energy efficient. Smaller mud Earth Huts are made using rammed earth walls. Here, mud and insulation foam are bound together by a string of concrete to create a thick mask which insulates the hut, meaning less cooling and heating is needed. To top it all off, 100% of the reserve&apos;s water is recycled. Such sustainable luxury doesn&apos;t come cheap, however: two-bedroom Tree-Top Villas start from \u00a3460 per night (three and four bedroom villas are also available), while the Earth Huts for two people begin at \u00a3150. Staying at Naked Stables is a polished, rather than an authentic, experience. It&apos;s perfect for those with a family who want minimal hassle. And it&apos;s easy to not wander beyond the reserve&apos;s gates. But for those in search of the &quot;real China&quot;, it can be found just outside. We take a three-and-a-half hour amble through local villages leading up to Moganshan. The mountainous hamlet is covered by bamboo plantations, and sits 700m above the East China plain. Foreigners living in Shanghai started using the hillside as a summer retreat in the late 19th century to escape the stifling summer heat. They were followed by Shanghai&apos;s gang bosses. Today, Moganshan offers the perfect rustic escape. Guests can stay in the Naked Home Village&apos;s converted European-style farmhouses dotted on a steep pathway up the mountain, which cost from \u00a335pp a night at the Purple Ridge Lodge (minimum 12 people) or \u00a3106 for a two-person Studio. The Moganshan Lodge (moganshanlodge.com) run by veteran China ex-pat and Moganshan resident Mark Kitto (author of China Cuckoo: How I Lost a Fortune and Found a Life in China) and his Guangzhou-born wife Joanna, is the only place for miles to find fresh coffee, English breakfasts and home-cured bacon (sourced from local pork). Adjacent is the Songliang Hotel (moganshanlodge.com), which, with rooms starting from just \u00a328 a night, is best for those looking for a dose of mountain isolation on a budget. We walked back down a road lined with concrete Chinese-style homes; at its end were pretty European-style stone inns at the tip of the mountain. Farmers were hacking down bamboo and transporting bamboo sticks on motorcycles \u2013 and eyeing us suspiciously. It was an interesting insight into real life in China&apos;s rural hinterland. But it was also good to know that just down the road there was a hot tub waiting for us. \u2022 The trip was provided by Naked Retreats (nakedretreats.cn)", "tags": ["China holidays", "Green travel", "Ethical holidays", "Adventure travel", "Cultural trips", "Asia", "Travel", "Shanghai holidays"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-16T22:45:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/nov/16/photography-websites-publications-and-galleries", "sentences": ["GALLERIES Open Eye Liverpool&apos;s newly redesigned Open Eye&apos;s main exhibition, from\u00a07 December, will be A Lecture Upon the Shadow, featuring artists from the north-west and Shanghai."], "title": "The best photography websites, publications and galleries | Guardian photography guide", "article": "ONLINE  Lensculture  features essays, slideshows, audio and visual interviews and incisive criticism, making it one of the most authoritative and wide-ranging sites. 1000 Words Photography is the online blog of the magazine of the same name, edited by Tim Clark.

She has been sharing a few locker-room secrets and we have somehow got around to the speculation of a relationship between Serena Williams, with whom she is friendly on the Tour, and Laura&apos;s former coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. &quot;I don&apos;t think I should even be going into this conversation,&quot; she says, laughing. &quot;Uhm, I think he&apos;s done a very good job ... Hah! Yeah ... whatever he&apos;s doing is obviously working ... tennis\u2011wise!&quot; There is a lot to like about Robson. Not only has her tennis matured to the point where the expectations heaped on her are now reasonable rather than idiotically out-sized, but she has somehow hung on to her all-round niceness in a sport that does not always encourage that quality. Robson, currently ranked 53rd in the world, leads, we discover, a reassuringly normal life. She passed her driving test a year ago, but does not own a car and rarely drives because she prefers to travel by Tube. She flies down the back of the plane, because, well, it&apos;s all she can afford \u2013 and, anyway, she doesn&apos;t suffer from jet-lag because she can sleep anywhere, any time. She has no plans to leave home, because her mother, Kathy, is such a good cook. She finds China boring, and kills time there making Gangnam videos on her iPad (the latest of which went viral on YouTube). And, no, Serena is not the queen bee of tennis. &quot;I&apos;ve always found her very pleasant,&quot; she says. &quot;The locker room doesn&apos;t really revolve around any one player \u2013 people just shower and leave. But I&apos;ve had a good locker, the same one at the US Open the last two years. &quot;I&apos;ve got [Maria] Sharapova on one side, Serena on the other, then it&apos;s all the past champions in various different places. I&apos;ve got a [Martina] Hingis locker near me, but I never really want to take the past champion&apos;s locker. This year they had a qualifier using Hingis&apos;s locker and I thought, maybe best to leave that to one of the senior players.&quot; Hingis would like that. The Swiss invited Robson to join her to train when Laura was 11, and the thrill for the London prodigy has stayed with her ever since. For someone with realistic ambitions of breaking into the top flight after a wonderful 2012 \u2013 in which she beat the former world No 1 Kim Clijsters at Flushing Meadows in the Belgian&apos;s farewell appearance, gave Sharapova a fright at the Olympics and then won\u00a0a silver medal with Andy Murray in the mixed\u00a0doubles \u2013 Robson is well grounded. She&apos;s not even sure how much\u00a0she is worth and, no, she is not remotely near being a millionaire. &quot;I wish!&quot; she squeals. Did she think she&apos;d changed much since sending the media into overdrive by winning Junior Wimbledon when she was 14? &quot;I think I was nicer then,&quot; she says. It&apos;s hard to believe \u2013 especially when she says the last time she was &quot;super angry&quot; was, &quot;when I was 13 and I was playing my coach in a mini-tennis game. I was playing with my right hand, he was playing with his left, and I lost a best-of-five match, each set up to 10, and I broke one of my rackets.&quot; Disgraceful. But Robson can see humour where others see only discord and controversy. She rather enjoyed, for instance, Novak Djokovic&apos;s spectacular racket-bashing in Shanghai recently. What has become the most irritating trend in women&apos;s tennis, grunting, bothers her not a jot. In the moment of her greatest triumph, against Clijsters, the enormity of the occasion barely disturbed her sense of wonder. &quot;That was the first time I&apos;d played on Arthur Ashe so you have to enjoy yourself when you&apos;re on there. It was after the first set and they played a Taylor Swift song, and I was singing on along to it. I looked up at Abi [Tordoff, her long-time agent] and she was giggling. Then I thought, no, I shouldn&apos;t be singing this song. So, after that, I tried to focus a little bit more.&quot; How distant is such innocence from the cynicism perceived to be at the heart of professional sport? Yet Robson somehow carries her personality on to the court, hitting as freely as she glides through life, without a care for unknown consequences, yet not disrespectful of the demands and pressures of her high-powered existence. She only recently was acquainted with the financial side of her life, when her father, Andrew, took her to see the local bank manager. She was surprised to learn in those talks that, &quot;almost 30% of footballers end up going bankrupt, so my dad is being very, very cautious \u2013 not that I would ever go crazy. You just have to be aware that it is such a short career and you have to do as much as you can to save.&quot; To that end, she shops within the confines of the allowance he gives her \u2013 and she doesn&apos;t waste money on travel, either. &quot;I&apos;m paying for my own flights, so it&apos;s definitely economy. I&apos;ve never really suffered from jet lag. I have the gift of being able to sleep anywhere; even in cars on the way to the airport, I&apos;m fast asleep. I like the window seat, and I just don&apos;t get up for eight hours. On the way to China, I slept for a solid 12 hours.&quot; Does her new coach, the no-nonsense Croatian Zeljko Krajan mind the cost-cutting? &quot;I think so, but he has to deal with it. Business class is too expensive for my ranking.&quot; What do other passengers think, sitting alongside a sports celebrity down the back of the bus? &quot;A few times people say hello; it&apos;s a bit awkward when they ask for a photo as well.&quot; It&apos;s all still a grand adventure, and Robson doesn&apos;t see it changing soon. All she wants for Christmas \u2013 her first at home since 12 months before she won Junior Wimbledon \u2013 is another puppy. &quot;But maybe three dogs is too much ...&quot;", "tags": ["Laura Robson", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-18T00:44:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/18/jaguar-land-rover-factory-china", "sentences": ["Jaguar Land Rover has signalled the importance of China to its growth prospects by starting the construction of a factory outside Shanghai.", "JLR and its Chinese partner, Chery, formally laid the foundation stone for a plant in Changshu, near Shanghai, as part of a 10.9bn yuan (\u00a31.1bn) investment that will include a new research centre and an engine production facility."], "title": "Jaguar Land Rover building factory in China", "article": "Jaguar Land Rover has signalled the importance of China to its growth prospects by starting the construction of a factory outside Shanghai.

I didn&apos;t even realise his contract was up.&quot; But Ferdinand has since told Inside United: &quot;The best thing I can do is to look at it at Christmas, and then again in the summer, to see how I&apos;m feeling and go from there. But hearing the manager say things like that definitely puts the spring back in your step. &quot;I&apos;ll have a better idea of that in December or January time, when the games start coming thick and fast. That is when it really hits you and you know the hard work really has to start. I&apos;ll probably get a better gauge of where I&apos;m at fitness-wise and the benefit of having the summer off then.&quot; Despite a long-standing back condition that means Ferdinand has to manage his fitness, the centre-back does not consider it a big issue and is intent on playing for as long as possible. He was heartened by the 38 appearances he managed in all competitions last season and this term he has missed only two of United&apos;s 12 league games, forming a partnership with Jonny Evans. While the defender&apos;s stance may be a negotiating move, his current deliberations could potentially hang on whether he is tempted by a fresh challenge at the close of his career. There has been at least one recent offer from China for Ferdinand to consider. Currently earning around \u00a3130,000 a week, a move there would prove to be highly lucrative for the 81-times capped former England defender. Nicolas Anelka left Chelsea for Shanghai Shenhua in January for around \u00a3175,000 a week, and Didier Drogba joined him in the summer on a two-and-a-half year deal worth a reported $310,000 (\u00a3195,000) a week. Regarding Ferdinand&apos;s comments on his future at United, Ferguson said last Friday: &quot;It will sort itself out, I am sure.&quot;", "tags": ["Rio Ferdinand", "Football", "Sport", "Manchester United"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-18T23:03:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/nov/20/david-beckham-australia-china-la-galaxy", "sentences": ["Her fashion business is an international success, and somewhere like Shanghai, where Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka play for one of the city&apos;s two Chinese Super League teams amid the fast-proliferating neon skyscrapers, might be appealing."], "title": "David Beckham will likely opt for one more venture into the unknown | Richard Williams", "article": "     When David Beckham says he intends to take on one more challenge before hanging up his boots, we had better take him seriously. Since Sir Alex Ferguson ended his dream of staying at Old Trafford for the whole of his playing career, Beckham has handled his moves across the football chessboard with considerable shrewdness and few missteps. One day he will probably take up the option he negotiated on his arrival in the United States, the one offering him the chance to head up a newly-formed Major League Soccer club (known as an expansion team). Or he might return to LA Galaxy as an investor. Before that, however, there is still business to be done, and the last dregs of pleasure to be squeezed out of playing on the pitch. Along with underestimating his talent for kicking a ball and influencing the course of a match, the mistake many people make about Beckham is to assume that somehow almost anything in his life takes precedence over the actual game. But look at his record: here is a man who made his first-team debut at 17 and is still competing for a national title at 37. On the way he has played with distinction for Manchester United, Real Madrid, Milan and LA Galaxy, for whom he will play a final match on 1 December, in an attempt to retain the MLS Cup. His six years at the Home Depot Centre, where he will make his farewell appearance, have been a time of steady growth for a league that came into being at the time of the 1994 World Cup but endured difficult times until his arrival, with weaker teams going to the wall on a regular basis. If life in Lotus Land has been good to him and his family, then he has been good for Major League Soccer. It is still no threat to the national popularity of baseball, basketball or college and pro football, but it has carved out a solid niche, and he has been its figurehead of its journey to stability. True, there are some Galaxy fans who resent the two winters he spent on loan in Milan while trying to maintain his fitness in order to keep playing for England. Elsewhere, however, the supporters of his various clubs have nothing but praise for his contribution and commitment. In Madrid he won over a deeply sceptical Fabio Capello and helped secure a league title at the end of a difficult season. A couple of years later he did well enough at Milan, where he played under Carlo Ancelotti and Leonardo, for the club to try to hang on to him after his loan period came to an end. He was also able to avail himself there of the expertise from the team of physiologists that had prolonged the active life of such players as Paolo Maldini, Pippo Inzaghi and Clarence Seedorf. If Beckham has been a shade manipulative, plotting his way through football to his maximum advantage, then perhaps we can blame Ferguson, who gave him a brutal demonstration that loyalty means nothing. Unable, in his old-school way, to see the substance beneath the flashy trappings, the United manager not only discarded Beckham but ensured that the club made a vast profit from a player who had cost them nothing and had given them so much. That, if nothing else, taught Beckham how football works. There will be plenty of offers for his services in his final season. Some of them will probably come from England, with Queens Park Rangers potentially to the fore, especially if Harry Redknapp \u2013 who welcomed him to the training facilities at Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 takes over from Mark Hughes. Given Beckham&apos;s inherent and essentially unpretentious love of football, the modest environment of Loftus Road might not prove a deterrent to the acceptance of Tony Fernandes&apos;s money. But what sort of a challenge would that represent to a man who has already proved himself in four countries? Our last chance of seeing him in England probably vanished with his omission from Britain&apos;s Olympic football team, a decision that, after all his work on behalf of the 2012 bid, he swallowed with no public display of disappointment, leaving the rest of us to conclude that Stuart Pearce&apos;s threadbare team could only have been improved by his presence. To Beckham, a new challenge is more likely to involve another venture into terra incognita, with Australia and China among the favourites. His family&apos;s needs will also be taken into consideration. Like her husband, Victoria Beckham has overcome scepticism to build a free-standing career. Her fashion business is an international success, and somewhere like Shanghai, where Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka play for one of the city&apos;s two Chinese Super League teams amid the fast-proliferating neon skyscrapers, might be appealing. Paris Saint-Germain, where Ancelotti is making use of the Qatar Investment Fund&apos;s resources and Mrs Beckham would no doubt enjoy seeing her clothes in the boutiques of the Faubourg Saint-Honore, is another possibility, although it is hard to see her husband making much of an inroad into a side with Champions League pretensions. All in all, as the rumours have been saying, Australia&apos;s A League looks the best bet: Sydney FC if he and his family want the bustle and glamour of another great international city, Melbourne Heart if he fancies a slightly more laid-back life by the bay in St Kilda, Adelaide United if he likes the idea of watching cricket at one of the world&apos;s loveliest grounds, Newcastle Jets if he&apos;s interested in a reunion with his former England colleague Emile Heskey, and Perth Glory, amid the mineral-rich remoteness of Western Australia, if money is the principal lure. Whatever he decides, it will probably involve an element of risk as well as guaranteed reward. There was no shortage of scoffing when he announced that he was taking off for Southern California, but he made it work.

The centre forward, who left Chelsea for Shanghai Shenhua in the summer, has reached the end of the Chinese Super League season and he has a window in December before he reports for the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast in January.

Champions League teams must register their squad lists for the group stage with Uefa in September before their first match. Drogba scored Chelsea&apos;s equaliser in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich last May, together with the winning penalty in the shootout, and he might have stayed at the club if they had offered him the two-year contract that he wanted. But Chelsea said that they intended to build the attack around Torres and Drogba left as a Bosman free agent. Torres has struggled desperately in recent weeks and the nadir for him came on Tuesday night at Juventus, when he was dropped for the 3-0 Champions League defeat that precipitated the departure of Di Matteo, despite the club&apos;s only other recognised striker, Daniel Sturridge, being injured. Chelsea are expected to move for a new striker in January, with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&apos;s Radamel Falcao and Andre Sch\u00fcrrle of Bayer Leverkusen prominent on their wish list.

They didn&apos;t bother putting up a statement on their internet site. Instead, they relayed the news using an animated gif picturing Punxsutawney Phil scuttling out of his hole and running up a flight of stairs drawn by MC Escher and then along some horizontal stairs and then down some stairs and then back along some horizontal stairs while reading aloud the entire text of Finnegans Wake from &quot;riverrun past Eve and Adam&apos;s&quot; to &quot;a way a lone a last a loved a long the&quot; and then scuttling back into his hole and then scuttling out of his hole and running up a flight of stairs drawn by MC Escher and then along some horizontal stairs and then down some stairs and then back along some horizontal stairs while reading aloud the entire text of Finnegans Wake from &quot;riverrun past Eve and Adam&apos;s&quot; to &quot;a way a lone a last a loved a long the&quot; and then scuttling back into his hole and then scuttling out of his hole. Anyway, it all happened very early in the morning (or very late in the evening, depending on how developed your problem-drinking is). This explains a lot. Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay and chairman Bruce Buck had been under explicit orders from Roman Abramovich to &quot;sack the manager&quot; after the team were spanked 3-0, or 10-0 in moral terms, by Juventus in Big Cup, a result which leaves the holders unlikely to be holding on for very much longer. But Gourlay and Buck were feeling snoozy, and still had some sleepy dust in their eyes, and instead of firing Plain Old John Terry, the yawning pair accidentally handed the P45 to club mascot Di Matteo instead. The farce was further compounded with news that the security guard required to frogmarch Di Matteo off the premises is, because of the early hour of the dismissal, technically due to be paid double time, but wants to take a day off in lieu next week instead, and Chelsea are thinking about sacking someone else then. They&apos;ll probably have to nip down the agency to get a temp to cover for him. That&apos;s not the only knock-on effect of Abramovich&apos;s diktat, though. Chelsea are now looking for a new mascot to satisfy Abramovich and POJT, and reports suggest former Extremadura supremo Rafa Benitez is the chappie they&apos;re going to get. In many ways, that&apos;d be a strange choice. That&apos;s partly because the fans don&apos;t want him: two La Liga titles and a Big Cup is all good and well, but he&apos;s not yet proved he can throw a lasso around the moon, yank it down to ground, and convert it to diamonds, coins and marshmallow yum-yums, so fair play to them for standing their ground over that one. But it&apos;s mainly because the impressively belligerent Benitez \u2013 who has expressed interest in the role \u2013 isn&apos;t exactly the type to sit down, shut up, and smile nicely like a good boy while doing his boss&apos;s bidding. So if this deal does go through, sit back and wait for the kind of firework display over the Stamford Bridge boardroom that will make the immediate reaction to this appointment on Liverpool messageboards look like a damp squib. The first Catherine wheel will be lit in roughly 100 days&apos; time, 200 tops. By which time the Chelsea website editor will be dusting off that animated gif, with a view to coaxing Punxsutawney Phil out of his hole and sending him up a flight of stairs drawn by MC Escher and then along some horizontal stairs and then down some stairs and then back along some horizontal stairs while reading aloud the entire text of Finnegans Wake from &quot;riverrun past Eve and Adam&apos;s&quot; to &quot;a way a lone a last a loved a long the&quot; and then scuttling back into his hole and then scuttling out of his hole.

With training to take and a litany of non-existent grievances to scribble before his 5.30pm unveiling this afternoon, Ben\u00edtez hasn&apos;t yet had a chance to adjourn to his bedroom and explain, through the medium of green rectangles and assorted red, purple, white and green circles, how Milan&apos;s Philippe Mexes did such a good goal.

But then, seeing as the selfish Russian oligarch can&apos;t even be bothered factoring in the feelings of Chelsea supporters when making his decisions, it&apos;s difficult to imagine why he&apos;d concern himself with those of an unfunny tea-timely football email that still touts its lack of punctuality as one of its most endearing features, even though it&apos;s invariably sent an hour early these days and hasn&apos;t been late for several months. &quot;Chelsea Football Club can confirm Rafael Ben\u00edtez has been appointed interim first-team manager until the end of the season,&quot; parped a statement on the club&apos;s website, announcing an appointment that is sure to displease countless fans who don&apos;t like Ben\u00edtez for a number of reasons, the main ones being his fantastically entertaining public feud with The Special One and that time he publicly ridiculed the club&apos;s policy of handing out &quot;stupid plastic flags&quot; to their supporters in an heroically misguided bid to generate atmosphere on match days. It&apos;s probably fair to say that Ben\u00edtez won&apos;t be too worried what Chelsea fans think of him. As anyone who has seen Robin van Persie wheeling away from goal to bask in the adoration of fans who used to delight in singing very unpleasant songs about him will know, football fans are a fickle bunch and a few good results will be enough for Rafa to win most denizens of Stamford Bridge over. And for neutrals (translation: people who don&apos;t support Chelsea, but enjoy seeing them lose), the plot-lines of the never-ending football soap opera will be considerably enhanced by the return of a manager who suffers from extreme paranoia and an heroic disrespect for the authority of those who pay his wages. One of Ben\u00edtez&apos;s first moves since accepting the job of Keeping The Stamford Bridge Manager&apos;s Seat Warm For Pep has been to pin a deputy badge on the lapel of Bolo Zenden, who the Fiver has always found quite attractive, without ever actually being able to put its finger on the reason why. &quot;He was approached on Wednesday by Ben\u00edtez and is now on a flight.

The boys, who were found dead in the south-western province of Guizhou, were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning, apparently after lighting charcoal in an attempt to stay warm overnight. News of the deaths spread when Li Yuanlong, a former journalist in Bijie city, posted details on an online bulletin board. But, according to sources, soon after the revelations the authorities forced Li to take a &quot;vacation&quot;, a method often used to deal with activists and dissidents. The Bijie propaganda office denied the allegation, pointing to a note posted from Li&apos;s bulletin board account that said he had not been taken away and was simply attending to urgent business. But his son Li Muzi, who is studying in the United States, told the South China Morning Post his father had been put on a plane to a tourist destination he did not want disclosed. &quot;Apparently they are trying to prevent him from helping other reporters follow up on the incident,&quot; Li Muzi added. He said his father had asked him to delete a microblog post about the disappearance in case it meant he was kept away for longer. &quot;The [local] government is quite cruel in dealing with this issue,&quot; said Li Fangping, a Beijing-based lawyer and friend of the family. The Chinese Human Rights Defenders network said Li, 52, had previously served a two-year sentence for inciting subversion of state power and been put under pressure for writing about sensitive subjects. The authorities were quick to dismiss or suspend eight officials in the poor, mountainous region, but have been criticised for failing to address the underlying causes of the deaths and the delay in finding the boys, who Chinese media said had been reported missing 10 days before their deaths. Bijie officials denied police had been told of their disappearance. Li Fangping added: &quot;They just want the public to stop paying attention to the issue; they want to use this result [the sackings] to distract the public&apos;s attention \u2013 they are not concerned with the causes, the effect and its consequences; they are not analysing this incident; not asking why officials were responsible; not asking what the problems in the system and the emergency response mechanism were. [They] did not mention how to prevent it happening again. &quot;The officials did not mention at all why it is so common for students to drop out in this district or why there are no NGOs getting involved.&quot; Others blamed the children&apos;s families or warned that society as a whole needed to learn lessons from the tragedy. A commentator for the English language Shanghai Daily newspaper said the sacked staff had been made scapegoats &quot;for pervasive social apathy&quot;. The children, aged nine to 13, were cousins. Four were supposed to be under the care of an ageing, blind grandmother because their fathers were working as scrap collectors in Shenzhen, hundreds of miles away. All five had skipped school repeatedly. Tao Yuanwu, father of two of the victims, said the children refused to return to classes, saying they were getting poor grades and disliked studying. Studies have shown that children left behind by migrant worker parents are more likely to suffer educational and behavioural problems. But parents say they have little choice owing to long working hours and the hukou, or household registration system, which restricts the rights of migrant families to services such as education in cities. &quot;Unfortunately, this is certainly not an isolated case. It is very common for kids to be in the care of elderly grandparents who don&apos;t have the resources to give them the care they need, materially and in terms of upbringing and education,&quot; said Geoff Crothall, of China Labour Bulletin. A commentator for Caixin magazine pointed out there were 58 million left-behind children in China, warning that without further action &quot;the tragedy in Bijie is bound to happen again&quot;.

Animal handlers who worked on the set of the Lord of the Rings prequel project have accused Jackson&apos;s production company of responsibility for the deaths of horses, goats, chicken and sheep, mainly because the creatures were kept at a farm filled with bluffs, sinkholes and other &quot;death traps&quot;. They are backed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), which is threatening to protest at the New Zealand, US and UK premieres of the forthcoming debut instalment in the triptych, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and has written to Jackson stating its concerns. Jackson this week denied any ill-treatment of animals. Now Warner Bros has issued a statement in which the studio blames disgruntled animal trainers fired more than a year ago &quot;for [just] cause&quot;. &quot;Warner Bros Pictures and [its subsidiary] New Line Cinema join Peter Jackson and the producers of The Hobbit in vigorously refuting and condemning accusations of animal abuse on the films,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;The production acted swiftly and responsibly in addressing any incidents involving animals in its care throughout the long filming process, and in fact, measures were taken to protect all farm animals, including those uninvolved with the films.&quot; &quot;We question the timing of this misinformation \u2013 given The Hobbit&apos;s imminent release \u2013 and have no recourse other than to reveal that the primary source of these new allegations can be traced to freelance animal wranglers who were dismissed by the production over a year ago for cause. We are immensely proud of our association with Sir Peter Jackson, his dedicated film crew and the people of New Zealand.&quot; Peta, meanwhile, has stepped up its campaign against Jackson and his team, calling for them to commit to using only computer-generated animals on forthcoming productions. A spokesperson told the Guardian: &quot;Five whistleblowers reported more than two dozen animal deaths during the production of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. They raised concerns not just once but repeatedly to both the head wrangler and the head of production about the unsafe housing conditions for animals and about Shanghai the horse, who was hobbled (his legs reportedly tied together when he proved to be &apos;too energetic&apos; for his rider). But their concerns were outright ignored.&quot; The statement continued: &quot;It seems to Peta that instead of vainly defending himself, Jackson should be giving a firm assurance that this will never happen again. He is the CGI master and has the ability to make the animals and other interesting creatures in his movies 100% CGI, and Peta calls on him again to do so.&quot; Meanwhile, Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood, who appears briefly as Frodo Baggins in the new trilogy, has also weighed in on the subject. &quot;That [report] was the most ridiculous thing ever. It was really heartbreaking actually,&quot; he told TMZ. &quot;I didn&apos;t even read the full report, I just read the response to it. &quot;It was heartbreaking because I never saw any of those kind of conditions when I was down there. All of the technicians and everyone who works on the films take the utmost care of the animals that worked in the film.&quot; Woods adds: &quot;The timing is so obvious as well. We&apos;re premiering the movie in less than a week.

The cliche that it is grim up north contains &quot;more than a grain of truth&quot;, it will claim, with swaths of the country lacking the ability to champion their own needs and stimulate a rise in productivity. With London and Scotland being championed by Boris Johnson and Alex Salmond respectively, it is also important for the north to be able to talk with one voice, the report will argue. Days before the chancellor, George Osborne, delivers his autumn statement, the report will demand that there be an annual convention of northern leaders to set priorities for the region. The report, from an independent commission established by the IPPR thinktank, will reveal that the north \u2013 which it defines as incorporating three of England&apos;s nine official regions for statistical purposes: the north-west, Yorkshire and Humberside and the north east with a combined population of almost 15m \u2013 contributed just a fifth to the UK&apos;s economic prosperity in the last decade, compared with London and a population of 8.3m, which has contributed more than a quarter. It will further claim that halving the productivity gap between the north and the national average would increase the UK&apos;s national economic output by \u00a341bn. Boosting the north of England is therefore central to rebalancing the UK economy, the final report of the 18-month Northern Economic Future Commission will say. The study will show that, while Germany has seven urban centres in the top 20 European cities in terms of economic productivity and Spain has two, as does the Netherlands, the UK has just one: London. It argues that the government needs to boost the northern counties and suggests that Manchester should be the UK&apos;s second international hub airport, with flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Moscow, S\u00e3o Paulo, Mumbai and Delhi. It adds that an extra half a million jobs would raise the north&apos;s employment rate from 69.5% to nearly 75% by 2022, while raising household wealth to the OECD regional average would mean that households in the north would be on average \u00a3500 better off each year. The commission, comprised of business leaders, voluntary sector and local government leaders, will launch its findings at a conference in Leeds on Friday, addressed by the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander. It follows publication of a study from economists PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) showing that Britain&apos;s north-south divide has widened since the start of the recession and households in the north east and Yorkshire are among the hardest hit by rising unemployment. Stalling wage growth, rising taxes, public sector cuts and personal insolvencies are also piling the pressure disproportionately on people in the north, according to PwC&apos;s regional household financial stress index. The IPPR&apos;s commission will also support claims by the deputy prime minister in an interview with the Observer that the breakdown of the old economic model in which the north was subsidised by tax receipts from the City is the issue to address. The commission will report that since the crash in 2008 it has become apparent that the UK&apos;s economic growth model has been too dependent on the fortunes of the financial services sector. It will claim that a successful City of London represented a central \u2013 if not the only \u2013 plank of a national economic strategy that redistributed the tax revenues generated by financial services into supporting public sector employment and ameliorating low wages and economic inactivity elsewhere. It will say that the north of England can expect more cuts in central government spending, according to current plans, whether to social security benefits or departmental budgets. In these circumstances, it will add, the north needs to demand greater control over the levers of economic growth. It needs a bigger share of the nation&apos;s investment in infrastructure, and more power to shape its economic destiny. Through investment in the Northern Hub and Trans-Pennine Electrification, for example, commuters could travel between Liverpool and Leeds in 77 minutes \u2013 35 minutes faster than now, but such issues are not being prioritised. Ed Cox, director of IPPR North, said: &quot;If the north of England was to emulate its northern European neighbours, it might lead the UK economy out of its present lopsided doldrums and towards a more progressive and sustainable economic future. Only then will the national debate move on and the nation as a whole will accept that northern prosperity is national prosperity.&quot;", "tags": ["Economic policy", "Manchester", "UK news", "Thinktanks", "Politics", "Business", "Recession"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-24T21:15:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/25/rory-mcilroy-dp-world-tour-championship", "sentences": ["When Peter Hanson won at the BMW Masters in Shanghai, Rory pushed him all the way to the end by making late birdies."], "title": "Rory McIlroy labelled 'Tigeresque' after ending 2012 with win in Dubai", "article": "A golfer wearing red who closes with five single putts and five successive birdies on a Sunday afternoon to win a tournament by two. Sound familiar? It is to the immense credit of Rory McIlroy that he now performs as a matter of routine just like the man he once idolised, Tiger Woods, did as second nature in his unstoppable prime. It is five years since McIlroy burst on to the golfing scene; 2012, however, will go down as the one in which he endorsed his status as the finest player in the world. Those looking to topple McIlroy will acknowledge the depressing realisation that he is still only 23. If it was ever fanciful to suggest McIlroy could match the on-course achievements of Woods, such a prospect is now edging towards reality. &quot;I guess every goal I set myself for 2012, I have achieved this year,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;So it doesn&apos;t really get much better than\u00a0that.&quot; McIlroy&apos;s extraordinary season, in which he won five times including a major and formed part of a successful Ryder Cup team, culminated with the Northern Irishman standing with arms aloft on the 18th green of the Earth Course. He started the day in what was billed as a &quot;Duel in the Desert&quot; with Luke Donald but ended it having dealt with the challenge of another Englishman, Justin Rose, in what is now typically powerful fashion. McIlroy thereby added the Dubai World Championship to the Race to Dubai title he had already claimed upon arrival in the Emirates. The world No1 will meet 2013 with a ferocious appetite. &quot;The big difference this year has been that when I haven&apos;t been at my best, I have still competed and won tournaments,&quot; said McIlroy. &quot;That&apos;s something I said I wanted to get better at. Before this year, I felt my wins came when I just played great golf and nobody could get near me. &quot;Being able to win when not at your best is what Tiger has done for so many years. That&apos;s why he has won so many tournaments. I&apos;m definitely not at that level yet, but I&apos;m learning how to do it.&quot; It was difficult not to feel some sympathy for Rose, who emerged through the pack chasing McIlroy and Donald courtesy of a course record 62. Rose hit arguably the finest professional putt of the year on his 72nd hole, from 90ft, which stopped on the lip of the hole. The problem for Rose was that, when he finished at an aggregate of 21 under, McIlroy had just birdied the 14th. The Northern Irishman was perfectly aware of what was required next. &quot;I knew midway through the back nine that I needed to do something special,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;I guess, in a way, Justin gave me the opportunity to do what I did. Seeing a target and shooting at something definitely makes you more focused.&quot; Donald began the fourth round in a tie with McIlroy and in the midst of a run of 100 holes at this venue without dropping a shot. That sequence came to an end on the 3rd; Donald was unable to make another birdie until the 14th as his efforts rather petered out. There was merely the consolation of watching a McIlroy show which Donald admitted was &quot;Tigeresque&quot;. The world No2 added: &quot;To able to do that when he needed to is the sign that he has what it takes. It was pretty impressive stuff and it shows us all how hard we will have to work to stay up with him.&quot; There was bittersweet emotion for Rose, who had posted his lowest career score as a professional before succumbing to the McIlroy charge. Rose described his penultimate putt as &quot;great, great, great&quot; and can reflect on his own notable professional strides before teeing up once again in 2013. &quot;I caught a glimpse of the scoreboard, walking to the 18th tee, and saw Rory had gone birdie, birdie,&quot; Rose recalled. &quot;He was putting the squeeze on. &quot;But I knew that&apos;s what Rory does. When Peter Hanson won at the BMW Masters in Shanghai, Rory pushed him all the way to the end by making late birdies. I kind of figured the same would happen\u00a0here.&quot; When the world rankings are next published, McIlroy will hold the biggest points lead since Woods was a dominant figure. Comparisons between the pair show no sign of abating; there is a growing sense McIlroy is perfectly content about that.", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "Sport", "Justin Rose"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-25T13:49:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/26/french-right-collapse-talks-fail", "sentences": ["&quot;Far, very far from the Barnum show that is the UMP, the international conference lecturer Nicolas Sarkozy flew off to Shanghai on Friday where he held a conference on the relations between the European Union and China."], "title": "French right on verge of collapse as talks fail", "article": "France&apos;s opposition was plunged into an unprecedented crisis on Monday as the two men fighting to lead the party continued to dispute the results of a botched election. A second investigation confirmed Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9 as the new leader of the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire (UMP), the centre-right party of former president Nicolas Sarkozy. But his rival, former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, immediately rejected the result saying the new count was &quot;illegal&quot; and the UMP appeals committee that produced it was biased in favour of Cop\u00e9. Cop\u00e9, 48, was initially declared winner by a margin of just 98 votes after the ballot of party members eight days ago. Shortly afterwards Fillon, 58, claimed votes from three overseas districts had been &quot;forgotten&quot; and would have given him victory. For the past week, the two sides have ripped the UMP apart, accusing each other of cheating and election fraud while party heavyweights called for calm and tried to referee the dispute. One French newspaper described it as &quot;live suicide&quot;. As a final attempt to reconcile the rival camps, party grandee Alain Jupp\u00e9 was brought in to mediate. He threw in the towel on Sunday evening after his peace efforts failed. It was reported yesterday that at a peacemaking lunch yesterday with Fillon, Sarkozy said holding a new vote would &quot;avoid an escalation of the conflict&quot;, a party source told AFP \u2013 an account confirmed by both Fillon and Cop\u00e9 loyalists in the party. The latest result, which appeared to show the hardliner Cop\u00e9 had won by 952 votes out of around 173,000 cast, followed a day of new lows that saw a bailiff sent by a judge to seize contested ballot papers turned away from the UMP headquarters, allegedly by Cop\u00e9 supporters. The legal move followed a breakdown in talks between Fillon and Cop\u00e9. The bailiff, sent on the orders of a judge at the Tribunal de Grand Instance in Paris, arrived at the UMP offices in the 15th arrondissement of Paris on Monday morning, to remove voting papers and documentation relating to the ballot after Fillon supporters suggested there was a risk of &quot;manipulation and alteration&quot;. However, shortly after midday, he left empty handed after party officials loyal to Cop\u00e9 were reported to have refused access to the documents. &quot;The [UMP] leaders have deliberately refused to execute a judicial order ... in politics, contempt for the justice system is a pretty bad augury for the quality of leaders,&quot; said Fillon&apos;s lawyer Fran\u00e7ois Sureau. The Fillon camp said it had been forced to act after Cop\u00e9 refused to give it access to the documents. The move was aimed at &quot;conserving&quot; the documents, it said. &quot;The electoral documents cannot be considered to be safe from manipulations or alterations,&quot; said one of Fillon&apos;s supporters. Jean-Pierre Versini-Campinchi, lawyer for the UMP, was due in court on Monday evening to try to delay the seizure of the election documents by the court until the party&apos;s appeals commission has finished examining the ballot papers. Speaking earlier in the day, Jupp\u00e9 said: &quot;It&apos;s clear that he is the only one who today has sufficient authority to finally propose a solution, that, as far as I&apos;m concerned, is difficult to see. Can Nicolas Sarkozy calm things down and persuade the two parties back around the table to discuss a solution? That&apos;s for him to decide.&quot; Former UMP cabinet minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet launched a petition calling for a re-vote among the 300,000 party members, saying the &quot;political legitimacy&quot; of the first election on 18 November was compromised. &quot;It is too doubtful, too contested,&quot; she told Europe 1 radio. &quot;Nicolas Sarkozy, so far, so near ...&quot; wrote centre-right newspaper Le Figaro. &quot;Far, very far from the Barnum show that is the UMP, the international conference lecturer Nicolas Sarkozy flew off to Shanghai on Friday where he held a conference on the relations between the European Union and China. &quot;Since his return on Monday morning, Nicolas Sarkozy was plunged once more in the nightmare of an UMP in shreds. What is the former president of the Republic to do?&quot; Analysts say Sarkozy, who until now has been careful to keep out of the fray, is primarily concerned over how the outcome of the UMP election will affect his chances of returning to politics if he wishes. At least one UMP member of parliament has threatened to leave the party if Cop\u00e9 refuses to stand down. Michel Piron said he would not &quot;stay in a UMP presided over by a president who is contested and contestable&quot;. Party treasurer Dominique Dord announced his resignation . As political analysts warned the row would fuel support for the far right Front National, the FN&apos;s president, Marine Le Pen, told French television: &quot;The UMP no longer exists. The UMP is finished. &quot;Whoever runs the UMP will have no legitimacy. Either they re-run the election, which would be reasonable, or the UMP announces its death and at that moment becomes two structures.&quot; In the vacuum left by the implosion of the official opposition party, the FN has been quick to vaunt itself as the only party able to take on Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s Socialist government. &quot;We will welcome [UMP members] with open arms, because the real battle against the left must be fought and today, tomorrow and in the months to come the UMP is clearly not in a state to fight it,&quot;\u00a0she said.", "tags": ["France", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-27T01:52:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/judges", "sentences": ["Prior to JUCCCE she was a venture capitalist in Shanghai; an Internet pioneer in Silicon Valley heading one of the earliest e-commerce companies; a McKinsey consultant."], "title": "Guardian Sustainable Business Awards: Judges", "article": "Will Andrews Tipper, head of sustainable business, Green Alliance      Will joined Green Alliance in June 2012 to lead our work in the sustainable business theme.

On 17 September 2012 I woke to hear the news that Michael Gove was introducing the English Baccalaureate Certificate as an overarching qualification to replace the discredited GCSEs. The announcement had a profound effect on our household, both professionally and personally. As a secondary headteacher the professional implications were obvious. As a father of two sons, one year 11 and one year 7, the personal impact became clear as the details of Gove&apos;s plans emerged. It was immediately obvious that the GCSE qualifications my year 11 son Joe had spent 11 years working towards were rubbished by the news. By the time I was dressed for work I had worked out that my year 7 son Oliver would be in the first cohort of students beginning the EBC qualifications in 2015. The headline feature of the new EBCs was the replacement of all forms of current assessment with end of course three-hour examinations. I gained decent grades at O level mainly because of my memory skills. In history I learnt our teacher&apos;s board work by rote and, after a three hour examination, gained a grade B. I learnt nothing more than factual recall. And it is this type of teaching and assessment the current secretary of state for education believes will prepare our children for the future; he couldn&apos;t be more misguided. Don&apos;t get me wrong; learning knowledge is crucial, but it is not all that matters. History GCSE in 2012 demands a range of skills which need to be artfully synthesised to attain a decent grade. Students have to interpret evidence, make connections between different sources, recall knowledge, make judgements and articulate reasoned conclusions. Today&apos;s GCSE history is a far better preparation for modern life. The idea of my son Oliver&apos;s future depending upon how well he survives a series of three-hour examinations is repellent. He is a bright but complex character. A range of assessment strategies will help ensure that his talents are recognised. Synoptic, one chance only, three-hour examinations when he reaches 16 will crush his vulnerable spirit. Such assessments will be terminal in many ways. On a personal level, then, it was very easy to decide to oppose the EBC plans; professional resistance was slightly more complex. For some time after the EBC announcement there was an explicable lack of opposition to the EBC, for two reasons. Firstly, the profession is fighting on so many fronts, including the hugely important English GCSE fiasco, that the EBC is down the list of issues currently troubling headteachers; secondly, the climate of fear in schools has, to some extent, paralysed us. Yet when all seemed hopeless, Twitter brought together a group of headteachers to mount an opposition movement to the EBC. Six weeks ago a group of us met in the Guardian offices to form the Headteachers&apos; Roundtable, a non-party political group that wants to influence national education policy so that education policy centres upon what is best for the learning of all children. Within hours of establishing a website \u2013\u2013 and the @headsroundtable Twitter identity \u2013 we had more than a thousand followers and education ministers from across the political spectrum had moved to meet with us. The Twitter heads&apos; six point plan to reform education was widely praised by professionals and parents alike. Over the weeks our support has grown; we now have nearly 5,000 Twitter followers, have met with politicians of all sides, and have published our own consultation on education reform in parallel with the DfE&apos;s EBC consultation. Our document is available on the Headteachers&apos; Roundtable website, and all stakeholders are invited to respond by 10 December. We think the EBC is fundamentally flawed. Its narrow focus upon six core subjects and the emphasis upon rote learning will marginalise the arts subjects and potentially damage our students&apos; creative skills. Our creative instincts are what have kept us at the forefront of innovation as a nation for many centuries \u2013 we would be utterly foolish to threaten them with poorly designed policy. And there are hordes of highly experienced professionals out here desperate to shape the educational future, if only the politicians would listen. It is deeply ironic that the Chinese \u2013 masters of didactic teaching \u2013 want what we have. Zhejiang is a wealthy Chinese province south of Shanghai whose rote-learning centred education system does not cultivate students who can think creatively. Consequently its provincial government schools have chosen to forge links with secondary schools in our very own York. If the Chinese want what we have in our schools why are we heading towards an assessment system which will inevitably see us begin to replicate the pedagogic practices in their schools? There is little time to lose. The coalition needs to pass legislation by 2014, in time for the next election, so its EBC consultation ends on 10 December like ours. They have already decided against any EBC pilot. We have 14 working days before the DfE stops listening completely; we must begin our campaign for an alternative to the EBC now!

China is also building 25,000 cinema screens over the next five years, to cope with demand from an increasingly wealthy population. Many will have the latest 4k digital technology. Growth will also be helped by the government&apos;s recent decision to relax the number of foreign movies allowed to screen each year from 20 to 34. &quot;The challenges for media and entertainment companies to penetrate China are still considerable; however, the vast potential of the market makes it impossible to ignore,&quot; said Ernst &amp; Young&apos;s John Nendick. &quot;Companies will need to understand that investing in China is a long-term proposition, and those who can make that commitment will be in a much better position to succeed.&quot; With a potential 1.34 billion cinemagoers, China has already overtaken Japan as the biggest film market for outside of Hollywood, and studios are increasingly looking east in an effort to offset sluggish box-office growth.

More than 800 people died and more than 3 million were affected in what was, for insurers, the most costly fresh water flood in history. More recently, an extreme storm in Beijing took 79 lives. And then hurricane Sandy showed us that even the most advanced cities cannot always protect themselves from the elements. According to reinsurance company Swiss Re, flooding affects 500 million people a year and the financial losses have risen from less than $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) to $15bn (\u00a39.4bn) per year in less than four decades. I&apos;ve previously written that sustainable cities&apos; principal goal is their long term economic competitiveness. Livability, good environmental stewardship and efficiency can help attract talent and investment. That talent and investment may not be deterred by vulnerable cities but it can be repelled by cities that fail to make themselves resilient. China may be especially exposed. A recent OECD report showed that six of the cities with the highest potential asset risk are Chinese, including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin and Hong Kong. Their combined population is 68.5 million, more than the total population of the UK. However, in Shanghai, where I moved earlier this year, investment in infrastructure and sustainable initiatives is impressive. Shanghai is making great progress in providing a more livable and attractive urban environment but its growth is putting its resources under strain and testing its infrastructure&apos;s ability to handle extreme weather. The scale of China&apos;s potential investment in urban resilience means that the rest of the world will be able to learn from their experience. That said, mature economies have led the way until now. London built its very effective flood barrier in the 1970s. Despite recent events, New York has a resilience strategy based on its nine-step adaptation assessment process to minimise the impact of climate change. Rotterdam has set itself the ambition to achieve 100% resilience by 2025. We also see good practice in Singapore, Copenhagen and elsewhere. But we do also see that legacy cities, in particular, often struggle to achieve best practice. And one challenge they face is how to combine resilience with social, environmental and economic sustainability \u2013 or as the Chinese would put it, harmonious urbanisation. I would argue that there are four key approaches cities should consider as a part of their efforts to combine resilience, sustainability and livability: \u2022 City governments should assume leadership to fully realise the value of resource efficiency, advanced technologies and solutions. That will result in an integrated master plan, which involves co-operation from various departments and agencies within government. The Rotterdam climate proof strategy, for example, comes under the direct responsibility of the mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb. \u2022 Technological advancement. Take Boston, which responded to the recurrent problem of snow-buried fire hydrants delaying fire fighters in emergencies. The city developed an adopt a hydrant phone app that allows people to take photos of their community fire hydrants, name them and maintain them voluntarily.The app has gone viral. \u2022 Cities should align partnerships with various stakeholders to explore effective collaboration models. We have worked with the Amsterdam Innovation Motor and the city&apos;s utility provider, Alliander, to build a co-operation model to accommodate potential carbon reduction solutions proposed by both the private and public sectors. That partnership resulted in more than a dozen pilot projects deployed in two years. In Japan, Accenture and six other companies partnered with the Yokohama city government to build a collaborative intelligent city, which last year won the first Barcelona Smart City Award. There are now 31 corporate partners involved. \u2022 Cities should take a value-driven approach to infrastructure development and technology deployment. Technology is not an end in itself. The citizen&apos;s user experience must be at the heart of thinking. That&apos;s why it&apos;s important to invite creative app developers in to exploit public sector assets and data to create user friendly apps and services. I tend to look at many things through a Chinese lens these days. Here we expect 300 million people to move to cities in the next 15 years alone. In some ways, these cities have a relatively blank slate to get resilience right. The sheer challenge of coping with explosive growth gives the Chinese a unique approach to urban sustainability. But the more complex efforts of long standing mature market cities can teach Chinese cities lessons in improvisation, navigating constraints and accommodating the sensitivities of multiple interest groups. Both Beijing and New York have suffered similar natural disasters in the last few months. We are likely to make most progress by learning from each other.

Opposite, teenagers perch on stools outside a snack bar slurping &quot;mango avalanches&quot; and &quot;strawberry blizzards&quot; \u2013 piles of juicy fruit over shaved ice that take the edge off the sultry tropical heat. It&apos;s hard to walk more than a few paces down Yongkang Street, or indeed many parts of Taipei, without succumbing to gastronomic temptation. Taiwan may be a small island, but its eating habits have been shaped by a fascinating history of settlement, colonisation and immigration. Once populated by indigenous tribes, it was settled by immigrants from Fujian in southeastern China from the 15th century, and later by Hakka people from the mainland. Portuguese sailors passed by in the 16th century, and the island was colonised in subsequent centuries by the Dutch, Spanish and Japanese. In 1949, at the end of the Chinese civil war, Chiang Kai-shek and his defeated Nationalist army, along with some 2 million mainlanders \u2013 including some of China&apos;s most accomplished chefs \u2013 fled to Taiwan. These days Taipei is a melting pot of regional Chinese cuisines, with a bias towards the refined cooking of Shanghai and eastern China. Most famously, the international Din Tai Fung chain, originally a\u00a0family business, specialises in what westerners call &quot;Shanghai soup dumplings&quot; and locals &quot;xiaolong&quot;, which it has raised to previously undreamed-of levels of perfection. Pick up one of the twirly dumplings, rupture its side with a chopstick and let the exquisite juices flow on to your spoon before you eat.     Bamboo baskets with dumplings Photograph: Corbis    For more formal Shanghainese dining, Feng Chao-lin&apos;s Small Shanghai Restaurant has a cult following among local gourmets. Here, a banquet might include crucian carp braised with spring onion, belly pork slow-cooked with fermented beancurd or crisp stir-fried shrimps. And the tiny and unassuming Sanfen Suqi, a favourite of local food-writer Chu Chenfan, offers slices of juicy pork neck with a dip of soy sauce, garlic and chilli, a\u00a0mesmerising version of a\u00a0Sichuanese classic, as well as &quot;dry-fried&quot; fish, a delicious mix of golden crispness, tender flesh and peppery fragrance. For Taiwan&apos;s local culinary style, try the Ningxia night market where you can perch at a makeshift table and scoff a bowlful of rice covered in a lazy stew of spiced belly pork, a skewer of grilled mullet roe with garlic and radish, or an oyster omelette. Some restaurants bring market food indoors, like Du Hsiao Yeh in Yongkang Street, where you can eat a bowlful of &quot;slack season&quot; noodles topped with a rich pork sauce, mashed garlic and a prawn. It was the Shin Yeh chain that first brought Taiwanese folk cooking upmarket. Head chef Kun-Yin Cheng says: &quot;We&apos;ve tried to raise its status, using less oil and salt and serving it in a restaurant environment, but keeping the old flavours and the special local ingredients.&quot; Shin Yeh is now an international business, serving delicious renditions of classic Taiwan dishes without the rough edges of the nightmarkets. Try, for example, the marvellous soft wheaten pancakes stuffed with warm vegetables spiked with dried fish, coriander and a sweet peanut relish, or, if you&apos;re feeling adventurous, a\u00a0stew of pig&apos;s kidneys and chicken testicles. In the South Gate market, traders preside over mouthwatering displays of Jinhua-style ham, dried bamboo shoots and mushrooms, all locally produced. The fresh fruit grown on Taiwan is a highlight of any visit. Market stalls are piled with wax apples, mangoes, pineapples and guavas, often served with a powder of preserved plums and salt. And there are growing numbers of organic caf\u00e9s in Taipei, according to food writer Sarah Chen, who met me at one of them, Tanhou, for a breakfast &quot;enzyme energy soup&quot;: glasses piled high with juicy chopped vegetables, dried fruits and seeds, which we ate with a spoon. There&apos;s a Japanese edge to the Taiwan food scene, a legacy of half a century of Japanese colonisation, which ended in 1945. The old city fish market has been transformed into Addiction Aquatic Development, a\u00a0chic, warehouse-style Japanese restaurant and supermarket, with a &quot;stand and swallow&quot; bar for sushi-eaters and a\u00a0grill division outside. If you fancy a teppanyaki blow-out, don&apos;t hesitate to drive out of town to the Shen Yen restaurant in Yilan county, where Chef Chen Chih-yung will dazzle you with his local seafood. Our lunch was an 18-course miracle of fish, eel and crustaceans, seasoned occasionally with his home-made soy sauce, and interspersed with sublime bamboo shoots, shots of iced hibiscus infusion and other treats.

There are now, built and in the pipeline, at least 30 towers, typically in a height range of 150-200 metres (or 490-650 feet. The BT tower is 177 metres high and more slender than anything now proposed). They are the fulfilment of the desires of investors and of the policies of Ken Livingstone, pursued with equal vigour by Boris Johnson, even though he once promised to take a tougher line on height. With minimum discussion, proposals are being waved through the planning system \u2013 and while both the mayor of London and the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, have the power to intervene in major decisions, neither has done so. A decade ago, plans for buildings such as the Shard and the Gherkin were widely publicised, provoked debate and were the subject of public inquiries. Now, developers and architects hold modest public exhibitions in the immediate neighbourhood of their proposals and are not overanxious that they should be more widely known about. Developers have long represented their projects with flattering, shiny visualisations that greatly over-estimate the seductive power of their cladding systems, which are bathed in an eternally golden glow. Now some of them have a new strategy, which is to act is if they are not there at all: sometimes, on their websites, you get views of plazas strewn with caf\u00e9 tables, and pastel-coloured ground plans, and little clue of the large objects that will rise over their heads. If many of the proposals shown on these pages are new to you, that could be because their makers are so reticent about designs which, when built, will be anything but. Last month, another clutch was approved. Almost all forms of resistance, such as the statutory bodies that are supposed to guide the planning system, have been neutralised, leaving only little-heard neighbourhood groups to voice their protests. All of which, if these tall buildings were making the capital into a great metropolis of the 21st century, might be a cause for celebration. Towers can be beautiful, and part of the genius of London is its ability to change, but what we are getting now are mostly units of speculation stacked high, garnished with developers&apos; ego. They are invitations to tax evaders to park their cash in Britain. What is happening now is the culmination of 15 years or more of gathering pressure to build high. In the 1990s, plans were first unveiled for what would eventually be the Gherkin, controversially built on the site of the Baltic Exchange, a building that was listed but also damaged by an IRA bomb. It was eventually decided that, if this building were designed by a celebrated architect, such as Lord Foster, and were an exceptional work of architecture, other planning issues could be overridden. When Livingstone was elected mayor in 2000, he enthusiastically supported tall buildings. He dined with developers in private, at a huge property junket in Cannes called Mipim, and publicly announced his grand bargain with capital: they should be allowed to build as big as they wanted, as long as he could take a tithe of the proceeds to spend on such things as affordable housing. He produced a London plan, which encouraged, among other things, building high around major transport interchanges, so as to encourage the users of these buildings to use public transport. It was all part of Livingstone&apos;s then vision that the future of London lay in the never-ending boom in financial services, with which a socialist mayor could cut a deal. It was repeatedly said that, following the precedent of the Gherkin, tall buildings should be of the highest architectural quality and also in &quot;the right place&quot;, two principles that would turn out to have flexible meanings. The Shard was proposed, and being by the celebrated Renzo Piano and having a certain classiness in its form, was approved following a public inquiry. It has a substantial impact on St Paul&apos;s Cathedral, when seen from Hampstead Heath, a view recognised by planning policy as significant, but not seen as reason enough to stop it. In 2005, Lord Rogers, once a business partner of both Piano and Foster, won permission for the 225-metre Leadenhall Building, or Cheesegrater, in the City of London. Encouraged by these precedents, further proposals popped up, with increasingly tenuous claims to be of the highest architectural quality or in the right place. They were not just in the City of London, but also south of the river in Southwark, Waterloo and Vauxhall. The 180-metre Vauxhall Tower (the St George Wharf tower to its developers) was proposed, smack in the middle of a view from Westminster Bridge, officially deemed to be important and requiring special care. There was not much evidence of special care in the design. It went to a public inquiry, in which the inquiry&apos;s inspector concluded that it should not be built. John Prescott, however, who was then the minister responsible for such things, used his powers to overrule this advice. This tower is now being built, its exterior nearly complete.     An artist's impression of how the cluster of tall buildings at Vauxhall and Nine Elms will appear, looking up the Thames from Westminster. Photograph: Miller Hare    In the City of London, planning officer Peter Rees long treasured the idea that tall buildings should be in a &quot;cluster&quot;, collectively forming a roughly conical shape that would rise to its peak close to the Bank of England. But then came the &quot;Walkie Talkie&quot;, officially called 20 Fenchurch Street, an office block designed by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, whose brilliant concept perfectly captured the money-worshipping zeitgeist of the pre-crash years: it gets fatter as it rises, to reflect the fact that floor area becomes more valuable the higher you go. The Walkie Talkie, whose frame is now rising, is by no stretch of the imagination inside this cluster, but Rees somehow persuaded himself that it is in the &quot;right&quot; place. On the South Bank, the 140-metre Doon Street tower was proposed. Another public inquiry was held and refusal recommended. Hazel Blears, who by then had inherited Prescott&apos;s mantle, like him decided she knew better and approved it. Construction is under way. In Elephant and Castle, the 148-metre Strata SE1 was built, which would be the winner of the 2010 Carbuncle Cup, awarded by Building Design magazine to the worst building of the year. Another view considered worthy of protection by planning policy is of the Houses of Parliament seen from the Serpentine Bridge in Hyde Park, its gothic spires framed by trees and water. Here, Strata waddles into the background from stage left, like SpongeBob SquarePants in a production of Hamlet. It is not in the &quot;right place&quot; either. There was a pause following the crash and the election of Johnson in 2008, whose mayoral campaign had included promises to be less tower-friendly than Livingstone. However, although he has the power to refuse significant planning applications, he has not once done so. Rather, he chose to approve the 237-metre Columbus Tower in Canary Wharf, reversing the decision by the London borough of Tower Hamlets to reject it. A new wave of proposals has come forward. An application will be submitted shortly for new towers next to the Shell Centre, near Waterloo station, with every expectation of being successful, and two more are planned at Elephant and Castle. Several have been approved near to the Vauxhall Tower, which a few years ago was considered impactful enough to require the inquiry in which the inspector found against it. Some of its new neighbours will be higher and not obviously more beautiful, while their collective effect will be much bulkier, but neither Johnson nor Pickles is using his authority to give pause to the process: at least half of the developments we picture in our gallery have been approved in the Boris era. And so it goes on. Policies are framed that, generous to start with, are then stretched far beyond any reasonable interpretation of what they might mean. Rules are made, then broken. It is doubtful, for example, whether Vauxhall is a major transport interchange of the kind that the London plan thinks is right for tall buildings, but it is becoming a mini Dubai nonetheless. Developments in the same area are supposed to follow a masterplan drawn up by Sir Terry Farrell, but when he pointed out that two proposed towers by Michael Squire broke its principles, they got permission anyway. Notions such as &quot;the highest architectural quality&quot;, to quote Johnson&apos;s version of the London plan, are rapidly debased. At one point, tower proposals felt the need to proclaim their sustainability, with ostentatious wind turbines included in the designs for the Vauxhall Tower and Strata (where, to be sure, they are almost never seen to turn). Now, developers don&apos;t even bother with these. Older applications, including the Walkie Talkie, proposed viewing galleries that, although they would actually be privately controlled, were called &quot;public spaces&quot;. Again, these are no longer on offer. Recently, the developers of the 163-metre One Blackfriars successfully applied to have their once-promised viewing gallery omitted. London has a multilayered planning system, in which borough councils make decisions and the mayor and minister can then overrule them. Bodies such as English Heritage and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe) advise and public inquiries can be held. Yet these layers, while retaining the ability to complicate and slow things down, no longer do their job of revision and review. Willingly or not, they have been disempowered. English Heritage has opposed several tower proposals, but after many losing battles (which, due to the cost of planning lawyers, were also expensive) its objections are now reduced to demoralised bat-squeaks. Although, for example, it thinks that proposals in Vauxhall will cause &quot;substantial harm to the setting of the Westminster world heritage site&quot;, it did not even issue a press release on the subject. Cabe, a watchdog ever fond of nuzzling the developers it was supposed to be watching, has been shrunk and further enfeebled. Even when it summons up the courage to state the bleeding obvious, such as the fact that the Quill, a risible block of student housing next to the Shard, is poorly designed, Cabe is ignored. At the relevant meeting of Southwark council&apos;s planning committee, an officer reported that Cabe supported it, even though it had said it did not. This provoked guffaws from the public gallery. It doesn&apos;t help that boroughs such as Southwark and Lambeth are unlikely to be tough on new towers, as they can order developers to contribute &quot;planning gain&quot;, which is money to be spent on affordable housing elsewhere in their territory. Livingstone liked them for similar reasons, as well us for the special delight that skyscrapers seem to have for mayors. Johnson is likely to be influenced by the community infrastructure levy raised on new developments, which helps pay for the Crossrail project. Of course, affordable housing and public transport are good things to have, but thoughtless plunder of the city&apos;s airspace is not the way to pay for them; by the same argument, we could build on parks or on the river. The results of these shoddy processes will be visible all over the capital, in the background of famous buildings, from hills and parks, down the ends of streets. They will change the Thames, bringing a completely different scale to its banks. None of which need be a problem, if they conformed to the official planning line that tall buildings should be well designed and in the right place. Or, to quote Johnson&apos;s policy, that they should form &quot;cohesive building groups&quot;, &quot;contribute positively to the image and built environment of London&quot; and be &quot;resisted in areas that will be particularly sensitive to their impacts.&quot; What is a world heritage site if not the latter? On the question of being &quot;well designed&quot;, the supporters of these towers will produce the well-worn arguments that design is subjective, that St Paul&apos;s was derided in its day and so on. One could, however, look for what might be thought qualities of good design and usually they will be hard to find. Do they, for example, show consideration of scale or proportion or try to make a meaningful relationship with their surroundings? Is there anything special about their detail? Is there consistency or integrity in their overall concept? Do they create handsome new public spaces at their base? Does their internal planning produce the best possible living or working spaces, which are well laid out and make good use of daylight? Failing all the above, do they have any worth in the rapidly debasing currency of iconicity? Are they, in other words, exhilarating to contemplate or innovative \u2013 do they transmit some sort of buzzy excitement about London being a dynamic world city? I would suggest that, if that&apos;s what you want, Shanghai and Dubai do it better. The Shard and the Gherkin, conceived early in the current tower boom, are impressive, going on magnificent, albeit with major defects \u2013 I defy you to stand at the base of either and say that you are in a world-class public space. But it turns out that they were as good is it gets. To take the Vauxhall Tower as an example, it makes no apparent effort to form any kind of relationship with its surroundings, neither a Georgian house behind it, nor even St George Wharf, an existing development by the same architects as the tower, Broadway Malyan, and the same developers, St George. It does not relate to the river in any particular way or, in longer views, to the Palace of Westminster. It is just there, sullenly uncommunicative. It seemingly wants to be a slender cylinder, but contradicts itself with a sawtooth plan. At the top, it changes its mind again and adopts a stepped, zigguraty form. At the bottom, it is something else again and there is little attempt to reconcile the various elements. Its cladding is an ordinary-looking glazing package. Around its foot is precisely the sort of shapeless, windswept, nothing place that we were supposed to have learned not to do in the 1970s. There are some honourable exceptions, with purveyors of rectilinear dignity doing better than those attempting artistic flourishes. Allies and Morrison&apos;s 100 Bishopsgate is an example or David Chipperfield&apos;s Elizabeth House at Waterloo station, the result of a rare occasion on which the developers were pushed to improve their initial ideas. They would have every right to be furious, having made an expensive effort with this project, at the easy ride given to other proposals. Others \u2013 Strata, the future towers at Vauxhall and Nine Elms \u2013 tend to follow their own, similar patterns. They offer a paltry &quot;public realm&quot; of Chinese granite and Costa coffee, standard glazing, a few loops and convulsions, like a dad at a disco, suggesting that they are bit on wild side. They don&apos;t bother at all to work with their neighbours to make a three-dimensional entity. There is no vision, concept or thought as to what their total effect might be on London, except that it will be great. In planning a kitchen, it is usual to envisage the totality before you start, but a great city has not been granted this courtesy. The onus should be on those who want to make such large changes, and to profit from them, to demonstrate their quality - the more conspicuous a building the more important it is that it is well-designed. As it is, they would rather we didn&apos;t notice them until it&apos;s too late.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "Ken Livingstone", "Boris Johnson", "Cities", "Planning policy", "London politics", "Politics", "Construction industry", "London", "UK news", "Social housing", "Skyscrapers"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-02T00:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/dec/03/jamesharding-news-corporation", "sentences": ["He had previously been the paper&apos;s business editor for a year after spending 13 years at the Financial Times during which he opened the FT&apos;s Shanghai bureau."], "title": "Is Harding off to the Wall Street Journal?

Crucially you don&apos;t have to enrol abroad to get that experience as part of your MBA \u2013 many UK and international business schools now offer it as part of their courses. Kingston University students, for example, have the chance to spend time at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration in Moscow \u2013 a link-up which is soon to celebrate 15 years of successful collaboration. The Kingston MBA programme is taught in Moscow \u2013 with exactly the same content at both institutions, and delivered in English, mostly by Kingston-based academics who fly out to teach there. &quot;It&apos;s ideal for our own MBA students because if they want to do some of the modules sitting alongside their Russian counterparts, then that&apos;s easy to do,&quot; explains Chris Bristow, Kingston&apos;s director of graduate management programmes and corporate learning. Additional costs &quot;What tends to happen is our students might do some or all of their electives over there in Moscow, so they fly out, they spend five or six days there, and they join the classes of their Russian counterparts. It&apos;s a very good way of providing that international mix. It gives our students, who are all very international anyway, a chance to understand and find out what&apos;s happening in the Moscow business environment.&quot; The cost of tuition in Moscow is built into the Kingston students&apos; upfront fees, but there are additional grants available to them to cover the costs of flights and accommodation. Kingston also offers the Moscow-based students the chance to visit the UK during their annual International Week, broadening their horizons too. &quot;We had a company visit to Veolia down in Hampshire, which was basically around the disposal of household waste,&quot; recalls Bristow. &quot;Rather than using landfill \u2013 which the Russians use entirely, as they&apos;ve got a huge amount of space \u2013 Veolia do a lot of incineration of household waste. One of the students went back and actually wrote his project on alternative ways of disposing of household rubbish other than landfill.&quot; Bristow admits that the link-up doesn&apos;t mean that Kingston students are inevitably going to look for work in Moscow following graduation. &quot;I think it would be fair to say that our students don&apos;t see it necessarily as a route to jobs in Russia,&quot; he says, &quot;but I think there are some students who are thinking about entrepreneurial activity. They certainly strike up friendships and it widens their network for the future.&quot; Manchester Business School (MBS) has a similar scheme, but their MBA students can spend an entire term with one of the partner international institutions. John Macaulay, founder of the Alchemy Agency, graduated in 2010 having spent the end of 2009 at China Europe International Business School (CEIBS), MBS&apos;s partner in Shanghai, where he studied Mandarin as well as his academic modules. &quot;I wanted to go somewhere as culturally diverse as possible from the UK,&quot; he recalls. Having been born and bred in Manchester, he found himself amidst a very international intake at MBS, and so decided to take up the optional international exchange in order to gain some global experience. &quot;China was a really attractive place to go, just because of the diversity of the culture generally and the business environment,&quot; he says. &quot;Also, it&apos;s still exciting times over there, with a lot happening, and with an entrepreneurial focus.&quot; He agrees that his time in China broadened his network of contacts, but it has also had a more practical impact on his career. &quot;When I finished my MBA in April 2010, the first thing I did was in China \u2013 I arranged for my favourite rock bands to play in Shanghai and Beijing,&quot; he laughs.", "tags": ["Guardian Careers", "Finance and professional services"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-04T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/dec/04/chanel-franco-scottish-affair-tweed", "sentences": ["Karl Lagerfeld has staged shows in St Tropez, Shanghai and the gardens of Versailles."], "title": "Chanel revives Franco-Scottish love affair in tweedy fashion", "article": "In a letter to his wife Clemmie from the Duke of Westminster&apos;s Scottish estate in October 1927, Winston Churchill wrote admiringly of the prowess of a fellow member of the duke&apos;s party. &quot;She fishes from morning to night, and in two months has killed 50 salmon,&quot; he noted. Her name was Gabrielle &quot;Coco&quot; Chanel who as the lover of the duke spent long summers in the Highlands between 1924 and 1931. On Tuesday night the Parisian house of Chanel upped sticks to celebrate its little-known Scottish connections with a catwalk show titled &quot;Paris-Edimbourg&quot;. Karl Lagerfeld has staged shows in St Tropez, Shanghai and the gardens of Versailles. But proved that for sheer atmosphere it is hard to beat a glorious Scottish ruin on a snowy night. In the courtyard of Linlithgow Palace, fire baskets raged around a fountain which Scottish legend says flowed with wine to honour Bonnie Prince Charlie&apos;s visit in 1745. Linlithgow was the birthplace of Mary Queen of Scots, who became queen consort of France, and Franco-Scottish links were woven through the evening. The army of Scottish umbrella-bearers sheltering guests from the snow were issued with Chanel cologne and instructions to wear no other. Trays of champagne alternated with earthenware pitchers of hot ginger and whisky. In temperatures around -4C, the latter were more popular. Lagerfeld updated the 1920s Scottish country house aesthetic which beguiled Coco with a phalanx of modern references. Tartan came as an allusion to punk, worn with studded boots; as a throwback to the Lagerfeld-designed Chanel tartans of the 1980s with It model Cara Delevingne in a Madonnaesque silhouette of slouchy dancer&apos;s jumper, cute short skirt and thick tights. There was a nod to the tartans loved by Alexander McQueen in the long coats of gothic grandeur. Lagerfeld said before the show he had been studying Scottish history because he &quot;liked to arrive informed&quot;. It showed. Even beyond the obvious \u2013 the 2.55 bags given a sporran twist, the tartan caps \u2013 there was a toughness in the warrior-like eyeliner, the flat boots, the layers that felt indigenous to these parts, even paraded before 350 guests flown in from around the world for a show conservatively estimated to have cost \u00a32m. Pearls, instead of being strung around the neck in Rue Cambon fashion, hung pear-shaped from ears as they would have done when this courtyard was peopled by kings and queens. The show closed with a red-haired model in a high-collared snowy white gown, as if the ghost of Elizabeth I was once again vanquishing that of her cousin Mary. Scotland was an inspiration for the most iconic of Coco&apos;s creations, the elegant suit in tweed \u2013 or boucl\u00e9, as it was known in her Paris ateliers. While staying on the duke&apos;s estates, Chanel, with her eye for elements of menswear that could be appropriated to modernise women&apos;s fashion, took to borrowing the Duke&apos;s tweeds. Photographs show her in her Scottish attire: dressed in a man&apos;s tweed jacket, long cashmere cardigan, trousers and sturdy boots, several dogs weaving around her feet. Liberating women from corsets and strictures to give them ease of movement was at the core of Chanel&apos;s design philosophy, and she embraced the freedom of country clothes designed for outdoor life. Chanel grew fond of Scottish tweed, with its irregularities and natural suppleness, and began sourcing fabrics from a local tweed mill to be made into soft two-piece skirt suits for her Parisian house. She would gather leaves, moss and earth from her walks in the Scottish countryside, take them to her tweedmaker and ask him to incorporate those colours in the weave. Chanel&apos;s vision of an elegant tweed suit, now a byword for Parisian chic, was a radical move at the time. Her French workshops were mystified by her enthusiasm for the rustic fabric. But Chanel persisted, making tweed a signature fabric of the house. In 1927, American Vogue reported that &quot;Chanel, an important influence on modes, whose clothes are invariably simple, practical, and beautiful, is making a feature of models of Scotch tweed in her recent collections.&quot; The Linlithgow show also celebrated the economic legacy of Chanel&apos;s love affair with the country. In October this year Chanel acquired Barrie Knitwear, a Scottish specialist that has long been a manufacturer of Chanel cashmere. The deal saved 176 jobs in the Hawick mill, threatened with closure after owner Dawson International was placed in administration in August. Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel&apos;s president of fashion, described the deal as &quot;natural, as the factory has worked with us for more than 25 years \u2026 through this acquisition we reaffirm our commitment to traditional expertise and craftmanship, and our wish to safeguard their future.&quot; It was also a shrewd business move for a label that relies on knitwear for around 30% of its ready to wear sales. The message of the Metiers d&apos;Art series of catwalk shows, of which this was one, is to underscore the artistry and skill that underscore the Chanel brand \u2013 and to remind the industry of the role Chanel plays in sustaining small-scale producers who would otherwise struggle to stay afloat in an industry increasingly dominated by fast fashion. While Scotland made an impression on Chanel, the designer left her mark on Scotland in turn. In her biography of Chanel, Justine Picardie, editor of Harpers Bazaar and author of a biography of Chanel which examines her links with Scotland, writes that the designer decorated her Scottish mansion, Rosehall, with hand-blocked French wallpaper and installed the first bidet in the Highlands. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 December2012.

Legend has it he struggled terribly, but ultimately succeeded. Hence the Chinese idiom &quot;Yu Gong moves the mountains.&quot; Where there&apos;s a will, there&apos;s a way. Now Chinese developers are putting old Yu to shame. In what is being billed as the largest &quot;mountain-moving project&quot; in Chinese history, oneof China&apos;s biggest construction firms will spend \u00a32.2bn to flatten 700 mountains levelling the area Lanzhou, allowing developers to build a new metropolis on the outskirts of the north-western city. The Lanzhou New Area, 500 square miles (130,000 hectares) of land 50 miles from the city, which is the provincial capital of arid Gansu province, could increase the region&apos;s gross domestic product to \u00a327bn by 2030, according to the state-run China Daily. It has already attracted almost \u00a37bn of corporate investment. The project will be China&apos;s fifth &quot;state-level development zone&quot; and the first in the country&apos;s rapidly developing interior, according to state media reports. Others include Shanghai&apos;s Pudong and Tianjin&apos;s Binhai, home to a half-built, 120-building replica of Manhattan. China&apos;s state council, its highest administrative authority, approved the Lanzhou project in August. The first stage of the mountain-flattening initiative, which was reported on Tuesday by the China Economic Weekly magazine, began in late October and will eventually enable a new urban district almost 10 square miles in size northeast of downtown Lanzhou \u2013 a small, but important part of the Lanzhou Nnew area project to be built. One of the country&apos;s largest private companies: the Nanjing-based China Pacific Construction Group, headed by Yan Jiehe, is behind the initiative. The 52-year-old former teacher is portrayed in China as a sort of home-grown Donald Trump \u2013 ultra-ambitious and preternaturally gifted at navigating the country&apos;s vast network of &quot;guanxi&quot;, or personal connections. Yan was born in the 1960s as the youngest of nine children. After a decade of working as a high-school teacher and cement plant employee, he founded his construction firm in 1995 and amassed a fortune by buying and revamping struggling state-owned enterprises. In 2006 the respected Hu Run report named Yan \u2013 then worth about \u00a3775m \u2013 as China&apos;s second-richest man. His latest plan has evoked a healthy dose of scepticism. Lanzhou, home to 3.6 million people alongside the silty Yellow River, already has major environmental concerns. Last year the World Health Organisation named it the city with the worst air pollution in China. The city&apos;s main industries include textiles, fertiliser production and metallurgy. Liu Fuyuan, a former high-level official at the country&apos;s National Development and Reform Commission, told China Economic Weekly that the project was unsuitable because Lanzhou is frequently listed as among China&apos;s most chronically water-scarce municipalities. &quot;The most important thing is to gather people in places where there is water,&quot; he said. Others also pointed to the financial risk of building a new city in the middle of the desert. &quot;All this investment needs to be paid back with residential land revenue, and I don&apos;t see much on returns in these kinds of cities,&quot; said Tao Ran, an economics professor at Renmin University in Beijing. &quot;If you have a booming real estate market it might work, but it seems to me that real estate in China is very, very risky.&quot; In an email interview, a China Pacific Construction Group spokeswoman dismissed criticisms of the project as unjustified. &quot;Lanzhou&apos;s environment is already really poor, it&apos;s all desolate mountains which are extremely short of water,&quot; said Angie Wong. &quot;Our protective style of development will divert water to the area, achieve reforestation and make things better than before.&quot; Yan&apos;s plans could be considered &quot;a protective style of development, and a developmental style of protection&quot;, she said, adding: &quot;I think whether it&apos;s England or America, or any other country, no one will cease development because of resource scarcity caused by geography.&quot; A promotional video posted on the Lanzhou new area website shows a digitally-rendered cityscape of gleaming skyscrapers and leafy parks. Against a driving operatic score, the camera zooms out from a large government building to reveal features of the area&apos;s imagined urban topography: a clock tower, a new airport, an oil refinery, a light-rail system, and a stadium packed with cheering fans.

Victory is far from certain \u2013 nobody really knows how difficult batting will be with in the third innings \u2013 but England are in a seriously good position. Their performance thus far has been immaculate.  Somewhere in the world, it&apos;s 3.21am on Saturday morning. Good Friday night? Give me some vicarious excitement here. Because of this cricket I&apos;ve only had one Friday night in a month.  WICKET! England 510-7 (Swann c Sehwag b Ojha 21) That didn&apos;t take long.

England 510-8 (Prior c Dhoni b Zaheer 41) Now Prior has gone! This is a great start for India, which keeps their slim chance of victory alive.

Assuming you&apos;re wearing some, and if you&apos;re not please don&apos;t reply to this and please don&apos;t ever contact me again.  166th over: England 516-8 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Finn 4, Anderson 2) &quot;Doesn&apos;t Finn look like an elongated Michael Vaughan under that lid?&quot; says Harry Tuttle. &quot;It&apos;s the cheekbones.&quot; Good spot.  167th over: England 523-8 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Finn 4, Anderson 9) These two might as well give it some humpty. When Zaheer offers a touch of width, Anderson larrups a swaggering cover drive for four. &quot;What a shot!&quot; says Bumble. &quot;The Burnley Lara!&quot; That was a beautiful stroke, and he times the next ball through midwicket for three more. &quot;Morning Rob, been lovely following the third test on OBO from Shanghai when wi-fi allows,&quot; says Matthew Valentine. &quot;I&apos;m wondering if now&apos;s the time to crawl the archive blogs from the last home Pakistan series when the Cookie monster was Asif and Amir&apos;s bunny for a public naming and shaking of all those contributors who wanted him dropped.&quot; I think, in fairness, almost all of those who wanted him dropped were advocating a little break to freshen up him up mentally and technically rather than a long-term banishment. And he did struggle terribly in that series. Even now he sometimes struggles against the moving ball, which is a strange thing to say for such an amazing batsman. The lovely thing about Cook is that, whatever the problem, he works it out in the end.  WICKET! England 523-9 (Anderson c Sehwag b Ashwin 9) R Ashwin strikes with his second ball of the day. Flight, turn, bounce and a simple edge from Anderson to slip. That turned a fair way.  WICKET! England 523 all out (Panesar LBW b Ashwin 0) Monty goes first ball, LBW to Ashwin. I&apos;m not sure about this decision but well, who cares? I thought it was going down leg; it wasn&apos;t, but there was a big inside edge and that&apos;s a poor decision from the otherwise excellent Kumar Dharmasena. Oh well, nobody died. England&apos;s lead is 207.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: India 6-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 0) Jimmy Anderson&apos;s first ball of the innings swings in nicely to Gautam Gambhir, who times it superbly through square leg for four. Anderson&apos;s hands went straight to his head, because if Gambhir missed that he was plumb. The next ball goes straight on past the outside edge. England would put their dignity on eBay for a couple of new-ball wickets. A fine first over from Anderson. &quot;That photo is seriously depressing,&quot; says Robert Ellson. &quot;It&apos;s like discovering that Paul McCartney was 27 when the Beatles broke up. I&apos;m 37 and have 0,000 Test runs to my name and 0 classic songs. So thanks for that.&quot;  2nd over: India 10-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 4) So, Sehwag. He&apos;s only scored one second-innings century in his Test career; this would be a very decent time to double that. If he&apos;s still there at the close, an Indian win will be a possibility. He gets going with a boundary fourth ball, opening the face to steer Finn through the vacant fourth-slip area. A good over from Finn nonetheless; Anderson and Finn have hit their straps straight away, and the last delivery bounces sharply past Sehwag&apos;s nose. &quot;Too cold to go downstairs to turn on the cricket so got to love Sky Go on the mobile accompanied by OBO,&quot; says Dave Forrest. &quot;Just been clearing out our spare room and came across Is It Cowardly For Rain (which of course was retained). Marvellous reading seven years on and a perfect complement to getting two sets of Ashes tickets this week. Great that Mitchell J is bowling himself back into the team \u2013 the Barmy Army must be salivating at two shite Aussie left armers called Mitchell to abuse!&quot; When Mitchell Starc takes 72 wickets across ten Ashes Tests next year, Dave Forrest&apos;s address will be available on request.  3rd over: India 10-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 4) England are bowling noticeably straight in this innings, which you&apos;d expect on a pitch like this, especially with the uneven bounce. Gambhir plays out a maiden from Anderson, who has started excellently. &quot;Forget Alastair &apos;Braceface&apos; Cook,&quot; says Danielle Tolson. &quot;On the subject of feeling old: this \u2013 a &apos;Freaks and Geeks&apos; reunion, with photos.Also, on a personal and seasonal note, still being able to name every member of Band Aid when I see the video for &apos;Do They Know It&apos;s Christmas?&apos;&quot; We&apos;re all for diversity at the Guardian, so if anyone under the age of 140 is reading, please do send us an email!  4th over: India 11-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 5) Sehwag, fishing outside off, is beaten by a good one from Finn. England are getting a fraction of movement, no more, but their line and length have been really good thus far. &quot;Friday night was good,&quot; says Chris Langmead. &quot;Nothing like drinking too much fizzy disco juice with a load of otherwise highly respectable professors and scientists. My 2am finish was tame compared to my colleagues who were still up at 6am. However, we are currently all sat in a lecture theatre on Melbourne trying desperately to concentrate on important scientific matters \u2013 though one of us is on OBO, obviously...&quot;  5th over: India 12-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 6) Gambhir plays an absent-minded cut at Anderson and is beaten. The pressure is building, with just two runs from the last three overs. In other news, some essential reading here: a superb interview with former Test cricketer Ricky Ponting.  &quot;Cook looks like he was a pretty punchable kid,&quot; goodwills Mac Millings. &quot;Is that a terrible thing to say? I am a teacher.&quot;  6th over: India 13-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 7) This is excellent cricket from both teams. England&apos;s new-ball bowlers have been right on their game from the start; India&apos;s openers have respected the quality of the bowling and been very solid in defence. &quot;Friday night involved a trip to Asda for Rice Crispies and toilet roll and now up and hoping TMS can soothe the baby back to sleep,&quot; says Jon Fortune. &quot;Asking what OBOers get up to on a Friday night? You&apos;ve opened a dull can of worms there.&quot; Yes, I may have ever so slightly misjudged the audience.  7th over: India 21-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 15) England have missed a great chance to dismiss Sehwag. He edged an excellent delivery from Anderson between Swann and Cook at second and first slip. Neither got there and it hurried away for four. That was Swann&apos;s catch, but he was really slow to get down to his left. Cook could also have taken it, although his was the trickier chance. The next ball is a poor one from the understandably aggrieved Anderson, a leg-stump half-volley, and Sehwag takes care of business with a roll of the wrists. &quot;Friday night was good, party at the British High Commission in Kolkata with local live band the Supersonics,&quot; says Paul Walsh. &quot;Up early for rugby practice on the maidan, rushed home for tickets to enjoy a day with the Barmy Army at Eden Gardens ... but ... am now sitting on the stairs of my flat as I have managed to lock myself out, tickets inside ... disaster!&quot; Crikey, that&apos;s a shocker. How long before you can get into the flat?  8th over: India 27-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 11, Sehwag 16) Monty comes on for the eighth over of the innings. It&apos;ll be interesting to see his pace in this innings, as it seems the important thing for spinners on this pitch is to bowl the ball pretty slowly. Monty seems to have sussed that out, with a few deliveries in the low 50s. An otherwise decent over is ruined by a last-ball full toss that Gambhir eases through extra cover for four.  9th over: India 30-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 11, Sehwag 19) Anderson&apos;s got a cob on, not unreasonably, and digs in a good short ball that Sehwag gloves round the corner. So, whABUDHABIo fancies chasing 150 on a fifABUDHABIABUDHABIth-day pitcIBAHDUBAh?  10th over: India 32-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 12, Sehwag 20) England were never going to go through India like a dose of salts as they did at Mumbai, so this becomes a game of patience now that Gambhir and Sehwag have got in. I don&apos;t think England&apos;s bowlers have done much wrong so far; it&apos;s been accomplished cricket from both sides. Who needs a drink? The players, that&apos;s who. &quot;Good morning from Guangzhou,&quot; says Tom Carver. &quot;Stinking cold: tick; hangover from Christmas party: tick; cricket on TV: tick; cricket on the radio: tick; cricket on OBO: tick. Marvellous. As an aside, I was trying to find the right word to describe Cook&apos;s batting earlier on and my wife hit the nail on the head when she said he bats like a German. Imagine Schumacher batting and you have our Cookie. Not flash. Not fancy. Ruthless efficiency.&quot; Yes, that&apos;s a nice description. Although Cook has added some flourishes to his game, not least those lazy straight sixes off the spinners.  11th over: India 32-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 12, Sehwag 20) Graeme Swann replaces Anderson, who bowled better than figures of 5-1-18-0 suggest. He has a slip, short leg and short extra cover for Gambhir, who gets well forward in defence. A maiden.  12th over: India 36-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 13, Sehwag 23) Sehwag has a twinge in his left knee and winces through for a single. With no runners allowed any more, he might be more inclined than ever to just stand and Gordon Greenidge it. Now Gambhir has been dropped! Well, not really dropped. He turned Panesar to leg off the face of the bat, and the ball hit the short leg Ian Bell on the arm before he could react. Bell is a magnificent short leg but he had a reaction time of around 0.00000000000000001 seconds there. &quot;OK,&quot; says Paul Connelly. &quot;I&apos;ll call your bluff. I&apos;m willing to say I fancy chasing 150 on a fifth-day pitch. I&apos;ll also say Adelaide if you want. Adelaide, Adelaide.&quot; REDRUM.  13th over: India 40-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 16, Sehwag 24) &quot;Friday night was good for me too,&quot; says Sam Valentine. &quot;I spent it drinking homebrew bitter in the shadow of Eden Gardens and am now feeling very much the worse for wear at work in Kolkata, hoping that, as the sole Englishman in my office, the mockery I&apos;ve doled out to my sullen Indian colleagues doesn&apos;t come back to bite me\u2026 Meanwhile, two miles away, my wife-to-be who recently met the England team without knowing who any of them were and best man are lording it up pitch-side, respectively dressed as a hungover lady and beefeater. Where&apos;s the justice?&quot;  14th over: India 43-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 18, Sehwag 25) India are milking the spinners pretty comfortably at the moment, and there hasn&apos;t been any significant bounce or turn for the spinners. We haven&apos;t seen their average speeds so I don&apos;t know if that has anything to do with it. &quot;My Friday night in Johannesburg was much like every other,&quot; says Stuart Wilson. &quot;Contrary to what readers might think, this didn&apos;t involve being shot at, mugged and dancing with Zulus. It consisted of drinking terrible beer, watching ancient episodes of QI (there is nothing else on) and going to bed at nine for a hot and uncomfortable night&apos;s sleep. However I have still shimmied out of bed at 5.30 this morning to watch England&apos;s slide to loss and despondency.&quot;  15th over: India 52-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 20, Sehwag 32) Samit Patel has come on to replace Graeme Swann, although it&apos;s probably a solitary over to allow the spinners to change ends. His first ball, as usual, is a full toss that Sehwag smears for four. Get that filth out of my sight. A single to long on brings up an excellent fifty partnership, and there are nine from the over. India aren&apos;t too far from being back in this game. Surely, 11 years later, we&apos;re not going to get another Eden Gardens miracle? &quot;Back on the stairs but at least we&apos;ve now located a key with the cleaner,&quot; says Paul Walsh. &quot;But it&apos;ll take time to get here! Ugh.&quot;  16th over: India 61-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 20, Sehwag 37) Swann does switch ends, and his first ball is slog-swept for four by Sehwag. He tries the same stroke next up; this time the ball keeps low and goes through Prior&apos;s legs for four byes. This is fascinating stuff. Sehwag, who played carefully for an hour, is ticking now. &quot;REDRUM,&quot; says Paul Connolly. &quot;So, now that you&apos;ve brought up &apos;The Shining&apos;, which was so called because of a lyric from the John Lennon song, are you saying Ishant Sharma&apos;s going to get you?&quot;  17th over: India 63-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 21, Sehwag 38) Panesar has switched to the High Court End. He was in dudgeon after that LBW from Kumar Dharmsena earlier, and now he is at Dharmasena&apos;s end. Sehwag, who is now dealing in boundaries and strolled singles, takes the latter to the cover sweeper.  &quot;I&apos;ve spent my Friday night in the university library labouring away on an essay that won&apos;t be finished any time soon with the cricket on,&quot; says Sam Robinson. Bloody students, eh, working diligently in the library on a Friday night.  18th over: India 65-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 22, Sehwag 39) Oof. That&apos;s the first sign of misbehaviour in this innings, with Swann spitting a corking delivery past Gambhir&apos;s outside edge. That bounced viciously.  19th over: India 66-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 22, Sehwag 40) Dear Mr Santa, stop buggering about with that sleigh and bring us a wicket please. Good lad. Love and hugs, the OBO.  20th over: India 76-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 23, Sehwag 49) This is getting pretty ominous for England. Sehwag tonks Swann for consecutive boundaries, the first a cut and the second a mighty slog sweep.  21st over: India 86-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 33, Sehwag 49) Panesar will bowl the last over of the session. Gambhir gives him the charge and drives handsomely over wide mid-on for six. That prompts a rush of blood to the head and a heave that is dragged just wide of the diving Compton at short midwicket. He ends the session by swiping Monty back over his head for four more. It&apos;s been a perfect morning for India, who took the last four wickets in no time and then reduced the deficit to 121 with some exhilarating batting. Bit by bit \u2013 or rather biff by biff \u2013 they are dragging themselves back in this game. Brilliant stuff. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session.  LUNCH  WICKET! India 86-1 (Sehwag b Swann 49) Graeme Swann has struck with the first ball of the session! It&apos;s a huge breakthrough for England to dismiss Virender Sehwag, and it was a beautiful delivery: tossed up and turning through the gate to hit the outside of off stump as Sehwag lunged into a woolly drive. Sehwag actually lost control of the bat, with one hand coming off it. Even so, it was a gorgeous piece of bowling.  22nd over: India 86-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 33, Pujara 4) Pujara inside-edges his second ball in the air but wide of short leg. That would have gone straight to short square leg. A wicket maiden from Swann. &quot;Mr Mukharjee, the groundsman has to be thanked for a real sporting wicket,&quot; says Krishan Patel. &quot;This wicket has something in it for everybody. The batters aren&apos;t clueless while the bowlers have some juice in the wicket as well. Think we need to see some reverse magic from Anderson in the post-lunch session to have any hope.&quot;  24th over: India 96-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 35, Pujara 8) I&apos;ve missed an over from Finn. In other news, Pujara gives Swann the charge and scuffs a drive fractionally wide of the diving Cook at short midwicket. India have clearly decided to go after England&apos;s spinners, and later in the over Pujara drives classily through extra cover for four.  25th over: India 96-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 35, Pujara 8) A maiden from Finn to Gambhir.  26th over: India 96-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 35, Pujara 8) &quot;My name is Alex Patmore and first I&apos;d like to say thank you for yesterday&apos;s three mentions of Japan cricket, but today I was hoping to link the current England side to cricket in the far east,&quot; says the very polite Alex Patmore. &quot;Thanks to my Japanese mother I am also a member of the Japan national men&apos;s team (it&apos;s there on Cricinfo), but before coming to Tokyo for work I played in Sheffield for a number of years with Joe Root at Sheffield Collegiate CC, batting together on numerous occasions. Last year we put on 97 for the fsecond wicket in one game, narrowly missing out on the first (I think) century partnership between Japan and (future) England internationals in Yorkshire League cricket. If he needs any advice on the pressure cooker environment of international cricket (Japan finished third in this years ICC World Cricket League Div8) I think he knows who to call. (I also introduced Joe to sushi for the first time \u2013 he now loves it.)&quot; Hang on, look at the opposition. John Major? Dave Brent?  27th over: India 97-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 35, Pujara 8) There&apos;s an inevitable post-Sehwag lull, with Finn bowling a third consecutive maiden. One ball pops from a length, forcing Gambhir to pull the bottom hand out of the way. There&apos;s also a pretty big shout for LBW against Gambhir, but it was surely sliding down from around the wicket.  28th over: India 98-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 36, Pujara 8) Swann is bowling really well here, and skids a delivery straight past Pujara&apos;s outside edge. &quot;I wonder if Paul Walsh has got to the ground yet and ejected the oiks I can see sitting in his seat?&quot; says Simon Brereton. &quot;Morning Rob.&quot; Non-linear emails. What a great idea. Maybe we could have MementOBOs, with entries like this: Even so, it was a gorgeous piece of bowling. It&apos;s a huge breakthrough for England to dismiss Virender Sehwag, and it was a beautiful delivery. Graeme Swann has struck with the first ball of the session! Sehwag actually lost control of the bat, with one hand coming off it. Tossed up and turning through the gate to hit the outside of off stump as Sehwag lunged into a woolly drive.  WICKET! India 98-2 (Pujara run out 8) Climie Fisher were wrong: it&apos;s the dismissal of Sehwag that changes everything. India scored at four an over with him at the crease; they&apos;ve scored at 1.5 per over since his dismissal \u2013 and now the pressure has told with a brilliant run out from Ian Bell! Gambhir tucked Finn to leg and set off. Bell, running round from midwicket, picked up and demolished the stumps with the diving Pujara fractionally short of his ground. That was an outstanding piece of work from Bell.  29th over: India 98-2 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 36, Tendulkar 0) Sachin Tendulkar is the new batsman.  29th over: India 98-2 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 36, Tendulkar 0) Is this another wicket? Gambhir pushed at Swann, who went up for the LBW, but as he did so Trott took a low catch at slip and set off in celebration. The umpires went upstairs, presumably to check if it carried, which it did \u2013 but Gambhir did not hit it. The problem is that the third umpire cannot overrule on that; his only remit is to determine whether it carried. Gambhir has been not out. This is really controversial. Surely the third umpire can only rule on whether it carried? It appears the third umpire may have taken the law into his hands. Ultimately it&apos;s the right decision \u2013\u00a0Gambhir didn&apos;t hit it \u2013 although that&apos;s not the point. Unless we&apos;re missing something really obvious, which can&apos;t be ruled out, England have been stitched up there. You can&apos;t have the third umpire making it up as he goes along.  WICKET! India 103-3 (Gambhir c Prior b Finn 40) Not even the third umpire can overrule this one! Finn, who has bowled beautifully, strikes with a wide, swinging delivery that tempts Gambhir into a very loose drive. It flies off the edge to the left of Matt Prior, who moves smartly to take a good two-handed catch. The third umpire does try to save Gambhir, checking for the no-ball, but Finn was fine and Gambhir has gone.  31st over: India 103-3 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Tendulkar 1, Kohli 0) India&apos;s fate is in the hands of superstars present and future, Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. &quot;It looks like DRS has been wheeled out to save India,&quot; says Andrew Hurley. &quot;How convenient. This is disgusting, it wouldn&apos;t happen anywhere else.&quot; I do wonder if we&apos;re missing something that would explain the decision. If not, it&apos;s a scandal, and the fact Gambhir is out doesn&apos;t change that. The fact it was morally the correct decision is an irrelevance. It might have been LBW for a start.  WICKET! India 107-4 (Tendulkar c Trott b Swann 5) Never mind the DRS fuss, England are running riot! Tendulkar feels for a non-spinning, lifting delivery from Swann and edges it straight to Trott at slip. England&apos;s response to a poor morning session has been quite magnificent.  32nd over: India 107-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 0, Yuvraj 0) Adam Mountford, the producer of TMS, has tweeted that &quot;Non DRS match regulations allow for umpires to ask if ball was hit even if they are only checking for a low catch.&quot; In which case, all is fine and dandy with the Gambhir reprieve. It doesn&apos;t seem right, though, that you can check if a batsman hit it or not. If that&apos;s the case, why couldn&apos;t they check Panesar&apos;s inside edge earlier? Why can you check for catches but not LBWs? I&apos;m boring myself now. Let&apos;s move on.  33rd over: India 111-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Yuvraj 0) Kohli gets off the mark with a princely square drive for four off Finn \u2013 and now he&apos;s dropped by Bell at short square leg! It&apos;s unlike Bell to miss those, even though it was well timed by Kohli. He reached to his left and couldn&apos;t hang on. Two balls later Kohli survives a huge shout for LBW. Kumar Dharmasena took a long time to decide, at least five seconds. It hit Kohli on the back leg but, as ever with Finn, height was an issue. It was extremely close though, and probably would have trimmed the bails. Finn is steaming in here.  34th over: India 119-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Yuvraj 8) Yuvraj helps a poor delivery from Swann to fine leg for four and then drives beautifully down the ground for another boundary. It&apos;s been a breathless afternoon session, but now it&apos;s time for drinks. &quot;Morning from the snowy Netherlands,&quot; says Anand. &quot;I am a bit surprised that everyone is complaining about the right decision being made in Gambhir&apos;s case after umpire referral. I thought that was what the world wanted and just when N Srini introduced his version of the umpire referral, everyone complains. :)&quot; You were doing so well until that smiley.  35th over: India 119-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Yuvraj 8) Anderson comes on for the excellent Finn (9-4-20-1) and finds a bit of reverse swing to Kohli. A maiden. &quot;Has a batsman ever been dropped for poor running?&quot; says Raakesh Natraj. &quot;Gambhir&apos;s certainly made a case for himself.&quot;  36th over: India 120-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Yuvraj 9) &quot;To follow up on Alex Patmore&apos;s introduction to cricket in Japan, may I offer you a welcome to Swedish cricket,&quot; says Dan MacDonald. &quot;I play for the Stockholm team SACS (Swedish T20 champions last year dontcha know). We&apos;re always looking for new players \u2013 sacs-cricket.info \u2013 and you can also catch the Swedish National Team in ICC Div. 2 action next summer, since the tournament will be taking place in England.&quot;  WICKET! India 122-5 (Yuvraj b Anderson 11) There&apos;s the uneven bounce! Yuvraj has been torpedoed by Anderson. He switched around the wicket to the left-hander and struck with his first delivery. It was straight, just short of a length, and it grubbed hideously to clean Yuvraj up. There was nothing he could do. He jabbed his bat down desperately and the ball flew off the bottom edge onto the stumps. India have lost five for 36 in 15.3 memorable overs.  37th over: India 122-5 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Dhoni 0) MS Dhoni plays around a reverse inswinger second ball and survives a big shout for LBW. It was going down.  38th over: India 122-5 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Dhoni 0) Kohli can&apos;t get going at all. After another maiden from Swann, he has four from 18 balls. &quot;This is magnificent cricket from England,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;After the disappointing first session, in the context of the series and history, this must be one of England&apos;s greatest ever couple of hours.&quot; I wouldn&apos;t go that far personally, but it has been an awesome performance, particularly coming on the back of such a difficult morning session.  WICKET! India 122-6 (Dhoni c Cook b Anderson 0) Is this really happening? Call 999-BUMBLE, because England are on fire! Anderson has struck again to dismiss MS Dhoni for a duck. It was a good delivery, just short of a length on a perfect fourth-stump line. Dhoni went fishing and edged it low to Cook at first slip. India have lost six for 36 since lunch! This is spellbinding stuff. Anderson has had a sensational game.  39th over: India 122-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Ashwin 0) Anderson&apos;s first ball to Ashwin is a beautiful reverse inswinger that Ashwin keeps out and later in the over he inside edges a wide delivery not far wide of off stump. Glorious bowling. &quot;My 10 month old Aidan is asleep on my chest after a v bad night,&quot; says Paddy Blewer. &quot;I&apos;m rationing refreshes on crackberry to every 10 mins or so not to wake him. Every refresh something&apos;s happened. Great session.&quot;  40th over: India 122-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Ashwin 0) &quot;Slept through the morning session,&quot; says Ken Danbury. &quot;Woke up to Swann taking the first wicket. Good decision I reckon.&quot;  41st over: India 125-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Ashwin 1) Ashwin inside edges Anderson a fraction wide of leg stump. It&apos;s almost a false shot a ball at the moment. &quot;I press refresh, Dhoni&apos;s gone,&quot; says Paddy Blewer. &quot;I refresh again and there&apos;s more detail, plus my email. The power has gone to my head (and lack of sleep). I will hereby finish the Indian innings early by refreshing at a higher frequency.&quot;  42nd over: India 125-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Ashwin 1) Complete the sentence: &apos;This has been England&apos;s session since ...&apos;. Melbourne 2010? The Oval 2009? Swann beats Ashwin with one that goes straight on. We have around 25 minutes to tea, so this match could easily finish today. &quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; says Hugo Hutchison. &quot;I only went next door to change my son&apos;s nappy and I missed a wicket. Are the players aware that this is Test cricket, not T20?&quot; Hang on, you went next door to change your son&apos;s nappy? What David Lynch suburbia do you live in?  43rd over: India 129-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 8, Ashwin 1) Kohli plays a fine stroke, wristily flicking Anderson through midwicket for four. India trail by 78.  &quot;At Milan airport, with the Alps looking as if they are covered in pink snow in the rosy dawn,&quot; says Martin Kettle. &quot;La Scala last night. An Indian batting collapse this morning. It doesn&apos;t get much better than this.&quot;  44th over: India 129-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 10, Ashwin 1) A maiden from Swann to Ashwin. Some very sad news from Kolkata: our ticketless hero Paul Walsh is stuck in a traffic jam. You&apos;ve missed one of the more famous sessions of English cricket since the turn of the century. I sympathise \u2013 I was lying on a hotel bed in Jamaica while Steve Harmison was taking seven for 12 down the road. Nearly nine years later I&apos;m completely over it, clearly.  45th over: India 130-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 11, Ashwin 1) Panesar comes on for Anderson, who bowled a glorious spell of 5-2-8-2. There&apos;s a stumping referral when Ashwin misses a defensive stroke; he did lift his back foot but it was down again in time.  46th over: India 131-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 12, Ashwin 1) India have only lost consecutive home Tests twice since 1977: against Pakistan and West Indies in 1987, and against South Africa in 2000. They have been pretty feeble here, although England have harassed them into surrender. India are nowhere near as bad as England have made the look.  47th over: India 131-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 13, Ashwin 1) &quot;I think England&apos;s best session,&quot; says Jeremy Bunting, &quot;was when they won the Ashes and ended up in 10, Downing St. the following morning.&quot;  48th over: India 138-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 18, Ashwin 2) I&apos;ve tried headbutting the wall, I&apos;ve tried shock therapy, I&apos;ve tried a Berocca buttie, but whatever I do the scoreboard still says that India are six down and England are closing in on a 2-1 lead. In India. After going 1-0 down. And losing all three tosses. It&apos;s ludicrous.  49th over: India 142-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 18, Ashwin 6) Ashwin, on the drive, edges Monty just wide of slip for four. India trail by 63. Kohli and Ashwin, who will be two of the key players in the new India side that will surely emerge after this series, have played well in the last half hour. It would have been pretty easy, too easy, to give it away. &quot;I was driving down to Southampton from London in the early hours of the morning listening to TMS on Radio 4 198 LW in my grandmas hand-me-down micra which is so old it only has a MW and LW radio,&quot; says Richard Webley. &quot;I was getting a familar &apos;here we go again&apos; feeling as India were effortlessly pilling on the runs for no loss. Now I&apos;m on the ferry to the Isle of Wight and everytime I check the OBO on my smartphone india lose a wicket. Great! Made me think that maybe India prefer being listenened to on LW. It definitely fits with their technophobe DRS stance!&quot;  50th over: India 145-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 19, Ashwin 8) Swann has gone around the wicket, an angle from which he bowls well to right-handers because he can beat either edge of the bat. Not much happens. One over to tea.  51st over: India 145-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 19, Ashwin 8) Steven Finn bowls the last over of a momentous session for England. It began with the wicket of Virender Sehwag from the first ball after lunch, and in 30 overs they took six wickets for 59 runs. It was every bit as beautiful as those bare figures suggest. &quot;Well, what the blazes?&quot; emails Andy Bull. He&apos;ll be here after tea, when England will hopefully complete an unforgettable victory. Thanks for your emails; see you tomorrow or next week.  TEA  Morning all. Andy Bull here now, so send your emails to me please, on andy.bull@theguardian.com. Rob needs his beauty sleep, and doesn&apos;t want to be pestered when he&apos;s trying to nap.  &quot;Waking up and seeing the score on OBO reminds me of watching England demolish Holland in Euro 96 at my friend&apos;s house,&quot; writes a misty-eyed Mark Hooper. &quot;His flatmate came home and, seeing the score (4-0 at the time), made the only logical conclusion: asked &apos;How have you done that?&apos; and looked behind the telly to see if we&apos;d somehow &apos;hooked up a computer to change the score&apos;.&quot; Yup, it was a dizzying session, and England fans can be excused for feeling a little delirious about what they&apos;re watching. I had a familiar feeling last weekend, actually, following the score from Twickenham on my phone while I was watching Wales play Australia in Cardiff. Anyone else got any cherished Victor Meldrew moments - &apos;I don&apos;t believe it&apos; - from following English sport?  While we&apos;re reveling in events in India, I can&apos;t stop myself taking a pot-shot or two at the &quot;cricketainment&quot; passing for serious sport which is underway in Australia. Gideon Haigh skewered the Big Bash League in The Australian today. I can&apos;t link to the piece because if I do you&apos;ll be asked to pay to read it. But if you google &quot;Gideon Haigh Big Bash Bumf&quot; you&apos;ll soon find it:  In fact, the Sixers have played the Thunder precisely once, and pulverised them, as did almost everyone last season. But if you&apos;re in the mood for a quiet barf, proceed no further than the mission statements of the Thunder and Sixers on their cookie-cutter websites. The Thunder? They&apos;re &quot;the real Sydney and will represent the hard-working families from the heartland of Australia&quot;, playing &quot;with the same spirit as their local community - determined and hard-working with a never give in attitude&quot;. The Sixers? They&apos;re for those who &quot;love the glitz and glamour of the harbour city&quot;. And guess what? &quot;They don&apos;t shy away from aiming to be the team that everyone else wants to be. Their uniforms are bright but that&apos;s the way they want it. They&apos;ll be loud and proud on and off the field.&quot; That someone was paid for writing this crud is as miraculous as anything you will witness in the BBL this summer.   Shane Warne, by the way, ended up bowling two overs for 41 runs. Ouch.  52nd over: India 153-6 (Kohli 19 Ashwin 16) Monty starts after tea, bowling from around the wicket to Ashwin. His first ball is a little too far over towards leg stump, and Ashwin glances it away for four. His last is a little wide of off, and Ashwin chops it away for four the other way, to third man. &quot;Greetings from Jakarta,&quot; says John Leavey. &quot;I spent last night and this morning watching the DVD of Melbourne 2010. I remember it well as I watched it on TV in various bars in Bali, surrounded by Aussies. I particularly enjoyed them laughing at me and jumping up and down at the moment we&apos;d been we&apos;d been bowled out. For a 400+ lead. Muppets. Happy days. Today feels like that - a major achievement I thought I&apos;d never see again. Anyone know of an Indian bar in Jakarta?&quot; What a truly inspired way to spend your spare time, John.  53rd over: India 155-6 (Kohli 20 Ashwin 17) Finn is on at the other end. This is now Kohli&apos;s top score of the series so far. He&apos;s more than capable, of course, of making many more this afternoon. Whether or not anyone can stay with him is another question. Ashwin can bat, and has taken a Test match century off the West Indies in his time, but there&apos;s not much to come after him.  WICKET! Kohli c Prior b Finn (India 155-7) What was I saying? Kohli goes, caught behind off a loose drive. It was good bowling from Finn, a three card trick, with the wide away-swinger following two balls that were slanting straight in at the stumps. This match is all but over now. It&apos;s a question of when, not whether, the match will end in this session. Finn almost has Zaheer caught behind off the very first ball, with a delivery that jagged back and may just have flicked the glove on the way through to Prior. The umpire decided that he couldn&apos;t tell whether it did or didn&apos;t, so Zaheer bats on.  54th over: India 159-7 (Ashwin 21 Zaheer 0) &quot;As a British citizen of Pakistani descent this is the kind of performance that would enable me to pass the Tebbit test with flying colours,&quot; cackles Yasir Gulzar. &quot;The fact that the opposition is India at home is merely the icing on the cake (or should that be pistachios on the kulfi?)&quot;  55th over: India 159-7 (Ashwin 21 Zaheer 0) it&apos;s not just that England are winning, it&apos;s the way they&apos;re doing it. This is an utter trouncing. &quot;Perhaps the most novel experience is scrolling up the OBO, watching the clatter of wickets and flurry of runs in the first session and expecting to see us fight back,&quot; says Alex Webster. &quot;I&apos;m not sure when this change happened and I&apos;m not sure how I feel about it. And I don&apos;t even feel the 0.0002g of sympathy for the Indians I felt when we beat them 4-0. I&apos;m really becoming a ruthless, clinical observer of Test matches.&quot; Ha! You&apos;re developing an Australian streak. Soon you&apos;ll just be asking for stronger opposition because you&apos;re bored of watching England win.  WICKET! Khan 0 lbw b Finn (India 159-8) That ball was far too good for a batsman of Zaheer&apos;s quality, slanting in and staying low, beating the dangling bat and hitting the pads. This match has but minutes to run.  56th over: India 162-8 (Ashwin 23, Sharma 1) India need 45 runs to avoid an innings defeat. Ashwin skips down the wicket and tries to launch a lofted drive down the ground, his head full of thoughts of Botham and Headingley &apos;81. He missed the ball, and should have been stumped but Prior fumbled the chance. Monty is furious. Cook consoles him by bringing in another slip.  57th over: India 162-8 (Ashwin 23, Sharma 1) Ishant Sharma is a gangling tripod of a batsman, seeming to sway in the breeze, propped up only by his bat. He doesn&apos;t inspire much confidence. Ashwin, on the other hand, has batted better than any other member of the vaunted middle order. He plays out a maiden from Finn, who also, again, knocks off the bails at the non-striker&apos;s end in his delivery stride. Nick Knight and Nasser Hussain, meanwhile, are having another set-to on the commentary. I don&apos;t know what passed between these two as players, whether it was at Essex or England, but they haven&apos;t got over it yet.  58th over: India 162-8 (Ashwin 23, Sharma 1) Yes, yes, I said &quot;follow-on&quot;, when I meant &quot;innings defeat&quot;. My brain is malfunctioning. As is Matt Prior&apos;s &apos;keeping. He&apos;s just dropped a straightforward sort of chance off Sharma, and this time Monty is seriously unamused.  59th over: India 166-8 (Ashwin 27, Sharma 1) Fine shot by Ashwin, a pull for four off Finn. &quot;It&apos;s 2 am in Salt Lake City, &quot; says Adam Blackwell. &quot;Where I have a terrible cold and am in great need of some recuperative sleep. So naturally I am following every over of a match whose result is now a foregone conclusion.&quot; Yes, it sort of feels like we should just be able to fast-forward through these last two wickets. England might be thinking the same thing, which would be why Prior has fluffed two chances. In the meantime we can enjoy the fact that Billy Cooper is starting to blast out Knees Up Mother Brown on his trumpet. Nice.  60th over: India 166-8 (Ashwin 27, Sharma 1) Jimmy Anderson is into the attack now. Sharma somehow keeps him out for an entire over. &quot;I think I speak for a lot of the OBO when I say &apos;Yessssssss!&apos; This is sensational stuff, Ahmedabad seems aeons away, doesn&apos;t it?&quot; says Guy Hornsby I wonder what team we&apos;ll see from India in 4 days? Sachin and DhonI still there, Ohja, Ashwin? Who else?&quot; It&apos;ll be fascinating to see how many changes they feel able to make. Perhaps they&apos;ll give this same time one last chance in this series. Yuvraj, I guess, would be the easiest man to drop.  61st over: India 166-8 (Ashwin 27, Sharma 1) Bumble is on brilliant form today in the commentary box. He must have finally got his head around the early starts. Either that or he got out to the French House in Soho last night, which, I think, is that&apos;s his usual haunt in London. He&apos;s just whipped out a pair of immaculate impressions of Brian Johnston and Fred Trueman on TMS.  62nd over: India 170-8 (Ashwin 27, Sharma 5) Sharma smears four past point off an inswinging half volley from Anderson. They trail by 37 now.  63rd over: India 174-8 (Ashwin 31, Sharma 5) Four more, for Ashwin this time. It all looks a little easy out there right now, though perhaps that&apos;s just because we&apos;re expecting wickets to fall so easily. England&apos;s biggest win in terms of runs in India is, I think, and innings and 25. At the moment they lead by an innings and 33 here. Ashwin refuses a series of singles, and then calls for a new bat, his current one having cracked at the splice.  64th over: India 178-8 (Ashwin 31, Sharma 9) Monty is on now, with four men crowding around the bat. Sharma chops the ball over the head of Jimmy Anderson at slip, and gets himself four more. &quot;Are India aware that their tactic to restrict Alastair Cook&apos;s run-scoring (by only offering him a single innings per match) is not new,&quot; chortles Christopher Howell, &quot;and that furthermore it wasn&apos;t successful for Australia?&quot;  65th over: India 178-8 (Ashwin 31, Sharma 9) &quot;Yasir gulzar&apos;s comment in over 55 reminds me of when I passed the Tebbit test,&quot; says Siddhu Warrier. &quot;I felt exactly the same as England trounced Pakistan at the Oval two years ago. I was on that great day doing Norman Tebbit proud, waving the cross of St George in the middle of a (slightly annoyed) group of Pakistan supporters. I guess today is when my bad karma sees me get my just desserts (a slightly rancid gulab jamun, to be precise).&quot;  66th over: India 184-8 (Ashwin 33, Sharma 9) Four byes, down the leg side, though Matt Prior couldn&apos;t have done much about them, so much did the ball swing after pitching. India need another 23 to avoid the innings defeat. As Simon McMahon says, &quot;it&apos;s come to something when it would be a victory of sorts for India to make England bat again.&quot;  67th over: India 184-8 (Ashwin 33, Sharma 9) Swann is on now. Here&apos;s hoping he can wrap this innings up quick sharp. Two of his first three balls spin viciously, the second of them ballooning up off Ishant&apos;s pads and looping over Cook at silly point. It&apos;s a maiden.  68th over: India 188-8 (Ashwin 37, Sharma 9) For India, this stand is almost more of a problem than it is a help, given the light it is casting on the effort of the other batsmen. They have out on 28 off 78 balls so far, and have made batting look very easy indeed in the last 30 minutes. &quot;I think these home defeats might be the best thing to happen to Indian cricket,&quot; says Anand, with no little sagacity. &quot;After successive drubbings, the talk was always about walking all over the opposition at home. If that happened, would have plastered over the cracks and no steps taken to overhaul. I hope that the new selection committee sees these defeats as the time to make changes. Unless people everywhere start blaming curators for the inabilities of the players.&quot;  69th over: India 191-8 (Ashwin 39, Sharma 10) This is getting a little tedious, to be honest. Credit to Ashwin and Sharma, of course, for not giving in, but there is no way to win they can win the match from here, and from a spectator&apos;s point of view, their stonewalling isn&apos;t much to enjoy. England, in the meantime, have turned flatter than week-old Tizer.  70th over: India 192-8 (Ashwin 40, Sharma 10) Ashwin thumps a drive in the air through mid-off, but there is no one there to catch it. A reader in need writes: &quot;I&apos;m wondering if the OBOers might be able to help me figure out how to quickly revert my bathroom back from the mini swimming pool it has currently turned into. All my towels are now too sodden to take up any more water and the fan heater just seems to create interesting currents and eddies. Of course, me wandering off for cricket updates and catching up on the action via OBO may mean I&apos;ve perhaps not been as diligent in bailing out as I should be. Any suggestions for how I can speed up the drying process gratefully received (not involving turning up the heating as my 1930s flat has only two settings....). Oh, and if England can hurry up and get the tail end out that would also be marvellous so I can focus properly on the problem.&quot; Any suggestions for Sinj Mukherjee?  71st over: India 193-8 (Ashwin 41, Sharma 10) India need 14 more to make England bat again, and there are 12 overs left today.  71st over: India 196-8 (Ashwin 44, Sharma 10) Ashwin steers two runs down to third man.  Please, please, please let this stumping be out. It&apos;s gone for a review. And it&apos;s not out. Sharma survives.  WICKET! Sharma 10 b Panesar (India 197-9) Well thank goodness for that. Monty bowls Sharma. Phew, Sharma&apos;s interminable innings of 10 from 53 balls is finally over. Well played, sir, but I&apos;ll be happy if I never have to sit through the like again. There&apos;s one wicket needed, and India still trail by ten runs.  73rd over: India 198-9 (Ashwin 45 Ojha 1) This is more like it. Ojha has an almighty swing at his first ball and skies the ball into the outfield. He takes a single, and Ashwin shoots him a dirty look. Ojha ignores him. It may have been irresponsible, but it was entertaining.  74th over: India 208-9 (Ashwin 53 Ojha 1) Ojha&apos;s recklessness seems to be infectious. Ashwin slaps a slog sweep away square for one four, and steers the next past third man for another. So, that brings up his fifty, and also means that the scores are level. England will have to bat again. Ashwin tries a reverse sweep now, for another single, and India lead by one.  75th over: India 217-9 (Ashwin 62 Ojha 2) No one does seem to have any suggestions for poor old Miss Mukherjee with his flooded bathroom. I imagine he&apos;s out of towels by now, too. Ashwin, meanwhile, has walloped a crisp four though cover. A glorious shot that. The next one is good too, a whip off his hips for another boundary. &quot;India have found one here,&quot; says Nasser, &quot;a proper all-rounder.&quot;  76th over: India 218-9 (Ashwin 63 Ojha 2) Oh dear. Now Ojha seems to be blocking too. Swing for six, or die trying man, there&apos;s no glory in the blocking game. The mind of Peter James McKean has been set wondering down memory lane by that photo of young Alastair Cook at the top of the page: &quot;When I was working at Oakham School I once went to Bedford School for an away cricket fixture. As my U15B team trooped into tea I lingered outsidee the pavilion to watch the 1st XI. On cue, a young batsman clipped a ball of his toes to bring up a double century (against an Oakham side containing Stuart Broad, who opened the batting in those days). Frank Hayes, ex. England and Lancashire commented &apos;That&apos;s the best young batsman I&apos;ve seen in 20 years&apos;. It was, of course, Alastair Cook. In a way I wish I&apos;d said something like &quot;Oh, I don&apos;t think he&apos;s all that. Looks a bit dodgy outside off stump&quot; as then I could have joined the ranks of Teachers Who Were Embarrassingly Wrong. But he was pretty good, so I just watched.&quot;  77th over: India 219-9 (Ashwin 63 Ojha 2) India&apos;s lead is 11 now. There are six overs to come after this one, less two for the change of innings. Monty leads a raucous lbw appeal against Ojha, but the ball was turning too much and would have missed leg stump.  78th over: India 222-9 (Ashwin 66 Ojha 2) Cook brings up his fielders, trying to tempt Ashwin into playing a big shot or, at least, ensure that Ojha is on strike for the next over. Ashwin does play a few ludicrous strokes, skipping down the pitch and trying -and failing - to swat a lofted drive down the ground, then swishing a reverse sweep to third man. The terrible truth is starting to dawn on the Sky commentators - they will have to come back tomorrow morning.  79th over: India 228-9 (Ashwin 72 Ojha 3) Oh my. Four more, as Ashwin clips a drive over mid-on &quot;The flat beneath have just been round to shout at me,&quot; says Miss Mukherjee, who has written in to point out that I made the mistake of assuming she was a man the last time I mentioned her. &quot;Luckily they were shouting in Chinese so I happily nodded, waved at my towels and shut the door on them.&quot; Come on readers, what&apos;s the lady to do?  80th over: India 228-9 (Ashwin 70 Ojha 3) &quot;What do you reckon Smyth is thinking right now?&quot; asks Simon McMahon. &quot;Probably hoping these two hang around til the close so he can get up for work at 3am on Sunday, right?&quot; You called it, Simon. Cricket is glorious isn&apos;t it? There are four overs left today, minus two for the change of innings, plus, of course, England could claim the extra half hour to try and win the match tonight. But that&apos;s only if the dying light allows it, though. India lead by 21 now.  81st over: India 232-9 (Ashwin 76 Ojha 3) England could take the new ball now, if the umpires allow them to in this rather murky light. They will, it seems. Cook has called for it, and given it to Anderson. His first ball is way down the leg side. Ashwin could yet come to regret extending this match so long that England have been able to take a new ball - Anderson has rapped him on the hand with sharp, straight delivery, and he&apos;s now in a little pain. The next ball nips back and almost sneaks through the gate. Ashwin carts the next ball back past the bowler for four, and slashes the next away for a single to the leg-side. Infuriatingly, that means Ojha gets off strike for the next over.  82nd over: India 238-9 (Ashwin 82 Ojha 3) Ashwin wallops four more through mid-wicket. He&apos;s playing wonderfully well. But I wish he wasn&apos;t. I realise it&apos;s only the journalists who really care whether or not England win this tonight, but take my word for it, it&apos;s tremendously tense for us professionals. There&apos;s a day off at stake here. Here, just for Miss Mukherjee, is a little practical advice on the problems of a flooded bathroom: &quot;Tools for flooding depend on the depth of the problem (sorry)\u2026&quot; writes Matt Bedford. &quot;When towels and mops can&apos;t cut it anymore you may be best off leaving it be and going to shop for a pump/wet-dry vacuum cleaner. Also essential: a camera \u2013 take loads of photos for insurance purposes\u2026 if neighbours are knocking, you may need those snaps.&quot; That wasn&apos;t the most thrilling email we&apos;ve ever published on the OBO, I have to say.  83rd over: India 239-9 (Ashwin 82 Ojha 3) &quot;Has Sinj turned the water off at the mains?&quot; asks Nick Tebbutt, most helpfully. &quot;That&apos;s the first move. After that, she should probably just leave the house and ignore the problem until evaporation takes its course. Now, can the OBOers suggest a fix for my problem? I&apos;m crushingly hungover and there&apos;s no breakfast in the flat. Everything&apos;s too bright outside, but the gf&apos;s just threatened to hit me if I don&apos;t provide something. What to do?&quot; Oh yes, that one&apos;s easy Nick - first option is to lock yourself in the toilet until she gives in and goes out herself, second option is to get down on your knees and plead that she look in her heart, has mercy on you and goes out to get breakfast herself, third option is to trade it off against promises of future good deeds.  It&apos;s all over, England aren&apos;t allowed the extra half hour, and we&apos;ll all have to come back tomorrow. Ashwin has batted brilliantly - Ojha has only had to face one delivery since the new ball was taken. I&apos;ve watched a little too much English cricket to say that England are bound to win this match tomorrow, but they really should do. India&apos;s lead is 32. Rob Smyth will be here at 3.15am to talk you through it. Poor bugger. Cheerio.

It has certainly done that'", "article": "Sam Mendes, director of Skyfall, hesitates. He is thinking about James Bond. It is, after all, partly thanks to him that Bond has recently acquired a psyche. But his case history is not easy to sum up. After a moment, he laughingly says that, were Bond on the couch, he would tell him: &quot;You have many demons. If I were to put you into Freudian analysis, you would be there for the next 200 years. What I strongly advise is a change of career. Why not run a small shop?&quot; This is not advice anyone is about to give Mendes himself. His charmed career has reached new heights. He started out as a 24-year-old dynamo directing Judi Dench in the West End. He founded and ran the Donmar theatre for 10 years from 1990. He won five Oscars for American Beauty in 1999 when he was not even 35. And he directed a film of America&apos;s dark suburban novel Revolutionary Road , starring his ex-wife Kate Winslet. But Skyfall is something else again. It broke UK box office records in its first week \u2013 taking \u00a337.2m \u2013 and is now Britain&apos;s highest-grossing film ever. Now the only question is whether Mendes is going to make the sequel. At 47, he has a young face \u2013 his grey hair and beard in contrast to his vibrancy. He is bearlike in his shaggy black jumper. A comfortable, vigorous, jovial presence filling the large sitting room in which we meet \u2013 part of his Covent Garden production company. &quot;It&apos;s not true that I&apos;ve worked out a new plot for Bond. Nor have I made any commitment to another Bond movie. I have said that I&apos;ve put everything I wanted into this film. The idea I can simply start again makes me feel physically ill. I need to get back to theatre, spend more time at home and then\u2026 and then it might be someone else&apos;s turn.&quot; The truth is Skyfall will be a hard act to follow no matter who is in the driving seat. Above all, Mendes needs a good story: &quot;Directing depends upon a story&apos;s rhythm \u2013 a good story should breathe in and out.&quot; Or, in Bond&apos;s case, hold its breath? He explains that Skyfall&apos;s opening 10 minutes, involving three Turkish locations, took more than two months to film. He talks about shooting in &quot;the disused tube platforms under Charing Cross in stygian darkness&quot;. He jokes: &quot;When I said &apos;yes&apos; to a Bond movie, I pictured South America, the Andes, a tropical island. And what was I given? F-ing London Underground \u2026&quot; The reward for filming there? &quot;Black snot.&quot; But wasn&apos;t Shanghai, at least, as dazzling as his film made it look? He smiles and shakes his head. Making the film was exhausting, &quot;like making four movies in one&quot;. It was, he says, half pleasure, half pain. And daunting? How would Mendes answer the question Bond is asked: what do you know about fear? &quot;Quite a lot \u2013 I am a good dissembler. So much of this job is to instil confidence. You need to be the leader. If you are scared, you have to hide it \u2013 it is not useful.&quot; A Bond film is &quot;frightening&quot; because &quot;one&apos;s personality could be consumed by the machine&quot;. He adds: &quot;I am the opposite to Bond. I&apos;m a physical coward. I don&apos;t enjoy firing a gun. And I drive very slowly.&quot; But the film has been liberating too. For once, he has not been worried about the critics (perhaps his Cambridge education or his parents \u2013 his Portuguese Trinidadian father was a university literature professor and his mother is an author \u2013 can be held responsible for his having taken them too seriously in the past). &quot;I stopped thinking about threading the needle between genres. I have made a Beckettian war movie (Jarhead), a $100m gangster movie like an arthouse film (Road to Perdition) and relationship dramas that are dark as they come (Revolutionary Road). It was nice to say: my sole job here is to tell a great story.&quot; And when his crowd-pleaser pleased the critics, he saw a lesson in it. I ask if using Adele was his idea? He says it was a joint thing and adds: &quot;She sat on that sofa over there.&quot; He remembers how worried she was about writing a Bond theme tune as her lyrics are always very personal. He explains: &quot;I told her to write a love song.&quot; When she did, he was over the moon: &quot;Coming in from the country to shoot, I listened to her song solidly for two hours.&quot; But he is also tickled pink, it would appear, at having made a middle-aged Bond film: &quot;This Bond is about a middle-aged Brit, made by a middle-aged Brit.&quot; At the same time, the film aimed to satisfy his &quot;inner 12-year-old&quot; \u2013 and his nine-year-old son Joe: &quot;One of the biggest reasons for doing this was to make a film my son could see.&quot; His devotion to his son could not be clearer. But he and Joe&apos;s mother, Kate Winslet (who was picking up a CBE from Buckingham Palace on the day we met), divorced last year and Mendes has since been reported to be in a relationship with the actress Rebecca Hall, daughter of Sir Peter Hall. How much pressure does being in the public eye put on a marriage? &quot;I don&apos;t think it makes a difference to the internal workings of a relationship,&quot; he says cautiously. &quot;It is more difficult for women. But people have been very respectful and I think we handled ourselves with dignity which is the important thing. The overriding concern, as always, is for the health and happiness of our children.&quot; He sounds, understandably, stilted \u2013 as if reading a press release aloud. Today, Mendes feels &quot;blessed&quot; but adds: &quot;I don&apos;t take any of it for granted.&quot; After years in America, he is now based in London \u2013 and has a house in the country \u2013 where he feels &quot;happy and rooted&quot;. Has he ever failed at anything? &quot;God, yes \u2013 do you want a list? I can&apos;t speak a foreign language. I can&apos;t type or play golf. I can&apos;t cook. And I have not got a perfect track record in the art of conducting relationships with the opposite sex\u2026&quot; And what about as a director? &quot;I have been down some blind alleys and felt I was repeating myself.

Besides scalpers, few turn out for iPad mini launch in Beijing &gt;&gt; WSJ  The release of Apple Inc.&apos;s iPad Mini on Friday at its flagship store in Beijing was missing the massive and unruly crowds reminiscent of some the company&apos;s previous product launches in China, but scalpers were still out in force despite rules making it tougher for them to buy most of the stock.  Apple is requiring Chinese customers to participate in an online lottery one day in advance to buy the Wi-Fi version of the iPad Mini at its seven retail stores in China.

Google&apos;s Android failure in China is another setback for the search company in the world&apos;s largest internet market &gt; MIT Technology Review Jessica Leber:   Now it&apos;s clear that Google is paying a price for leaving the country just as the mobile market took off. Today, it&apos;s barely a factor for Chinese consumers who use mobile phones. Because Google no longer has servers in China, Google Play and Google Web search aren&apos;t particularly useful to people there. Google Play suffers from bad connectivity, and the Web search is routed through Hong Kong. &quot;Google won&apos;t improve the situation unless they resolve the bigger issue of having a presence in China,&quot; says Nicole Peng, the Shanghai-based research director for the market research firm Canalys.  Google also has accused China of slowing or blocking access to Gmail. And its mobile mapping service has fallen from popularity in part because the service is poor and has been infrequently updated while Google has been waiting for the Chinese government to approve a necessary licence.  That&apos;s in stark contrast to Apple, which tightly controls its devices--and hasn&apos;t battled with the Chinese government over censorship. It was able to simply remove Google Maps from its phones in China in favor of its own new map service, just as it did elsewhere around the world this year.  Chinese companies, too, are jumping in where Google can&apos;t. Baidu has its mobile search and mapping services and has released a cloud-based service to help developers build apps for Android devices. Tencent&apos;s chat and payment app, WeChat, has become popular. And companies like Xiaomi have developed customized versions of Android that phone owners can install on new phones after their purchase.  Microsoft Silverlight: shattered into a million broken urls &gt;&gt; Tim Anderson&apos;s ITWriting  I am not sure when it happened, but it is true. Silverlight.net now redirects to a page on MSDN. Some but not all of the content has been migrated to MSDN, but Microsoft has not bothered to redirect the URLs, so most of the links out there to resources and discussions on Silverlight will dump you to the aforementioned generic page.  One of the things this demonstrates is how short-sighted it is to create these mini-sites with their own top-level domain. It illustrates how fractured Microsoft is, with individual teams doing their own thing regardless. Microsoft has dozens of these sites, such as windowsazure.com, windowsphone.com, asp.net, and so on; there is little consistency of style, and when someone decides to fold one of these back to the main site, all the links die.  Google adds bizarre requirement for SFPD&apos;s bike theft workshop attendees &gt;&gt; SFAppeal  &quot;The workshop will offer speakers from the San Francisco Police Department on topics ranging from how authorities investigate bike theft to tips and tricks on protecting your bicycle,&quot; according to SFPD.

According to the RSVP page for the event, admission to the bicycle theft event is guaranteed only if community members include a link to their Google Plus Local profile with five or more reviews... &quot;You know you try and do something good, you try and do something for the community and something like this happens,&quot; Officer Carlos Manfredi, an SFPD spokesperson told The Appeal in apparent frustration.

Thoughts on Apple&apos;s 6.4% Stock Drop &gt;&gt; AAPL Orchard &quot;Sammy&quot; has frequently forecast Apple&apos;s revenues and profits more accurately than Wall Street analysts:   I&apos;m skeptical that any rumored (or even factual) news story was capable of causing the world&apos;s most valuable company to drop 6% in a few hours. Instead, I think the intense selling pressure was caused by several mid-sized hedge funds forced to sell Apple positions because their computer models were programmed to sell Apple. In an effort to remove emotion from trading, some funds program models to buy and sell stock given certain market conditions (most likely momentum characteristics). By removing the human from the equation, one is unable to avoid selling a stock on no news (in many ways, for the model to be successful, all decisions have to be followed).

The Indian-owned company has agreed to conduct a &quot;feasibility study&quot; with Saudi Arabia&apos;s National Industrial Clusters Development Program \u2013 a government body charged with securing investment in five industrial sectors including car making. JLR has indicated that its UK expansion, which includes a move to 24-hour operation at its Halewood plant, has reached a limit for now and that it will target overseas markets. Alongside the China operation, JLR operates an assembly plant in India, where parts are shipped in and put together to make cars \u2013 as opposed to the fully integrated process at places like Halewood, where car bodies are stamped out as well. JLR&apos;s chief executive, Ralf Speth, said Saudi Arabia was an &quot;attractive&quot; option. He added: &quot;We are committed to further international partnerships to meet record demand for our highly sought after vehicles.&quot; While JLR&apos;s recent UK investments have helped stoke talk of a British manufacturing revival, the company is setting its sights abroad. Speth said in September that JLR must &quot;go where the markets are&quot;, a strategy that has drawn expressions of concern from Tony Woodley, former joint leader of the Unite trade union. JLR, which has hired an extra 8,000 people in the UK in recent years, owns three car plants in the West Midlands and Merseyside and has announced plans for an engine plant in Wolverhampton. JLR said talks were at a preliminary stage but said the discussions had already identified opportunities in making aluminium components such as car bodies.

Harding summoned staff to a meeting at 3.30pm on Wednesday to announce that he had resigned. He will leave the paper at the end of the month and it is understood he is unlikely to stay on in another job at Times publisher News International or parent company News Corp. In his resignation speech in the Times newsroom Harding told shocked colleagues: &quot;It has been made clear to me that News Corporation would like to appoint a new editor of the Times. I have, therefore, agreed to stand down. I called Rupert [Murdoch] this morning to offer my resignation and he accepted it.&quot; Harding added: &quot;This job is a constant privilege and I hope you will, like me, look back with a sense of achievement at the work we have done.&quot; He said he was &quot;proud&quot; of the paper&apos;s campaigns on tax avoidance, adoption and cycling and its &quot;unflinching foreign coverage&quot;. He thanked Murdoch for the &quot;great honour&quot; he did him in appointing him editor of the paper and said it was &quot;a privilege and a point of pride&quot; to work there. Those in the newsroom for the announcement said that Harding was hugged by his emotional deputy editor Keith Blackmore, who will take over as interim editor. In tears, Blackmore said that he was &quot;the best editor the times ever had&quot;. John Witherow, the editor of the Sunday Times for the last 15 years, is being tipped as a possible replacement, along with his deputy Martin Ivens. The appointment of a new Times editor must be approved by the independent directors of Times Newspapers, the News International subsidiary that publishes it, as part of a legally binding agreement entered into by Murdoch when he acquired the paper in 1981. Stunned Times journalists took to Twitter to express their shock. Sports journalist Patrick Kidd said he was &quot;immensely saddened&quot; by Harding&apos;s &quot;enforced resignation&quot;. He was &quot;universally admired, a real positive force&quot;. Reporter Fay Schlesinger tweeted: &quot;James Harding&apos;s departure is a massive loss for us. Office quietest I&apos;ve ever known it.&quot; The timing of the resignation is particularly surprising given that Harding is been leading negotiations between editors and with No 10 in the wake of the Leveson inquiry over how to design a reformed system for press regulation that will operate without statute. He is understood to have been in close talks with No 10 about how to create a body to certify the work of the press regulator that would be set up by royal charter \u2013 and chaired last Wednesday&apos;s meeting at the Delaunay restaurant, at which editors broadly agreed to sign up to the non-statutory provisions of the Leveson report. Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp, said: &quot;James has been a distinguished editor for the Times, attracting talented staff to the paper and leading it through difficult times. I have great respect for him as a colleague and friend, and truly hope we can work together again.&quot; Harding said in News International&apos;s official statement: &quot;For any journalist, it is an extraordinary privilege and a point of pride to see your work appear beneath the masthead of the Times, the greatest name in newspapers in the world. &quot;I feel hugely honoured to have been given the opportunity to edit the paper and deeply grateful for the experience of working among the finest journalists in the world. This paper has an unrivalled history and, I am extremely confident, a long and impressive future ahead of it.&quot; Harding was appointed in late 2007 following the promotion of Robert Thomson to run Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal following Rupert Murdoch&apos;s $5bn acquisition of the US financial information and news publisher. He was the second youngest ever editor of the title, aged 38 when he took over. He came under criticism over the paper&apos;s decision to unmask the anonymous police blogger NightJack after his email was hacked by former Times journalist Patrick Foster. Murdoch told the Leveson inquiry that he was &quot;appalled&quot; that a Times lawyer had misled the high court over how the paper came to reveal Richard Horton&apos;s identity and said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; that Harding decided to publish the story in the first place. Harding began his career on the Financial Times. He opened the paper&apos;s Shanghai bureau and went on to become bureau chief in Washington before joining the Times as business editor. In an email to staff, outgoing News International chief executive Tom Mockridge praised Harding&apos;s &quot;energy, wit and inspiration&quot; and the Times&apos; coverage of key events including Olympic Games. He added: &quot;Since his appointment as editor in 2007, James has guided the Times through transformational change. Under his leadership the title has embraced the huge advancements in technology, whilst remaining true to the heart of the story and its world-renowned reputation as the paper of record. &quot;In the face of industry-wide pressures on circulation, the Times has managed to steady its market share and expand its subscription model.&quot; \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

It was a dramatic contrast to the scenes at the iPhone 4S launch in January when an angry crowd pelted the store in Beijing with eggs and fights broke out between would-be touts aiming to resell new phones. On Friday there was one person waiting at Apple&apos;s store in Shanghai&apos;s financial district before it opened. But the lack of queues may have been down to the online lottery scheme introduced by Apple to prevent a repeat of January&apos;s chaos. It used the same method earlier this month for the launch of its iPad mini, and enforced a two-per-person limit. Although the company has 300,000 pre-orders for the phone from China Unicom, one of the three big mobile providers, and will also sell it through mobile company China Telecom, it has still not sealed a deal with China Mobile, the biggest player with 703 million users of whom 79m are 3G (ie smartphone) users. Despite years of talks, the two sides have disagreed on revenue splits and business models. That means Apple is unable to increase its shipments there as fast as the market for smartphones is growing. There are already 290 million smartphone users and that is forecast to double in the next 12 months. Nokia&apos;s shares rose earlier this month after it tied up a deal to sell its Lumia smartphones through China Mobile. Even so, China Mobile announced in March that an estimated 15 million people use iPhones on its network, despite their being incompatible with its data services. More broadly, But Apple and Nokia are struggling in the face of competition from devices powered by versions of Google&apos;s Android software: those make up roughly 90% of the smartphones sold in China, although many connect to Chinese services rather than Google&apos;s. &quot;In absolute terms, this (iPhone 5) launch will certainly result in strong sales for Apple in China. However, in relative terms, I don&apos;t believe it will move the needle enough in market share,&quot; Shiv Putcha, a Mumbai-based analyst at Ovum, a global technology consultant, told the Reuters news agency. Peter Misek of Jefferies said he was lowering his iPhone shipment estimates for the first quarter of 2013 by 5m to 48m, on the basis that the company was cutting orders to suppliers. He also cut his estimates for the company&apos;s gross margins by 2 percentage points, to 40%. He said it was unclear how much the snowy weather and requirement to pre-order were factors in the small queues. That seems to have helped push down Apple shares, which have lost a quarter of their value since hitting an all-time high of $705.07 on 21 September. Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS Research, told clients in a research note that he didn&apos;t expect the iPhone 5 to do as well in China as the iPhone 4S.

He was the first in the village to acquire a bicycle; like Ford&apos;s Model T, the Forever came in any colour you liked, as long as it was black. Though America was deep in the golden age of the automobile, those days lay so far ahead for China that small boys would loiter on street corners in Beijing, waiting until a car drove by and the exotic tang of petrol fumes filled their nostrils. Even by the early 1980s, glimpses of imported Soviet Ladas or stately Chinese Red Flag saloons were rare outside the capital. &quot;We never dreamed we would have a chance to have our own car\u2026 and not only one,&quot; Zhang&apos;s husband, Wang Junfang, says. China&apos;s love affair with cars began late, but it has more than made up for the delay. In 2000 there were 4m cars for the 1.3bn population and experts predicted that the number would be six times higher by the end of the decade. Instead, it soared 20-fold. Two years ago, the country became the world&apos;s largest new car market. This year, it should see about 18m sales, against 14.5m in the US. The kingdom of bicycles is now the land of the car. Michael Dunne, whose firm Dunne &amp; Company advises on investments in the Asian automobile industry, calls it car culture with Chinese characteristics. People are looking for freedom and convenience, but &quot;it&apos;s different from the US experience \u2013 open highways, rolling down your windows, putting music on,&quot; he says. &quot;In China, it&apos;s more about social status: look at me, look at my\u00a0new car. It&apos;s much more about the thrill you get from pulling up in front of your hotel or golf club or workplace and being seen and recognised.&quot; Zhang and her husband \u2013 a fresh-faced, sporty couple in their early 30s \u2013 have already added a\u00a0Peugot 206 to their 4x4 Subaru Forester. &quot;Families want different cars for different uses,&quot; she explains. &quot;One for daily use, one for weekends.&quot; The bigger Subaru is ideal for getting out of the city so that Wang can fish or the pair can ride their bikes together, they say. The Peugeot\u00a0is fine, too, and only a few years old. But they like the idea of getting something newer and hipper, so they have come to a Mini showroom. The Mini &quot;looks very cool and quite British, and this brand has been bought by BMW, so we trust its quality,&quot; Wang says. &quot;And, of course, we like the personalisation aspect. We want to add stripes after we buy it, and colourful paintwork.&quot; They have plenty of choice as they stroll through the vast new Mini emporium in west Beijing. The store spans 9,000 square metres across two floors, with espresso points and a\u00a0miniature Zen garden. There&apos;s a pool table beneath the scrawled command BE SEXY \u2013 BE MINI and giant copies of Andy Warhol&apos;s Marilyn and Mao portraits lean against a wall. Around the floor, potential buyers settle into the seats of Coopers and Countrymen, while returning owners ponder new ways to distinguish their cars. One motorist shows off the chequerboard roof, racing stripes and new wing-mirror covers that he&apos;s added; he is disappointed that there is, as yet, no checked glove compartment cover for his model. At 220,000 to 400,000 yuan \u2013 \u00a322,000 to \u00a340,000 \u2013 the cars are a hefty investment in a city where last year the average income was about 33,000 yuan. Wang and Zhang are teachers, but still live with his parents and have had a little help from relatives. Being a two-car couple seems natural to them. In fact, the Mini showroom looks restrained in a land that boasts almost a million dollar-millionaires. Gleaming Lamborghinis, Tramontanas and Porsches park in front of malls or screech along expressways in late-night races, prompting admiration, envy and resentment, but little surprise these days. Sky-high taxes on high-end imports have proved little deterrent; the Maserati Quattroporte, at upwards of 2.2m yuan, is the vehicle of choice for ladies who lunch. Last month, 130 Ferraris, mostly as red as the Chinese flag, paraded through the streets of Guangzhou in a celebration of the brand&apos;s 20 years in the country. When Rolls-Royce launched a $1.2m Year of the Dragon edition of its Phantom, with the creature hand-painted on its wheelbase and hand-stitched on to cushions, all eight sold in two months. Car firms throughout the price spectrum have come to depend on Chinese buyers. &quot;There is no way to overstate how much foreign companies have become reliant on sustaining success in the Chinese market,&quot; says Dunne, who is also author of American Wheels, Chinese Roads: The Story Of General Motors In China. &quot;For GM, Hyundai, Nissan, Volkswagen, Audi, it&apos;s already the number one car market in the world. Take China out of their portfolio and their fortunes would reverse.&quot; Some believe that the US \u2013 the land of Route 66, T-Birds and American Graffiti \u2013 has reached &quot;peak car&quot;; the number of miles driven per person has fallen in recent years. But no one doubts that plenty of room remains in the world&apos;s second largest economy, even as its GDP growth cools. In the US, there are around 600 cars per 1,000 people, against a global average of 135, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. In China? Just 44. When a report from the management consultants McKinsey warned of slowing growth in the car market in China, it was predicting an 8% annual increase in the near future. That may be a substantial fall from the 24% of recent years \u2013 but given the size of the existing market, it should not prove too painful for car firms.     Star car: workers polish up a Rolls-Royce outside a petrol station in Beijing. Photograph: Chien-Min Chung/Polaris/Eyevine    The government has encouraged car sales as part of the Chinese dream. &quot;The Chinese customer really wants a better life,&quot; says Arthur Wang, of McKinsey&apos;s Shanghai office, &quot;and when they consider that, they have a house, they have a\u00a0car.&quot; Officials are thinking about the economic benefits. Car manufacturing has a powerful multiplier effect compared with other sectors, fuelling steel production and other industries and, at the other end of the chain, a\u00a0growing number of dealerships. Meanwhile, officials have used infrastructure construction to shore up GDP figures and promote development across the country. If Beijing&apos;s six ring roads are striking, the national network&apos;s expansion is more so. In 2000, there were 16,000km (11,000 miles) of expressway, according to state media; by 2009 that had reached 65,000 and by 2020 there will be 100,000km, roughly similar to the US. But, Dunne notes, there is now &quot;a bit of a political dilemma&quot; for the government. &quot;It really likes the fact that 95% of cars on the road are built here, thanks to very high tariffs on imported cars. It\u00a0means investment in factories, jobs, tax revenues. On the other hand, [it is] suddenly confronted with the potential risks to national security in that it is more than ever reliant on imported oil. How do you feed this monster? And the environment is incredibly important, especially to younger Chinese. The government is saying it will tolerate the problems because it wants the motor industry. But it&apos;s not an open-and-shut case. They are saying: we have to manage this, because it&apos;s big and it could get out of hand.&quot; China is roughly the same size as the US, but its population is four times bigger, and the downsides of car growth are already obvious. In 2011 alone, 62,387 people were killed on the roads, according to the police. Although those figures show the toll declining from a peak in 2002, other researchers question the data and the downwards trend. In 2007, they point out, police recorded 81,649 deaths on the roads, whereas death registrations suggested that crashes killed 221,135. Cars have also come to symbolise what is worst, as well as best, about the country&apos;s breakneck development. For China it is a love-hate relationship, with an ambivalence apparently lacking in America&apos;s automobile addiction. Cars have become inextricably associated with corruption and the abuse of power; greed and materialism; environmental devastation; perhaps, above all, the growing gulf between the rich and the rest. Anger erupts when wealthy boy racers mow down less privileged pedestrians. Gossip is rife about luxury models registered to official work units or driven by cadres&apos; relatives. Many believe that a leading politician&apos;s hopes of promotion were destroyed this year when his son was involved in a fatal Ferrari accident. When I\u00a0passed a luxury car crash in Beijing this spring, an old man who had stopped to stare muttered, &quot;It would be better if rich people just died.&quot; Regular motorists moan about the arrogance and bullying behaviour of those in more expensive cars, especially those with official plates. (Not all of these may be genuine: past crackdowns have netted vast numbers of fake military registrations.) People may not care about their own contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, and the effect of rising temperatures and sea levels, as policy-makers do. But they notice when their children choke on smog and they grumble when they inch along because their route to work is clogged by other motorists. When the media group Bloomberg held a race across the capital last month, a bicycle reached the finish line in half an hour \u2013 22 minutes quicker than the Porsche. Even two-car households often spurn the western one-vehicle-one-user model on practical grounds, as Zhang explains. &quot;The traffic is so bad, we drive one car and he will drop me off halfway so I can get the subway,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s more efficient than taking two cars to work.&quot; The problems are becoming so bad that Beijing has banned motorists from driving one day a\u00a0week and limited new car registrations through a lottery system. In 2010, some 790,000 cars were added to the capital&apos;s roads \u2013 more than 2,000 a day. But officials say only 173,000 were added last year \u2013 the first slowdown in growth since 1984. Even that, they think, is not enough of a reduction. In October they said they would consider ordering odd- and even-numbered licence plates to drive at alternate times in specific areas. Shanghai has also taken action and Guangzhou hopes that similar measures will halve the number of new vehicles. Chongqing, a south-western metropolis, has discussed introducing a congestion charge. Arthur Wang of McKinsey says 15 or 20 cities are likely to reach the congestion levels that prompt such policy changes over the next five years. But most car growth is in small cities and newly urbanising areas, and he sees little prospect of national controls. Deborah Gordon, co-author of Two Billion Cars and an associate with the energy and climate programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says Chinese authorities should seize their chance to curb car usage. Instead, they would be advised to focus on better-designed cities, improved public transport, more efficient cars and more electric or hybrid vehicles. &quot;When economic growth was double-digit in recent years, policy-makers were having a\u00a0hard time keeping up with rapid changes in motorisation,&quot; Gordon says. &quot;They have a golden opportunity now to shape future growth without disrupting it during the economic downturn. If China grows to accommodate autos as the priority form of mobility, it will be very difficult and expensive to reverse these investments.&quot; On a cold late autumn afternoon, shoppers wander the rows of the Huaxiang secondhand car market in south-western Beijing. The city&apos;s air is thick with fumes. Buildings loom out of the haze and the sun glows an apocalyptic red. According to local officials, motor vehicles account for about half the capital&apos;s air pollution. Clusters of men play Chinese chess and puff on cigarettes under the pearl-coloured sky. Women stamp their feet to keep warm as they swipe at cars with miniature mops; even a boxy, retro-looking Chang&apos;an estate shines as if fresh from the production line. Zhang Penghao is in search of his first\u00a0car, without a great deal of enthusiasm. Despite his friendly smile, his eyes are gloomy behind his heavy glasses. &quot;Actually, it&apos;s not worth it. There are too many cars and limited roads,&quot; the 24-year-old complains. Driving to his job at a hotel would take longer than using the subway; he will reserve the car for visiting friends in the suburbs and, more importantly, for dates. &quot;In China, if you don&apos;t have a house or car, you can&apos;t get a wife. There&apos;s a\u00a0lot of pressure.&quot; His only reason for buying a vehicle is to improve his eligibility. &quot;If a\u00a0girl can see you didn&apos;t drive to pick her up, she won&apos;t bother coming out. I don&apos;t understand why it&apos;s so\u00a0important, either. It&apos;s women, or really the women&apos;s parents, who care.&quot; It is no coincidence that the soundbite that has come to sum up modern Chinese\u00a0materialism centres on a car. When a dating show contestant rebuffed an impecunious suitor with the words, &quot;I\u00a0would rather cry in the back of a BMW than laugh on the back of a bicycle&quot;, they instantly became part of popular lore. Chinese motorists know they must impress, whether they are seeking partners for romance or business. Roll up in an Audi and you ensure a basic degree of respect. Arrive in a domestic Chery QQ hatchback and you are doomed before you get through a client&apos;s door. &quot;People don&apos;t really think about whether they need a car, but feel they have to have one to show their status,&quot; Zhang&apos;s friend Zhao Cihang tells me at the Mini showroom. Until recently he edited a car website and, although he is a year younger than Zhang, already owns two BMWs, an Audi and a Honda. But, he adds, &quot;I still think about new ones. I&apos;d like\u00a0an SUV \u2013 the biggest kind.&quot; SUVs are one of the fastest-growing sectors, thanks to buyers such as Zhao, who see them as smarter than saloons. But Dunne thinks there is something more to the passion for SUVs: &quot;It&apos;s symbolic of the aspiration to project the image of a free spirit\u2026 They may not use the vehicles off-road, but they want to say: I am an explorer.&quot; Last year, Zhang and her husband drove to Shanghai, a journey of almost 800 miles that is more easily and comfortably covered by plane or\u00a0high-speed rail. The drive was the point; though they could have afforded hotels, they slept in the Subaru overnight. They speak enviously of the motorhomes they glimpsed on a European holiday. &quot;We hope the younger generation, our generation, can think of cars as a symbol of freedom and use them for travel, so\u00a0they&apos;re not just about achievement and social status,&quot; Zhang says. For a handful of educated urban consumers, cars are no longer simply a sign of how much they have earned, how good their taste is or how suitable for marriage they may be. They are a\u00a0hint of their inner yearnings, a sign that one day, perhaps, motoring might become embedded in China&apos;s culture as it has in the US, the other great nation of the automobile. Though highways stretch out across the country, there are as yet no road movies. Young men and women cruise around town, but no anthems celebrate today&apos;s Chinese equivalent of a T-bird. The Mini dealership&apos;s manager enthuses about the ability of cars to express their owner&apos;s individuality. But asked if Chinese authors or musicians might one day celebrate automobiles as Americans have, she looks bewildered. &quot;Things like washing machines and refrigerators are part of our life in China, but we don&apos;t really have songs about them,&quot; she explains politely. &quot;We don&apos;t think because refrigerators are popular that maybe someone has to write a book about them.&quot; \u2022 Additional research by Cecily Huang", "tags": ["China", "Automotive industry", "Motoring", "Technology", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-14T23:00:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/17/apple-2-million-iphone-5-china", "sentences": ["Sources including Shanghai Daily said that even if Apple&apos;s stores were comparatively quiet, its carrier partners selling the iPhone 5 had a busy weekend, with people signing up to buy the handsets with contracts through China Unicom and China Telecom."], "title": "Apple sells 2m iPhone 5s in China", "article": "Apple has confounded Wall Street&apos;s expectations by announcing it sold more than 2m iPhone 5s in China, a record for the company, after a launch on Friday that observers had thought low-key. Chief executive Tim Cook said the sales \u2013 which were allotted by online lottery to defeat gangs who buy and resell the handsets \u2013 had been &quot;the best first weekend sales ever in China&quot; in a statement. Sources including Shanghai Daily said that even if Apple&apos;s stores were comparatively quiet, its carrier partners selling the iPhone 5 had a busy weekend, with people signing up to buy the handsets with contracts through China Unicom and China Telecom. Before the launch, China Unicom had had 300,000 preorders for the device, compared with the 200,000 it had for the iPhone 4S in January. Even so, Apple&apos;s stock was downgraded by at least one analyst, as Citi Research cut its recommendation from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;neutral&quot;, suggesting people shouldn&apos;t buy or sell it. Citi Research also lowered its target for the stock to $575 (\u00a3355) from $675, saying there was growing competition in smartphones and lower excitement around the iPhone 5. The announcement by Apple seemed calculated to respond to reports on Friday suggesting the lack of queues at its stores meant a lack of interest. In fact the online lottery \u2013 instituted by the company after near-riots around the launch in January of the iPhone 4S \u2013 meant customers could come into stores at any time to pick up a handset if they were allocated one in the scheme. China is the world&apos;s largest smartphone market, and growing fast, dominated by cheap devices built on Google&apos;s Android software. Apple&apos;s key problem is seen as the lack of a contract with China Mobile, the country&apos;s largest mobile operator, which has more than 700 million customers. The iPhone 5 was launched in the US and 30 other countries in September, and will be on sale in more than 100 countries worldwide by the end of December \u2013 the company&apos;s fastest rollout ever. That makes direct sales comparisons with previous years hard, but also means greater volumes for Apple overall in the increasingly competitive smartphone market, where smartphones using Android have a dominant \u2013 and growing \u2013 share, and new competitors using Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone software have begun rolling out.", "tags": ["Apple", "iPhone 5", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Telecoms", "Technology", "Android", "Google", "Software", "China", "World news", "iPhone 5S"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-17T07:22:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/dec/18/2012-fashion-year-review", "sentences": ["Giorgio Armani visited the country for the first time in April and hosted a fashion show in Shanghai."], "title": "2012 in fashion: the year in review", "article": "The rise of the fashionisto With the first menswear-only fashion week in London taking place in June, 2012 was the year when British fashion got manly. Selfridges launched the biggest men&apos;s shoe department in the world in November, with 10,000 square feet dedicated to brogues, sneakers and dress shoes \u2013 without a stiletto in sight. Elsewhere, outlets ranging from Mr Porter to Topman have reported impressive growth this year \u2013 and David Beckham, perhaps the ultimate icon when it comes to men who care how they look, appeared on the front of Elle. All in all, a good year for men. The ultimate fashion spat     Hedi Slimane appears at the end of Saint Laurent's S/S 2013 collection. Photograph: Jacques Brinon/AP    There&apos;s been change at the top in fashion \u2013 and it hasn&apos;t all been smooth sailing. While John Galliano&apos;s position at Dior was finally filed by Raf Simons in April, Yves Saint Laurent&apos;s creative director, Stefano Pilati, left the label in March and was replaced by the former Dior Homme designer, Hedi Slimane. While the Dior v Saint Laurent show dominated the Paris collections in September, the real drama started afterwards when Cathy Horyn \u2013 the revered critic from the New York Times, who was banned from the Saint Laurent show \u2013 posted a disappointed review on the paper&apos;s site. The response? Personal insults from Slimane on Twitter and gossip to keep the fashion world occupied for days. The next instalment is expected in March 2013. Sport becomes stylish     Team GB athletes pose with designer Stella McCartney at the launch of the new Olympic kit. Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP    With the Olympics providing such a bumper year for sport, style didn&apos;t get swapped for tracksuits \u2013 instead, thanks to Stella McCartney&apos;s collaboration with Adidas, those tracksuits were stylish. The British designer made Team GB&apos;s kit and, despite some murmurings of messing with the British flag, they looked great. We gained some new style icons in the shape of heptathlete Jessica Ennis, gymnast Gabby Douglas and \u2013 of course \u2013 cyclist Bradley Wiggins, who singlehandedly made mod style mainstream, while go-faster stripes became the trouser detail for autumn. After a boost in profits announced in October, Stella&apos;s bumper year continued with a British Fashion Award in November. The high street shifts     A Whistles store in London. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    M&amp;S posting disappointing sales for fashion \u2013 with a 6.8% drop in non-food sales in July \u2013 wasn&apos;t just a sign that the stalwart was losing its way. Women don&apos;t want to get their carrots in the same shop as their party dress any more. Now, with shops such as Zara emerging as top dog, women want a fashion-only environment and a constant supply of newness. The success of slick, grown-up shops including Cos and Whistles \u2013 which expanded in 2012 \u2013 shows a savvy, smart shopper had emerged. We&apos;re sure to see more of her next year.

This year, their death knoll finally sounded \u2013 instead of tottering around on Alexander McQueen&apos;s Armadillo designs, fashion editors went for something a little more sensible. Carine Roitfeld endorsed single-soled white heels at fashion week in September \u2013 and Asos reported a rise in sales. Smoking slippers were adopted by young things, including Alexa Chung and Mary-Kate Olsen, this summer, while Isabel Marant&apos;s wedge trainers had their own advert in the shape of Miranda Kerr and stocky heels became a hipster favourite. The final nail in the coffin came when Victoria Beckham, Christian Louboutin&apos;s biggest customer, was spotted in flats. Midriffs are the new erogenous zone     Rihanna shows off her abs. Photograph: Getty    While hipbones, bums and right legs gained headlines throughout the year, midriffs just edged it as the body part to flash. Rihanna was an early adopter \u2013 back in May, a rare style misfire saw her in a crochet skirt with matching bikini top. Honing the look, her latest take is baggy streetwear with just a smidgen of stomach. Others getting involved include Kristen Stewart in her first post-scandal outfit in August (subtext: how could you not forgive someone with such great abs?), and Diane Kruger rocking a crop top on the red carpet. Pilates lessons came as standard. The Chinese come calling     Chinese designs on the catwalk. Photograph: guardian.co.uk    With the prediction that China will be the world&apos;s biggest luxury market by 2020, western brands started to really court eastern consumers this year. Giorgio Armani visited the country for the first time in April and hosted a fashion show in Shanghai. Louis Vuitton did something similar in July, with a lavish event \u2013 shipping in a steam train \u2013 in the city. While Burberry announced a profit warning in September, their profits were still up 6%, and new ventures such as the luxury members site Luxup launched to appeal to the travelling Chinese shopper. Designers Uma Wang and Huishan Zhang showed their own talent is growing in profile too. Age ain&apos;t nothing but a number     Iris Apfel, fashion muse. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage.com    It used to be that new models meant just that \u2013 teenagers who look good in clothes. In 2012, however, things changed and older models \u2013 we&apos;re talking octogenarian in some cases \u2013 became the height of cool. Lanvin featured a 62-year-old in their autumn/winter campaign released in July, and Iris Apfel, the 91-year-old style muse, was in ads for MAC. In other model news, progress was made when Vogue pledged to work only with models over the age of 16 in May \u2013 despite the Chinese edition breaking the code in September \u2013 and Kate Moss revealed her vulnerability as a young model in an interview with Vanity Fair in October. France regains its fashion power     Emmanuelle Alt and Carine Roitfeld. Photograph: Getty    We fell for French style hard this year. Alpha editors Carine Roitfeld and Emmanuelle Alt became style references \u2013 with Roitfeld&apos;s pencil skirt, blouse and kohl formula even scoring her a collaboration with MAC, and her CR magazine, released in September, selling out. Emerging style references run from Valerie Trierweiler, the superchic partner of Francois Hollande, who attended the Saint Laurent show in September, to Melody Prochet, the singer behind psych-pop vehicle Melody&apos;s Echo Chamber. We can pick up the je ne sais quoi on the UK high street now \u2013 not only with French brands such as Sandro and Zadig &amp; Voltaire, but also by spotting France&apos;s elite, many of whom have moved to London to avoid Hollande&apos;s new tax laws. Cats - and monkeys - get cool           If dogs have dominated as fashion pet over the last few years \u2013 see Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs and Brix Smith-Start as notable canine owners \u2013 this was the year of the cat. Karl Lagerfeld started it all \u2013 his kitten Choupette was introduced to the world back in January. The little white ball of fluff, known to play with iPads and keep a staff of two maids, gained her own Twitter account in June. She now boasts 24,000 followers, several photo shoots and, fleetingly, a mini-me in the shape of Kim Kardashian&apos;s kitten, Mercy, who recently died (RIP). And yet they were all trumped by Darwin, the monkey who wandered into a Canadian branch of IKEA in a very smart sheepskin coat, instantly stealing the crown for most fashionable pet.

But that doesn&apos;t mean it can&apos;t have its own micro-boom. Bhimsen Giri is a coffee exporter with a problem. The farmers he visits in the hills around his native Kavre district, 20 miles outside the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, are not producing enough. &quot;We have hardly met 10% of the demand,&quot; said Giri. However, the 30-year-old, who has been in the business for a decade, is optimistic. More Nepalese growers are turning to coffee, drawn by record prices paid by exporters. &quot;Farmers are very excited about coffee farming,&quot; Giri said. &quot;But most of them lack information regarding the process and benefit of coffee farming.&quot; Driven by surging demand \u2013 especially in traditionally tea-drinking countries such as India and Pakistan \u2013 the Nepalese coffee farming industry is booming. The result is visible on the neat rows of bushes on the green slopes of Kavre district. Nepal now has 1,700 hectares of coffee plantation, more than 10 times the area 20 years ago when growing started. Total production is 417 tonnes of coffee, more than 30 times the crop in the early 1990s. In Kavre alone 2,200 farmers are involved in coffee, according to Hom Raj Giri, chairman of the Kavre District Coffee Entrepreneurs Association. Every year, according to Prem Acharya, planning officer at the National Tea and Coffee Development Board (NTCDB), 16% more land is being used for coffee and production is increasing by 20%. The industry now employs more than 25,000 people. In a country with deep poverty and political instability, coffee is one of the few industries beyond tourism that are thriving. Binod Acharya, a technical officer at the NTCDB, said farmers were attracted to coffee as it was more profitable and less arduous to grow than traditional crops such as maize and millet. &quot;Maize, millet and coffee are all grown in steep, hilly areas but coffee production earns more than other crops,&quot; he added . &quot;Neither heavy rain or dry weather make any difference to coffee plants, but cause problems for maize and millet.&quot; One advantage for Nepal, still a minor player in the global coffee market but one with big ambitions, is the very hills that make farming so many other crops so hard. &quot;Nepal&apos;s coffee is regarded as speciality coffee in the international market due to [the] climate and typography,&quot; said Binod.More than 60% of Nepalese coffee is exported to South Korea, Japan, the UK, the US and other Asian and European countries. Even in the recession-hit west, coffee consumption has risen in recent years.Andrea Illy, chairman and CEO of Italian coffee group illycaffe, recently said coffee consumption was likely to grow globally by between 2% and 3% over the next decade, as it has done over the past decade. Globalisation and rising incomes, combined with marketing drives, would propel coffee drinking in countries such as China and India where coffee is not part of traditional culture, he said. Both countries are neighbours of Nepal. Illy said he believed that &quot;in one generation, China will become one of the five most important coffee-consuming nations in the world&quot; while in India, the world&apos;s second most populous country after China, consumption was rising as promotional campaigns gathered momentum and incomes rose. India, which like China shares trade links with Nepal, has a long tradition of coffee houses and coffee growing. Although an average American drinks 40 times more coffee a year than an Indian, local demand has reportedly doubled in the last decade as levels of affluence have risen and a cafe culture has grown. Starbucks recently opened its first branch in Mumbai. Queues were so long there were reports of traditional chai sellers serving those waiting in line. The taste for cappuccino or latte in Shanghai and Hyderabad \u2013 as well as further afield \u2013 is generating much-needed foreign reserves for the Nepali government and income in agricultural communities with few resources. In Nepal, too, demand is growing fast. Madan Sapkota, Bbusiness development manager at Himalayan Beanz, a coffee house in Kathmandu, said business was thriving. &quot;Three years back we launched with two outlets in Kathmandu. Now we have six and by the end of this year we are planning to launch five more,&quot; said Sapkota, who sources his coffee from Nuwakot district, 30 miles outside the capital. &quot;Demand for coffee is not just booming in the international market but in the domestic market as well.&quot; Kanchi Dhungana, a 51-year-old farmer from Tinpiple in Kavre, planted her first five coffee plants 12 years ago. Her family now have 3,000 plants on their one-hectare plot and no longer grow maize. &quot;We earn more than 10 times more money from coffee farming,&quot; Kedar, her husband, said. &quot;We earn  ", "tags": ["Nepal", "World news", "Coffee", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Global economy"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-18T19:35:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/dec/19/music-alliance-pact-december", "sentences": ["CHINA: WooozyRainbow Danger Club - The Gathering Of FoolsAs one of Shanghai&apos;s most talented new bands, Rainbow Danger Club has been wowing music fans since 2010."], "title": "December's best music from across the MAP", "article": "Right-click on the song title to download an mp3, or grab a zip file of the full 39-track compilation through Ge.tt here.

Olor De Nuevo is our favorite from their new album, Gracias Tonales, which you can stream and buy from Bandcamp.  AUSTRALIA: Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Sunk Junk - JrIf Sunk Junk represent the calibre of young bands coming out of Oz, no-one can justify not being able to find decent new music ever again. Sunk Junk have only released one home recorded EP, but it&apos;s definitely the most impressive thing we&apos;ve heard all month. The elaborate percussion in Jr only feeds this assertion - weaving its labyrinthine way around intricate guitar lines and a hypnotic croon that could be easily mistaken for Jeff Buckley&apos;s ghost. A sprawling track which teeters on the stark side of melody and mania, Jr is definitely a marker of good things to come from this band.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigClara Luzia - Morning LightMorning Light contains some of my favourite lyrics: &quot;We held hands and cried until the morning light&quot;. Isn&apos;t the idea of sharing one&apos;s sadness with someone else just such a beautiful thought? After four successful records in Austria, singer-songwriter Clara Luzia recently released her international debut album The Range, a compilation of songs from her previous albums.  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoMet\u00e1 Met\u00e1 - Man FerimanEthno math-rock could be a way to try to explain the sound of Man Feriman, a song from the album MetaL MetaL from Paulistan project Met\u00e1 Met\u00e1. Sung in Yoruba (a West African language), it has elements of African liturgical music, free jazz and alternative rock, with a three-verse lyric that is repeated over the song to create an experimental, dark mantra.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsElephant Stone - Heavy MoonMontreal &quot;Hindi rockers&quot; Elephant Stone defy easy categorization. Echoes of The Stone Roses, The Kinks, Sloan and Big Star abound, but in the end the band crafts their own unique sound. Their sophomore self-titled LP is due early in 2013, but Elephant Stone have been teasing Canadian fans for the past few weeks with Heavy Moon.  CHILE: Super 45Protistas - GranadaIn just a few years, Protistas has become one of the most active bands in the Chilean indie rock scene. They frequently perform in Santiago, with appearances on blogs&apos; multimedia shows and local festivals (Primavera Fauna, Pulsar), along with tours across Chile and Argentina. They have released two albums and an EP since 2009. Their melodies combine the poignancy of Sebadoh with the urgent impact of Guided By Voices, in a style they&apos;ve named &quot;wild pop&quot; - bittersweet songs with an explosive, intense guitar sound.  CHINA: WooozyRainbow Danger Club - The Gathering Of FoolsAs one of Shanghai&apos;s most talented new bands, Rainbow Danger Club has been wowing music fans since 2010. Their theatrical live shows, fantastical lyrics and lush arrangements have drawn comparisons to Arcade Fire, The Decemberists, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Hector Berlioz. Last month they released their new 12-track Into The Cellar EP.  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloLucrecia Dalt - ConversaLucrecia Dalt&apos;s musical journey has taken her from the city of Pereira to Barcelona, Spain, where she currently lives. With guitar and drum machine she makes introspective music with many layers that stirs the imagination of the listener. She has traveled the road of independence and now with Conversa, from her 2012 album Commotus, she grabs our attention again.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianThe Woken Trees - OrdersI know December is supposed to be all about lights and happy times, but here&apos;s a MAP exclusive track and a band that is almost exactly the opposite. There are six of them, they call themselves The Woken Trees and they&apos;ve recorded an awesomely bleak and hard-hitting post-punk debut album which is sure to make waves everywhere when released on January 28.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraJuango D\u00e1valos - 6PMJuango D\u00e1valos borrows his musical inspiration from the 80s, but the songs he composes are surprisingly fresh and modern. 6PM is part of his most recent album, R\u00e9plica, which is also available as a free download.  ECUADOR: Plan ArteriaSwing Original Monks - Tuc\u00e1nSwing Original Monks broke into the musical scene in early 2010. The band offers a proposal that is both visual and aural, feminine and masculine, provocative and subtle.

Swing Original Monks is not a fusion band, it&apos;s an infusion band.

They use the fizzy electro-pop medium to express feelings of longing for better days. &quot;Most of the songs we&apos;ve written seem to be about looking back on being a teenager and that wide-eyed optimism about the world,&quot; they say, which might explain the giddy chorus to Carolyn - &quot;Hey, hey, Carolyn, get into my car/Keep your feet up on the dashboard&quot; - and its memory of illicit abandon.  FINLAND: GlueMurmansk - MercuryHelsinki band Murmansk play loud noise-rock built from powerful guitars and upfront bass and drum beats. Their songs are notable for their propensity for melody and the energetic performance of vocalist Laura Soininen. Mercury is part of the band&apos;s recently released third full-length album R\u00fc\u00fctli.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredLescop - La For\u00eatMathieu Lescop, singer for the rock band Asyl, recently started a solo project and released an eponymous album in October under the name Lescop. Heavily influenced by the French (\u00c9tienne Daho, Daniel Darc) and British (Joy Division, New Order) coldwave and new-wave, he achieved much success in France with his single La For\u00eat, and consequently is the most talked-about artist in the country.  GERMANY: ColtranBinoculers - MonstersBinoculers is an artist you might easily overlook, given the reserved attitude of Nadja Ruedebusch. But you would miss some of the most thoughtful folk music Germany can currently offer. This is the kind of thing you might like to hear on a foggy winter&apos;s day or a sparkling spring afternoon when you lay down in the grass for the first time that year. Binoculers&apos; third album, There Is Not Enough Space In The Dark, has just been released.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaManolis Aggelakis - Apoleipein o Theos AntonionManolis Aggelakis&apos; fourth album, O Anthropos Vomva (&quot;The Bomb Man&quot;), is yet another sensational landmark on his long, well-traveled path. Guitars, tightly tied drums, dirty electronic sounds and noises gently form otherworldly landscapes. Along with his distinctive voice and disarming performance, the lyrical themes portray an authentic troubadour recording signs of difficult times with a gloomy nostalgia for bygone eras. Apoleipein o Theos Antonion (&quot;The God Abandons Antony&quot;) is a poem by Constantine P. Cavafy.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minnPojke - Black EyeSindri M\u00e1r Sigf\u00fasson, singer and songwriter for bands such as Seabear and Sin Fang, has recently been exploring his electronic side through a side-project titled Pojke. So far he has released two songs as Pojke on his SoundCloud page which can be downloaded and remixed freely.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarFunny Little Dream - Be With YouThis is the latest single from Funny Little Dream, aka Ganesh and Peppy, whose cute indie-pop songs have received a great response from fans around the world.  IRELAND: Harmless NoiseWindings - This Is A ConversationA five-piece band from Limerick, Windings released This Is A Conversation as a single in September. Introduced with a clean guitar and racy keys, the light pop intentions go slightly awry when Steve Ryan starts belting out the vocals, repeating nine lines of lyrics in chorus-like bursts. There comes a mighty bass riff that lays down the heavy element, and a few light taps of cymbal domes mark time for the band to gather up and go all-out towards a hugely satisfying rock crescendo.  ITALY: PolaroidLife &amp; Limb - Before The Flame And The FloodAndrea Mangia comes from Lecce; Mike McGuire comes from New York. They have both released solo albums on the prestigious German label Morr Music, which is how they met in 2006 and started collaborating. They are now releasing their self-titled third album, and it is gorgeous as always: uplifting electronic sounds full of lush synths, fat downtempo beats and ultrasweet melodies. If you like M83 or The Postal Service, you&apos;ll be carried away by Life &amp; Limb.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesHNC - I Will Make You SadHNC (short for Hazel Nuts Chocolate) has been in the Japanese music scene for more than a decade, originally operating as a hyperactive pop maker. Now, though, she is making music grounded in reality, shaped by actually living through the ups and downs of time. I Will Make You Sad is a sparse meditation on inevitable disappointment, HNC and her music sounding melancholy but all the while aware that she is the one who is going to let someone down.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaClaire Tonna - Age Of No AgeSinger-songwriter Claire Tonna is known for her profound, exceptional voice and awe-inspiring performances. Tonna&apos;s innovative acoustic debut studio album The Port, which contains collaborations with acclaimed writer Maria Mar, gets its first international release in New Zealand this month.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaVerano Peligroso - CulpableVerano Peligroso (translated as &quot;Dangerous Summer&quot;) is the boy-girl pet project of an omnivorous studio-rat and a gorgeous radio presenter for a Mexico City indie-rock station. They just released their debut EP on which Culpable stands as a naive call-and-response song that, in contrast to its twee-pop sound, tells a story about a crime of passion. This pair really spend their time in a peculiar way!  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!Kleinindustrie - RepetitionKleinindustrie emerged from out of nowhere in 2010, wowing live audiences and winning two big music competitions in Utrecht, the band&apos;s hometown. After this sudden burst to the surface, the band shrouded itself in a veil of mystery. Although some said they emigrated to Norway to live off the prize money, 2011 turned out to be the quiet before the storm. Since February 2012, Kleinindustrie has released three EPs and toured all over the Netherlands. Repetition stems from their latest release, Hit It!, which meanders loosely between no-wave and straightforward noise-rock. With a relentless drummer, menacing singer and a bass player and guitarist in one, Kleinindustrie have created a huge sound that&apos;s naturally fit for repetition.  PERU: SoTBSergio Cubas - RuteandoRuteando is taken from Sergio Cubas&apos; debut album Revoluci\u00f3n Caliente. For this album, Sergio performs a mix of different musical styles such as dub, lounge, jazz and reggae linked to various Peruvian influences such as Afro-Peruvian music and Festejo. Revoluci\u00f3n Caliente (listen on SoundCloud) features 11 songs that are an invitation to relax.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogAfro Kolektyw - Czasem Pada \u015anieg w Styczniu (Zakazane Warzywo)Afro Kolektyw is one of Poland&apos;s most distinguished bands, with a music career spanning nearly 14 years, from organic hip hop, jazz and funk origins to electronic elements in more recent tunes. Although Afro Kolektyw have never been tied to only one style, their latest album, Piosenki Po Polsku, shocked listeners. With songwriting inspired by 80s Polish pop and sarcastic lyrics, this journey seems to be Afro&apos;s most risky and ambitious one yet.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?A Jigsaw - Let It Snow!A Jigsaw, who were on the Music Alliance Pact in March 2012 with their fantastic song The Strangest Friend, have been kind enough to let us share their exquisite cover of the classic Let It Snow!, which was on a very limited edition benefit CD for a children&apos;s hospital in Coimbra. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to them and all of you.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieAlegr\u00eda Rampante - Hotel Puercoesp\u00ednWhen Puerto Rico&apos;s indie darlings Superaquello disbanded in 2011, they left behind four remarkable LPs and a disappointed fanbase not ready to miss them. A year later, fans can breathe easier thanks to vocalist, composer and dramatist Eduardo Alegr\u00eda, who has emerged with a new musical project - Alegr\u00eda Rampante. Eduardo and his group of skilled collaborators from the local indie scene have quietly built an arsenal of melodic earworms to be released over the next few months as the digital singles collection Se Nos Fue La Mano. Hotel Puercoesp\u00edn is the second song from the cycle, an upbeat baroque pop-rocker full of Eduardo&apos;s trademark playful lyrics and sincere delivery. Alegr\u00eda Rampante is Latin Alternative&apos;s best kept secret - but not for long, so get in first.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseStonebox - Welcome To My WorldStonebox are an alternative band from Bucharest with 90s rock influences, in particular grunge. Thanks to their mesmerizing live performances and energy they have played at the major festivals in Romania and gathered an impressive number of fans.  RUSSIA: Big EchoAstrocowboys - We Give BloodUsing a Soviet LEL DR-8 drum machine, cheap synthesizer and jangly guitar, Astrocowboys from Saint Petersburg create their familiar, yet distinctive sound. Their deep, sweet-sounding lo-fi album Olympic has an unusual combination of influences from New Order-esque synthpop to old school hip hop and early electro.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopThree Blind Wolves - ParadeThree Blind Wolves may be from Glasgow, but it&apos;s the American Deep South that resonates most emphatically in their music. They are a little bit country, a little bit hillbilly rock &apos;n&apos; roll, yet their versatility means they&apos;re equally at home in indie and folk circles. Their new album Sing Hallelujah For The Old Machine comes out in April, with the coil-sprung standout track Parade released as a single in October (alongside this promo video), but here it is as an exclusive free download.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To....gif - Diatribe.gif embodies the illusion of data passing off as real-life moving images by giving us an electronic amalgamation of observatory life with shades of melancholy, hope and resolution. While usually accompanied by ukulele, Weish finds the embrace of warm textures courtesy of Din, with synthesizers and beat arrangements assembling base emotions into the soul of a machine.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieSasquatch - MannequinSasquatch emerged this year with a retro synth sound reminiscent of the very best of K-pop of the 80s and the 90s, bound to charm even those with no knowledge of Korean music prior to Gangnam Style. Debut album Utopia was released last month, with lead track Mannequin and its addictive harmonies and melody lines serving as the perfect introduction to the band.  SPAIN: MusikornerNITCH - Bon Dia, Capit\u00e0NITCH are a three-piece rock/shoegaze act based in Barcelona. They started in 2007 and so far they have played in almost every (cool) venue in town and supported important underground local bands. Now it&apos;s their turn to be in the spotlight, and this month they played at the Primavera Club festival, Primavera Sound&apos;s little brother.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaVED - Din Egen SpegelbildVED is a five-piece project from southern Sweden inspired by old film scores, obscure audio recordings, progressive rock and folk music. A collection of their experimental, epic creations was recently released through the ever-reliable label Adrian Recordings, and Din Egen Spegelbild (translated as &quot;Your Own Reflection&quot;) is the latest track to be shared from VED&apos;s self-titled album.  SWITZERLAND: 78sMama Rosin - Sorry Ti MondeThe Cajun/folk/garage trio released their new album Bye Bye Bayou in October, which was produced by Jon Spencer from the legendary Blues Explosion. Cyril, Robin and Xavier from Mama Rosin are consistently entertaining on stage and entirely passionate about their art. Plus they are good at a party!  TURKEY: WEARTBEATMeriva - Hepberaberyaln\u0131zMeriva formed with five close friends in 2007. They get their musical inspiration from people&apos;s struggle to win back their self-esteem and therefore reflect urban life complications in their alternative rock sound, which is often danceable and catchy. Meriva hope to progress their career with the release of their debut album in 2013.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouTeen Mom - I Wanna Go OutWashington DC trio Teen Mom are the type of band that act as a reminder that simple music can pack a punch. Staying away from flash or gimmicks, they focus on a splashy guitar, rattling bass and fast-paced drums to craft Mean Tom, one of the most infectious EPs of 2012.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sPlaneador - Al DiabloPlaneador returns to the Music Alliance Pact, this time with a track from Barcelona 10C, certainly one of the best albums released this year in Venezuela. Its deeper lyrics and more elaborate melodies reflect the musical maturity of the band.", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-19T10:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/22/1", "sentences": ["Paolo Bandini 49: Didier Drogba, Shanghai Shenhua, Ivory Coast; age 34; forward Since he always played with a sense of drama, it was fitting that Drogba&apos;s Chelsea career would have a Hollywood ending."], "title": "World's 100 greatest footballers: Nos 70-41", "article": "70: Robert Lewandowski, Borussia Dortmund, Poland; age 24; forward There are more prolific strikers than the Pole, who has been averaging a goal every two games since moving from Lech Poznan in 2010. But he is truly in a league of his own when it comes to holding up the ball, making intelligent runs and linking up with the attacking midfielders. His former team-mate Nuri Sahin nicknamed him &quot;The Body&quot; for his athletic build and Franck Rib\u00e9ry described him as &quot;Dortmund&apos;s most important player&quot;. The Premier League beckons. Raphael Honigstein 69: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, St Etienne, Gabon; age 23; forward A move to Milan when he was 19 proved premature but now, at 23, the Gabonese is showing the benefits of playing regularly and producing the same form at club level that made him a star of this year&apos;s Africa Cup of Nations. His excellent performances for Saint Etienne make another move to a top club inevitable for this lively forward. Was once invited to play for Italy Under-19s after a good season when on loan at Dijon, but he ended up playing for France at Under-21 level. Paul Doyle 68: Mathieu Valbuena, Marseille, France; age 28; midfielder Rejected by Bordeaux as a teenager on the grounds that he was supposedly too small ever to make it as a footballer, Valbuena showed characteristic doggedness to succeed and is now recognised as one of the most impressive playmakers on European pitches. He has long been the creator-in-chief of Marseille and now Didier Deschamps has put him in the heart of France&apos;s midfield. Scored against England at Wembley in 2010. Paul Doyle 67: Mario Balotelli, Manchester City, Italy; age 22; forward A riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigmatic ego. The complexities of Balotelli continue to make him a frustrating talent. His qualities when harnessed mark him out as a striker of exceptional promise, but it is the job of harnessing that has people pulling their hair out. He is still only 22, with Champions League, Serie A, Premier League and FA Cup titles already in his locker, but Roberto Mancini seems to be losing patience with him. Amy Lawrence 66: Arjen Robben, Bayern Munich, Holland; age 28; midfielder/forward In the past three years Arjen Robben has lost two Champions League finals and wasted the best chance in a World Cup final. The winger epitomises the Dutch tendency to impress technically, before failing when the pressure is on, although he has won league titles in four countries. He remains injury prone, but when Robben is on fire, he is devastating. In March he scored seven goals and collected four assists in three Bayern games. Michael Cox 65: Joe Hart, Manchester City, England; age 25; goalkeeper Joe Hart has endured an erratic few months, making several big-game blunders that have called his reputation into question. These should not be glossed over, but what has made them stand out so much is the fact that he had so often seemed near to flawless before this jittery spell. Ever since his early days at Shrewsbury Town and Birmingham City he has shown confident leadership and rare ability that make it likely he will overcome his current dip. Paul Doyle 64: Nemanja Vidic, Manchester United, Serbia; age 31; defender In an age when top-class centre-backs are at a premium, Vidic stands out as probably the best in terms of pure defensive ability. Others may move more silkily, but as a craggy-faced holder of the line and, to use Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s phrase, &quot;a defender who can defend&quot;, Vidic stands alone. It is the curse of Vidic&apos;s type to be noticed more in their absence. This season Manchester United have conceded a goal every 63 minutes. With Vidic on the pitch it is every 91 minutes. Jonathan Wilson 63: Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Schalke, Holland; age 29; forward &quot;I think you could behead Klaas and he&apos;d still score goals.&quot; So said Schalke team-mate Lewis Holtby, paying tribute to Huntelaar&apos;s scoring knack. Louis van Gaal is another admirer, claiming Huntelaar is the best in the world in the penalty area. Forty-eight goals from 47 matches last season helps his case. A slow starter before he kicked on at Ajax, he has found his stride. With six months on his deal, Premier League teams are hovering. Amy Lawrence 62: David Villa, Barcelona, Spain; age 31; forward Top scorer at Euro 2008, top scorer at the 2010 World Cup, top scorer in Spain&apos;s international history. For years David Villa had one thing going against him: he did not play for one of the big two. Then, in 2010, he joined Barcelona. A year later he was scoring in the European Cup final. Injury and submission to the supremacy of Lionel Messi have blunted his edge of late but few strikers boast his skill, touch, and efficiency in front of goal. Sid Lowe 61: Ramires, Chelsea, Brazil; age 25; midfielder To dismiss this energetic Brazilian as a mere workhorse would be foolish. Breaking up play is so very easy for him to do but Ramires offers much more besides, such as penetration, vision and subtlety. All of which were memorably showcased by his wonderful lobbed goal for Chelsea at the Camp Nou in last season&apos;s Champions League semi-final as Barcelona were memorably dispatched from the competition on their own turf. Paul Doyle 60: Marouane Fellaini, Everton, Belgium; age 25; midfielder Fellaini&apos;s father, Abdellatif, was determined to help his son become a footballer and had Marouane run to school rather than taking the bus (Abdellatif was behind him, on a bicycle, with a stopwatch). Marouane played for Anderlecht and Mons before signing his first professional contract with Standard Li\u00e8ge at 17. Three years later he moved to Everton \u2013 still with his best years ahead. Key member of a talented Belgium squad. Marcus Christenson 59: James Rodr\u00edguez, Porto, Colombia; age 21; midfielder Behold the latest proof of Porto&apos;s astonishing capacity to seamlessly replace stars. The departure of Hulk to Zenit St Petersburg gave him the chance\u00a0to shine, even though he had already enjoyed some moments in the limelight, such as when he scored a hat-trick in the 2010 Portuguese Cup final. A canny passer and tricky runner, he has piqued the interest of some of the world&apos;s biggest clubs, including Manchester United. Paul Doyle 58: Eden Hazard, Chelsea, Belgium; age 21; midfielder The Belgian made his debut for Lille when 16 and later became their talisman, as his dashing dribbles, shooting and vision guided the club to the French title in 2011 and twice made him Ligue 1&apos;s player of the year. That he achieved those feats while also being the league&apos;s most fouled player attests to the toughness of a player who is still only 21. Chelsea paid \u00a332m for him in the summer and no one suggests he was overpriced. Paul Doyle 57: Arturo Vidal, Juventus, Chile; age 25; midfielder Andrea Pirlo is the face of Juventus, but another midfielder signed in 2011 has had a similarly dramatic impact on their fortunes. Arturo Vidal&apos;s goals against Chelsea in the Champions League have raised the player&apos;s international profile, but Juve fans had long been aware of his qualities as a powerful box-to-box midfielder and accomplished finisher. The less heralded work he does winning possession is just as impressive. Paolo Bandini 56: Mario Gomez, Bayern Munich, Germany; age 27; forward There are few, if any, better &quot;orthodox&quot; No9s than this 6ft 2in striker. Gomez is strong in the air, shoots with both feet and has a Gerd M\u00fcller-type knack of popping up in the right place at the right moment. Three goals at Euro 2012 meant he finally displaced Miroslav Klose as Germany&apos;s preferred centre-forward, too. If he was slightly more elegant, and wasted fewer chances, he would be appreciated even more. Raphael Honigstein 55: Jordi Alba, Barcelona, Spain; age 23; defender/midfielder For an aspiring footballer the moment of being released by Barcelona from their esteemed youth academy at the age of 16 must be a crushing blow. Jordi Alba moved to UE Cornell\u00e0, a modest Catalan club who play at a ground that holds 1,500 spectators, and after slipping down the snake he began energetically climbing ladders all the way back to the Camp Nou. He rejoined Bar\u00e7a last summer after effervescent displays for Spain at Euro 2012. Amy Lawrence 54: Samuel Eto&apos;o, Anzhi Makhachkala, Cameroon; age 31; forward The Cameroon striker seems almost to have been forgotten since he moved to Anzhi but a player who was central to Barcelona and Internazionale&apos;s success has not become a bad player just because he&apos;s now scoring in the Russian league. Eto&apos;o is 31 years old and remains as sharp as ever. He&apos;s versatile as well: having operated as the main striker at Bar\u00e7a and Inter, he has tended to operate almost as a playmaker as Anzhi hunt a first league title. Jonathan Wilson 53: Toni Kroos, Bayern Munich, Germany; age 22; midfielder Kroos&apos;s performance in Bayern Munich&apos;s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid last season was incredible. He dominated a midfield littered with the continent&apos;s finest footballers. His tactical understanding of the game is extraordinary \u2013 few other players have such a fine appreciation of space, or vary their position so instinctively and effectively. His attitude has been questioned, but Kroos is unquestionably a sublime talent. Michael Cox 52: Stephan El Shaarawy, Milan, Italy; age 20; forward &quot;Il Faraone&quot; (the Pharoah) is an obvious nickname for an Italian international with an Egyptian father but that is about the only predictable aspect about a striker who has proven full of surprises in his short career. In addition to his direct, yet beguiling, dribbles and finishes that befuddle goalkeepers, the speed of his progression has taken people aback, as not many expected him to have achieved so much by the age of 20. He made his Serie A debut at 16 for Chievo but did not feature for them after that before being loaned out to the lower league side Padova, where dazzling displays caught the attention of Milan in the summer of 2011. He confirmed his potential by scoring his first goal for the club the following September but he sparkled only intermittently after that and there was much debate at San Siro about his readiness for a regular starting place, with some suggesting he could gain more strength and savviness by being loaned out to another club for a season. Eventually Milan judged that he was already good enough to grace the elite consistently and this season he has vindicated them in style, effortlessly filling the void left by Zlatan Ibrahimovic. His spectacular solo goal against Zenit St Petersburg in October two weeks before his 20th birthday made him the youngest player to score for the club in the Champions League and he has continued that form domestically, at the time of writing the leading scorer in Serie A with 14 goals from 17 matches. At ease either wide on the left or as a centre-forward, El Shaarawy seems destined to be a fixture of the Italy side for years. How Egypt must regret ignoring him before he declared for the Azzurri. Paul Doyle 51: Marcelo, Real Madrid, Brazil; age 24; defender Left-backs do not come much more enterprising than this Brazilian. Marcelo is a worthy heir to Roberto Carlos at Real Madrid, where he raids down the wing thanks to wonderful acceleration, sweet touches and jagged running, often concluding his bursts with decisive passes or shots. Thanks to rare speed, stamina and tackling, he can usually do all that and still perform his defensive duties, which is why he is first choice for club and country. Paul Doyle 50: Giorgio Chiellini, Juventus, Italy; age 28; defender The emotional leader of a Juventus back-line that gave up 20 goals in 38 league games last season, Chiellini began his career at left-back but has since established himself as one of the finest central defenders of his generation. His attempt to play through injury backfired for Italy in the final of Euro 2012 \u2013 beaten for Spain&apos;s first goal, he then limped off after 20 minutes \u2013 but he has continued to excel for club and country. Paolo Bandini 49: Didier Drogba, Shanghai Shenhua, Ivory Coast; age 34; forward Since he always played with a sense of drama, it was fitting that Drogba&apos;s Chelsea career would have a Hollywood ending. That said, his role in the Champions League triumph was defined as much by his indefatigable power play in the knockout rounds as it was by his theatrically charged spot-kick in the final. Recently voted Chelsea&apos;s greatest ever player, he has been missed since his move to China, supposedly for the (ahem) challenge. Amy Lawrence 48: Carlos Tevez, Manchester City, Argentina; age 28; forward Take away the silly feuds with Sir Alex Ferguson and Gary Neville, and the five-month golfing holiday after the Munich tantrum (where the forward refused to warm up), and you are left with a rather sublime footballer. Tevez, who grew up on the mean streets of Fuerte Apache in Buenos Aires province, blends dizzying skills with (controlled) rage on the pitch like no other player at his level. No wonder City fans welcomed him back with open arms. Raphael Honigstein 47: Angel di Mar\u00eda, Real Madrid, Argentina; age 24; midfielder The International Olympic Committee won&apos;t let you watch a YouTube clip of the goal with which Di Mar\u00eda won the gold medal for Argentina in Beijing, which is a pity since the winger&apos;s chip over the Nigerian goalkeeper was a gem. Having begun his career with Rosario Central, the club supported by Che Guevara, Di Mar\u00eda moved first to Benfica and thence to the Bernab\u00e9u, where he ranks second only to Cristiano Ronaldo as an attacking force. Richard Williams 46: Carles Puyol, Barcelona, Spain; age 34; defender With the flowing locks of a Pre-Raphaelite angel and the face of a back-alley assassin, Puyol is the standing reproach to those who think that the modern Barcelona team is constructed solely of moondust and cobwebs. If the world were a fairer place, the Catalan club&apos;s captain would have spent the past few years vying for international player of the year awards with his club-mates Messi, Xavi and Iniesta. They, above all, understand his value. Richard Williams 45: Mats Hummels, Borussia Dortmund, Germany; age 24; defender How Bayern Munich must regret loaning Mats Hummels to Dortmund in 2009. The young defender had failed to break into the first team \u2013 &quot;I was the third-choice centre-back but when one of the first two got injured I still wasn&apos;t picked&quot; \u2013 and he did not hesitate over a permanent move. And that was despite his father working for Bayern at the time. Now he is the natural leader of the German champions and the national team, his Beckenbauer-esque playing style a joy to behold. Marcus Christenson 44: Petr Cech, Chelsea, Czech Republic; age 30; goalkeeper Chelsea&apos;s Champions League triumph could so easily have been derailed without the countless interventions of their No1. Cech rediscovered his finest form last season: angles were narrowed, spaces cut out, opportunities thwarted with a telescopic arm or leg. The Czech was dominant, determined, and awe-inspiring. Of all the Roman Abramovich purchases, few have represented such value for money as \u00a37m Cech. At 30, he could still be Chelsea&apos;s keeper for years. Amy Lawrence 43: Dani Alves, Barcelona, Brazil; age 29; defender For many years considered the best right-back in the world, Dani Alves&apos;s stock has fallen in the past 12 months. He is still a good player but injuries have taken a toll and he is not a certain starter at Barcelona. Could well leave Catalonia next summer and possibly move back to Brazil with a home World Cup ahead. He won&apos;t be short of offers. Told the Guardian this year that he &quot;loves&quot; Gareth Bale: &quot;He is so Brazilian.&quot; Marcus Christenson 42: Daniele De Rossi, Roma, Italy; age 29; midfielder Luis Enrique used De Rossi as a deep-lying playmaker, his successor, Zdenek Zeman, believes he is a box-to-box midfielder, while the Italy coach, Cesare Prandelli, solved an injury problem at Euro 2012 by putting him at centre-back. An incredibly fierce competitor and a fine technician, De Rossi is a fantastic all-rounder. Harmed his reputation by punching a Lazio player in a recent Rome derby, but his pure ability and influence is unquestionable. Michael Cox 41: Javier Zanetti, Internazionale, Argentina; age 39; defender/midfielder As he approaches his fifth decade and closes in on his 600th Serie A appearance, the versatile Argentinian remains the captain and linchpin of the Internazionale team. Born in Dock Sud, a tough seafront quarter of Buenos Aires, he still competes with a tigerish authority. Surely the only sadness in his career is that his long international career has not lasted long enough for him to take part in a World Cup on South American soil.

If he revisits a place or genre it&apos;s to tell a very different story \u2013 a martial arts movie in medieval China (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) is followed by a spy thriller in wartime Shanghai (Lust, Caution), and a western with a US civil war background (Ride With the Devil) is succeeded by a western about a gay relationship in present-day Wyoming (Brokeback Mountain). He adopts different styles to fit his new subjects, and while there are certain recurrent themes, among them the disruption of families and young people facing moral and physical challenges, there are no obsessive concerns of the sort once considered a necessity for auteurs. He has a fastidious eye for a great image but he also has a concern for language. His magnificent new film is a version of Yann Martel&apos;s Booker prize-winning novel, Life of Pi, adapted by an American writer, David Magee, whose previous credits were films set in England during the first half of the 20th century, Finding Neverland and Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day. From its opening scene of animals and birds strutting and preening themselves in a sunlit zoo to the final credits of fish and nautical objects shimmering beneath the sea, the movie has a sense of the mysterious, the magical. This effect is compounded by the hallucinatory 3D, and in tone the film suggests Robinson Crusoe rewritten by Laurence Sterne. The form is a story within a story within a story. An unnamed Canadian author whom we assume to be Yann Martel himself (Rafe Spall) is told by an Indian he meets that there is a man in Montreal called Pi who has a story that will make you believe in God. He&apos;s Piscine Molitor Patel (Irrfan Khan), a philosophy teacher, and he tells the curious story of his own extraordinary life, beginning as the son of a zookeeper in Pondicherry, the French\u00a0enclave in India that wasn&apos;t ceded until 1954. The movie&apos;s two central characters both obtained their names by comic accident. The deeply serious Piscine (played by Gautam Belur at five, Ayush Tandon at 12 and Suraj Sharma at 16)was named after an uncle&apos;s favourite swimming pool, the Piscine Molitor in Paris, but changed his name to the Greek letter and numinous number Pi after fellow schoolboys made jokes about pissing. He later became fascinated by a Bengal tiger in the zoo caught by the English hunter Richard Parker who called him Thirsty. On delivery to the zoo their names were accidently reversed and the tiger became Richard Parker. Was this fate or chance? Growing up, the ever curious Pi becomes attracted to religion and the meaning of life, a spiritual journey that the film treats with a respectful wit as the boy rejects his father&apos;s rationalism and creates a personal amalgam of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. His faith is tested as an adolescent when his father is forced to give up the family zoo, where Pi realises he&apos;s been as much a captive as the animals themselves. A Japanese freighter becomes a temporary ark on which the Patel family take the animals to be sold in Canada. But it&apos;s struck by a storm as dramatic as anything ever put on the screen, and Pi becomes a combination of Noah, Crusoe, Prospero and Job. Alone above the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Pacific, he&apos;s an orphan captaining a lifeboat with only a zebra, a hyena, a female orang-utan and the gigantic Bengal tiger Richard Parker for company.           This is grand adventure on an epic scale, a survival story that takes up half the movie. It&apos;s no Peaceable Kingdom like Edward Hicks&apos;s charming early 19th-century painting, where the lion sleeps with the lamb. This is a Darwinian place that Pi must learn to command. Using state-of-the-art 3D and digitally created beasts, Lee and his team of technicians make it utterly real, as they do a mysterious island that briefly provides a dangerously seductive haven. The 227 days at sea are a test of physique, mental adaptation and faith, and Suraj Sharma makes Pi&apos;s spiritual journey as convincing as his nautical one. He confronts thirst and starvation, finds a modus vivendi with the fierce tiger, endures and wonders at a mighty storm, a squadron of flying fish, a humpbacked whale, a school of dolphins, a night illuminated by luminous jellyfish. This brave new world is observed by a young Chilean director of photography, appropriately named Claudio Miranda. The movie does for water and the sea what Lawrence of Arabia did for sand and desert, and one thinks of what Alfred Hitchock, who used 3D so imaginatively in his 1954 film of Dial M For Murder, might have done on his wartime Lifeboat had he been given such technical facilities. This poetic Life of Pi concludes with a fascinating, deliberately prosaic coda that raises questions about the reality of what we&apos;ve seen and confronts the teleological issues involved. One thinks of the reporter&apos;s remark at the end of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance: &quot;When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.&quot; At another level, Sam Goldwyn&apos;s advice to the screenwriter comes to mind: &quot;Give me the story and send the message by Western Union.&quot;", "tags": ["Ang Lee", "Film", "Yann Martel", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-23T00:06:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/dec/28/top-data-stories-2012", "sentences": ["A combined total of 2,346 live in Beijing and Shanghai, equivalent to three in every ten of China&apos;s multimillionaires."], "title": "2012: the year in data, journalism (and charts)", "article": "What were the headline figures of 2012?

The natural disaster hit not only the US but also Haiti, Cuba, the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Canada and Jamaica.  The greatest number of deaths outside the US were in Haiti - which was not in the path of the hurricane but hit by extreme flooding in a country still recovering from the earthquake in 2010. 21,500 The Guardian and the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) offshore investigation identified &apos;nominee&apos; directors controlling thousands of companies across the world. More than 21,500 companies were identified using a group of 28 so-called nominee directors.  The Guardian/ICIJ investigated the offshore industry and secrecy surrounding it, uncovering a network of individuals willing to appear on official records as directors of companies while acting only on the instructions of its real owners, who stay invisible and off-the-books. 1,987 Made up of 1,987 pages, the Leveson report was one of the most highly anticipated releases of the year. Published on the 29th November 2012, it set out Lord Justice Leveson&apos;s recommendations for the future of press regulation in the UK. Analysis of the text showed some interesting results. Perhaps unsurprisingly, references to failure were two thirds more numerous than those to success, with use of words including the text &quot;fail&quot; outweighing the total number of &quot;success&quot;es and &quot;succeed&quot;s by almost 75%.

The Guardian/Mixmag survey was one attempt to explain the facts behind what drugs people really take. The survey found that users claim that more of them use cannabis than energy drinks.           65 Team GB excelled at the London 2012 Olympic Games winning 65 medals in total. The olympics was a veritable feast for the Datablog allowing for projects such as the alternative medals table and a breakdown of medal winners by sport, education and sex. The Royal Statistical Society and the Datablog teamed up with four statisticians at Imperial College, London, to help work out how key factors might change the Olympic league table. The idea being by &apos;weighting&apos; the medals, what happens to the results? The team, Christoforos Anagnostopoulos, Giovanni Montana, Axel Gandy and Daniel Mortlock, looked at previous olympics and traditional indicators such as the output of a country&apos;s economy (GDP), the size of its population - and also ways to weight the score by the size of each country&apos;s Olympic team. Using this analysis Russia became the winner of the alternative Olympic medal table and was followed in second place by the UK.

This means the population has grown by 3.7m in the 10 years since the last census, rising from 52.4m in 2001 - an increase of 7.1%. This was the largest growth in the population in England and Wales in any 10-year period since the census taking began, in 1801. Between 1991 and 2001 it had gone up by 1.6m The first results of the census were released in July and they showed population by age, sex and housing across the country.

In the wake of the Newtown shooting in Connecticut, there has been a renewed focus on gun control in the US.      \u00a3694.89bn Public spending in 2011-12 was \u00a3694.89bn - compared to \u00a3689.63bn in 2010-11.

The news that North Korea has successfully launched a satellite heightened fears that the same know-how could be used to launch ballistic missiles. We looked at which countries already have the capability to launch a nuclear missile, and how many warheads they have.       11.6% The eurozone unemployment rate rose to 11.6% in September - the highest rate on record. Spain has been hit the hardest with more than one in four out of work. Eurostat figures showed that 25.75m people in the whole European Union were unemployed in September 2012. 2:1 The ratio that sums up the problem facing women in theatre. The Guardian, in collaboration with Elizabeth Freestone of Pentabus Theatre undertook research earlier this year looking at female representation, from actors to board members and creative crews. Strikingly the results show that three artistic directors had never directed a play by a woman; Sir Nicholas Hytner of the National Theatre, Gregory Doran of the RSC and Paul Kerryson of the Curve Theatre, Leicester. Additional research by Elizabeth Freestone examined which of William Shakespeare&apos;s plays are the most female friendly. Her research showed that with 40% female lines, As You Like It is the most women friendly of all the bard&apos;s plays.

The chart below shows a selection of the worst turnouts and really highlights how the low turnout for the PCC votes has made it one of the worst ever.      714,646 The number of Twitter followers Pope Benedict XVI had on his English language account under the name @Pontifex (as of 12th December 2012).

And no one will notice so long as you take yourself very, very seriously. In fact, the more serious and illogical movies got, the better they went down. Exhibit A: SKYFALL. It was presented as a Bond movie for grown-ups: Death! Character! Psychology! MILFs! But think about Javier Bardem&apos;s unfeasibly cunning plan. He must have basically worked out everything in advance: that Bond would kill that Shanghai assassin, which would lead him to Macau, where he&apos;d be seduced by a disposable love interest, who&apos;d lead him to Bardem&apos;s secret baddie island, where Bond would overpower him, bring him back to London, get Q to feed his deadly computer virus into the system, and so on. Tube schedules, sewer plans, police disguises, helicopters, perfectly timed getaway drivers, plus a small army \u2013 hosting the Olympics was a village fete by comparison. All this to get to M, while Bond simply broke into her apartment. The Batman franchise is no stranger to infeasibly cunning plans, either, and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES was so riddled with plot holes you could use it as a sieve. But again, the movie&apos;s Occupy-referencing &quot;political significance&quot; papered over the idiocy. For example, the whole story hinged on Bane&apos;s siege of Gotham \u2013 but why did he do it? To give the city back to the people? The same people he planned to blow up with his big nuclear bomb? And since the bomb could have been set off at any moment, why did they wait three months to do it anyway? Mind you, the whole thing could have been avoided if they hadn&apos;t decided to send EVERY COP IN THE CITY down into Bane&apos;s tunnels. D&apos;oh! Illogic spread across our screens like a mutating alien virus. Which brings us to PROMETHEUS (see below). Yes, remember that monolithic compendium of sci-fi dumbness? Its tagline could have been: &quot;In space, no one observes basic health and safety guidelines.&quot; In some distant part of the universe higher life forms are still trying to count the ways in which Prometheus didn&apos;t make sense. Us Earthlings just paid up and scratched our heads. By contrast, nonsensical popcorn movies such as THE AVENGERS, MEN IN BLACK 3 and CABIN IN THE WOODS were redeemed by their flagrant, uninhibited silliness. Flying aircraft carriers, Norse gods, an alien Andy Warhol, the Merman \u2013 it&apos;s not real! We&apos;re still trying to work out if LOOPER makes sense or not, but did it matter? It didn&apos;t matter! At the higher end of the pecking order meanwhile, we were made to feel stupid for even expecting HOLY MOTORS to make sense. What was holding this coup de cinema together? A chimpanzee family and talking limos, of course, you uncultured idiot! Meaning disintegrated before your eyes in BERBERIAN SOUND STUDIO and by coincidence, what&apos;s been widely regarded as the year&apos;s best movie THE MASTER, concerned a pompous, self-important writer whose incoherent and contradictory fantasies are lapped up unquestioningly by his followers. What could Paul Thomas Anderson have been trying to tell us? Prometheus: A scientist tries to explain it Prometheus was the most dissected release of 2012, but the crew&apos;s search for the meaning of human creation was nothing compared to the audience&apos;s search for the meaning. Still baffled, we asked an expert \u2013 Graham Shirling, a biomedical scientist working for blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan \u2013 to make sense of the violent liquids and aliens. &quot;Nothing in the film seemed too unreasonable. Obviously there&apos;s nothing in it that comes directly from anything we&apos;re doing at the moment, but it&apos;s the direction we&apos;re trying to go in. The whole GM scare, people are saying, &apos;You&apos;re acting like gods&apos;... people can be frightened of science, through ignorance. Then again, if we&apos;re able to do more and more, we could become arrogant enough to want to engineer worlds, engineer species. And Prometheus is, in a way, an extrapolation of trying to cure diseases and faults in the system. The fluid in the film is used to create and destroy life, and actually it is the way things are going. At Anthony Nolan we&apos;re using stem cells to cure diseases and put missing things back. So that could be argued as a step down that road, with what&apos;s happening with GM, putting DNA into things.&quot;", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Prometheus"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-29T00:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/31/venezuela-best-stock-market-2012", "sentences": ["Elsewhere, the Hang Seng added 22.6%, the Nikkei 225 climbed 22% and the Shanghai market 4.5%."], "title": "Venezuela is best-performing stock market for 2012", "article": "If someone had told you at the start of 2012 to invest in a country with an ailing, anti-capitalist president who regularly seizes company assets, you could be forgiven for quickly walking away.

Tucked inside the driver&apos;s jacket, it reminds him of warmer times and passes unnoticed by friends and passengers \u2013 at least until its loud creaks erupt. His nameless friend, two inches long with a pale green abdomen and vicious-looking mandibles, serenades him through long days for a simple supper of carrot. &quot;During the winter it is dry and cold and you cannot hear any birdsong. The sound of bush crickets makes me happier,&quot; said Wang, 31. China has a long history of cherishing insects for their voices and fighting abilities, immortalising crickets and bush crickets in poetry and paintings. After falling out of favour when the Communists came to power in 1949, the pastime re-emerged in the 1990s as people grew wealthier and renewed their interest in Chinese traditions. &quot;It is such fun \u2013 it is the sound of nature. Can any musical instrument compare?&quot; said Zhao Boguang, deputy director of the Capital sound-producing insect specialist committee, who sells about 1,000 such pets each year. &quot;In winter, if you have some flowers and keep a bush cricket singing in your room, how elegant it is!&quot; Writers celebrated cricket song as early as 500BC, experts say. Later, the wealthy began to keep them in cages. &quot;As early as the Tang dynasty, in the palaces, the concubines fed those sound-producing insects to kill time when they felt lonely,&quot; said Yin Haisheng, director of the Shanghai Entomological Museum, which will soon hold an exhibition on the subject. &quot;Gradually, it became popular among normal people.&quot; Selling crickets has become a lucrative industry for farmers from Shandong, in the north-east, which is said to produce the best. In the summer, you can buy one for 10 yuan (\u00a31), said Wang. But in winter, their scarcity sends the price shooting up. A specimen with a particularly fine song might cost 400 yuan. The most exquisite and melodic can command five times that. Volume is most important, but tone matters, too. There have even been cricket singing competitions. Historically, cricket lovers kept their pets in specially moulded gourds or elaborately wrought bamboo or metal cages. Some commissioned elaborate sandalwood cases inlaid with mother of pearl. Wang keeps his pet in a see-through tube with breathing grids at the end, but cricket houses can sell for hundreds of pounds. Dedicated fanciers can buy special long-handled sponges for bathing the insects and spoons to feed them titbits of vegetables or tofu. Most are middle-aged men who remember playing with the insects as children. The strongest cricket cultures are found in Beijing, Xi&apos;an and Hangzhou because they were ancient capitals, said Zhao, reflecting the noble origins of the hobby. Other areas near the latter city took it up because of their relative wealth and love of betting, added Yin; gambling is banned but widespread on the mainland. Cricket fighting is an even more addictive pursuit than rearing the insects for their song. China&apos;s notorious 13th-century &quot;cricket minister&quot; was accused of neglecting duties due to his obsession. These days contenders are sorted into weight classes and champions change hands for thousands of pounds. Yin said some owners cross-breed them with other species to produce tougher fighters \u2013 or resort to doping them. Even the hardiest do not survive for long. Their feistiness is part of their appeal; but their short lives, and their deaths in the cruel winter frosts, have greater cultural resonance. &quot;As a symbol of autumn, they have become associated with loneliness, sadness, pity for the fate of mankind and are thus used prolifically in Chinese poems,&quot; wrote entomologist Jin Xingbao in an essay. Wang watched helplessly as his first neared its end: &quot;The body was green, and gradually turned to black. You knew it was going to die. Of course, I felt very bad when it did. &quot;The second one was a sad story: my children took it out from the cage, and played with it.&quot; This one, his third, is doubly cherished as a gift from a friend. Their time together is brief, he acknowledged; normally they die in the new year. &quot;If you are a good foster father, your bush cricket can live until April,&quot; he said hopefully.

This forecast is the latest in a cascade of ominous observations. Just in the last month US scientists warned that West Antarctica was warming twice as fast as expected, and three times faster than the average for the planet as a whole; and the European Space Agency revealed that snow cover in Europe and Asia in June had been the lowest since satellite observations began 45 years ago. It has been a year of extremes, in which the Arctic summer sea ice fell to its lowest\u00a0ever; in which the 48 contiguous states of the US experienced the hottest ever temperatures and protracted drought; in which wildfires in the tundra darkened snow over Greenland and precipitated melting at an unprecedented rate. The largest Atlantic hurricane on record crippled New York, while Britain, which began the year with one of the driest winters on record, then experienced what for some counties proved to be the wettest year ever. In global terms, 2012 was probably only the ninth warmest on record. But 11 of the 12 warmest ever have fallen in this young century. The signals could hardly be clearer: climate change is on the way, driven largely by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activity. More than two decades ago, scientists warned that these things would happen: they are happening, and faster than anybody expected. Ice reflects sunlight: it helps insulate the planet. Dark things \u2013 soot, blue water, tarmac and brick \u2013 absorb sunlight, and accelerate warming. So the loss of ice cover is itself going to feed back into extra warmth and even faster melting. For every 1C temperature rise, saturated air can hold 7% more water vapour. So with rising temperatures, there will be devastating drought in some regions and catastrophic floods and cyclones in others. But glacial ice is also water waiting to reach the ocean. Researchers warned in 1978 that the West Antarctic ice sheet was likely to melt as carbon dioxide levels rose. There is enough ice there to raise global sea levels by at least 4.5 metres: if that happened, London, New York, Shanghai and other estuarine megacities would become uninhabitable and most of Bangladesh could disappear. Already, as we report in connection with Britain today, food security is back on the political agenda in the rich world. And the political response to these ominous signals? Ministers met in Doha, agreed once again that planetary warming should be limited to 2C rather than, say, a possible 4.8C, and promised to meet again in 2015. They then went back to worrying about economic growth. But unsustainable growth is the problem. Successive UK governments have grasped the gravity, but have acted slowly and inconsistently. This one \u2013 avowedly the &quot;greenest government ever&quot;\u2013 should be vigorously pursuing carbon-free ways of delivering energy and inventive ways of saving it. Instead, it has seconded energy executives into the civil service; it is contemplating the exploitation of shale gas; and it is watching rail fares rise by twice inflation, and so encouraging fossil fuel use on the road. In the US, attitudes are changing: senators and members of Congress may remain sceptical, but \u2013 according to a December poll \u2013 four Americans in five now think that temperatures are rising and government should act. That is good news: politicians respond to electoral alarm. The bad news is that the longer the delay, the more radical the action needed, and the more single-minded, wholehearted and hardheaded the requisite international co-operation to deliver it. The auguries are not promising. Rationing resources is never easy politically, and nation states tend to compete, rather than co-operate. But headlong climate change presents hazards on a global scale, so global agreement and concerted action is the only option. We don&apos;t have another planet to go to. We really are all in this together.", "tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Science", "Weather"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-31T19:43:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/31/transfer-window-premier-league-guide", "sentences": ["Who they&apos;re after Interest in Nicolas Anelka at Shanghai Shenhua is established while, if \u00a37m can be spent on a player, they could revisit Demba Ba&apos;s willingness to leave Newcastle."], "title": "Transfer window: Premier League club-by-club guide", "article": "Arsenal Money to spend Ars\u00e8ne Wenger still has a large transfer kitty. Ivan Gazidis, the chief executive, has confirmed this and, in short, Wenger can spend whatever he wants to strengthen the squad. The age-old question, though, concerns whether the manager can find sufficient value in the market or quality that represents an upgrade on what he already has. What&apos;s needed A striker, particularly as Wenger will lose Gervinho to the Africa Cup of Nations; a left-back, as the club are open to offers for Andr\u00e9 Santos and maybe a defensive midfielder. Wojciech Szczesny is not entirely secure as the long-term answer in goal. Who they&apos;re after Demba Ba, Wilfried Zaha and Luke Shaw are all prime targets. David Hytner Aston Villa Money to spend It is a case of needs must at Villa Park, which means Randy Lerner, the club&apos;s owner, will make funds available to help stave off the threat of relegation but there will be no repeat of the club-record deal that brought Darren Bent to the club two years ago. The transfer kitty is likely to be \u00a310m at most. What&apos;s needed Where do you start? Apart from goalkeeper and right-back, Villa need strengthening in just about every position. Experience is the key requirement, given the number of youngsters in Villa&apos;s team. A central defender, combative midfielder, striker and left-back have been targeted. Who they&apos;re after Steve Morison, the Wales international striker who is out of favour at Norwich, Lambert&apos;s former club, is an option while loan moves for Manchester City&apos;s John Guidetti and Tottenham&apos;s Tom Huddlestone are possibilities. Stuart James Chelsea Money to spend Funding, as ever, is available and will be spent. The outlay may not be as lavish as two years ago, when Fernando Torres and David Luiz arrived for a combined \u00a373.3m, but it will still be impressive. What&apos;s needed A striker to back up Torres given Daniel Sturridge&apos;s move to Liverpool, possibly a second striker to operate off the Spaniard, a central midfielder and, at a push, a left-back. Who they&apos;re after The ideal remains Radamel Falcao but there is an acceptance Atl\u00e9tico Madrid will not sell in January, so Chelsea are monitoring Demba Ba, Bayer Leverkusen&apos;s Andre Sch\u00fcrrle, Barcelona&apos;s David Villa and the Borussia Dortmund pair Marco Reus and Robert Lewandowski. In midfield, Corinthians&apos; Paulinho is a target with Everton likely to retain Marouane Fellaini until the summer. Southampton&apos;s Luke Shaw and Everton&apos;s Leighton Baines have attracted interest at left-back. Dominic Fifield Everton Money to spend David Moyes has requested an advance on next year&apos;s television money, worth at least an extra \u00a320m to each Premier League club, to seize the opportunity of Champions League qualification. He has not received a definite answer and a tempting offer for Marouane Fellaini is more likely to inflate the kitty. What&apos;s needed A new goalkeeper to increase the competition for Tim Howard, more bite in central midfield and another striker to ease the reliance on Nikica Jelavic. Who they&apos;re after Birmingham&apos;s keeper Jack Butland, the Paris St-Germain forward Kevin Gameiro and possibly the Club Brugge midfielder Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe are targets should money be available. Loan deals otherwise. Andy Hunter Fulham Money to spend The season&apos;s initial spark, provided by Dimitar Berbatov, has rather fizzled out and Martin Jol has conceded reinforcements must arrive next month to help his team back into the safety of mid-table. Money will be available, particularly given the sales sanctioned last summer. What&apos;s needed Strengthening up and down the spine of the team, particularly given the uncertainty over Brede Hangeland&apos;s long-term future at the club. And both Kerim Frei and Alex Kacaniklic enjoying an injury-free second half to the season. Who they&apos;re after Darren Bent&apos;s situation at Aston Villa has not gone unnoticed while Jol, having considered Blackburn&apos;s Paul Robinson, should finally complete the \u00a3800,000 signing of the Turkish goalkeeper Sinan Bolat from Standard Li\u00e8ge. The Clermont midfielder Yacouba Sylla, who is also interesting QPR, might add steel. Dominic Fifield Liverpool Money to spend Brendan Rodgers could be one of the busiest managers in the January window as his employers, Fenway Sports Group, seek to remedy the mistakes of last summer&apos;s transfer policy. Liverpool have almost \u00a320m to spend although their manager is still required to remove high earners like Joe Cole off the wage bill. What&apos;s needed As was glaringly obvious last season before Andy Carroll was allowed to leave and has been stated with monotonous regularity ever since: someone else apart from Luis Su\u00e1rez to score goals. Who they&apos;re after Daniel Sturridge has joined from Chelsea and Tom Ince likewise from Blackpool. PSG&apos;s Kevin Gameiro is also a possibility and Rodgers retains an interest in Theo Walcott. Andy Hunter Manchester City Money to spend In theory the sky&apos;s the limit, despite the strictures of Uefa&apos;s financial fair play, so an outlay up to \u00a350m plus wage costs would not be a surprise. What&apos;s needed A strong back-up goalkeeper to give Joe Hart some competition and a central defender \u2013 Joleon Lescott is now fourth choice and wants a move, and Kolo Tour\u00e9 could miss all of January after the New Year&apos;s Day visit of Stoke City due to Africa Cup of Nations duty. Also a creative midfielder, with Samir Nasri continuing to disappoint. Mario Balotelli&apos;s troubles might also cause Roberto Mancini to consider a striker. Who they&apos;re after Stoke&apos;s centre-half Ryan Shawcross is of interest, as is Theo Walcott whose flexibility in playing through the middle or wide is a plus, so Mancini will monitor whether the Arsenal forward finally signs a new deal to stay put. Internazionale&apos;s Wesley Sneidjer could be a replacement for Nasri. Jamie Jackson Manchester United Money to spend In theory anything up to \u00a350m bracket though Sir Alex Ferguson has always been reluctant to spend in the January transfer window, so he may prefer to use any funds generated by a sale if a particularly lucrative bid for one of his more peripheral players is made. What&apos;s needed According to Ferguson the current squad is as good as any he has had during his 26 years at Old Trafford. But with David de Gea still unsure under the high ball the Scot may be tempted if a top-class goalkeeper became available. He could also do with a defensive midfielder and a wide player as Ryan Giggs is used less and less. Long-term, a replacement for Patrice Evra is required. Who they&apos;re after According to Ferguson no one. At the weekend he dismissed reports that Borussia Dortmund&apos;s Robert Lewandowski is on his way. Jamie Jackson Newcastle United Money to spend Unknown. Second guessing Mike Ashley, Newcastle&apos;s maverick owner, is a fool&apos;s game and the club is ultra secretive about transfer business. What&apos;s needed A centre-half, a right back, a striker and Demba Ba to stay put. Who they&apos;re after Mathieu Debuchy, the France right-back, is supposed to be arriving from Lille for \u20ac6m on Wednesday. There is also strong interest in the FC Twente centre-back Douglas and the Marseille striker Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my. Meanwhile Ba&apos;s knee problem, wage demands and hefty agent fees mean the \u00a37m release clause in his contract does not represent the bargain it might seem. Louise Taylor Norwich Money to spend Chris Hughton is unlikely to have significant cash at his disposal but Norwich have proved there are plenty of bargains to be found outside the Premier League. Alexander Tettey and Robert Snodgrass have proved cheap and shrewd purchases. What&apos;s needed More firepower up front. Grant Holt has scored only four goals this season and the Canaries have had to rely on players from midfield such as Anthony Pilkington getting forward in support of the striker. Who they&apos;re after Hughton failed with a bid to sign Brighton&apos;s Craig Mackail-Smith last summer and could step up his pursuit of the 28-year-old in January if Steve Morison is shown the door at Carrow Road, as seems likely. James Riach Queens Park Rangers Money to spend Harry Redknapp began by suggesting he would not spend if QPR&apos;s position felt hopeless in January, but he will surely not put up with this squad&apos;s deficiencies, particularly having publicly complained that too many players are being paid too much to have produced so little. Tony Fernandes will back him in his desperation to remain in the Premier League. What&apos;s needed Most urgently, a strong centre-half and a regular goalscorer. Who they&apos;re after Interest in Nicolas Anelka at Shanghai Shenhua is established while, if \u00a37m can be spent on a player, they could revisit Demba Ba&apos;s willingness to leave Newcastle. Clermont&apos;s Yacouba Sylla feels like a Redknapp signing in waiting, while the manager may explore a reunion with Joe Cole. Any centre-back targeted would surely have experience in the Premier League, though Michael Dawson from Spurs or Fulham&apos;s Brede Hangeland may prove pipe dreams. Dominic Fifield Reading Money to spend Reading only spent about \u00a35m last summer and they are unlikely to be convinced that a January spree is the most sensible option in their fight against relegation. However, their billionaire Russian owner, Anton Zingarevich, could always have a change of heart. What&apos;s needed Quality all over the pitch but particularly in attack. Pavel Pogrebnyak has scored only three league goals for the Royals and Brian McDermott could do with more options than just Adam le Fondre and Jason Roberts. Who they&apos;re after Loan signings could be Reading&apos;s best way of strengthening their squad this winter, with Arsenal&apos;s Andrey Arshavin and Tottenham&apos;s Tom Huddlestone both struggling to feature prominently at their respective clubs. James Riach Southampton Money to spend Southampton were one of the biggest-spending clubs in Europe last summer, with the \u00a312m purchase of Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez breaking their transfer record. After steadying the ship following a shaky start, Nigel Adkins could once again be allowed to dabble in the market by Southampton&apos;s chief executive, Nicola Cortese. What&apos;s needed Defence has to be the priority for Adkins as Southampton have conceded 37 goals in 19 league matches so far this season. They are short of centre-backs and a top-class goalkeeper. Who they&apos;re after Birmingham City&apos;s goalkeeper Jack Butland is reportedly on the radar, as is the Cagliari defender Davide Astori. Brighton&apos;s winger Will Buckley could make the short move along the south coast. James Riach Stoke City Money to spend Minimal especially as Tony Pulis, the manager, has a sizeable squad and has been told by his owner, Peter Coates, to temper any outlay and focus on offering greater opportunity for homegrown players to develop. What&apos;s needed Stoke sit an impressive eighth with 29 points at just over the halfway point so the current squad is doing fine. Pulis, though, would not turn down a consistent goalscorer as Stoke have scored only 21 goals. The left-back position requires strengthening. Who they&apos;re after It may be more of a case of who they can keep as discussions continue with Stoke&apos;s captain, Ryan Shawcross, about him finally signing a fresh long-term deal. A contribution from Michael Owen (four substitute appearances, zero goals) would also be welcomed. Jamie Jackson Sunderland Money to spend Unknown. Ellis Short, the club&apos;s owner, is too canny to bandy any figures around but Martin O&apos;Neill appears to have convinced him the squad requires strengthening. What&apos;s needed A striker, a strong, creative midfielder and a centre-half. Who they&apos;re after Tim Cahill on a short-term deal from New York Red Bulls during the MLS off-season and a possible loan arrangement with Manchester City for the striker John Guidetti. Long-term targets include Joleon Lescott from City, Celtic&apos;s Gary Hooper, Norwich&apos;s Grant Holt and, although unlikely, James Milner. Louise Taylor Swansea City Money to spend They made a tidy profit on player trading in the summer, courtesy of the departures of Joe Allen to Liverpool and Scott Sinclair to Manchester City, so there is up to \u00a310m to spend should Michael Laudrup, the Swansea manager, find the right players. What&apos;s needed The priority is a striker. Laudrup would happily move Danny Graham on and replace him with a centre-forward who can weigh in with a few goals to reduce the burden on Michu. A winger is also a possibility to provide cover. Who they&apos;re after The Celta Vigo striker Iago Aspas. Laudrup has spoken openly about his admiration for the 25-year-old Spaniard, although a deal is a long way off from being completed and Swansea will face competition from several other clubs. Eder, the Braga forward, is also on Swansea&apos;s radar. Stuart James Tottenham Money to spend The chairman, Daniel Levy, will back Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas but the available funds would swell if the loans of David Bentley, Jermaine Jenas and Danny Rose could be turned into sales, while Heurelho Gomes and Carlo Cudicini are available for transfer. What&apos;s needed Villas-Boas has an almost fully fit squad and says that he will add nobody. Then again, he was guilty of telling a few porkies over the summer and it is not like Tottenham to remain quiet during a transfer window. The squad needs a striker and cover at full-back and in wide midfield. Who they&apos;re after Big names from abroad \u2013 Willian, Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o and Fernando Llorente would all cost serious money. Closer to home, Wilfried Zaha would not be much cheaper. David Hytner West Bromwich Albion Money to spend They spent less than any other Premier League club in the summer so there is no reason to think that there will be much money available in January, especially as Albion are enjoying such a good season. What&apos;s needed Holding on to Romelu Lukaku for the remainder of the season \u2013 Chelsea have an option to recall him \u2013 would be a big boost. Losing Youssouf Mulumbu during the Africa Cup of Nations is a worry but George Thorne, who made his full Premier League debut at Manchester United on Saturday, could get a chance to shine. Who they&apos;re after Few clubs plan their transfer business as well as Albion, which means panic-buying in January rarely comes into the equation. Unless Lukaku returns to Chelsea \u2013 the Belgium international has suggested he would like to stay at The Hawthorns \u2013 it is difficult to see much happening other than a few fringe players moving on. Stuart James West Ham United Money to spend Funds are tight as the club carries its debts and the board may point out that they helped Sam Allardyce to reshape the squad in the summer after promotion. What&apos;s needed Allardyce says that he desperately wants a couple of new signings as the squad has suffered severely from injuries, particularly in creative positions. The big fear is that Mohamed Diam\u00e9, the dynamic midfielder, will be tempted away \u2013 he has a \u00a33.5m release clause in his contract and no shortage of admirers. Who they&apos;re after Marouane Chamakh, Nicolas Anelka and Salomon Kalou would all increase Allardyce&apos;s options up front, while Ga\u00ebl Givet could be brought in to bolster the defence. David Hytner Wigan Athletic Money to spend Roberto Mart\u00ednez wants &quot;two or three in January&quot;, mainly as a consequence of the crippling injury list that has undermined Wigan for most of the season so far. An FA panel has already given the green light to the free transfer of Honduran midfielder Roger Espinoza from Kansas City. What&apos;s needed Wigan&apos;s central defenders have suffered repeated injuries this term and Mart\u00ednez cannot wait forever on their recovery. More creativity from midfield is necessary too. Who they&apos;re after The Espinoza deal is done, Dutch midfielder Ferrie Bodde has been training with the club since being released by Swansea in the summer and Manchester United&apos;s teenage Chilean striker Angelo Henr\u00edquez is lined up on loan.
