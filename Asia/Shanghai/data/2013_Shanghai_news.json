Chris Buckley, a 45-year-old Australian who has worked as a correspondent in China since 2000, rejoined the Times in September after working for Reuters.  The NY Times applied for Buckley to be accredited, but the authorities ignored numerous visa requests. So Buckley, his partner and their daughter flew yesterday (31 December) to Hong Kong. The paper is also waiting for its new Beijing bureau chief, Philip Pan, to be accredited. He applied in March but his visa has yet to be processed. These problems come amid government pressure on foreign news media over investigations into the delicate subject of the finances of senior Chinese leaders. Corruption is widely reported in China, but top leaders are considered off limits. On the day that the NY Times published a long investigation into the riches of the family of prime minister Wen Jiabao, both its English-language website and its new Chinese-language site were blocked within China, and they remain so. The NY Times reports: &quot;In June, the authorities blocked the English-language site of Bloomberg News after it published a detailed investigation into the family riches of China&apos;s new top leader, Xi Jinping. Chinese financial institutions say they have been instructed by officials not to buy Bloomberg&apos;s computer terminals.&quot; According to research by the New York-based press watchdog, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the Chinese authorities have exerted growing pressure on international news outlets. In May, Al-Jazeera correspondent Melissa Chan was forced to leave the country. China&apos;s ministry of foreign affairs declined to comment on Buckley&apos;s forced departure.  &quot;I hope the Chinese authorities will issue him a new visa as soon as possible and allow Chris and his family to return to Beijing,&quot; said Jill Abramson, the NY Times&apos;s executive editor. &quot;I also hope that Phil Pan, whose application for journalist credentials has been pending for months, will also be issued a visa to serve as our bureau chief in Beijing.&quot; According the NY Times, it has six other accredited correspondents in China, and their visas were renewed for 2013 in a timely manner. They included David Barboza, the Shanghai bureau chief, who wrote the articles about Wen&apos;s family.

The church of Santa Teresa in Milan was originally built in 1674, but closed for worship in the early 19th century. The city council purchased the building in 1974 and in 2003 it opened as a media library. No one can tell how many there are. Neither the Catholic church nor the arts departments at various levels of government have seen fit to count them. But there are probably several thousand places of worship all over Italy which have been deconsecrated and sold. The permutations seem endless: here a bar or a country house, an artist&apos;s studio or a garage, there the head office of a bank, a library or function rooms. But sometimes a whiff of incense seems to linger, as if long after the last mass the spirit of the place still clings to the walls. This may be yet another sign of the hard times on which the church has fallen and Italy&apos;s increasingly secular society. But that is not what prompted the Milanese photographer Andrea Di Martino to set up his camera at the entrance to a series of ex-churches. Much as for a passport photograph, he adopted exactly the same angle for each picture: the effect is striking yet poetic, &quot;an encounter between an umbrella and a sewing machine&quot;. &quot;I started the Mass is Ended project four years ago,&quot; says Di Martino. &quot;A bit by chance to start with, in Lombardy, then in other parts of Italy where I was working. After that my research became more systematic, indeed an obsession. I looked for deconsecrated churches all over the place, particularly on the websites of estate agents. I discovered yet more places through the grapevine. My objective now is to cover the whole of Italy, for use in a book to be published next year. Obviously people may put a political spin on my work, see it as an illustration of the church&apos;s decline, but what interests me is primarily the architecture.&quot; More recently, he travelled to China, photographing the area round Shanghai to which whole chunks of European landscape \u2013 an Eiffel tower, a London neighbourhood, an Amsterdam canal \u2013 have been imported. The pictures of churches feel equally strange. Each one seems like a contradiction in terms: a black Audi parked in the nave, a bookcase at the foot of a column. What are they doing there? How about the plastic chairs, reminiscent of some provincial village hall? Who put them there? Who designed these installations? Actually, no one. They just happened by chance or necessity. The destiny of a place can change over time. Nothing lasts forever, even if churches supposedly prepare us for eternal life. There is nothing new about Italian churches being deconsecrated. The Napoleonic campaigns, which foundered on resistance by the papal states, and then Italian unification led to the closure of many places of worship, respectively as an act of vengeance, and for lack of funds. After being turned into barracks or storehouses, they are now coming back on to the market. The price can be high, though, up to \u20ac1m ($1.25m) for the finest, well-maintained specimens. \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "tags": ["Photography", "Architecture", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-01T12:33:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/01/china-taste-pork-pollution-problem", "sentences": ["Wang Xi, a professor of environment law at Jiaotong University in Shanghai, says that while the legal system regulating the livestock industry is comprehensive, the implementation of laws is patchy."], "title": "China's taste for pork serves up a pollution problem", "article": "     Fan Jianjun points to a concrete pipe jutting from the lake bank. Sludge spews from its mouth and arcs across the water, the surface bubbling with the bodies of flies. Fan has lived in Houtonglong village all his 31 years. The water was clear, he says, before the pig farm was built and people&apos;s health began to suffer. No one consulted the villagers before Shengtai pig farm was built 100 metres from their homes. The farm produces 10,000 animals a year \u2013 a relatively small concern in the world of industrialised farming \u2013 but there is so much waste to dispose of, the village air is thick with the stench. In the rainy season manure escapes from the farm, covering the roads. Villagers are developing respiratory problems and Fan struggles to raise chickens and ducks, which die soon after hatching. In the 10 years since the farm arrived, the villagers have tried to get it dislodged. &quot;We pulled down the walls several times, and blocked the gate with mud and trucks,&quot; said Fan, a self-employed businessman. Complaints to the local government have gone unanswered, so Fan turned to internet forums to raise awareness. &quot;We can only hope the farm will stop polluting our environment,&quot; he added. &quot;Our village was once a very beautiful place.&quot; Pork is China&apos;s favourite meat: last year the country produced 50m tonnes \u2013 more than half the world&apos;s total \u2013 and as the disposable incomes of China&apos;s 1.3 billion people rise, their appetite is growing. &quot;Pork is wrapped up in ideas of progress and modernity,&quot; said Mindi Schneider, a sociologist at Cornell University. Until the 1990s typical families only ate meat at Chinese new year. Memories of the devastating famine that killed tens of millions in the early 1960s still weigh heavy on the Chinese psyche. &quot;I&apos;ve heard people talking about eating meat in &apos;revenge,&apos;&quot; Schneider said. &quot;It was so limited before. Now it&apos;s like: &apos;look at this progress, we can eat as much meat as we want.&apos;&quot; In 1980 the average Chinese person ate 14kg of meat. Today that person eats over four times more, almost 60kg. In comparison, the average American eats 125kg of meat each year and the average Briton about 85kg. The livestock industry is transforming accordingly. Seen from a hilltop 200 miles from Houtonglong, the future of Chinese pork production takes the form of 32 identical redbrick pig sheds, shaded by leafy trees. Jiahua Pig Breeding Centre is one of China&apos;s new mega-farms, producing 100,000 pigs a year. Unlike the farm in Fan&apos;s village, Jiahua is relatively isolated. But from this vantage point, the reek of manure wafts over with the wind. Periodically, the screams of dozens of pigs gather in a crescendo. There will soon be more farms like Jiahua: between 2007 and 2010 the government invested \u00a31bn in the construction of industrialised pig farms, and it continues to provide similar levels of support. Jiahua itself has invested \u00a330m in a plant that will be three times the size of this one. Feeding a fifth of the world&apos;s population on less than 10% of its arable land is a critical issue for the government. Industrial livestock farming, the argument goes, will stabilise China&apos;s erratic pork prices through its efficiency and predictable output. But, in China&apos;s case, some dispute this assertion. &quot;Industrial production is one of the very things that makes the price so volatile, because the cost of industrial production in China is higher than the cost in the US, because feed is so expensive since it&apos;s all imported, and there are costs associated with buying the housing and technologies,&quot; said Schneider. The growth of industrial pig farming in China has implications for the rest of the planet: the livestock industry accounts for 18% of the world&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 more than is produced by cars, planes, ships and trains combined, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. China produces more or less the same amount of pork as it consumes, but it cannot grow enough pig feed: it takes 4kg of grain to produce 1kg of pork, and China is short of crops. Last year China imported 60% of the world&apos;s soya beans, which were fed to pigs exclusively. Shipping soya beans and, increasingly, corn to China affects global food prices, entails hefty greenhouse gas emissions, contributes to the razing of millions of hectares of forest, savannah and pasture in Latin America and diverts grain that could feed the world&apos;s hungry. In Houtonglong village, other forms of environmental degradation are evident. Beyond the sludge lapping the lake edge, a bloom of russet algae covers the water. A 2010 investigation by the Chinese government found that agriculture is a bigger source of water pollution than industry. &quot;The fast development of livestock breeding and aquaculture has produced a lot of food but they are also major sources of pollution in our lives,&quot; said Wang Yangliang, of the ministry of agriculture. But the government is doing little to enforce the protection laws it has put in place. Wang Xi, a professor of environment law at Jiaotong University in Shanghai, says that while the legal system regulating the livestock industry is comprehensive, the implementation of laws is patchy. &quot;Generally&quot;, he says, &quot;it doesn&apos;t look good.&quot; Additional reporting by Xia Keyu Meaty numbers Today, the average Chinese eats 60kg of meat a year, four times more than in 1980. The average Briton consumes 85kg. In 2011 China consumed 50m tonnes of pork, half the world&apos;s total. The country produced 80m tonnes of meat, 28% more than a decade ago. Humans will need to eat a quarter of the meat they currently do to feed the extra 2 billion people expected to be alive by 2050. Food derived from animals consumes five to 10 times more water than a vegetarian diet. China&apos;s 4,000th KFC opened in Dalian in September. The first opened in Beijing in 1987. Since 2007 the number of outlets has doubled.

In case anyone had missed the point, photographs of Mao&apos;s memorial ceremony \u2013 which in their originals featured the Gang of Four prominently \u2013 were republished following their arrest with fuzzy gaps in the places where they had stood. Bo Xilai, the disgraced party secretary of the megalopolis of Chongqing, is also being airbrushed out of the city that he dominated for five turbulent years, until his spectacular fall last March. His victims now speak openly of torture, and the Mao-style rallies he promoted are out of favour. Bo himself has yet to be put on trial on the corruption charges now drawn up against him. While the trial of the Gang of Four in the early 80s was a protracted affair that drew a public line under the extremes of the Maoist era, Bo&apos;s trial is likely to be briefer. Its purpose is to drive a stake through the corpse of his political career, rather than to rehearse the details of crimes that the public might judge unremarkable in any Communist party leader. Bo was corrupt? The public shrugs. His family was inexplicably rich? Some of the richest people in China are the children and grandchildren of party leaders. But the party prefers its would-be leaders to remember that none is allowed to be bigger than the organisation. It is one of several characteristics the Chinese Communist party shares with the mafia. The message that the once charismatic \u2013 and highly visible \u2013 leader&apos;s trial will convey to the Chinese public is quite simple: he lost. But his fall comes at an inflection point in China&apos;s development, almost as\u00a0significant as that of 1976. This year will test China&apos;s ability to execute a number of key transitions: towards a less wasteful and more innovative economy, towards or away from the rule of law, towards a fairer society or back to authoritarianism and the immense privileges of the elite. The new leaders inherit a number of actual and impending crises, of which the most dramatic is in Tibet, where the number of self-immolations since 2009 has reached 92. A new approach there would be a convincing sign of leadership. On corruption, Xi Jinping, the incoming president, will have to work hard to convince anyone that his promises mean more than the empty talk of his predecessors. (Wen Jiabao, the outgoing prime minister, warned that the families of those in power should not enrich themselves. In October2012, the New York Times was blocked for revealing that Wen&apos;s family had accumulated assets worth $2.7bn during his years as premier. Bloomberg was also blocked for revealing details of Xi Jinping&apos;s family fortune, estimated at several hundred million dollars.) In 2011, then president Wen Jiabao told a London audience: &quot;Without freedom, there is no real democracy. Without guarantee of economic and political rights, there is no real freedom&quot;, sentiments his audience might claim to appreciate rather more than the speaker. But in his 10 years in office, rule of law made little progress, and economic and political rights continue to be honoured more on paper than in practice. The outgoing president Hu Jintao&apos;s &quot;harmonious society&quot;, proclaimed as a rebalancing of an increasingly unequal social order, is invoked by citizens to satirise everything from internet censorship to the suppression of political debate. Instead of rebalancing China&apos;s unequal wealth, the government stopped publishing the Gini coefficient, the index of inequality, 11 years ago, claiming its data on the rich was incomplete. Will Xi fare any better? The first signs are not encouraging for those who hope for a more liberal China \u2013 like the 71 intellectuals who signed a petition last month calling for separation of powers and an end to state interference in the law. Internet controls have been severely tightened and the official media have led a chorus calling for patriotic obedience to the rules in everything from internet use to culture. Xi&apos;s speeches so far have stressed the nationalist dream of an ever stronger China, and maintaining the one-party system and its spoils will be a priority. When he speaks of reform, does he mean any more than measures necessary to keep the system intact? Perhaps the party hopes it will grow stronger as the first model of a &quot;post democratic order&quot;, as Eric Li, a Shanghai-based venture capitalist, writes in the current issue of Foreign Affairs. The party, Li argues in a notably sycophantic essay, will overcome any short-term difficulties to demonstrate the superiority of China&apos;s wise, meritocratic, and public-spirited one-party system and expose the failings of western democracy. The Chinese system does not look outstandingly public spirited from below, but in a &quot;post-democratic&quot; system, perhaps this does not matter. The people, though, are increasingly showing their feelings, despite 20 years of rising living standards: in the 180,000 acknowledged major public order incidents each year; in posts on social media and on the internet; in savage satire of the party&apos;s claims to virtue. As China&apos;s first phase of development and modernisation comes to a close, the new leadership might wonder how its restive citizens would react to an economic setback \u2013 one that collapsed the bargain of the last 20 years in which political stasis was accepted in return for economic advance. They might soon find out. China&apos;s overheated property market is one of the few investments available to the rising middle classes and the estimated 10% of China&apos;s GDP represented by illicit &quot;grey&quot; money, and selling real estate is a major source of income for local authorities. Warnings that the bubble will burst have grown steadily louder over the last year: in the once prosperous city of Wenzhou, property prices have dropped 70% since 2010, Shanghai developers have cut prices to offload swollen inventories, and last month the Chinese business magazine Caixin warned of the dangers to the economy of the empty speculative property that the magazine estimates at 20% to 40% of housing stock. The knock-on effects on shaky financial institutions across China and the consequences for savers and investors could be extremely serious. How the leadership will handle such economic challenges will test whether the claim to wise meritocracy has any more substance than the repeatedly proclaimed anti-corruption drives.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Wen Jiabao", "Xi Jinping", "Bo Xilai", "Hu Jintao"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-01T18:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/01/china-great-famine-book-tombstone", "sentences": ["I never thought it was the government&apos;s problem.&quot;     A manmade disaster ... starving children in Shanghai."], "title": "China's Great Famine: the true story", "article": "Small and stocky, neat in dress and mild of feature, Yang Jisheng is an unassuming figure as he bustles through the pleasantly shabby offices, an old-fashioned satchel thrown over one shoulder. Since his retirement from China&apos;s state news agency he has worked at the innocuously titled Annals of the Yellow Emperor journal, where stacks of documents cover chipped desks and a cockroach circles our paper cups of green tea. Yet the horror stories penned by the 72-year-old from this comforting, professorial warren in Beijing are so savage and excessive they could almost be taken as the blackest of comedies; the bleakest of farces; the most extreme of satires on fanaticism and tyranny. A decade after the Communist party took power in 1949, promising to serve the people, the greatest manmade disaster in history stalks an already impoverished land. In an unremarkable city in central Henan province, more than a million people \u2013 one in eight \u2013 are wiped out by starvation and brutality over three short years. In one area, officials commandeer more grain than the farmers have actually grown. In barely nine months, more than 12,000 people \u2013 a third of the inhabitants \u2013 die in a single commune; a tenth of its households are wiped out. Thirteen children beg officials for food and are dragged deep into the mountains, where they die from exposure and starvation. A teenage orphan kills and eats her four-year-old brother. Forty-four of a village&apos;s 45 inhabitants die; the last remaining resident, a woman in her 60s, goes insane. Others are tortured, beaten or buried alive for declaring realistic harvests, refusing to hand over what little food they have, stealing scraps or simply angering officials. When the head of a production brigade dares to state the obvious \u2013 that there is no food \u2013 a leader warns him: &quot;That&apos;s right-deviationist thinking. You&apos;re viewing the problem in an overly simplistic matter.&quot; Page after page \u2013 even in the drastically edited English translation, there are 500 of them \u2013 his book, Tombstone, piles improbability upon terrible improbability. But Yang did not imagine these scenes. Perhaps no one could. Instead, he devoted 15 years to painstakingly documenting the catastrophe that claimed at least 36\u00a0million lives across the country, including that of his father. The Great Famine remains a taboo in China, where it is referred to euphemistically as the Three Years of Natural Disasters or the Three Years of Difficulties. Yang&apos;s monumental account, first published in Hong Kong, is banned in his homeland. He had little idea of what he would find when he started work: &quot;I didn&apos;t think it would be so serious and so brutal and so bloody. I didn&apos;t know that there were thousands of cases of cannibalism. I didn&apos;t know about farmers who were beaten to death. &quot;People died in the family and they didn&apos;t bury the person because they could still collect their food rations; they kept the bodies in bed and covered them up and the corpses were eaten by mice. People ate corpses and fought for the bodies. In Gansu they killed outsiders; people told me strangers passed through and they killed and ate them. And they ate their own children. Terrible. Too terrible.&quot; For a moment he stops speaking. &quot;To start with, I felt terribly depressed when I was reading these documents,&quot; he adds. &quot;But after a while I became numbed \u2013 because otherwise I couldn&apos;t carry on.&quot; Whether it is due to this process, or more likely his years working within the system, Yang is absolutely self-possessed. His grandfatherly smile is intermittently clipped by caution as he answers a question. Though a sense of deep anger imbues his book, it is all the more powerful for its restraint. &quot;There&apos;s something about China that seems to require sharp-elbowed intellectuals,&quot; says Jo Lusby, head of China operations for Penguin, the publishers of Tombstone. &quot;But the people with the loudest voices aren&apos;t necessarily the ones with the most interesting things to say. Yang Jisheng comes across as a sweet old man, but he has a core of steel. He has complete integrity.&quot; He is, she points out, part of a generation of quietly committed scholars. Despite its apparently quaint title, Annals of the Yellow Emperor is a bold liberal journal that has repeatedly tackled sensitive issues. But writing Tombstone was also a personal mission. Yang was determined to &quot;erect a tombstone for my father&quot;, the other victims and the system that killed them. The book opens with Yang&apos;s return from school to find his father dying: &quot;He tried to extend his hand to greet me but couldn&apos;t lift it \u2026 I was shocked with the realisation that &apos;skin and bones&apos; referred to something so horrible and cruel,&quot; he writes. His village had become a ghost town, with fields dug bare of shoots and trees stripped of bark. For all his remorse and grief, he regarded the death as an individual family&apos;s tragedy: &quot;I was 18 at the time and I only knew what the Communist party told me. Everyone was fooled,&quot; he says. &quot;I was very red. I was on a propaganda team and I believed my father&apos;s death was a personal misfortune. I never thought it was the government&apos;s problem.&quot;     A manmade disaster ... starving children in Shanghai. Photograph: TopFoto Photograph: Topography/ TopFoto    He joined state news agency Xinhua after his graduation, while the political madness of the Cultural Revolution was wreaking fresh havoc on the country: &quot;When I look back on what I wrote [in that first decade], I should have burned all of it,&quot; he says. Even as he wrote his paeans to the party, his job began to offer glimpses of the truth behind the facade. One day, he was shocked to overhear a senior leader in Hubei province say that 300,000 people had died there \u2013 the first hint that his father&apos;s death was not an isolated incident. It was, he says, a gradual awakening. He continued to work for Xinhua, a task made easier by the country&apos;s reform and opening process and his own evolution; by the third decade of his career, he says, &quot;I had my independent thinking and was telling the truth.&quot; That was when his work on Tombstone began: &quot;I just had a very strong desire to find out the facts. I was cheated and I don&apos;t want to be cheated again.&quot; Paradoxically, it was his work for Xinhua that enabled him to unearth the truth about the famine, as he toured archives on the pretext of a dull project on state agricultural policies, armed with official letters of introduction. Numerous people helped him along the way; local officials and other Xinhua staff. Did they realise what he was working on? &quot;Yes, they knew,&quot; he says. Only once, at the archives of south-western Guizhou, was he almost rumbled. &quot;The people who worked there said: &apos;We can&apos;t just let you in; you need permission from the director,&apos;&quot; Yang recalls. &quot;The director said: &apos;I have to get permission from the provincial party vice\u2013secretary.&apos; So we drove to see the provincial party vice\u2013secretary. He said: &apos;I have to ask the party secretary.&apos; The party secretary said: &apos;I have to ask the central government.&apos;&quot; He pauses. &quot;If the central government had known, I would have been in a lot of trouble.&quot; Yang made his excuses and left. Half a century on, the government still treats the famine as a natural disaster and denies the true death toll. &quot;The root problem is the problem of the system. They don&apos;t dare to admit the system&apos;s problems \u2026 It might influence the legitimacy of the Communist party,&quot; Yang says. The death toll is staggering. &quot;The most officials have admitted is 20 million,&quot; he says, but he puts the total at 36 million. It is &quot;equivalent to 450 times the number of people killed by the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki \u2026 and greater than the number of people killed in the first world war,&quot; he writes. Many think even this is a conservative figure: in his acclaimed book Mao&apos;s Great Famine, Frank Dikotter estimates that the toll reached at least 45 million. Tombstone meticulously demonstrates that the famine was not only vast, but manmade; and not only manmade but political, born of totalitarianism. Mao Zedong had vowed to build a communist paradise in China through sheer revolutionary zeal, collectivising farmland and creating massive communes at astonishing speed. In 1958 he sought to go further, launching the Great Leap Forward: a plan to modernise the entire Chinese economy so ambitious that it tipped over into insanity. Many believe personal ambition played a crucial role. Not satisfied with being &quot;the most powerful emperor who had ever ruled China&quot;, Mao strove to snatch leadership of the international communist movement. If the Soviet Union believed it could catch up with the US in 15 years, he vowed, China could overtake Britain in production. His vicious attacks on other leaders who dared to voice concern cowed opposition. But, as Yang notes: &quot;It&apos;s a very complicated historical process, why China believed in Maoism and took this path. It wasn&apos;t one person&apos;s mistake but many people&apos;s. It\u00a0was a process.&quot; The plan proved a disaster from the first. Local officials, either from fanaticism or fear, sent grossly exaggerated reports of their success to the centre, proclaiming harvests three or four times their true size. Higher authorities claimed huge amounts of grain for the cities and even dispatched it overseas. Cadres harassed or killed those who sought to tell the truth and covered up deaths when reports of problems trickled to the centre. Even so, work by Yang and others has proved that senior leaders in Beijing knew of the famine as early as 1958. &quot;To distribute resources evenly will only ruin the Great Leap Forward,&quot; Mao warned colleagues a year later. &quot;When there is not enough to eat, people starve to death. It is better to let half the people die so that others can eat their fill.&quot; Ruthlessness ran through the system. In Xinyang, the Henan city at the centre of the disaster, those who tried to escape the famine were rounded up; many died of starvation or from brutality in detention centres. Police hunted down those who wrote anonymous letters raising the alarm. Attempts to control the population tipped over into outright sadism, with cadres torturing victims in increasingly elaborate, ritualistic ways: &quot;The textbooks don&apos;t mention this part of history at all,&quot; says Yang. &quot;At every festival they have propaganda about the party&apos;s achievements and glory and greatness and correctness. People&apos;s ideology has been formed over many years. So right now it&apos;s very necessary to write this book; otherwise nobody has this history.&quot; There are signs that at least some in China want to address it. Last year, the Southern People&apos;s Weekly dared to publish an issue with the words &quot;Great Famine&quot; emblazoned starkly across the cover. Inside, an article referred to the calamity as a manmade problem. Yang is convinced that Tombstone will be published on the mainland, maybe within the decade. He adds with a smile that there are probably 100,000 copies already in circulation, including pirated versions and those smuggled from Hong Kong: &quot;There are a lot of things people overseas know first and Chinese people learn from overseas,&quot; he points out. But in other ways the shutters are coming down. Zhou Xun, whose new book, The Great Famine in China, collects original documents on the disaster for the first time, writes that much of that material has already been made inaccessible by archives. &quot;Researching it is going to become harder. They are not going to let people look at this stuff any more,&quot; warns Beijing author and photographer Du Bin, whose forthcoming book, No One In The World Can Defeat Me, juxtaposes accounts and images of the horror with the cheery propaganda of the time. In China, history cannot be safely contained within a book; it always threatens to spill over: &quot;Although many years have passed, the Communist party is still in charge of the country,&quot; says Yang. &quot;They admit it, but they don&apos;t want to talk about it; it&apos;s still a tragedy under the Communist party&apos;s governance.&quot; Some hope that the new generation of leaders taking power may be willing to revisit the country&apos;s history and acknowledge the mistakes that have been made. Others think it will be easy for them to continue smoothing over the past. &quot;Because the party has been improving and society has improved and everything is better, it&apos;s hard for people to believe the brutality of that time,&quot; Yang notes. He recalls meeting a worker from Xinyang who lost two family members to the famine. The man&apos;s teenage grandson simply could not believe his recollections, and the pair ended up rowing. Yet the power of the truth to reshape China is manifest in its effect on Yang himself: &quot;I was a very conservative person growing up with a Communist education. My mind was very simple. Now, my mind is liberated. I believe China should move forward to democracy and market economy,&quot; he says. He is, says Lusby, a true patriot; his diligent and risky work is not just for his father and himself, but for his country: &quot;The Chinese people were cheated. They need real history.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Famine", "Books", "Communism", "Asia Pacific", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-01T20:30:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/03/pere-ubu-lady-shanghai-review", "sentences": ["The 17th Pere Ubu studio album, Lady from Shanghai, is accompanied by a lengthy primer on the album&apos;s conception and making, which employed a kind of musical &quot;Chinese whispers&quot;: members recorded their parts in isolation, unrehearsed but according to Thomas&apos;s quite particular and faintly perverse rules, aiming for some magical, paradoxical midpoint between the written song and pure improvisation."], "title": "Pere Ubu: Lady from Shanghai \u2013 review", "article": "It&apos;s 35 years since &quot;avant garage&quot; pioneers Pere Ubu released their debut album, The Modern Dance \u2013 one of the first and still greatest art-rock records \u2013 but bandleader David Thomas hasn&apos;t stopped messing with the settings of rock&apos;n&apos;roll since.

The atmosphere in the outlet is as chaotic and diverse as the city beyond. A moustachioed teenager tries to sell a fake Rolex to a woman with a Prada handbag. Two old men in paint-spattered khakis laugh over coffee. A toddler sticks french fries into her ice cream cone. It was with this first outlet that KFC pioneered western fast food in mainland China. Its parent company, Kentucky-based YUM! Brands \u2013 which also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell \u2013 now operates almost 4,500 outlets in the country; more than four out of five of them are KFCs. YUM! makes half its profits in China and the pace at which it is opening new outlets is still ferocious \u2013 it plans another 700 outlets there next year. McDonald&apos;s, its closest competitor, has about 2,000. Yet recent months have not been kind to KFC in China. The chain&apos;s same-store sales dropped 4% year-on-year in the past quarter; they had risen 21% in the same period last year. One day in late November, its share price dropped almost 10%. Conversations with KFC customers reveal the changing relationship between the Chinese and western fast food. &quot;This place is quick, it&apos;s convenient, it&apos;s sanitary, it&apos;s safe,&quot; said retired official Mrs Wang, 73, before biting into a spicy chicken sandwich. Huang Chong, a 26-year-old teacher, was less enthusiastic. &quot;Originally people thought KFC was great because it was from the west and really expensive,&quot; she said. &quot;But now people just think it&apos;s junk food.&quot; Many of the reasons for KFC China&apos;s recent troubles are macroeconomic \u2013 the country&apos;s GDP growth is slowing, even as labour costs and property prices rise. Yet analysts believe there are other factors at work. Chinese consumers are doing more of their shopping online, leaving once-lucrative shopping malls empty. As they grow richer, they&apos;ve begun to regard eating at KFC as less of a sign of status. They are also becoming more health-conscious. Then there was the recent &quot;45-day chicken&quot; food safety scare \u2013 an episode that laid bare the fragility of brand reputations. In late November, Chinese media accused one of the chain&apos;s Shanxi province-based suppliers of pumping its chickens full of noxious chemicals to ensure they were fully grown within 45 days. &quot;Reports claimed that the feedstuff Suhai prepared was so toxic it could even kill flies,&quot; said Xinhua, the country&apos;s official newswire. A Chinese Central Television report which aired last month accused another KFC supplier, Liuhe Group, of feeding its chickens a cocktail of illegal drugs and antibiotics. It is unclear whether or not the accusations constitute true-to-form food safety scandals, like the glowing pork, exploding watermelons and foul recycled oil that have made Chinese consumers hyperconscious about what and where they eat. KFC immediately denied the allegations about Suhai, and shortly afterwards, Shanxi provincial authorities concluded that the supplier&apos;s meat passed national standards. The chain has severed its ties with Liuhe and has agreed to &quot;actively co-operate&quot; with a government investigation into its use of antibiotics. But it was enough for social media users to take a hatchet to KFC&apos;s reputation. One called the chain Kentucky Toxic Chicken. &quot;American people don&apos;t eat it, so they take their poisonous garbage and bring it to China?! Resolutely do not eat it!&quot; wrote one user on Sina Weibo, China&apos;s most popular microblog, which has 400 million users. 85% of respondents to a Sina Weibo poll said that they believed KFC and McDonald&apos;s chicken products were unsafe. Three quarters said that they would stop eating them. &quot;There is a massive social response against fast-growing chicken,&quot; said Yifeng Mao, the head of research at Shanghai-based Goldpebble Research. He added that a KFC executive brushed off questions about the scandals at an analyst meeting in New York this month. &quot;We think KFC or YUM! \u2013 those guys in the US \u2013 underestimate the severity of the food safety thing,&quot; he said. Meanwhile, the competition KFC faces is fierce. McDonald&apos;s has promised that by 2015 it will be opening a new restaurant in China every day. Burger King has announced plans to open 1,000 outlets by the end of the decade, presenting itself as a fresher, classier alternative to McDonald&apos;s. Chargrilled burger chain Carl&apos;s Jr has started popping up in Shanghai, and Californian chain Fatburger in Beijing. &quot;When McDonald&apos;s used to come to town, in second and third-tier cities, it was a big thing, like you&apos;d arrived as a town,&quot; said Paul French, chief China market strategist at the market research firm Mintel. &quot;That probably isn&apos;t true anymore.&quot; It is not just western style chains. Dicos, a Taiwanese chain which sells cumin-flavoured chicken fries and pineapple-chicken-mayonnaise sandwiches, has more than a thousand outlets in China, most of them in small cities. Chongqing-based fried chicken and rice restaurant Country Style Cooking listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. Its shares shot up 50% in a day. At the same time a number of domestic fast-food restaurants have emulated the type of brightly lit, sanitised, plastic environment that was once the exclusive province of western brands. HeheGu, founded eight years ago in Beijing, specialises in slow-cooked pork and bamboo shoots over rice. Last year, its profits grew by 45%. Another chain, Kungfu has found remarkable success selling Chinese comfort food \u2013 meat stews, boiled lettuce and soups. An image of Bruce Lee adorns its bright red shopfronts. But YUM! Brands seems sure of its continued dominance in China. Its other powerhouse chain, Pizza Hut, will open 220 outlets in the country next year. &quot;It&apos;s part of Chinese culture to respect the elderly, and the same goes with brands,&quot; said Warren Liu, a former vice-president of YUM!&apos;s predecessor Tricon Global Restaurants and author of a 2008 book about KFC&apos;s China strategy. &quot;Being the first \u2013 the pioneer into these remote corners of China \u2013 has continued to provide KFC with a substantial competitive advantage.&quot; Liu said KFC China&apos;s success comes from its longstanding ability to adjust to the country&apos;s vagaries and idiosyncrasies. The chain immediately set itself apart in the late 1980s by hiring managers from other emerging Asian economies like Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, rather than the US. It partnered with the right state-owned enterprises and established its own distribution centres at a time when the country wasn&apos;t traversed by reliable roads. Its menu is distinctly Chinese and constantly changing. Customers can order rice congee with pickles, egg custard tarts and tree fungus salad. The chain&apos;s rice dishes (meatballs, shrimp, Hungarian-flavoured beef) are just as popular as its fried chicken. Chinese Pizza Huts are also dramatically different from their western counterparts \u2013 pricey, low-lit, spacious. They offer squid, shrimp, and pineapple pizza. They&apos;re considered a good place to take a date. Sales aside, KFC-style fast-food chains have made an indelible mark on the fabric of everyday Chinese life. Sun Hongxia, a 28-year-old nutrition products salesperson, says she visits KFC to chat with friends, read and study. When there&apos;s no KFC around, she goes to McDonald&apos;s. When there&apos;s no McDonald&apos;s, she goes to Dicos. Yet she rarely orders any food. &quot;Nobody ever bothers you here,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s just a good place to come and sit.&quot; Additional research by Chuan Xu", "tags": ["China", "Food & drink industry", "Fast food", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Business", "Chicken"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-04T16:07:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jan/04/30-best-bargain-adventure-holidays-2013", "sentences": ["A six-day tour including the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Terracotta Warriors in Xian, a tour of Shanghai, and flights from the UK, costs \u00a31,095pp in February, or \u00a31,145 in March.\u2022 0161-491 7616, jod.uk.com Caribbean cottage, Barbados BA has a series of Caribbean deals for January."], "title": "30 of the best bargain adventures in 2013", "article": "Surfing and photography, Costa Rica Taking pictures of the sea is almost as tricky as surfing.

Mead Gallery, Warwick Arts Centre, Wed to 9 Mar Robert Clark Fred Sandback, London There&apos;s a &quot;now you see it, now you don&apos;t&quot; quality to Fred Sandback&apos;s elegant sculptures, made from nothing more than string and air. The late artist pinned and pulled coloured acrylic yarn tight, to draw lines in space, slicing up galleries into series of geometric planes (imagine a three-dimensional Mondrian painting). It&apos;s a radically pared-down, razor-precise way to change our relationship with space. Of the historic works on show here, there is a huge triangle of yarn extending from the wall like the side of a pyramid, making the area of floor and wall it covers look like one flat plane. Strings turn from hot red to ice blue and plummet downwards like shafts of light falling into the void of the spiralling stairwell.

The fact that the work was censored by the Chinese authorities during the exhibition&apos;s run there last year makes its showing here all the more intriguing. Open Eye Gallery, to 17 Feb RC Michael Smith: Fountain, London Though less well known than his friends and collaborators Dan Graham or the late Mike Kelley, Michael Smith cuts a uniquely engaging figure within New York&apos;s art world. Focused on failed dreams and modern times, his absurdist skits owe as much to stand-up comedy as they do to performance art. In the past 30 years he&apos;s built an entire world around his alter-ego Mike, a charmingly optimistic figure, who is forever seeking new ways to get the good life. His latest escapade, told through photos and a video installation, sees him form a band (pictured) and visit a Florida tourist trap, The Fountain Of Youth State Archaeological Park, as he tries to hold back the march of time.

Zaha Hadid's Wangjing Soho building in Beijing. Courtesy of Zaha Hadid Architects    The issue of China and its attitude to intellectual property rights has now been reignited, following claims that a project in Beijing by Zaha Hadid is \u00adbeing replicated by &quot;pirate \u00adarchitects&quot; in Chongqing, the megacity in the south. It could even be finished \u00adbefore the original is completed next year. The British architect&apos;s globular \u00adcomplex of pebble-shaped towers \u2013 an office and retail development called Wangjing Soho \u2013 is itself something of a\u00a0copy of her recently completed Galaxy Soho, also in Beijing, and both projects are in keeping with the city&apos;s new vernacular of bulbous UFOs, kicked off in 2007 by Paul Andreu&apos;s \u00adNational Grand Theatre. Hadid intends to take legal \u00adaction, while a furious Pan Shiyi, the \u00adbillionaire chairman of the Soho empire, has vowed to &quot;bring the infringers to court&quot;. But Chongqing Meiquan, the developer behind the \u00adbuilding, claims innocence, insisting at a press \u00adconference that the project was \u00adinspired not by Hadid&apos;s curves but &quot;by the cobblestones on the bank of the Yangtze river by which Chongqing was built&quot;. It also launched an advertising slogan in response to the furore: &quot;Never meant to copy, only want to surpass.&quot;     The real deal ... Hallstatt in Austria. Photograph: Robert Harding World Imagery/A/Alamy    This catchphrase could be the \u00admanifesto for modern urban China. From pirated DVDs to knock-off designer brands, the country has a thriving counterfeit culture, often facilitated by local protectionism and a \u00adreluctance on the part of the authorities to \u00adenforce fledgling intellectual property laws. Moreover, there are no specific laws protecting architecture, due to its \u00adslippery definition as a work of applied art \u2013 with functional and \u00adartistic qualities, in which only the \u00adlatter is protected. This overlooks the fact that the two can rarely be \u00adseparated: a facade could be an integral part of a building&apos;s structure, as well as providing its main artistic thrust. So China, like a global architectural \u00admagpie, helps itself to the biggest and best bits of cities the world over. &quot;Soho could have a good chance of winning litigation,&quot; You Yunting, a Shanghai-based lawyer specialising in intellectual property, told German newspaper Der Spiegel. &quot;But even if the judge rules in favour of Soho, the court will not force the defendant to pull the building down.

Photograph: CAIP/Blogspot    Archaeologist Jack Carlson, writing in Foreign Policy magazine, argues that the wholesale copying of architectural culture may have its roots in something much bigger than shameless commercial borrowing: &quot;The ancient parallels for these copycat projects \u00adsuggest that they are not mere follies, but monumental assertions of China&apos;s global primacy.&quot; He cites ancient \u00adChina&apos;s premier historian, Sima Qian, who recorded a remarkable building programme pursued by China&apos;s first ruling dynasty, the Qin: &quot;Whenever Qin conquered one of its rivals, it would commission replicas of its \u00adpalaces and halls and reconstruct them on the slope north of the capital. From Yongmen all the way to the Jing and Wei rivers, there were replica palaces, passages, and walled pavilions.&quot;     Le Corbusier's Chapelle de Notre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp, France. Photograph: Alamy    If this clone culture does represent a kind of triumphalism \u2013 a way for China to show it has equalled, and perhaps even transcended, the west&apos;s achievements \u2013 should we be worried? &quot;Architecture&apos;s whole history is full of people copying each other,&quot; says Sam Jacob of Fat Architecture, whose Museum of Copying was a highlight of last year&apos;s Venice Biennale; it featured a re-make of Palladio&apos;s Villa Rotunda in spray-foam and plaster. &quot;It used to be thought of as a good thing. Copying antiquity is what you were supposed to do, and new things emerged.&quot; More recently, he says, Mies van der Rohe&apos;s reputation boomed precisely because of his ability to be copied. &quot;That was a big part of his power and success \u2013 he could replicate himself, but other people could also replicate him easily.&quot; Jacob adds that if you look at early buildings by the architectural giant SOM (Skidmore, Owings and \u00adMerrill), they are indistinguishable from Mies; so much so, in fact, that Frank Lloyd Wright nicknamed the trio The Three Blind Mies. Zaha Hadid&apos;s initial reaction to the doppelganger was surprisingly \u00adgenerous: if future generations of these cloned buildings display \u00adinnovative \u00admutations, she said, &quot;that could be quite exciting&quot;. But at the weekend practice director Nigel Calvert said: &quot;We will be demanding that the \u00adcopycats immediately cease construction, change the exterior of the \u00adbuilding, offer a public apology and provide compensation.&quot; Hadid added: &quot;It is fine to take from the same well \u2013 but not from the same bucket.&quot;", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "China", "Intellectual property", "Law", "Zaha Hadid", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-07T18:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/09/boeing-dreamliner-fire-fuel-leak", "sentences": ["A similar engine failed on a Boeing 747 in Shanghai in September."], "title": "Boeing Dreamliner 787 fire and fuel leak add to safety concerns", "article": "Two Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes have been the subject of safety scares within two days at Boston airport in the US, adding to concerns about the aircraft. On Monday, an electrical fire erupted on one of Boeing&apos;s 787 Dreamliners operated by Japan Airlines at Boston Logan international airport. Authorities said a battery in the auxiliary power unit aboard the plane jet had suffered &quot;severe fire damage&quot;.  On Tuesday at the same airport, a fuel leak forced a different 787 operated by JAL to cancel takeoff. Massachusetts Port Authority spokesman Richard Walsh said the plane was towed back to the gate after about 150 litres (40 gallons) of fuel spilled. He said the plane had 178 passengers and 11 crew members on board. Walsh said the plane was evaluated and departed that afternoon. A JAL spokeswoman said the crew had reported a &quot;mechanical issue&quot;. The two incidents have extended a series of problems that have dogged the jet for more than a month and increased concern about the plane.  The fire broke out on an empty Dreamliner jet parked at a gate in Boston. Officials said a battery in the auxiliary power system exploded around 10.30am, shortly after passengers had disembarked. A mechanic inspecting the jet discovered smoke while performing a routine post-flight inspection. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are looking into what caused the problem, which came within weeks of Boeing enduring a string of other electrical problems that briefly grounded three of the planes. The new jet also has suffered an engine failure and fuel leaks in the 14 months it has been in service.  The electrical fire is troubling in part because the 787 relies heavily on electrical power to drive onboard systems that in other jet models are run by air pressure generated by the engines. The new jet also suffered an electrical fire during a test flight, prompting a redesign of electrical systems.  Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said on Monday: &quot;We are aware of the event and are working with our customer.&quot; The Dreamliner is Boeing&apos;s first jet to be made of carbon composites rather than aluminium, a change that reduces the plane&apos;s weight and allows it to use less fuel.  Since entering service in October 2011 the plane has repeatedly made headlines for mechanical problems. In July 2012, the FAA investigated an incident in which a 787 engine made by General Electric Co blew apart on the ground in South Carolina, prompting changes in how the engines are made, maintained and inspected. A similar engine failed on a Boeing 747 in Shanghai in September. The Dreamliner&apos;s run of electrical mishaps began on 4 December 2012 when a United Airlines flight from Houston to Newark, New Jersey, made an emergency landing after it appeared that one of its power generators failed. United later said an electrical panel was at fault. On 13 December Qatar Airways said it had grounded one of its three 787 jets because of the same problem. On 17 December, United said a second 787 in its fleet had developed electrical issues. Also in December, the FAA ordered inspections of 787s after fuel leaks were found on two aircraft operated by foreign airlines. The leaks stemmed from incorrectly assembled fuel line couplings, which could result in loss of power or engine fire, the FAA said.  In late December, the Boeing chief executive, Jim McNerney, said the 787 had not experienced an unusual number of problems for a new aircraft, calling the problems &quot;normal squawks&quot;. The jet was plagued by production problems that delayed its initial delivery by three and a half years. Boeing has nearly 800 unfilled orders for the plane and is ramping up production from five a month to 10 a month this year. JAL has ordered a total of 45 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, including seven it is already operating. Morito Takeda, a JAL spokesman, said six of those seven aircraft were flying as usual. The seventh remained at Boston Logan airport.  All Nippon Airways, which has placed orders for 66 Dreamliner aircraft including 17 that are already operating, also had no plans to change its orders, said spokesman Etsuya Uchiyama. Japan&apos;s transport ministry has ordered inspections of batteries made by Yuasa for the auxiliary power unit. JAL inspected six of the units and found no problems. Shares of the batteries&apos; maker, Japan&apos;s GS Yuasa Corp, fell sharply for a second day on Wednesday after the fire.", "tags": ["Boeing", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "Boston", "Massachusetts", "US news", "World news", "Business", "Boston Logan international airport"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-09T06:37:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/09/delhi-mumbai-urban-heat-islands-india", "sentences": ["A study of 30 years&apos; weather records by the Shanghai Urban Environmental Meteorology Centre shows that warming differs according to the degree of urbanisation, and that many more people die from extreme heat in built-up areas than in areas surrounding a city."], "title": "How urban heat islands are making India hotter | John Vidal and Samarth Pathak", "article": "It is bitterly cold in Delhi. A bone-chilling wind has left temperatures below 3C (37F), the lowest since records began in 1969, and at least 100 homeless people are said to have died. But temperatures in the mega-city that is now home to an estimated 18 million people can be expected to rise to a sizzling 46C if there is a heatwave in May, and the city is often unbearably hot by the time the monsoon arrives at the end of June. Now, Indian government-backed research shows that both Delhi and India&apos;s biggest city, Mumbai, are becoming &quot;urban heat islands&quot;, with significantly different climates to their surrounding rural areas. Preliminary findings from the Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) show that temperatures in both cities have risen 2C-3C in only 15 years. The ongoing study, based on Nasa satellite readings, also shows the cities to be 5C-7C warmer than in the surrounding rural areas on summer nights. The phenomenon of urban heat islands is recognised as a direct consequence of urbanisation. Like many other cities in developing countries, Delhi and Mumbai have more than doubled in size and population in the past 25 years as rural migrants have flooded in. But artificial urban surfaces such as concrete and asphalt act as a giant reservoir of heat, absorbing it in the day and releasing it at night. Pollutants from nose-to-tail traffic add to the heat and, in a vicious cycle, people turn to air conditioning, which pumps out yet more heat and pollutants, so increasing climate-changing emissions, which lead to warmer global conditions. &quot;Incessant urbanisation increases land surface temperatures and, over time, the city ends up as an island of heat. Delhi, Mumbai and their residents have been facing this onslaught [of heat] for 20 years. It may eventually result in unprecedented repercussions such as heatwaves, health impacts, human discomfort and increased mortality among the elderly,&quot; Teri researcher Richa Sharma says. Scientists expect urban heatwaves to increase in both frequency and intensity as cities in developing countries grow. A study of 30 years&apos; weather records by the Shanghai Urban Environmental Meteorology Centre shows that warming differs according to the degree of urbanisation, and that many more people die from extreme heat in built-up areas than in areas surrounding a city. &quot;The [urban heat island] effects are directly related to and worsened by climate change, where it is expected that an increase in the average temperature will have a stronger effect on the health of people living in cities, and particularly of the vulnerable groups like the sick and elderly,&quot; Sharma says. Cities in the US have found that the heat-island effect can be counteracted slightly by using white or reflective materials to build houses, roofs, pavements and roads. Cool roofs can reflect around 75% of the sun&apos;s rays; pale-coloured concrete reflects up to 50% more light than asphalt. But the best way to make cities liveable is to contain sprawl and increase the amount of vegetation. &quot;Building water-retentive pavements and installing reflective roofs can be adopted to combat surface heat. Above all, the need of the hour is to control urban sprawl and put in place stringent policies for sustainable urbanisation,&quot; Sharma says. Large cities are being found to have surprising impacts on surrounding areas. The extra heat they can generate can induce showers and even thunderstorms, and Nasa satellite studies show major rainfall increases downwind of cities.", "tags": ["Cities and development", "Global development", "Urbanisation", "India", "World news", "Environment", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-09T07:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/10/china-censorship-souther-weekly-reappears", "sentences": ["The new edition was available in Beijing and Shanghai early on Thursday morning, but only hit newsstands in its home city of Guangzhou after a brief, unexplained delay.", "Although Southern Weekly staff intended to include an editorial celebrating the 30th anniversary of the paper&apos;s founding, it was ultimately axed by propaganda authorities, according to an online post by the director of features at a sister publication in Shanghai.", "Two sections of Thursday&apos;s paper were also missing from copies in Shanghai, reported the South China Morning Post."], "title": "China's Southern Weekly newspaper reappears after censorship standoff", "article": "The Chinese newspaper Southern Weekly hit news-stands as scheduled on Thursday after a week-long confrontation with propaganda authorities that spiralled into a rare public backlash against press censorship. But a reported deal between the newspaper&apos;s staff and its Communist party overseers has been followed by a fresh clampdown on dissent. Authorities have tampered with the paper&apos;s latest edition, forcibly dispersed anti-censorship protests, scrubbed references to the controversy from the internet and detained more than a dozen activists for expressing solidarity with the newspaper. The new edition was available in Beijing and Shanghai early on Thursday morning, but only hit newsstands in its home city of Guangzhou after a brief, unexplained delay. Its front page carried a story about a fire in an orphanage. Although Southern Weekly staff intended to include an editorial celebrating the 30th anniversary of the paper&apos;s founding, it was ultimately axed by propaganda authorities, according to an online post by the director of features at a sister publication in Shanghai. Zuo Zhijian wrote that the commemorative editorial&apos;s first draft was heavily self-censored and that even a second draft containing some Communist rhetoric was eventually dropped. Two sections of Thursday&apos;s paper were also missing from copies in Shanghai, reported the South China Morning Post. One contained an article about land reclamations and the other touched on political reform. &quot;Just like media people from other countries, we want more freedom of speech, of course,&quot; said a Southern Weekly employee who requested anonymity because he had been instructed not to speak to foreign journalists. He added that the paper had resumed its normal daily operations. &quot;Everything looks normal, and I don&apos;t feel any changes,&quot; he said. Southern Weekly has found support from similarly outspoken publications. Dai Zigeng, the publisher of the highly respected Beijing News, verbally resigned on Tuesday after defying official mandates to publish a government-penned editorial downplaying the controversy. Beijing propaganda authorities have yet to approve his resignation. Police forcibly dispersed a small group of protesters outside the paper&apos;s Guangzhou headquarters on Thursday with videos showing plainclothes officers bundling demonstrators into vans. More than a dozen people in various cities have been detained for their outspoken support of the paper. Many were interrogated and then released. &quot;They said we were creating social chaos,&quot; Ren Weiren, an anti-censorship demonstrator in Hangzhou, told the South China Morning Post. &quot;They said if I do anything similar again, they will lock me up.&quot; There have been protests in Guangzhou since the paper fiercely admonished provincial propaganda officials for interfering with a front-page pro-reform editorial several days ago. Supporters donned masks, covered themselves in Southern Weekly papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, and held signs calling for freedom of expression and democracy, according to pictures posted online. While the demonstrations began with a small group of students and activists, they quickly gained momentum and attracted a group of virulent Maoist counter-protesters. Many of them waved Chinese flags. One held a placard saying &quot;angrily denounce the traitor media&quot;. Internet users continue to express support for Southern Weekly using a broad range of cryptic references and euphemisms, a common method of evading internet censors, who have blocked the paper&apos;s name on popular social media websites. One popular term for the paper online is &quot;Southern Porridge&quot; (&quot;porridge&quot; and &quot;week&quot; are homophones in Chinese). The beleaguered Beijing News expressed its support for Southern Weekly on Wednesday by publishing an elaborate paean to the food. &quot;Just placed upon the table, the porridge writhes still with heat.

For most 20-year-olds, the prospect of confronting the finest player in the history of the game on such a stage of their home tournament would turn legs to jelly and words to gibberish \u2013 but not Tomic. Could he possibly beat the great man, he was asked on Sunday? &quot;If he gets that far,&quot; was his instant response, a clear reference to Federer&apos;s answer when asked about Tomic the night before: &quot;He has to get there first.&quot; So, what was initially an intriguing prospect had in the space of a quote become an event to savour: a shootout between players separated by nearly a dozen years, 17 grand slam titles and 41 ranking places. To get there Tomic has to beat the Argentinian Leonardo Mayer and the 29th-seeded Slovakian Martin Klizan, opposition not even as strong as he defeated to win his first ATP Tour title in Sydney on Saturday, so his part of the contract is doable. It is inconceivable, on the other hand, that Federer will lose to either of the 46th-ranked Beno\u00eet Paire or Nikolay Davydenko, whom he has beaten 17 times in 19 matches. Yet, just getting here has been a monumental victory for Tomic. Eighteen months ago the volatile Queensland teenager had the tennis world in the palm of his strong, right hand. He had taken a set off Novak Djokovic in the fourth round at Wimbledon, the youngest player to go that deep in the tournament since Boris Becker. One-time rebel John McEnroe recognised a fellow-traveller and predicted great things for Tomic. In the months that followed, however, his tennis fell to pieces, along with bits of his private life. A very public relationship with the model Donay Meijer lasted three months. When he returned to Wimbledon, his fellow prodigy, David Goffin, put him out in the first round (he would go home at the earliest opportunity eight more times) and he was booed off the court. At the 2012 US Open Tomic bridled when McEnroe accused him of tanking in the 22-minute third set against Andy Roddick, and his performance in losing 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 to the American in the second round was not exactly a life-and-death effort. The wicked and hilarious nom de tennis, &quot;Tomic the Tank Engine&quot;, would take some shedding. Given the opportunity to reply, Tomic turned on the Australian journalist Will Swanton and said with menace: &quot;I&apos;ll remember you.&quot; Tomic&apos;s defence was that he felt &quot;very strange&quot; playing in front of such a large and loud audience against the home crowd&apos;s soon-to-retire hero. The following month Tomic bizarrely admitted to giving &quot;85%&quot; when losing tamely to Florian Mayer in the first round of the Shanghai Masters. It looked as if he had slipped into the don&apos;t-care days of 2009, when he was fined for walking off court during a match against his fellow Australian Marinko Matosevic in Perth. It would get worse. Raging against the world as his sublime touch tennis deserted him, he was in serious danger of being washed up before his 20th birthday \u2013 which he reportedly celebrated with a two-day bender in October, not long after the Shanghai debacle. There was an infamous YouTubed brawl with a man in a swimming pool on the balcony of his Gold Coast apartment to go with a run-in with police over a traffic violation. Australia&apos;s Davis Cup captain, Pat Rafter, ran out of patience and in November phoned Tomic to tell him he was dropped from the team for the upcoming tie against Chinese Taipei. The player responded by making himself unavailable for the subsequent match, next September. Suspicions grew that he was idling away a special talent but on the back of a sensational start to 2013 sentiment swung back his way. Swanton, with good grace, put it succinctly in the local vernacular: &quot;Tomic is being punished in 2013 for being a pork chop in 2012. It&apos;s an error that can still be rectified.&quot; On Sunday Tomic softened his view: &quot;I had my ups at the start of 2012, in January, but then I had my downs. I&apos;ll learn from my downs. Lucky I learnt at my age, 20, not 25 and 28. I&apos;m learning now.

In addition, the Chinese subtitles have changed the meaning of dialogue between Bond and bar hostess S\u00e9v\u00e9rine (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe) in a Macau casino, removing a reference to her becoming a prostitute at a young age. Re-editing of imported films is not uncommon in China, where scenes deemed offensive were removed from the likes of Men in Black 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&apos;s End. Perhaps more problematic, however, are attempts by the authorities to protect homegrown films from Hollywood competition by delaying releases. Skyfall, which has so far taken $1.03bn at the global box office, was originally scheduled to come out in China last November, but was pushed back to 2013 to allow two state-backed historical epics, Back to 1942 and The Last Supper, a clear run at Chinese audiences. Skyfall&apos;s travails come despite a relaxation of the strict quota system for US films enforced in Chinese cinemas, agreed after high-level negotiations between the two countries last year. The US had accused China of not complying with its obligations under World Trade Organisation agreements by preventing access to the $2bn-plus Chinese box office. However, in February 2012 \u2013 following talks between US vice-president Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart at the time \u2013 a deal was struck allowing more 3D and large-format films into the country.", "tags": ["James Bond", "Thriller", "Film", "Culture", "China", "Film industry", "Skyfall"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-17T13:16:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jan/18/bernard-tomic-roger-federer-australian-open", "sentences": ["The misdemeanours we know: accused of tanking at the US Open, virtually admitting it in Shanghai, with an &quot;85%&quot; losing effort, brawling in his penthouse pool (made famous on YouTube), driving his car too fast, snapping at a journalist only trying to help dig him out of a hole."], "title": "Bernard Tomic faces Roger Federer determined to seize the day | Kevin Mitchell", "article": "Bernard Tomic is not the most articulate of athletes. He stumbles over his words and thoughts as if rushing to save a drop shot with a feather duster, reaching to rescue a lost cause with the best he has got. But the past few days Tomic has got his head around life. He is 20 now \u2013 famously celebrating the date last October with accepted Australian overstatement on a bender that is said to have lasted two days \u2013 and starting to wonder why people keep looking at him. He has worked out that they look because they expect. They want him to win something, preferably a big shiny grand slam tennis trophy but, if that is beyond him for now, perhaps beat a legend or two, starting with Roger Federer in the third round of the Australian Open in the Rod Laver Arena on Saturday night. To get this mind-set it is important to understand that performing sporting miracles is part of the Australian psyche. On Friday Australia were bowled out for 74 in their one-day cricket match against Sri Lanka in Brisbane but it did not plunge the nation into despond as it might have done in any other country similarly embarrassed \u2013 England, say. Instead the former Australia Test batsman Damien Martyn tweeted the following sentiment: &quot;Come on Australia, this would be a great win.&quot; They took six wickets in losing and not many would have bet against them. So Tomic has the ingrained national DNA of irrational optimism to call on. It expressed itself with brash force after he had beaten Daniel Brands in the second round, making headlines around Australia and beyond as he gave the German big hitter nary a glance and looked instead to bigger game in Federer: &quot;What a match it is, you know, 10 out of 10 now with matches. I feel so confident. This is the perfect time to play him.&quot; As noted, it was not Shakespeare but the intent was clear. He had seen off Brands, he had secured his 10th win in a row \u2013 including one against Novak Djokovic in the Hopman Cup \u2013 and he figured there could hardly be a better opportunity to beat the finest player of modern times. Tomic&apos;s declaration of intent will go down as one of towering hubris or the opening sentence of a new chapter in the history of tennis. He probably is not bothered. The hallmark of his game is its seeming weakness, a relaxed, almost liquid look, where he caresses the ball with such subtlety it flies from his strings as if on some mild drug. When Federer handled Tomic with ease in the fourth round last year, it was clearly not the perfect time for the Australian to be testing his precocious talent against the Swiss but much has happened since, some of it encouraging, much of it not quite so good. The misdemeanours we know: accused of tanking at the US Open, virtually admitting it in Shanghai, with an &quot;85%&quot; losing effort, brawling in his penthouse pool (made famous on YouTube), driving his car too fast, snapping at a journalist only trying to help dig him out of a hole. Tomic was turning into quite a brat but his tennis grew by the week. In a way it does not matter if Tomic beats Federer. The odds are he will not \u2013 they are as long as 9-2, with the Swiss 1-8 \u2013 but any young gun who has the self-belief to think he can is worth listening to. Listen to his swagger: &quot;I saw the stats as I was walking out [after Brands]. It was 23 to 26 aces my way. That&apos;s probably the best I&apos;ve ever served. I didn&apos;t get broken at all, not even in the first round. The last break of serve was in the quarters against [Jarkko] Nieminen in Sydney. I think I just got broken once there. &quot;If I keep it close in the first set [against Federer], manage to win that first set, then it can be a different story. Being one set to love up is a huge advantage against him. If he frees up and wins that first set, it&apos;s different. &quot;That was the second time I played Roger [last year]. He did play pretty well that day. I think I lost 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. I had my chance, got it to 4-all. I think I lost that service game. From there I couldn&apos;t get back into the match. I don&apos;t want to speak too soon but I have my tactics. &quot;I&apos;m serving the best I&apos;ve ever been. I&apos;m finally using the best of my height. It&apos;s important to have a good serve at 6ft 4in, 6ft 5in. I had a few flaws in my game and I improved that. I improved my serve a lot and my fitness. Time flies, I learnt that last year. All of a sudden I was 19, now I&apos;m 20. Before last year I didn&apos;t really have the urge to improve. I was doing well. I mean, I got to 27 in the world. But I started not training as much, not doing the right things, not committing, not focusing on the tennis court. Slowly I was sliding down. &quot;Winning last week and being on this winning streak doesn&apos;t satisfy me. I want to win grand slams. This is a chance and I&apos;m going to take it. After I turned 20, I was, like, I could have been much better than this. I&apos;m not going to waste them any more. I&apos;m going to try to win.&quot; Listen to the kid.

The title, meanwhile, derives from a\u00a0pamphlet by the bookseller Alexander Cruden (1699-1770) protesting against unfair treatment of patients in the capital&apos;s lunatic asylums. The piece itself is a postmodern tour\u00a0through the city&apos;s soundscapes, past and present, complete with multiple allusions to Elgar&apos;s Cockaigne Overture, 1940s big-band music, and the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons, which\u00a0frequently underpins its course\u00a0like an ostinato. Its principal virtue is its gaudy, virtuosic scoring, and its principal flaw a sense of overload, not quite redeemed by the ending, in\u00a0which the textures gradually thin towards a haunting flugelhorn solo. That less can sometimes be more was brought home by the London premiere of one of its companion pieces, Reflet d&apos;un Temps Disparu, by Qigang Chen, Shanghai-born, now resident in Paris and a pupil of Messiaen. The Proustian title hides a\u00a0one-movement cello concerto, essentially in variation form, though the\u00a0theme, a 15th-century Chinese melody, is placed at the work&apos;s midpoint\u00a0and seems to coalesce from the surrounding\u00a0variations before being\u00a0subsumed back into them.

The cavernous interior of the massive Expo Mart in Shanghai \u2013 the former African Pavilion of the World Expo \u2013 echoed with thundering beats as a troop of silken-clad percussionists hammered away at giant drums. A packed crowd of thousands roared with delight as two massive LED screens flanking a huge, red-carpeted stage, flickered to life and became emblazoned with a familiar logo: &quot;Starcraft II: The Wings Of Liberty&quot;. With the pomp and ceremony of a Kung Fu tournament from a Bruce Lee movie, the Battle.net Global Championship Finals of Starcraft commenced. Yes, this ornate preamble heralded the start of a videogame tournament. Over a weekend last November Battle.net would hold its e-sports Championship final in which elite players from all over the world competed for prize money amounting to more than $500,000 (\u00a3315,000) \u2013 contestants received $2,000 just for making it this far and the eventual winner walked away $100,000 richer. Depending on how steeped one is in gaming culture, an event like the Battle.net Global final can come across as more than a little bizarre. Here, individuals who plough insane amounts of time into improving their prowess at a videogame are mobbed like they&apos;re celebrities. Each time the tournament announcers read their names out over the PA, the crowd in attendance roared appreciatively \u2013 reserving their loudest screams for the lone Chinese participant in the contest, Hui Shenn (or Comm, to use his Battle.net handle). When the contestants were assembled at the start of the tournament, they were all accompanied by a beaming, uniform-clad woman carrying the flag of each of their native countries. It was like the Olympic Games for nerds. To add to the outlandishness of an event where obsessive gamers are treated like rockstars, the game at the centre of it pits hillbilly space cowboys against stoic philosophical aliens and feral xenomorphs. Starcraft II is a real time strategy game in which players control one of three distinctly different races \u2013 Terrans (humans), Protoss and Zerg \u2013 but it&apos;s shot through with the story of a Space Western on the frontiers of the universe.     Battlenet2 Photograph: Nick Cowen    Starcraft and South Korea The original Starcraft was a huge success for the company that created it, Blizzard, when it was released back in 1997; what the California-based developer could never have predicted is that it would become outrageously popular in South Korea \u2013 so popular, in fact, it became a professional sport. It&apos;s a question that still, to some extent, puzzles Blizzard&apos;s CEO Mike Morhaime, whose face creases into a wry smile when I ask him how a Space Western became a televised sport in the Far East. &quot;It was kind of a perfect storm,&quot; he says. &quot;First of all, the timing of our release of Starcraft was perfect in South Korea. The country was just coming out of a recession and PC Bangs \u2013 what they call internet game rooms \u2013 were popping up all over South Korea because people wanted to play Starcraft.&quot; &quot;The game took off,&quot; he says, &quot;and that in turn, combined with the emergence from a recession, made it necessary for the country&apos;s online infrastructure to get better. The game fed into that and vice versa.&quot; Wait a minute: Starcraft influenced the growth of South Korea&apos;s infrastructure? &quot;The game is very competitive and it struck a huge chord in Korea,&quot; he says. &quot;It really appealed to the Korean gamers. They were really into the competition side of it \u2013 the prestige, the ladder rankings. It became the &apos;thing&apos; used to settle rivalries at schools because everybody knew who the best Starcraft players were \u2013 they were all on the leaderboards. &quot;It became a social thing, is what I heard; if you had a disagreement with someone, it was like &apos;I&apos;ll see you later at the PC Bang and we&apos;ll settle this!&apos;&quot; The popularity of Starcraft swiftly led to the rise of local and then national gaming tournaments. From there, it was only a short time before Starcraft tournaments were being televised. &quot;I think at one point there were three television channels showing Starcraft tournaments in South Korea,&quot; says Morhaime. &quot;We were so unprepared for its success. To give you an idea of how unprepared we were, consider this: Starcraft was never designed to support multi-byte languages. In order to support more complicated languages like Korean or Chinese, you need two bytes of storage and Starcraft only had one byte.&quot; Morhaime laughs, as if his recollection brings Blizzard&apos;s initial incredulity at the whole situation flooding back. &quot;We never localised the game in Korean,&quot; he says. &quot;To this day Starcraft \u2013 even Brood Wars [the Starcraft expansion pack] \u2013 is only in English.&quot;     Battlenet3 Photograph: Nick Cowen    Rise of e-sports Starcraft wasn&apos;t the first videogame to be played as a sport, but it&apos;s arguably done more to popularise e-sports than any other game. The demand for tournaments has risen incrementally ever since Starcraft \u2013 and Doom and Quake \u2013 ruled the roost in the mid-to-late 90s. In the years since, its popularity has ballooned; recently, Valve&apos;s Dota 2 tournament final raked in half a million viewers, while Riot Games stated that viewing figures for their League of Legends Tournament reached upwards of 8 million. The Battle.net Global Championships, which alongside the world Starcraft II finals included the World of Warcraft arena finals, was watched by millions of people online and thousands of fans in attendance at the convention centre. The fans themselves are a passionate bunch \u2013 as one would expect from folk prepared to travel large distances to sit in front of huge screens showing a game played out between two PC wonks in booths on a massive stage. They burst into rapturous applause whenever one player gained the upper hand, drowning out the sound of the live play-by-play being doled out by the tournament announcers. I made the mistake of dithering while finding a seat and one fan made known their displeasure at having their view of the action momentarily blocked by hurling a bottle of water at my head. This enthusiasm was also evident among the local press. When one of the tournament contestants, Manuel Schenkuizen (Grubby, to his fans), sauntered into the press area, he was illuminated by photo flashes for about five minutes. Then the local photographers all took turns handing each other their cameras and having their photo snapped with him. To hear Morhaime tell it, running an event like this is a logistical nightmare. &quot;This is a very complex event to put on,&quot; he says. &quot;I mean, think of the scale we&apos;re working at out here in China; you&apos;ve got a ton of people who have had to co-ordinate their schedules to be here, we&apos;ve got live broadcasters in multiple languages, we&apos;re on TV in several different countries \u2013 China and Korea \u2026&quot; He trails off and then smiles. &quot;It&apos;s \u2026 big,&quot; he says finally. All this palaver naturally means that e-sports are a huge part of Blizzard&apos;s future, both as a games developer and an event runner. &quot;One of the design goals for Starcraft 2 was to factor in better features that would make a better viewing experience for e-sports,&quot; says Morhaime. &quot;At the foundation level, the core balance of the game is critical and we&apos;re constantly looking at improving and iterating balance \u2013 especially with Heart of the Swarm (the game&apos;s new expansion pack) on the horizon.&quot; [There are some units] in Wings Of Liberty, which is in closed beta right now, in the single-player tech tree, which don&apos;t appear in the multiplayer,&quot; he says. &quot;That gave us a lot more flexibility to create cool new stuff for the single-player campaign without worrying that we were upsetting the delicate balance in the multiplayer.&quot; &quot;With Starcraft 2, e-sports is something that&apos;s foremost in the mind,&quot; he says. &quot;More so than World of Warcraft. With WoW, it never was the primary goal \u2013 that&apos;s to provide a good PVE and PVP [Player v Environment and Player v Player] experience and we felt the arenas were challenging enough to inspire people to play at a higher level.&quot;     Battlenet4 Photograph: Nick Cowen    Gamers&apos; gripes That having been said, one of the general complaints that I picked up at the finals in Shanghai \u2013 and one that has been bubbling away in the SC2 community for some time now \u2013 is that the scope of versatility within the different races in Starcraft 2 has been stagnating recently. Apparently, players have begun to gripe that the three races in the game offer a finite number of opening gambits and the elite competitors are those who can correctly spot these and react to them the quickest. It&apos;s a problem Morhaime says that Blizzard is certainly aware of. &quot;What we want to do is give players more viable options,&quot; he says, &quot;which increases the strategic depth of the game. What&apos;s really interesting is when you see players using tactics or combinations of units that we&apos;d never even thought of. That happens every year. &quot; While this may be the case, the action moved a bit too fast for my untrained eyes to pick up any subtle nuances on the tactical side of things. After a weekend of watching the SC2 elite hammer away at each other, I can&apos;t claim to be any the wiser on the subject of Starcraft 2, although I can report the eventual winner, 18-year-old Won Lee-Sak (PartinG) defeated fellow South Korean Hyun Woo-Jang (Creator) quite comprehensively four games to two, and walked away with a $100,000 for his efforts. There was also a little drama when South Korean Yoon-Jong Jung (Rain), who came third, announced his retirement from e-sports at the ripe old age of 18, saying he felt he was no longer capable of making the grade in this type of competition. Then it was all over bar the shouting and fireworks.

We are prepared to talk about British wishes, but we have to always keep in mind that other countries have different wishes and we have to find a fair compromise. We will talk intensively with Britain about its individual ideas, but there will be time for that over the months to come. German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle  Not everything has to be decided in Brussels and by Brussels, but a politics of cherry-picking will simply not work. Europe is not a sum of national interests but a community of fate in difficult times. EU parliamentary president, Martin Schulz, German Social Democrat  It is the very same people who are overridingly responsible for the delays in Europe who are pointing the finger at Europe. Cameron&apos;s Europe \u00e0 la carte is not an option. We have to focus on jobs and growth rather than getting lost in treaty discussions. Laurent Fabius, French foreign minister It could be dangerous for the UK itself, because the UK outside Europe? Difficult. The other day I was at a meeting with lots of British people, in particular businessmen, and I told them that if the UK decides to leave Europe we will roll out the red carpet [to attract them]. We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe \u2026 but you can&apos;t do Europe \u00e0 la carte. I&apos;ll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let&apos;s imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you&apos;re in it you can&apos;t say: &apos;Let&apos;s play rugby&apos;. Gunther Krichbaum, head of the German Bundestag European affairs committee Cameron said that he wants Britain to shape the future. How can you shape the future if you put the car in reverse while other regions of the world are on the fast lane? In a changing world, voices from Europe will only be heard if we join forces. As the African saying goes: if you want to travel fast, go alone. If you want to travel far, go together. I&apos;m a bit surprised that Great Britain wants to renegotiate the rules. Britain is not a new member state, it did not just join the European Union. It had a say in negotiating all the rules and treaties. If we opened that Pandora&apos;s box, all the pulling and hauling would start again and we would probably end up in the same spot. By announcing a referendum for 2017 today, Cameron risks paralysing the European Union for years. But Great Britain needs a European Union and especially a functioning single market. French newspaper Le Monde  David Cameron has turned a deaf ear to those in his own country as well as abroad who warned he should be wary of such a move away [from Europe]. His partners at the heart of the European Union are reticent or hostile about the perspective of a &apos;Europe \u00e0 la carte&apos;. President Barack Obama is for the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union and the Liberal Democrats at the heart of the British government remain resolutely Europhile. French financial newspaper La Tribune David Cameron&apos;s speech is perhaps the first stone in a new alliance with Germany to redesign the European architecture. [The paper said analysts were focusing on the referendum, but it believed the speech went much further.] David Cameron is saying that he wants to redesign the future of Europe and for that he needs the support of Germany. What we are seeing is the first stone perhaps in an entente cordiale between London and Berlin. Prof G Parthasarathy, former Indian diplomat Britain has the dilemma of which way to look, to Washington or to Europe, and this is a continuation of that. Europe gets stuck in internal issues and that does have an effect on our [India&apos;s] economic co-operation. Ashok Singh, analyst at Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation India is quite happy to engage with individual European states so Britain&apos;s continued participation in the EU is not really a priority. As for competition from Europe, when it happens it will happen but right now what really matters is competition from China. Gary Liu, professor at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai The European market means a big opportunity for China. And if the UK really exits the European Union, this will create some uncertainties for Chinese business leaders. Withdrawal could create actual cost for Chinese people doing business in Europe. Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing We all know that Great Britain is a special ally of the United States, and Great Britain is also a very important country in the European Union. But if you abandon [the latter] identity, you will only have one identity in Chinese eyes. Rachida Dati, former justice minister in Sarkozy&apos;s right-of-centre administration We should salute his foresight which is in contrast with the ostrich politics practised by certain European leaders and even the presidency of the European commission. But as the British prime minister also said, the interest of everyone, including the British, is to remain in the European Union. David Cameron has rightly identified the three challenges Europe must address: to resolve the eurozone difficulties, to kick-start the competitivity of our economies and to cross the gulf that exists today between the citizens of the European Union and their leaders. To overcome these three challenges needs, it is true, a new dynamic, a new push. But this will happen through the emergence of a strong and political Europe. We cannot just be satisfied with a single market or a two-speed Europe; that would be to construct a weak Europe, and that is against the interest of all European citizens. This new approach must take into account more the hopes of European citizens. The disconnection between Brussels and the European peoples is a growing reality, against which we must fight more openly. I respect the decision of the prime minister to give the British people a choice on the future of the United Kingdom at the heart of the [European] Union. I hope between now and then, Europe will do its best to convince a large majority of Britons to vote with confidence for their country to stay in the European Union. The solution is a Europe strong and willing, which will give us weight, politically and economically, on the international scene, without constraining our national sovereignty at the same time; a Europe that is built not in spite of the people, but by the people themselves. We are still far from this, and that&apos;s the whole problem. David Cameron&apos;s speech was right to clearly set the terms for the debate necessary for the future of Europe. I want to believe in his sincerity when he says the United Kingdom should stay in a Europe, a Europe that is more attentive to its people. Veja, influential magazine in Brazil This step by the UK generates concern in the international market because it could create uncertainty about the economic future of Europe and lead to a decrease in foreign investment even as countries struggle to recover. Brazil&apos;s former foreign minister, Luiz Felipe Lampreia [The uncertainty for Britain and the EU until a referendum in 2017] will cause anxiety because Europe is already in a difficult corner. For us in Brazil, it is not a challenge of that nature but it is disturbing to see Europe further unbalanced. Lucio Flavio de Almeida, a political scientist at the Catholic University of S\u00e3o Paulo The attitude of the United Kingdom could strengthen critics of other regional integration projects such as Mercosur in Latin American.

The White House reiterated its belief on Wednesday that Britain is stronger within Europe but ducked the fresh opportunity to lean on Downing Street over the issue, favouring more conciliatory language than in recent weeks. &quot;We welcome the prime minister&apos;s call for Britain to remain in Europe,&quot; said spokesman Jay Carney. &quot;We believe that the UK is stronger as a result of its EU membership and as a result of having the UK in, the EU is stronger.&quot; But asked about prospects of a referendum on EU membership, Carney would only say: &quot;The internal processes by which these matters are discussed are a matter for local governments.&quot; In contrast with a decade ago, when the Bush administration appeared to welcome division in Europe, the Obama administration values a united Europe, not least in sharing the military burden of being the world&apos;s policeman. Unusually for Washington, while acknowledging it is a matter for the British public, it has made its opposition public. The White House, after a call between Obama and Cameron on January 17, issued a statement saying: &quot;The prime minister set forth his thinking on UK-EU relations in light of his upcoming speech. The president underscored our close alliance with the United Kingdom and said that the United States values a strong UK in a strong European Union, which makes critical contributions to peace, prosperity, and security in Europe and around the world.&quot; The mantra &apos;a strong UK in a strong European Union&apos; is explicit and is repeatedly underscored by the state department. Victoria Nuland, the state department spokeswoman, facing a series of questions from reporters earlier this month, said: &quot;We value a strong UK voice in the EU and that the European Union is a critical partner on global issues, and we welcome an outward-looking European Union with the UK in it.&quot; When Obama became president in 2009, leading members of his foreign and security team proposed retilting the balance away from Europe, with the cold war mentality of fear of Russia largely redundant, to the Pacific, to face the challenge from China. Obama reiterated in the run-up to re-election in November last year that a focus on the Pacific remained one of his priorities. But his position on Europe has softened over the last four years, seeing a value in an alliance that saw European engagement in various troublespots, primarily France and Britain taking a lead in Libya. Although the Obama administration pays lip-service to the &quot;special relationship&quot;, it has forged closer ties with Germany, to the chagrin of Britain. Matthias Matthijs, Washington-based assistant professor and European specialist at the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University, said: &quot;I think the Americans are greatly frustrated with all this UK fickleness on Europe.&quot; He contrasted the US position now with a decade ago, when the Bush administration was worried about a united Europe posing a geopolitical challenge to the US and welcomed division between &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; Europe. Now, the US wants a united Europe to share the diplomatic and military burden in a more plural world. &quot;If the UK is out, then you can forget about a common European foreign policy that the rest of the world will pay attention to,&quot; Matthijs said. &quot;If eurosceptics in the UK think that the Americans would applaud their exit from the union, they could not be more wrong.&quot; There was no official response from the Chinese government, but experts there said that the spectre of a 2017 in-out referendum could damage Sino-UK economic relations and unsettle Chinese business leaders who have come to rely on Britain as a key player in Sino-EU trade. The EU is China&apos;s largest trading partner \u2013 the two economies trade over \u00a3840m per day \u2013 and as such, China&apos;s regional economic allegiances are clear. &quot;If the UK really exits the European Union, this will create some uncertainties for Chinese business leaders,&quot; said Gary Liu, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. Withdrawal, he added, could &quot;create actual cost for Chinese people to do business in Europe.&quot; Chinese foreign policy officials would perceive a split between the UK and the EU as a possible harbinger of closer ties between UK and the US \u2013 not a China-friendly development, given a recent surge of distrust in Sino-US affairs. &quot;We all know that Great Britain is a special ally of the United States, and Great Britain is also a very important country in the European Union,&quot; said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. &quot;But if you abandon [the latter] identity, you will only have one identity in Chinese eyes.&quot; Officials at the Indian ministry of external affairs said they were considering the text of the speech, but would be unlikely to make any official comment.

Sheldon Adelson&apos;s Venetian Macau took legal action in a Hong Kong court this week to recover approximately $4.5m (\u00a32.8m). In one lawsuit, filed on Wednesday Hong Kong&apos;s high court, the Venetian is trying to recover $3m from Zou Yunyu, who has an estimated $220m fortune from her company, the Shanghai Gaoyuan Property Group. In the second case, the Venetian is pursuing $1.5m from Xie Xiaoqing, a businessman and deputy to the provincial legislature in Hubei province, according to Hong Kong media. The Venetian is one of four casinos owned by the Chinese arm of Adelson&apos;s Las Vegas Sands Corp. Adelson&apos;s fortune is valued at more than $20bn and his interests span gaming empires in Nevada and Asia, the Israeli newspaper market and Republican politics in the US. In the 2012 elections, he and his wife, Miriam, donated $95m to Republican candidates, including a massive late surge of $33m to pro-Romney political committees. Macau, a special administrative region of China and former Portuguese colony, earned $38bn in casino revenue in 2012, 13.5% higher than the year before. Macau&apos;s rise to the top of the casino market has been powered by wealthy mainland Chinese gamblers, but the lawsuits highlight the difficulties in collecting debts if they return to the mainland, where gambling is illegal and debts aren&apos;t recognised by courts. Both Macau and nearby Hong Kong have separate legal systems from mainland China.

But after a record breaking year in 2012 and as the jockey of Shanghai Bobby, one of the favorites for this year&apos;s Kentucky Derby \u2013 which no woman has won \u2013 that relative anonymity could well disappear. Napravnik&apos;s home, however, reflects someone who&apos;d rather not become well known. Where one would expect the walls to be adorned with memorabilia from an already decorated career, Napravnik&apos;s mid-city New Orleans house contains only a few items that betray her profession, and indeed the person. One is a portrait of Ruffian, America&apos;s ill-fated champion filly whose desire to win surpassed even the pain from catastrophic injury. The other, a picture entitled The Savage, is a black and white snapshot of the 1980 Tremont Stakes at Belmont Park in which, amid the fervor of a sustained stretch battle, Great Prospector reached over, neck sinews strained to snapping, to maul Golden Derby, the eventual winner. The parallels between Napavnik, 24, one of America&apos;s top jockeys, and Ruffian need little clarification. Both have succeeded in a sport that continues to be a routinely male preserve. The parallels between Napravnik and Great Prospector are there too. Napravnik&apos;s gritty determination is well documented, and it takes no stretch to cast her in the role of Great Prospector, her hunger to win almost insatiable.  But there is another side to Napravnik, more in the vein of Golden Derby \u2013 of someone whose success has come about through a single-minded vision despite other factors weighing in to frustrate her ascendant star. And it is this more vulnerable Napravnik that sits down in her kitchen late one Monday night in early January: that of someone poignantly aware of forces that are beyond her control. &quot;I&apos;m really, really worried about how it&apos;s going to turn out. It could take a negative turn at any point,&quot; says Napravnik, referring to an article about her due to be published in a major New York magazine. The interview, she believes, fared badly, and she&apos;s concerned that she&apos;ll be portrayed in an unflattering light.  Naturally shy, Napravnik knows that she can appear to some to be brusque, almost standoffish. But as Shanghai Bobby&apos;s jockey, and as a woman, she understands that she can expect intense scrutiny in the months-long jamboree that leads up to that first Saturday in May. The first major test comes this Saturday, when Shanghai Bobby makes his seasonal reappearance in the Holy Bull stakes in Florida.  &quot;People think I&apos;m stuck up and unhappy,&quot; she says. &quot;But it&apos;s not that I&apos;m unhappy or not content. It really isn&apos;t. I had an agent at Delaware [Park racecourse] say: &apos;You could lose by a nose or win by 10 lengths and you look exactly the same walking back to the jocks room, showing no emotion at all.&apos; It&apos;s hard to explain what I&apos;m so focused about.&quot;  Tonight, relaxed after a meal of grouper (a white fish delicacy in New Orleans) and a few glasses of wine, and now awaiting the fudge brownies that are readying in the oven, Napravnik is candid, eager to discuss the fallout from a banner year that saw her better two long-standing records for female jockeys. She says:   I think any female jockey who is successful will be compared to Julie Krone because who else do you compare them to?  In ending the year with $12,451,713 in purse earnings and an eighth-placed finish on the jockey&apos;s standings, Napravnik surpassed two tidemarks for female riders that were set by Krone, whose illustrious career spanned the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. They are more comparable as jockeys than as personalities \u2013 think of Napravnik as Yoko Ono to Krone&apos;s Lucille Ball \u2013 but Napravnik is keen to dispel the myth that she somehow resents the inevitable comparisons that are made.  &quot;It doesn&apos;t bother me at all,&quot; she says. &quot;She&apos;s recognized for some extremely big accomplishments but I do like to be recognized for some of my own accomplishments at the same time. It does seem like every big race I&apos;ve won they go, &apos;Did Julie win that?&apos; Or, &apos;Are you the first?&apos; It becomes a bit repetitive but in all due respect, no one&apos;s been as impressive as her in the industry\u2026 It has nothing to do with Julie herself.&quot; Last year was a pivotal one for Napravnik. Riding the appropriately named Believe You Can, she became the first female jockey to win the Kentucky Oaks \u2013 the distaff equivalent of the Kentucky Derby. &quot;The Oaks was like a story book,&quot; she says. &quot;It felt like a race I was meant to win \u2013 for myself. I really, really liked that filly talent-wise and she was a little bit underrated. But she won as though she was much the best.&quot;             The season&apos;s crescendo arrived in November at Santa Anita, where Napravnik won the Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile aboard Shanghai Bobby, establishing his bona fides as a heavyweight Derby prospect. She and the hitherto unbeaten colt toiled to a hard-fought victory. In the process, Napravnik became only the second female jockey to secure a win in the world championships of racing. There are no prizes for guessing who was the first, and Napravnik is acutely aware of the groundwork Krone and the female jockeys before her did in plowing the soils in which her career is growing. &quot;I probably wouldn&apos;t be able to do half of the things I have done if someone hadn&apos;t gone first and it become accepted that a girl could be so successful,&quot; she says. &quot;If I was in that generation of female riders, I&apos;m sure it would be a lot tougher then than it is now.&quot; According to Krone, the evidence of that shift in ideology at the racetrack can be seen in how very few top trainers now discriminate against female jockeys. &quot;When I was riding, out of the top 10 trainers, about two would ride me [in a race],&quot; she says. &quot;Now, Rosie&apos;s riding for pretty much all 10 of them.&quot; Krone is quick to point out that any remaining gender bias is only to the trainer&apos;s detriment:  The art of riding is feminine and masculine,&quot; she says. So the very best jockeys have got to be soft and subtle as well as strong and effective. So, if you think about it, girls are going to be naturally gifted with thoroughbreds.  Despite her aversion to media scrutiny, Napravnik is aware of the positive impact it has had on her career: &quot;Because you&apos;re female, they make a big deal. And it is a big deal. I think it&apos;s helped me considerably as far as promotion. I don&apos;t resent the following at all.&quot; Nevertheless, she has felt herself coerced into being a role model for little girls who like horses. &quot;It was a big adjustment to do that because I thought that wasn&apos;t part of my job description,&quot; she says, &quot;that I&apos;m just here to ride horses. It just came about. It was uncomfortable at first... but when you see the reaction and the impact it has on other people then I kind of accepted it as my position and it made me feel great.&quot; Joe Sharp, her husband of less than two years, himself a former jockey, sweeps into the kitchen and serves a generous dollop of brownies and ice cream. &quot;This is going to be so good,&quot; Napravnik says, her spoon in the desert as soon as the bowl is placed down. Because there is no racing the following day, Mondays are her designated indulgence night \u2013 the rest of the week, she makes up for the extravagance. &quot;I&apos;m heavier than I look,&quot; she says, without a crumb of remorse. It&apos;s nearing 11 and Napravnik&apos;s piercing blue eyes are hooded with nearing sleep. In between mouthfuls, she reflects upon Saratoga last year. It was her first time riding at the prestigious summer meeting in New York and her recollections are perhaps colored darker by fatigue. &quot;I was and I wasn&apos;t disappointed with Saratoga because it was up and down,&quot; she says. &quot;It had a lot of great points, I won three grade stakes, I rode in all the big races. But at the same time I went zero for 20-something at some point. It was just really hard. I felt like I didn&apos;t exceed anybody&apos;s expectations, which is probably my goal: to exceed everybody&apos;s expectations.&quot;  Before she can reflect further, she finishes her brownies and ice cream and calls time on the interview. &quot;We&apos;ll finish this tomorrow,&quot; she says, offering a tired good night before filing off to her bedroom flanked by Ripcord, Whiskey and Leo, the first two rescue dogs, the third her companion of 10 years \u2013 which is longer than she&apos;s been a jockey. &apos;This is the real deal&apos;     Napravnik on Shanghai Bobby after winning the Grey Goose Breeders' Cup Juvenile Grade 1 race. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images    On an overcast, steely grey Tuesday morning, the sort of day where the cold sinks straight through to the bones, Napravnik sits in a bustling coffee shop, before her a cup of herbal tea and a blueberry scone that she picks from intermittently.  In a cream polo neck sweater, she looks refreshed, her blue eyes clear and piercing once again. Tuesday is the one morning that she doesn&apos;t have to rise at five to ride workers at the Fair Grounds Racetrack, hustle mounts for the week ahead, ensure that trainers know that she&apos;s as keen as ever to ride winners. Right now, her thoughts are on her Derby mount. &quot;I remember being on [Shanghai Bobby] in the post parade,&quot; says Napravnik of his maiden race last year, at Saratoga.   I turned him loose and I warmed him up by myself. I remember thinking to myself, &apos;geez, this is a two-year-old in April and he is such a big, strong classy animal. Oh my goodness, this is the real deal.&apos;  They won that day and every other day they teamed up in last year, for a total of five victories. An easy win in the Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga set them up for a pulverizing defeat of their rivals at Belmont Park in the Champagne Stakes, one of the most important two-year-old races of the season. &quot;In the Champagne he was just 10% focused,&quot; says Napravnik, &quot;from the second he broke to the finish line he was doing his job and acting like a professional.&quot;  Shanghai Bobby&apos;s seasonal denouement, of course, came at Santa Anita. Asked whether she felt pressure riding the molten-hot favorite, Napravnik replies immediately: &quot;I surprised myself at how I handled riding the favorite in a Breeders&apos; Cup race. Normally I would feel the pressure but I was feeling so confident it was eased a little bit. But I guess there is more pressure when there&apos;s something expected of you and the horse.&quot; While she may squirm beneath the media scrutiny, Napravnik is unforgiving on herself, her insular nature lending itself naturally to rigorous self-analysis. Her sights focused upon climbing the jockey&apos;s ladder, she dissects all aspects of her game \u2013 which tracks she should ride at, her attitude, her work ethic, her relationship with trainers, the number of winners she&apos;s riding \u2013 in a manner that leaves no room for self-delusion. Nor is she adverse to criticism from those close to her.  &quot;If I ever get caught up with a bad attitude, my husband will be the first person to tell me about it,&quot; she says. &quot;And I can appreciate the constructive criticism because I&apos;m like, &apos;Wow, you&apos;re right. I haven&apos;t been winning so many races and maybe I need to get back to being humble and get back to continuing to work hard.&apos; Not that I&apos;ve ever stopped working.&quot; Determined as she is, Napravnik&apos;s successes would have been far trickier to achieve had she not enjoyed the unalloyed support of her family. She was born in 1988, in Mendham, New Jersey, in her grandmother&apos;s house. As she says: &quot;People always write that I was born in Morristown, New Jersey, but they&apos;re wrong. I was just sent to hospital there after I was born.&quot;  While both parents worked with horses, neither was involved in racing. Her father, Charles, was a farrier and her mother, Cindy, leased a farm where she kept show horses and eventers. And yet all three of their children were struck with racing fever: Napravnik and her sister Jasmine (Jazz), with horses, their brother, Colt, with cars. From the age of seven, Napravnik spent her weekends riding on the mid-Atlantic pony racing circuit \u2013 horseracing that got shrunk in the wash. Even then, it was evident that becoming a jockey was patterned into her DNA:   There was another girl who was probably on the other most competitive pony. During one of the races that I&apos;m going to win, she&apos;s behind me, and I&apos;m looking back and I&apos;m steering in her way so she can&apos;t get past me. I didn&apos;t want her to pass me. I remember my parents saying afterwards, &apos;You can&apos;t do that, you know.&apos; I think the stewards got involved.  Each win on the pony racing circuit only served to stoke her competitive fires and she quickly set her sights on becoming a professional jockey. At 13 and 14, over the summers and on weekends, she travelled to stay with Jazz, who was working as an exercise rider in a racing stable. She found work in the steeplechase yards of Jonathan Sheppard and Jack Fisher, doing the same jobs \u2013 the grooming, the mucking out, the riding \u2013 as those much older than her, more robust than her 99lb sapling frame; people physically equipped to manage half-ton racehorses.  &quot;I galloped this one horse, he was really tough, and my sister goes, &apos;I couldn&apos;t even gallop that son of a bitch.&apos; And when I found out that I was galloping him that day I was like, &apos;What the hell were they thinking?&apos; But at the same time I thought that, &apos;Well, if they think I can do it then I guess I can do it.&apos; That summer, when I first went to stay with my sister I was 110lb and within a week I was 99lb. I was exhausted.&quot; At 15, Napravnik took a year hiatus from horseracing to spend with her schoolfriends: &quot;I said, &apos;You know what, when I&apos;m 16 I&apos;m going to be able to get my license at the racetrack and I&apos;m going to have to work with horses for the rest of my life and I&apos;m going to have to work my ass off everyday. So I&apos;m not going to work with horses this year.&apos;&quot; The day she turned 16, she got her license to gallop at Pimlico Racecourse in Maryland. Her first employer was Dickie Small, a trainer renowned for producing a string of successful female jockeys. Within a year, she took out her jockey&apos;s license. On June 9 2005, Napravnik rode her first race. The filly, Ringofdiamonds, was considered a forlorn hope. Right out of the gates, Napravnik sent her to the lead. The only view the other jockey&apos;s got was of Ringofdiamonds&apos; rear.  &quot;I remember thinking that I would be somewhere near the front. I don&apos;t know how I did it. I broke, went out to the lead, I pulled my stick through on the left side like Dickie told me to do and the filly won. So that was a kind of crazy moment like, this was the real thing. My mom was crying. Everyone was so excited.&quot;  While Napravnik&apos;s academic career had stalled \u2013 beneath an arduous workload, she decided to drop out of high school with a year remaining, only to earn her GED the following year \u2013 her riding career flourished. She proved an instant hit at smaller venues like Colonial Downs in Virginia, and Pimlico and Laurel Park in Maryland. There were, however, painful lessons to be learned. &quot;I remember Steve Hamilton [one of the senior jockeys] giving me an old-fashioned schooling. He kept telling me, &apos;After you hit the horse, bring your hand up on the reigns again, don&apos;t leave it dangling down against the horse&apos;s neck,&apos; which is what I was doing, even after he told me not to. This one time in a race, he hit me whack right on the top of my hand and my hand swelled up this big and I went, &apos;Oh, I get it,&apos; and I finally started to correct it.&quot; &apos;I was lost, lonely and I had an injury&apos; It wasn&apos;t long before the first of a laundry list of injuries would make her swollen hand look like a paper cut. At Laurel Park on 12 November 2005, she broke her collarbone, the same day she signed a lease on an apartment. &quot;It was the first time I lived on my own,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn&apos;t know anyone at Laurel. I was really lonely and I didn&apos;t have any furniture and I had to move the furniture in by myself. I was really lost, lonely and I had an injury.&quot; The next year, she won more than 300 races. But on 26 January 2007, a horse collapsed crossing the wire, exhausted, and she was flung into the dirt. &quot;I landed on my chest and my legs flipped over my head,&quot; she says \u2013 she suffered a compression fracture of the spine and fractured three thoracic vertebrae.  She recovered quickly, only to take another spill on 6 July. This time, she broke her wrist clean across the radius and the little finger of her right hand: &quot;My wrist was broken in half. I didn&apos;t feel the break. I think I was kneeling and when I went to push myself up I felt that it was broken. I said to myself, &apos;Don&apos;t freak out, don&apos;t freak out.&apos; But I&apos;m freaking out.&quot; On 2 August 2008, she broke her leg, tibia and fibula, clean across the shin:   I rolled in front of another horse. I was on my back with my arms and legs covering myself and it just galloped though my leg. I heard it, felt it, snap in half. I remember grabbing a handful of dirt and going, &apos;That&apos;s going to take another lay off.&apos;  In July of 2011, she broke her wrist again, above where the plate from her 2007 accident was still inserted. The treatment was almost as bad as the blow: &quot;They tried to take the plate out but they couldn&apos;t because the screws wouldn&apos;t budge so they had to cut the heads off the screws, leave the screws in my wrist, and put a bigger plate in to hold it all together.&quot; Despite those injury plagued years, Napravnik&apos;s statistics indicate a jockey who has enjoyed, thus far, a steady ramble to the summit. Since 2008, her year-end standing on the jockey&apos;s table for purse earnings runs as follows: 63, 40, 30, 24, 8. The results speak of a focused and accomplished rider \u2013 a rider every bit as able as her male colleagues. And by and large, the treatment she&apos;s received by her male cohorts has been one of mutual respect rather than chauvinistic antagonism \u2013 despite a few notable exceptions:  When I first came to Fair Grounds [in 2010], a few riders really did their best to try to intimidate me. It&apos;s the first time it&apos;s happened in that kind of way. They all had the same idea that they were going to be a little bit more territorial, and because I&apos;m a girl it should have been easier for them to intimidate me. It was like one day they had gang up on Rosie day. I remember one jockey was trying to push me out of my spot. All I did was stand my ground and refuse to move. He put himself in a really bad position and ended up checking on heels really badly and almost went down.  She didn&apos;t raise the issue with authorities \u2013 just walked back to the jock&apos;s room and prepared for the next race. &quot;I probably gained a little bit of respect to say that I could ride just as well as they could,&quot; she says. Not that it prevented them from trying it again. &quot;I remember later on I was on the favorite in a short field and you could completely see them side up to stop me from winning the race. &quot;I don&apos;t like confrontation at all. It just makes me sorry. I just like to throw it back in their face. I don&apos;t like to start anything, ever, but if they&apos;re going to try to intimidate me, I like to just stand there and say, &apos;Sorry, it ain&apos;t gonna happen.&apos; I&apos;m shy but I&apos;m badass. I&apos;m not shy in a timid way, just shy in a way that I&apos;m not comfortable with people.&quot; &apos;I had a dream of winning the Derby on Shanghai Bobby&apos;     The Kentucky Derby is the biggest event in American racing. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    The sounds from the coffee shop, of other conversations, of the puck-puck-puck of espresso machines and of Taylor Swift on the speaker system, shift the focus back to the present \u2013 to Shanghai&apos;s Bobby&apos;s chances of lifting the Kentucky Derby. &quot;A couple weeks ago,&quot; Napravnik says, &quot;I was standing in my silks in the jocks room, and all of a sudden I had this really vivid day dream of winning the Derby on Shanghai Bobby, actually winning the race, crossing the wire, the crowd going wild, I can&apos;t actually believe it. It&apos;s not typical of me to have these fantasies. I think if I was to dream about it all the time I would be putting more and more pressure on myself.&quot;  And what about the holy grail of racing: the triple crown? &quot;I don&apos;t know about the triple crown,&quot; she says, rather less romantically, citing the question marks that hang over Shanghai Bobby&apos;s stamina in his breeding. &quot;But the horse himself doesn&apos;t give me any reason to believe that he has limitations. He is versatile, and I think he has probably not shown anybody how good he is yet. I don&apos;t think he&apos;s shown his 100% effort.&quot; When it comes to defining Napravnik&apos;s future, we are back to Great Prospector versus Golden Derby, the insatiable competitor versus someone more aware of, and vulnerable to, external factors. On the one hand, she wants to &quot;win the Florida Derby, win the Derby, win the Preakness, win the Belmont, then go to Saratoga again and be leading rider, then go to the Breeders&apos; Cup, have five mounts and win the classic on Mark Valeski.&quot; On the other, she&apos;s aware that whatever she achieves is dependent upon remaining fit and healthy \u2013 on a whole host of variables. &quot;The better you do, the more people expect of you and the more I expect of myself,&quot; she admits, finally, not satisfied with her response but unable to land upon a more concrete answer.  If all goes according to plan, come the first Saturday in May she&apos;s going to have quite the burden on her shoulders.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Breeders' Cup", "US sports", "Sport", "Kentucky Derby"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-25T13:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jan/26/spot-the-dog-report-fund-managers-bestinvest", "sentences": ["Over the past five years, the Shanghai stock market index has fallen from 4,500 to 2,300."], "title": "Spot the Dog!

It identifies 153 funds with \u00a323bn under management, that have underperformed the market in each of the last three years, yet they have charged investors around \u00a31bn in fees. The worst offenders are those that invest in North American shares, but many emerging market and ethical funds have also performed poorly. Dubbed &quot;The guide that fund managers would love to ban&quot;, BestInvest names Scottish Widows, BlackRock, Baillie Gifford, F&amp;C Investments and Jupiter as the big investment management houses that are failing to deliver. At the other end of scale, not a single fund from JPMorgan Asset Management, M&amp;G, AXA Investment Management and BNY Mellon/Newton found their way onto the Dog list, despite each having a large number of funds. Many of the worst funds returned 30% less than the average over three years. For example, the Standard Life UK Opportunities, named as the worst pension fund, gave investors a return of just 2% over three years, compared to the average 32% gain in the sector. But at least the fund hasn&apos;t actually lost money. The award for consistently bad performance, where investors have lost a large part of their capital, went to a fund investing in China, Brazil and Russia. The Hexam Global Emerging Markets has lost its investors nearly 10% over the past year and 13% over three years. Jupiter&apos;s \u00a3200m China fund is also in the doghouse, after losing money over three years. Despite China&apos;s industrial might, the country has been a graveyard for investor expectations. Over the past five years, the Shanghai stock market index has fallen from 4,500 to 2,300. Jason Hollands of BestInvest says: &quot;Sadly, the funds listed in Spot the Dog represent the tip of the iceberg of poor performance because the criteria we have set are designed to focus on the very &apos;worst of the worst&apos;. In our view, financial product providers too easily get away with dismal or uninspiring performance, benefitting from a combination of investor inertia and advisers failing to provide a satisfactory level of monitoring on investments they have previously recommended.&quot; Scottish Widows is named as the investment management group with the worst record. &quot;It was top dog in our last report and has been a regular offender over many years,&quot; says Hollands. A spokesperson for Scottish Widows said: &quot;In April we began the process of repositioning our \u00a354bn equities business. We are completing the process of transitioning a number of equities funds, including those named in the survey \u2026 We remain committed to active equities management and will compete in those markets where we have confidence that we can generate strong performance.&quot; So should investors who hold &quot;dog&quot; funds sell out and buy something else? BestInvest says that management groups may be taking action to turn around the fortunes of a fund, but adds: &quot;You should certainly explore further whether or not to stick with a fund if it appears in the guide. Neither should you assume that a fund is in the clear just because it isn&apos;t in Spot the Dog.

The crowd, the American and Australian TV networks \u2013 the ballkids too probably \u2013 everyone wanted the charming Chinese player to win the Australian Open, to beat the vilain du jour who had hustled the sweet American teenage prodigy Sloane Stephens out of the semi-finals with her blatant gamesmanship. Yet there was something heroic about Azarenka&apos;s achievement in retaining the title she won last year by slaying another golden girl, Maria Sharapova. This was a counter-intuitive twist that defied the power of the crowd, and one irreverently embroidered by her boyfriend, the wildly-coiffed American singer, Redfoo, who clutched the hand she reached up to him from the court in victory and uttered the heartfelt quote of the tournament: &quot;I love you, baby \u2013 you&apos;re fucking amazing.&quot; The microphones picked it up, and there was duly an apology to viewers. You are not supposed to use language like that here, not in tennis, not on Australia Day, even when wrecking a fairytale. That Roger Federer had used similar language the previous night in his match with Andy Murray did not get much of an airing. If the night had gone to script, Azarenka, although No1 in the world, would not have beaten the sixth seed 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in two hours and 40 minutes of flawed, eventful tennis. The storyboard would have had Li getting up from a spill that wrenched her left ankle to blast the wicked witch off the court. It would then have her return from the quite preposterous Australia Day 10-minute fireworks break, tumble on the ankle again, bang her head and hang on in the third set for a heartwarming win. Tennis in China would then have roared ahead of all the other sports scrambling for the biggest untapped audience in the world and they would make a movie of her life to go with the giant posters that already dot Shanghai and Beijing. But this was real. And it was better than the pre-written script. Azarenka was better than Li, by a decent bit at the end. She served efficiently, at 78% on her first effort, to a poor 48% return for Li, whose unforced error count was catastrophic in the end: 57, with 30 on her backhand as her wrists failed to roll tough enough through the shot. Azarenka sobbed uncontrollably into her towel at the end, wobbled over to her coach, Samuel Sumyk, who said: &quot;You&apos;re a champion&quot;, a more decorous acclamation than that of Redfoo. He grew up in posh Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles but comes from no-nonsense stock, the son of Tamla Motown founder, Berry Gordy Jnr. Vika has interesting potential in-laws, as Gordy, a would-be boxer until he found music easier, is distantly related to Jimmy Carter, through the former US president&apos;s mother, Bessie Lillian Gordy. Had he been court-side, he could have serenaded her through her lachrymose celebrations with one of his great hits, Lonely Teardrops. And she was all alone here, apart from those close friends. It was an unseemly spectacle, seeing the crowd cheer Azarenka&apos;s every mistake. Yes, as she admitted, &quot;it was my bad&quot; that she had taken a spectacularly ill-judged medical timeout against Stephens. But that was not good enough. &quot;I was expecting way worse \u2013 but I thought Li Na played some great tennis,&quot; she said. Azarenka fought so hard to survive in the first set, saving four set points, before throwing it away with a double fault, and the expulsion of joy in the arena was a communal snarl in her direction. It must have taken all her fortitude to ignore it \u2013 and she is not known for that quality. To that point, it was a final of emotion and ill-discipline, with seven service breaks in the first 10 games. Another followed at the start of the second, giving Azarenka rare breathing space under intense pressure. She fought against her instincts to ignore the welter of distractions that followed. Li played her part, smiling through serial bouts of adversity.

Her commitment was never divorced from reality: she translated it, pleasantly but firmly, into everyday life and work. Living in Hong Kong in the late 1960s, she was an unusual expat mum who refused to have a resident amah (maidservant). Her notable travels with two very young children included exploring the Andean plateau and crossing the Soviet Union by the Trans-Siberian railway. Aelfthryth was a strong supporter of state education and the comprehensive system, but she was not taken in by rhetoric. A school manager at William Tyndale junior school in Islington, north London, she opposed the chaotic progressive experiment there in 1974 which led to an official inquiry. A colleague at the Social and Community Planning Research, the non-profit social research organisation now known as NatCen, where she worked as an interviewer and later as a training manager (1978-2000), recalls how she flatly refused to sign the Official Secrets Act for the Government Social Survey. Throughout her life Aelfthryth had to deal with the inquiry &quot;Is your name Welsh?&quot; It is actually Anglo-Saxon. Her diplomat father \u2013 a language enthusiast \u2013 had chosen it, while her Jewish mother from prewar Poland had no idea it was not a common name when Aelfthryth was born in London. Joining me in Shanghai for two years from 2001, Aelfthryth taught business English at Jiao Tong University and did volunteer work at the Children&apos;s Welfare Institute, the city&apos;s largest orphanage.

After we retired to Shipton under Wychwood, in Oxfordshire, Aelfthryth became an enthusiastic campaigner for the Labour party. She helped form the Burford (later Oxfordshire) Probate Group which, working for the Victoria County History, transcribed local wills. Later she was active with the Wychwood Probate Group. Aelfthryth is remembered as a lively colleague with an infectious laugh, as a deeply caring mother, and as a constant loving partner.

One part of the solution should be a new global climate agency, founded, financed and led by a coalition of the big emerging market countries. Such an agency would not require prior agreement on two contentious issues that have stymied the international talks: binding emissions reductions, and financial support to help poor countries adapt and invest in clean growth. Instead, the new entity would focus on fostering co-operation on a wide range of knowledge-based issues that can provide a basis for progress even without such an agreement, and that will be necessary to support any agreement that eventually emerges. What would the new agency do? Despite the plethora of international organisations addressing climate change, there is a core set of knowledge-based services best supplied at the global level that are crucial and yet are not being adequately supplied. These include data collection and policy research (think of the World Bank&apos;s role in research on poverty reduction); surveillance and monitoring (the IMF&apos;s role in tracking members&apos; macroeconomic and financial-sector issues to enhance global stability), and arbitration (the World Trade Organisation&apos;s role in settling trade disputes). Possible related functions include: \u2022 tracking contributions to international climate funds, and to energy and climate-relevant research; \u2022 supervisory and regulatory functions to undergird private markets in emissions rights at national, regional and global levels; \u2022 organisation and facilitation of third-party financing of technology transfers to low-income countries; \u2022 impartial third-party monitoring and reporting on climate actions by corporations and governments. The G20 emerging market countries \u2013 notably China, India and Brazil, but also others such as Mexico and South Africa \u2013 have both a strong incentive and the means to lead in the creation of the entity, while extending an invitation to all nations to join. The leaders of these countries understand that their national ambitions and the stability of their societies are threatened by climate change. The rich world can \u2013 for a while at least \u2013 afford to adapt. Developing countries, with much lower per capita incomes, have much less room to manoeuvre. By taking the lead, the emerging market countries would be in a position to decide the new body&apos;s mandate, governance, location, staffing and leadership, just as the victors of the second world war established ground rules for the Bretton Woods institutions. The new entity could be headquartered in a thriving emerging-market city (ideally, perhaps, in one that is not the capital of any major power), say, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sao Paulo, Mumbai or Songdo, the newly selected home of the green climate fund in South Korea. Most of the G20 emerging market countries have ample reserves. The main cost would be salaries, headquarters and commissioning research. Initial capital of $10bn-12bn (\u00a36.3bn-7.6bn) would generate an annual budget of about $300m-500m, adequate to cover these needs. China has ample reserves to put up a considerable portion of the capital and could jump-start commitments from other middle-income countries, which might, in turn, be matched by developed countries. The founders could encourage others to join by giving greater weight to early contributions, and address concerns about voice and equity by awarding greater weight to contributions from countries with lower per capita emissions. This would be a radical departure from business as usual. But as extreme weather events and other problems associated with rapid climate change mount, and deadlock in negotiations persists, the appetite for fresh approaches is certain to grow. Pollution is already a major political issue in China, and erratic monsoon rains are creating hardship in India. Tentative moves towards the creation of a Brics bank by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (which is expected to be discussed at the Brics summit in March) show these countries are interested in the creation of institutions that will better serve their collective interests. Perhaps the next climate crisis will provide a catalyst. The emerging markets can&apos;t force the US and other rich countries to reduce emissions or provide finance. But they can take the lead in the creation of an agency to better track climate actions that are under way, build trust among deeply distrustful parties, and provide the knowledge that will be crucial to combating the growing climate threat.", "tags": ["Environmental sustainability", "Global development", "Climate change", "Environment", "China", "World news", "Brics"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-28T07:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/smart-cities-answer-population-fewer-resources", "sentences": ["Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect \u2013 famous for taking Copenhagen&apos;s little mermaid statue to China as part of the 2010 world expo in Shanghai, and founding partner of Bjarke Ingels Group \u2013 thinks that Masdar is &quot;not exactly very practical."], "title": "Are smart cities the answer to rising populations?", "article": "Meeting the twin global challenges of more people and dwindling resources requires dramatic solutions. One answer is to build entirely new &quot;smart cities&quot;, using the latest in technology and construction techniques. The most well-know of this kind of project is Masdar City, which is being build on a spare square mile of desert by Abu Dhabi international airport and due to be completed in 2025 (pushed back from 2016). The city will be raised metres above a concrete base to maximize its exposure to cooling winds, petrol cars banned and replaced by a fleet of self-driving electric cars in specially-built tunnels, and low-energy appliances and insulation mean the city will use only a quarter of the energy of a traditional city its size (an expected 40,000 residents and 50,000 commuters), almost all of which will be provided by a solar farm positioned outside the city limits. What&apos;s not to like? Well, according to some of the world&apos;s leading thinkers in urban design and architecture, quite a lot. Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect \u2013 famous for taking Copenhagen&apos;s little mermaid statue to China as part of the 2010 world expo in Shanghai, and founding partner of Bjarke Ingels Group \u2013 thinks that Masdar is &quot;not exactly very practical. It&apos;s an extreme prestige project that doesn&apos;t really work in conventional economical terms.&quot; The price tag for Masdar has been reported as $22bn (\u00a314bn). &quot;It involves almost a tripling of the infrastructure of a city,&quot; says Ingels. &quot;I can&apos;t see how an entire extra level of underground streets with self-driving, ultra-expensive cars, is a very feasible proposal for a successful urban model.&quot; The issue urbanists have is not with Masdar per se \u2013 home to the already complete Masdar Institute for renewable technology design, and already testing many welcome innovations including new PV-panel designs \u2013 but with the idea that new cities can be seen as some sort of solution. &quot;The majority of the cities that will be our cities of the future are already here&quot;, continues Ingels. &quot;Cities evolve in gradual increments. Even a city like Shenzhen, that grew from being a fisherman&apos;s village 30 years ago to being 40 million people at the last count, is developing on a series of existing conditions.&quot; Adam Greenfield, founder and managing director of New York urban technology company Urbanscale, and working on the book The City is Here For You to Use, agrees with Ingels. &quot;Instead of building smart cites, we need to ... help cities do what they already do,&quot; he says. &quot;To remain supple enough in our technological and budgetary commitments that we can respond.&quot; He adds: &quot;Technology evolves at a speed that is much higher than society or processes of democratic accountability.&quot; In other words, the technology of a brand new city may begin as cutting edge, but could be outdated even before completion, and that of existing cities may be outdated, but the infrastructure is already there to build upon and retrofit. &quot;We do need a radical new approach, but the radical new approach may be hiding right under our noses,&quot; says Greenfield. &quot;Retrofitting means an acknowledgement of and an adaptation to reality. Habits and patterns of sociability change \u2013 we cannot begin to know, when we layout a plan for a new city, what use people are going to make of it. The street literally does find its own use for things.&quot; At LSE Cities, Philipp Rode, executive director and senior research fellow, argues that there is nothing new about &quot;new cities&quot;. &quot;Brasilia [built in 1956] is probably the most extreme, but also Islamabad, Chandigarh ... Whereas what we&apos;re talking about today is mostly extensions of existing cities. The question is much more about when do you build on greenfield versus when do you use existing urban structure? I would argue it should be a priority to build on existing urban land rather than developing new.&quot; He adds: &quot;There is an embedded energy demand in building new, where there are no roads, not a single piece of concrete or wiring that you can re-use. That itself requires a lot of energy, some people suggest even up to 20-30% of the lifecycle energy of the city.&quot; However, if retrofitting is the answer, is it happening? There are a handful of positive examples, such as the Bristol retrofit city initiative. Or poster child projects such as the Tate Modern&apos;s regeneration of the Bankside power station, or New York&apos;s High Line park giving new life to the former central railroad. Ingels also points to the transformation of industrial river waterfronts into the Hudson River Park and the East River Park in New York, a trend that can be seen from Oslo to Newcastle. &quot;These are radical developments that have occurred relatively invisibly over the past 10 years but are massively changing how the city feels and how it is to inhabit ... It&apos;s a continual re-investment and upgrade of existing cities.&quot; It is also a concept that, somewhat paradoxically, Ingels is attempting to bring into his new-build architecture projects.

Jefferies has since acquired further shares in 3i to bring its stake to 1.6%, worth around \u00a340m. The move raises the prospect that Sherborne could start agitating for change at 3i, which is emerging from a turbulent year of restructuring. 3i drew attention to the fact that Sherborne has recently raised more than \u00a3200m through its new Aim-listed Guernsey B fund, or &quot;SigB&quot;, reportedly to build a stake of up to 30% in a single target, probably in the UK. SigB is backed by one of George Soros&apos; funds, Soros Fund Management. However, \u00a3200m would buy only 8% of 3i&apos;s shares at the current price of 264p, up 2.3% today. 3i was not obliged to put out the statement but it is understood it wanted to put shareholders on notice of Sherborne&apos;s move. Neither Sherborne nor Jefferies is thought to have informed 3i that it had acquired shares. US-based Sherborne was founded by Bramson in 1986. According to its website, it invests in &quot;companies which we believe have the potential to increase their profits substantially but which have underperformed for an extended period of time&quot;. In 2011 Bramson used Sherborne&apos;s stake in F&amp;C to oust the chairman and chief executive and install himself as executive chairman. Sherborne&apos;s other investments have included chemicals company Elementis, promotional products group 4imprint, and telecoms group Spirent. Bramson has been chairman at each of them. A spokesman for Sherborne declined to comment. 3i, whose investments include lingerie business Agent Provocateur, fashion retailer Hobbs and the Giraffe restaurant chain, faced pressure from investors last year over its performance. Under chief executive Simon Borrows, the company is in the process of cutting 160 jobs, more than a third of its workforce, and has closed six of its 19 offices, including those in Birmingham, Hong Kong and Shanghai. The share price has been recovering strongly since last year and the company is planning to dispose of its stakes in Canadian manufacturer Mold Masters and Danish-German ferry operator ScandLines. 3i traces its roots to 1945, when it was set up to provide capital to small and medium-seized businesses in the aftermath of the second world war. It floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1994 and today focuses on mid-sized companies as well as infrastructure and debt management .", "tags": ["3i", "Business", "Private equity", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-29T10:14:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jan/30/john-reed-obituary", "sentences": ["He was recruited by the British Council in 1978 to teach in Beijing and Shanghai."], "title": "John Reed obituary", "article": "My brother, John Reed, who has died aged 82, was a peripatetic academic. He taught in many parts of the world, but his heart, I believe, was in central Africa. He was born to working-class parents in Camberwell, south London, and spent two years in rural Oxfordshire as an evacuee during the second world war. He was awarded a London county council boarding scholarship to Bancroft&apos;s school in Essex. At 16, he sat for open scholarships to Oxford and was awarded a demyship (special scholarship) to Magdalen College, where he studied under CS Lewis and gained a congratulatory first in English. After his national service in the RAF, he lectured on English at Edinburgh University and King&apos;s College London, before going to University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now the University of Zimbabwe) in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe). Always a man of the left, he was soon involved in black politics and the independence movements. He taught adult classes in the townships and visited detainees in the detention camps, as well as editing with his colleague, Terry Ranger, a political magazine called Dissent. With another colleague, Clive Wake, he produced a number of translations of the emerging literature of Francophone Africa \u2013 notably a volume of L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor&apos;s poetry for Oxford University Press. In 1965 Ian Smith&apos;s regime issued a warrant for his arrest on political charges but he had just left Salisbury on his appointment as the first professor of English at the new university in Lusaka in the newly independent Zambia. John&apos;s memoir, Chikwakwa Remembered (2011), co-written with Michael Etherton, tells of the founding, development and eventual political difficulties of the university&apos;s student theatre there. Returning to Britain in 1974, he gained an MA and a PhD in historical linguistics at Newcastle University with Barbara Strang. He was recruited by the British Council in 1978 to teach in Beijing and Shanghai. In 1983 he began a decade as visiting professor at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan. In semi-retirement he went back to Harare as a &quot;supply&quot; professor; during a student revolt, the police cleared the campus of students by using teargas. John, working late in his office, hadn&apos;t heard the police orders and the teargas came down the corridor and into his office. He retired to Manchester, where he lived the life of an old-fashioned scholar \u2013 reading, thinking and writing. He was committed to his ideals and remained a socialist to the end. His diaries (now archived at Chetham&apos;s Library, Manchester) will be a legacy showing the development of his intellectual life and giving an account of the political events he lived through in Africa.

Here we have a footballer from the Ivory Coast, whose reputation flourished playing in England for a team funded by a Russian billionaire. That reputation gave him the opportunity for a spectacular payday in China, but when things didn&apos;t work out so well, his next destination is Turkey, who have perhaps the most favourable tax rate in Europe any footballer could wish for outside of Monaco. When Drogba agreed to follow Wesley Sneijder to make Galatasaray one of the stories of this transfer window, it was understandable for the reaction to be mixed. Even within Turkey people have expressed astonishment about these quite unexpected transfers. The club deserve hearty congratulations for showing such ballsy ambition, and preparing themselves as best they can to capitalise on their first appearance for some time in the Champions League knockout round. But it is slightly puzzling that players of the calibre of Sneijder and Drogba were not chased by more suitors. Both are capable of being in the top handful in the world in their position. They both proved inspirational to their teams winning the Champions League in recent seasons. Sneijder might be a difficult character to drop into a dressing room, and Drogba close to his 35th birthday, but the fact that Galatasaray had no genuine competition is strange. There are whispers that both players were holding out for a different destination, only for nothing to materialise. Time to smile for the cameras in Cimbom colours. Galatasaray leveraged themselves into pole position helped by a tax-free deal. Although the Chinese club is complaining, and there is some manouvering to be done, Drogba expects to join Galatasaray after the Africa Cup of Nations. He will collect a fee of \u20ac4m and the club will pay his tax bill on top of that. It suddenly does not seem pure coincidence for a couple of notable stars to head to Turkey, while the French league, under the cloud of the 75% rate proposed by the Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is experiencing a talent drain. Finances might have talked loudly in Galatasaray&apos;s negotiations, but it is worth pointing out that from a sporting perspective this is not the same thing as David Beckham going to LA Galaxy or Samuel Eto&apos;o heading to Anzhi Makhachkala. Galatasaray&apos;s heritage should ensure they have considerably more clout. This is all about a club trying to regain its footing in the upper echelons of European football. Since winning the Uefa Cup in 2000, their high watermark and constant reference point, they endured a decade between 2001 and 2011 that was mostly demoralising. There were a couple of titles, but no sustained success, and money problems dogged them. Now they are going for it, determined to give themselves the best possible chance of skipping back up the ladder. Everything began to look up in 2011. Galatasaray moved into a new 52,000-seat stadium, the biggest in Turkey. They have generated new sponsors, resources in excess of \u20ac95m, and sit in a comfortable place in the Deloitte football money league. They racked up more than 40,000 season ticket holders, and feel able to compete beyond the domestic market they now lead. Galatasaray have been steadily upgrading since the club came under the influence of a new president. When the Istanbul-born millionaire Unal Aysal took over in 2011, his priority was to bring back Fatih Terim, the man they call the emperor, the charismatic coach who had inspired the most successful period in Galatasaray&apos;s history. The connection between these two men has been instrumental in turning Cimbom around. &quot;Galatasaray are re-establishing themselves,&quot; observes Alp Ulagay from the newspaper Hurriyet. &quot;The club is able to pursue these players, and get big stars, thanks to Terim and Aysal, who is a very European-minded man.&quot; The title was won in the first season under the leadership of Terim and Aysal, who began building a squad by blending domestic talent with overseas experience \u2013 Brazilian Felipe Melo is a crucial player. Even Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 has prospered after a poor start to his spell in Turkey. Now the club are raring to take the next step. &quot;One of my principles is to go further and further. No limits,&quot; Terim said when he was at the peak of his powers leading Gala to the 2000 Uefa Cup triumph. It has not been the happiest period in Turkish football, with match-fixing scandals still fresh in the memory, the national team fading and domestic standards dipping. Bringing in high-profile names such as Sneijder and Drogba is a real boost.

The hackers gained entry to the newspaper&apos;s internal systems and accessed the personal computers of 53 employees including David Barboza, its Shanghai bureau chief and author of the Wen expos\u00e9, and Jim Yardley, a former Beijing bureau chief. An investigation by Mandiant, a cyber-security company hired by the New York Times, concluded that the hacks were likely part of an elaborate spy campaign with links to the country&apos;s military. The company traced the source of the attacks to university computers that the &quot;Chinese military had used to attack United States Military contractors in the past&quot;, the Times said. Although the hackers gained passwords for every Times employee, Mandiant found that they only sought information that was related to the Wen story. The Times said it worked with telecommunications company AT&amp;T and the FBI to trace the hackers after AT&amp;T noticed suspicious activity on the paper&apos;s computer networks on 25 October, one day after the article appeared in print. A later analysis concluded that hackers initially broke into Times computers on 13 September when reporting for the Wen story was in its final pre-publishing stages.  The Times hired Mandiant on 7 November when management realised initial efforts to expel the hackers from the company&apos;s computer systems had been unsuccessful.  &quot;To get rid of the hackers the Times blocked the compromised outside computers, removed every back door into its network, changed every employee password and wrapped additional security around its systems,&quot; said the article. While Times executives worried that a flurry of hacker activity around the time of the US presidential elections may have indicated that the hackers were intent on shutting down the paper&apos;s publishing systems, &quot;the attackers&apos; movements suggested that the primary target remained Mr Barboza&apos;s email correspondence&quot;. The Chinese government had warned the Times that the expos\u00e9 would &quot;have consequences&quot;, according to the report.  The hackers used a technique called spear-phishing, according to the article, allowing them to install malware on their targets&apos; computers via seemingly innocuous email messages. The malware allowed them to add remote access tools that gave them access to data from employees&apos; computers.  &quot;Attackers no longer go after our firewall. They go after individuals. They send a malicious piece of code to your email account and you&apos;re opening it and letting them in,&quot; said Michael Higgins, the Times&apos; chief security officer.  Chinese hackers began targeting western journalists in 2008 as part of a possible campaign to pre-empt stories that could damage the leadership&apos;s reputation at home and abroad, the article said. Bloomberg was also a victim of cyber-attacks after the newswire published a report on the vast wealth of incoming president Xi Jinping&apos;s family last summer. In response to allegations that the Chinese military was behind the attacks, China&apos;s ministry of national defence told the New York Times that &quot;Chinese laws prohibit any action including hacking that damages internet security&quot; and that &quot;to accuse the Chinese military of launching cyber-attacks without solid proof is unprofessional and baseless&quot;.", "tags": ["New York Times", "Media", "Hacking", "Technology", "China", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-31T06:02:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/31/new-york-times-hacking-china-cybercrime", "sentences": ["I am pretty sure that they will be back.&quot; The hackers gained entry to the newspaper&apos;s internal systems and accessed the personal computers of 53 employees including David Barboza, its Shanghai bureau chief and author of the Wen expos\u00e9, and Jim Yardley, a former Beijing bureau chief.", "They operate in places like Shanghai and coastal Shandong Province, but usually avoid detection by tunnelling through easily-infiltrated computers at servers and universities in the United States."], "title": "New York Times hacking revelations shed new light on China cybercrime", "article": "Revelations that China apparently targeted the New York Times in a campaign of cyber-espionage have cast a rare spotlight on attempts by Beijing to crack down on any criticism of its ruling elite.

The company traced the source of the attacks to university computers that the &quot;Chinese military had used to attack United States Military contractors in the past&quot;, the Times said. Although the hackers gained passwords for every Times employee, Mandiant found that they only sought information that was related to the Wen story. &quot;They were after David Barboza&apos;s source list; confidential names and numbers and looking to find out who he was talking to,&quot; said Frons. The Times said it worked with telecommunications company AT&amp;T and the FBI to trace the hackers after AT&amp;T noticed suspicious activity on the paper&apos;s computer networks on 25 October, one day after the article appeared in print. A later analysis concluded that hackers initially broke into Times computers on 13 September when reporting for the Wen story was in its final pre-publishing stages. Instead of immediately going public, however, the Times took the decision to watch the hackers and see what they were after, though it took steps to isolate vital commercial information, such as reader email addresses and subscriber information, behind security walls. &quot;We let them play in our environment so that we could watch what tools they were using and watch what they were doing,&quot; Frons said. The Wall Street Journal said on Thursday that its computer systems had also been been infiltrated by Chinese hackers trying to monitor the newspaper&apos;s coverage of China. Despite the vociferous denials the exposure of the hacking is likely to be a source of public embarrassment to Beijing. Yet it is unlikely to blunt its extensive activities when it comes to conducting cyber warfare. Experts say the contours of a Chinese cyber attack have become familiar. They begin with slightly malfunctioning computer networks, usually at the headquarters of a military contractor, government office or multinational internet company. Sensitive files might go missing; servers may crash. While the attack&apos;s surreptitious nature allows Chinese authorities to hide behind a veneer of deniability, security firms have discovered a number of uncanny similarities among such incidents. Most targeted groups could pose some threat to the Chinese government. They include American military contractors, Tibetan and Uyghur independence groups, activist networks, and lately, western media organizations. Bloomberg was hacked after publishing a similar expos\u00e9 last summer. According to the UK-based cyber-security researcher Greg Walton, western experts know a fair amount about Chinese hackers&apos; methods \u2013 their &quot;tools, techniques and procedures,&quot; in information technology parlance. &quot;But we know very little about the people behind these machines,&quot; he said. &quot;If we want to tackle a problem of such complexity, and of such danger to civil society networks transnationally, were going to have to do a tremendous amount of research into the people behind these programs.&quot; Cyber security companies suggest that the Chinese government and military employ a vast army of hackers, carrying out a covert spy campaign against organizations that it feels run counter to their interests. They operate in places like Shanghai and coastal Shandong Province, but usually avoid detection by tunnelling through easily-infiltrated computers at servers and universities in the United States. The New York Times investigation found that they typically begin working at 8am and adhere to a standard office schedule. Their organizational structure is still unclear \u2013 the hackers could be on the People&apos;s Liberation Army&apos;s payroll, or just as easily be loosely-affiliated vigilante organizations operating with tacit government approval, like renegade consulting companies. &quot;If anything, the fact that these groups aren&apos;t being run by the Chinese government makes the problem worse,&quot; Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert at a telecommunications company in London, wrote on the Discovery Channel&apos;s tech blog last year. &quot;Without central political coordination, they&apos;re likely to take more risks, do more stupid things and generally ignore the political fallout of their actions.&quot; The hackers frequently use a technique called &quot;spear phishing,&quot; in which they send a piece of malware to a target via email; the hapless user may then download malicious files by clicking on a seemingly innocuous attachment. Chinese hackers have used this technique to compromise the Gmail accounts of senior US, South Korean and Australian government officials, and have attempted to access the White House&apos;s Military Office, home to the US&apos;s nuclear launch codes. In November, Bloomberg reported that a Silicon Valley-based software engineer was hacked shortly after filing a civil lawsuit against Chinese authorities. The firm spent months under digital siege \u2013 hackers shut down its web servers, gained access to confidential files, and spied on an employee with her own webcam. The intrusions drove the company to the brink of bankruptcy. &quot;If they could just put the company out of business, the lawsuit goes away,&quot; the engineer told Bloomberg. &quot;They didn&apos;t need guys with guns or someone to break my kneecaps.&quot;", "tags": ["New York Times", "Cybercrime", "China", "Media", "Technology", "US news", "World news", "New York"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-31T18:29:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/03/why-india-lags-behind-china", "sentences": ["The current focus is on pushing investment towards the more undeveloped west side of the country, which is making huge strides in infrastructure and otherdevelopment, to draw living standards towards Shanghai and the rest of the eastern economic zones."], "title": "Letters: Why India lags behind China", "article": "Timothy Garton Ash raises an important question (Come on, India! Show us freedom can triumph, 31 January) but poses it badly by exaggerating how free Indians are. Yes, the metropolitan elite can speak and write with reasonable freedom and this is important. And yes, according to the constitution everyone should enjoy these freedoms. But for people who are neither rich nor well-connected this can seem irrelevant. The reality, certainly in much of central India, is that landlords and employers behave as petty tyrants, confident that the newspapers, which depend on them for advertising, will not report abuses and that the local judiciary, composed of friends and relatives, would protect them in the unlikely event of a sacked employee, evicted smallholder or victim of violence trying to obtain justice. Privatisation is unlikely to tackle these problems as private businessmen and landlords are key culprits. It is true the police often do their bidding, but not quite as reliably as the private armies which larger businesses employ. As petty tyranny breeds incompetent management and low pay makes for the inefficient use of labour, it seems plausible that it is precisely the lack of freedom and poor human rights which hold back the Indian economy. The question is then why a lack of freedom appears to be less damaging in China.Margaret DickinsonLondon \u2022\u2008Timothy Garton Ash makes several valid points, but also misleads. His comparisons of India and China omit the fact that economic inequality in China greatly exceeds that of India. He appears not to know that the current Indian government, in its first term (2004-09), spent over $57bn on poverty programmes \u2013 greatly in excess of any previous government, or of the Chinese. And he is wrong about Indian politicians buying the votes of the poor. Even illiterate voters are too canny to be duped, and they have thrown out the more moneyed parties at state and national elections on a majority of occasions since the late 70s.Professor James ManorInstitute of Commonwealth Studies \u2022\u2008What a desperate series of excuses Timothy Garton Ash pours out to &quot;explain&quot; why India lags so far behind China in development, with one-third of the per-capita income, terrible poverty etc. Religion, ossifying British bureaucracy, huge diversity etc are hamstrings, he pleads. But China has just as many ethnic groups, had a stultifying imperial bureaucracy and major religious backwardness etc. The difference is, it tore them all up and started again: it was called a revolution, and established a planned economy or, to be brief, socialism. The decades using major capitalist investment for economic propulsion are not an error, though it has brought its own dangers, not least importing western attitudes and dire consumerism, and weakening the Leninist side of what Garton Ash wants to describe as &quot;Leninist capitalism&quot; (a devious non-Marxist term). But China remains a socialist state, running capitalism as a technical and economic mechanism but only under an overall political state plan. This is far more controlled than the chase-the-short-term-profit laissez-faire of untrammelled capital (euphemistically called &quot;democracy&quot;) and gets the results \u2013 in just 30 years at that. The current focus is on pushing investment towards the more undeveloped west side of the country, which is making huge strides in infrastructure and otherdevelopment, to draw living standards towards Shanghai and the rest of the eastern economic zones. This state control is what has allowed the growth not only to do better than India but surge right past it.Don HoskinsEconomic &amp; Philosophic Science Review \u2022\u2008Timothy Garton Ash provides a timely reminder of the need for broader-based social development in the subcontinent but stops short of taking India&apos;s government to task. The state in India is engaged in a curious strategy of allowing schools, hospitals and other government services to atrophy while dispensing huge sums via populist development programmes. How this strategy will play out is unclear, but in the meantime the poor are taking things into their own hands, and it is interesting that on the day of this article, a huge demonstration against manual scavenging reached its climax in Delhi.Craig JeffreyOxford", "tags": ["India", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-03T21:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/04/ping-fu-book-chinese-critics", "sentences": ["A Shanghai newspaper learned of her groundbreaking research and &quot;called for an end to the madness&quot; in an editorial comment subsequently republished by the People&apos;s Daily \u2013 in what would have been an astonishing move for the staid official Communist party newspaper."], "title": "Chinese cast doubt over executive's rags to riches tale", "article": "Her story is an incredible tale of triumph over tragedy: a tormented childhood during China&apos;s Cultural Revolution, detention and forced exile after exposing female infanticide \u2013 then glittering success as the head of a major US technology firm. &quot;It sounds too unbelievable for fiction, but this is the true story of a life in two worlds,&quot; enthuses the website for Ping Fu&apos;s autobiography, Bend Not Break. In one interview to promote the book, the entrepreneur related how Michelle Obama had invited her back to the White House for a nightcap after the 2010 State of the Union address. But after Chinese readers flagged up a series of inconsistencies and improbabilities in interviews she has given, Fu has been forced to defend her book from accusations that some of it is exaggerated or untrue. &quot;I am shocked and saddened by the things that have been said,&quot; Fu told the Guardian. &quot;It is very, very hurtful because it brings me right back to what happened to me when I was eight years old.&quot; Fu is chief executive and cofounder of the 3D software company Geomagic, whose laser scanning technology has been used by Hollywood film studios, car designers and historians making a precise replica of the Statue of Liberty. She arrived in the US aged 25, passing through college and spells as a babysitter, cleaner and waitress before rising to her current position as a prominent business executive and board member of the White House advisory panel, the National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Many of the questions swirling around Bend Not Break relate to the 54-year-old&apos;s horrifying account of being wrenched from her parents when the Cultural Revolution started in 1966, and sent to a re-education camp where she was gang-raped at the age of 10. An estimated 36 million people were persecuted during the turmoil of that time and numerous families were torn apart. But sceptics, including Fang Zhouzi, an influential blogger who scrutinises Chinese academia, say much of Fu&apos;s story does not ring true. Fu has now acknowledged that her 2010 account to NPR radio of being forced to watch Red Guards executing a teacher by using four horses to tear the victim apart was an &quot;emotional memory&quot; and probably wrong. &quot;When I was young, these are the stories being told to us and in my nightmares they come back again and again. That time was so traumatic. I was taken away from my parents,&quot; she said. But she now accepts that her imagination may have played tricks. &quot;Somehow in my mind I always thought I saw it, but now I&apos;m not sure my memory served me right. I probably saw it in a movie or something, and I acknowledge that&apos;s a problem.&quot; There are also queries about the circumstances surrounding her departure from China. The opening line of the book reads: &quot;When I was 25 years old, the Chinese government quietly deported me.&quot; Sceptics point out that usually only prominent dissidents go into exile by arrangement. Fu said she hadn&apos;t used &quot;deported&quot; in the draft of her memoir. The word was suggested as an amendment by her co-author and editors as a way to &quot;attract readers&quot;. But she added that by the dictionary definition it was accurate to say she had been deported. &quot;If you are asked to leave your country and it is not voluntary, that is a form of deportation.&quot; According to Fu&apos;s book, she was forced to leave because of her university thesis on female infanticide prompted by the one-child policy. A Shanghai newspaper learned of her groundbreaking research and &quot;called for an end to the madness&quot; in an editorial comment subsequently republished by the People&apos;s Daily \u2013 in what would have been an astonishing move for the staid official Communist party newspaper. That sparked an international outcry and her detention, she wrote. After Fang said he found no trace of the commentary, Fu responded in a column in the Huffington Post: &quot;I remember reading an editorial in a newspaper in 1982 that called for gender equality. It was not a news article and not written by me, and I didn&apos;t know it had anything to do with my research. When writing the book, I did not name the paper, since I wasn&apos;t certain. However, I think that is where I read the editorial because it was the most popular and official newspaper.&quot; Adrian Zackheim, publisher of Portfolio books, Penguin&apos;s business imprint, said he stood by Bend Not Break, adding that he had &quot;absolute confidence&quot; in Fu and her memoir. &quot;I have no doubts that the book is substantially correct and that attempts to pick apart elements of it are political attacks.&quot; Zackheim said Portfolio had no plans to look into the veracity of the book. &quot;This is a memoir of a woman&apos;s life, it&apos;s not a work of journalism.

Confirming her retirement at the age of 23, with two Olympic golds and two bronze medals in her drawer and as the 800m freestyle world record holder, Britain&apos;s most decorated swimmer of modern times looked forward to her own next chapter but she leaves British Swimming at a crossroads. &quot;I hate the word retire. I&apos;ll never retire from swimming, it&apos;s something I&apos;ll always love to do. But as an elite athlete I won&apos;t be swimming competitively any more,&quot; she said, basking in the deserved plaudits of everyone from Lord Coe to Ian Thorpe for her achievements. While an appearance on Strictly is not out of the question, there is one route she joked she was determined not to go down: &quot;Everyone keeps saying to me, why don&apos;t you get really fat and then do a fitness DVD? That&apos;s not really my aim.&quot; Instead she unveiled a new long-term goal every bit as ambitious as winning four Olympic medals \u2013 to ensure that every child leaves primary school able to swim 25 metres through her new Swim Stars programme. Adlington insisted she felt no angst and not a little relief at having finally made the decision to quit competitive swimming after getting back in the pool at Christmas. &quot;It was a gradual thing. It was one of those things that just seemed right. I never once considered retiring after Beijing but it was something that I had to consider after London, particularly being a distance swimmer. The girl who won [the 800m freestyle] in London was 15. I&apos;m 23. I did feel old, sad to say,&quot; said Adlington, who said she had ticked off all her post-Beijing goals. &quot;I wanted to go to a Commonwealths, I wanted to get a medal at a world championships. It was the perfect time to end on a high. Some want to milk it for as long as they can and others want to finish at the top. Ever since I was 12 or 13 I&apos;ve wanted to finish on a high. I don&apos;t want to keep dragging it out.&quot; Adlington was elated to win bronze in the 400m freestyle in London, starting in lane eight having narrowly crept into the final, but she was visibly upset at only coming third in the 800m. Yet she collected two thirds of Team GB&apos;s swimming medals, with her team-mates failing to convert the promise of the trials to the Games themselves. Having gone from wide-eyed Olympic debutant to old hand she made her own contribution to the soul searching that followed, criticising British Swimming for not consulting the athletes on what went wrong. But she insisted the performance was not as calamitous as it was portrayed. With Bill Furniss, her coach since the age of 12, installed as the new British Swimming head coach and a new performance director in Chris Spice, who formerly had the same role for rugby union, hockey and basketball, she said she hoped to stay involved: &quot;We&apos;ve got to let Chris and Bill come in and make their changes and then I&apos;ll see where I can fit in.&quot; Furniss once called her a &quot;Jekyll and Hyde character&quot; as he described the contrast between her bubbly demeanour out of the pool and her fierce competitiveness in it. Even in retiring Adlington showed flashes of the steely streak that has made her Britain&apos;s&apos;s most successful swimmer of the modern era. She said that while &quot;Beijing was everything&quot; and irrevocably changed her life\u00a0\u2013\u00a0she came home to find her local swimming pool had been renamed in her honour, a pair of Jimmy Choos from the Mayor of Mansfield and her family under\u00a0siege from the media \u2013 her gold and silver at the 2011 world championships in Shanghai were memorable for different reasons. &quot;In Beijing I was always seen as the underdog and afterwards it completely changed. Everything was so different, the attention was different. I noticed after 2010 I was getting older and needed more recovery. In Shanghai it felt as though I was back. That was the first time I realised I could still do this.&quot; Adlington spoke too of the difficulties she had coping with the glare of the media spotlight after returning from Beijing and of how she could help younger athletes cope with the same transition. &quot;As a 19-year-old girl, it was having to deal with people wanting to take a photograph and talk to me. I didn&apos;t understand why they wanted to talk to me. I eat, sleep, swim, that&apos;s all I do,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;m not interesting at all. It was hard to deal with, it was overwhelming. But Beijing was without a doubt the best moment of my entire career.&quot; Adlington said she was now committed to using her profile to encourage schools and local authorities to sign up to her Swim Stars programme. &quot;It always shocks me that swimming is not on the national curriculum, because it&apos;s such a life skill. We learn how to walk and run but we don&apos;t learn how to swim,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;ve got these floods and we live on an island! It&apos;s shocking to me that people can&apos;t swim. It&apos;s not about hammering the government, it&apos;s just hopefully about speaking to the right people, being more involved and learning more about it.&quot; More pressingly, there is a party on Saturday to celebrate her achievements. And if she has gained new confidence out of the water, she also hopes that she has bequeathed her former team-mates more belief in it. &quot;No one ever expected a swimmer from this country to get two golds before Beijing,&quot; she said. &quot;Hopefully the younger\u00a0guys coming up can see that it is possible. I&apos;m just a girl from Mansfield and I&apos;ve done it.&quot;", "tags": ["Rebecca Adlington", "Swimming", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Sport", "Team GB"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-05T10:09:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/05/finnegans-wake-china-james-joyce-hit", "sentences": ["It begins: &quot;riverrun, past Eve and Adam&apos;s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.&quot; So the 41-year-old professor at Shanghai&apos;s Fudan University was incredulous when the translation became a surprise bestseller in China after hitting shelves last month.", "Backed by an elaborate billboard ad campaign, the first volume of &quot;Fennigen de Shouling Ye&quot; sold out its first run of 8,000 copies and reached number two on a prestigious bestseller list in Shanghai, second only to a biography of Deng Xiaoping."], "title": "Finnegans Wake becomes a hit book in China", "article": "After spending eight years translating the first third of James Joyce&apos;s famously opaque novel Finnegans Wake into Chinese, Dai Congrong assumed it was a labour of love rather than money. The book&apos;s language is thick with multilingual puns and brazenly defies grammatical conventions. It begins: &quot;riverrun, past Eve and Adam&apos;s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.&quot; So the 41-year-old professor at Shanghai&apos;s Fudan University was incredulous when the translation became a surprise bestseller in China after hitting shelves last month. Backed by an elaborate billboard ad campaign, the first volume of &quot;Fennigen de Shouling Ye&quot; sold out its first run of 8,000 copies and reached number two on a prestigious bestseller list in Shanghai, second only to a biography of Deng Xiaoping. Sales of 30,000 are considered &quot;cause for celebration&quot; according to Chinese publisher Gray Tan, so 8,000 in a month has made Joyce a distinctly hot property. Ian McEwan, for instance, is considered pretty buzzy in translation, but the print run of Atonement was only 5,000 copies. &quot;At first I felt very surprised, and I feel very surprised now still,&quot; says Dai. &quot;I thought my readers would be scholars and writers, and it wouldn&apos;t be so popular.&quot; She traces her love of Ulysses back to her time as a doctoral student at Nanjing University in the late 90s \u2013 the novel was first translated into Chinese in 1995. With some prodding from her academic adviser, she decided to tackle Finnegans Wake in 2004 and signed a translation contract with a publishing agency two years later. Joyce is a recent arrival to China. His work was shunned as bourgeois western literature under Mao Zedong \u2013 A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man wasn&apos;t translated into Chinese until 1975, a year before Mao&apos;s death. And not for lack of demand. When a Chinese version of Ulysses hit shelves just under 20 years later, it promptly sold 85,000 copies. Dai ventures that Chinese readers may appreciate Joyce&apos;s rumination on the cyclical nature of history, the relationships between his male and female characters, and the sheer challenge of interpreting his prose. She describes translating Joyce&apos;s famous stream-of-consciousness writing style as an enormous challenge. &quot;The things I lost are mostly the sentences, because Joyce&apos;s sentences are so different from common sentences,&quot; she says, adding that she often broke them up into shorter, simpler phrases \u2013 otherwise, the average reader &quot;would think that I just mistranslated Joyce. So my translation is more clear than the original book.&quot; Yet she took great pains to remain as faithful to the original as possible. &quot;For example, there was a phrase in Finnegans Wake that said &apos;sputtering hand&apos;, which might mean shaky. If I translated it as &apos;shaky hand&apos;, that would be OK \u2013 in Chinese it&apos;s a good sentence. However, I just translated it as &apos;sputtering hand&apos;. Sputtering and hand cannot be put together in Chinese grammar, but I put the two together anyway.&quot; Dai was originally cowed by the scale of the undertaking \u2013 the French translation took 30 years to complete \u2013 and occasionally considered quitting. &quot;It is a kind of torture,&quot; she said. &quot;In China, translation is not regarded as an academic achievement \u2013 I have to publish first, and then give my own time to translation.&quot; She often quarrelled with her husband (he wanted her to go to bed; she wanted to stay awake and translate), and was driven to distraction trying to balance the project with family. &quot;My body suffered from the work, working every night,&quot; she said. &quot;I looked older than I should be. My eyes became dark, and my skin wasn&apos;t that good either.&quot; Her contract covers the remaining two-thirds of the novel, and despite the long hours, she has no qualms about continuing. &quot;I think it&apos;s a very great book \u2013 after I read Finnegans Wake\u2026 I&apos;ll think oh, this writer used a sentence that&apos;s too traditional, too simple, and if he can experiment more with his sentences then he might be able to express different things.&quot; &quot;Finnegans Wake made me believe that Joyce is a writer who is never satisfied with what he&apos;s already accomplished,&quot; she continues. &quot;His spirit is very strong.&quot; That is one thing they have in common.

All our poems in the coming year will relate to London and its history, and many will be by London poets. We hope the poems will also reflect the city in its diversity, a refuge for exiles and immigrants and a beacon for visitors from all over the world. Our first set of Poems on the Underground appears on the tube next week. It includes work by the young Ghanaian poet Nii Ayikwei Parkes and the distinguished Jamaican poet Lorna Goodison, as well as WB Yeats at 50 (&quot;a solitary man, / In a crowded London shop&quot;), all writing about aspects of London that might not be familiar to the average tube traveller. Nii Parkes describes the longing of a\u00a0Ghanaian youth for comradeship in a\u00a0cold city indifferent to his plight: &quot;With reluctance I accepted the faux / deafness and odd looks my Accra greetings / attracted, but I couldn&apos;t quell my deep / yearning for contact, warmth, recognition.&quot; Lorna Goodison writes about a Jamaican teacher forced to work as a charwoman in the West End: &quot;She sings &apos;Jerusalem&apos; to herself and / recites the Romantic poets as she mops hallways and / scours toilets.&quot; Some tube travellers will relate to these experiences directly; others will see their city in a new way. Jo Shapcott&apos;s Gherkin Music and Connie Bensley&apos;s wry ode to the Northern line, Station, add their own contemporary notes to the general mix. Wordsworth, too, will be appearing on the tube next week. Only a poet born and raised in the Lake District could describe London at dawn with the enthusiasm of his famous sonnet: &quot;Earth has not anything to show more fair&quot;. Upon Westminster Bridge circled the tube in an earlier series of London poems; this time we chose lines from The Prelude describing the poet&apos;s impressions as a youth of 18, intoxicated by the city&apos;s ceaseless activity: &quot;The river proudly bridged, the giddy top / And Whispering Gallery of St Pauls \u2026 Streets without end and churches numberless, / Statues with flowery gardens in vast squares.&quot; Visitors, exiles, immigrants \u2013 these are among the voices we hope to offer the travelling public, along with the more familiar voices of native Londoners. I love to imagine Karl Marx, thrown out of every country in Europe, making his way from his Soho lodgings to his usual seat in the British Museum reading room, using government Blue Books to document the inevitable collapse of capitalism. His later follower, Bertolt Brecht, in flight from Nazi Germany, described his London experience in The Caledonian Market and Buying Oranges: &quot;In yellow fog along Southampton Street / Suddenly a fruit barrow, and an old hag\u00a0/ Beneath a lamp, fingering a paper bag. / I stood surprised and dumb like one who sees / What he&apos;s been after, right before his eyes. / Oranges! Always oranges, as of old!&quot; London&apos;s underground, like the Paris metro and the New York subway, has always fascinated writers, both in its own right and as a metaphor for travel, transport, being underground, and emerging into the light. Ezra Pound&apos;s Japanese haiku, In a Station of\u00a0the Metro, applies equally well to the tube: &quot;The apparition of these faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet, black bough.&quot; In anthologies of prose and poetry about London, the obvious names recur: Dickens for prose, Betjeman for verse, Byron for satire (&quot;A\u00a0mighty mass of brick and smoke and shipping / Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye / can reach\u2026 A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown / On a fool&apos;s head \u2013 and there is London town!&quot;). Blake, the quintessential London poet, writes as a biblical prophet raging against his own tribe: &quot;I\u00a0wander thro&apos; each charter&apos;d street, / Near where the charter&apos;d Thames does flow / And mark in every face I meet / Marks of weakness, marks of woe.&quot; This is probably too strong for the tube, but we might feature the visionary lines from Blake&apos;s Jerusalem: &quot;The fields from Islington to Marybone, / To Primrose Hill and Saint\u00a0John&apos;s Wood, / Were builded over\u00a0with pillars of gold, / And there Jerusalem&apos;s pillars stood.&quot; One of the earliest London poems, attributed to the Scottish poet William Dunbar, is even more glowing: &quot;London, thou art the flower of cities all!&quot; The city is large and various enough to contain multitudes, paradoxes, love and its opposite. It&apos;s exciting for us to find a Chinese dissident poet, Yang Lian, celebrating the Lee Valley, Hackney and Stoke Newington in Chinese, with English translations by half a dozen UK poets. (&quot;Hackney is like a short Chinese verse&quot; the poet writes \u2013 a thought that might surprise many Hackney residents.)

Police arrived to interview the singer shortly after he announced that the performance, which took place in Beijing last November, was dedicated &quot;to the spirit and talent of Ai Weiwei&quot;, according to two sources. One said officers wanted John&apos;s manager to sign a statement saying the dedication was inspired only by admiration for Ai&apos;s art. John&apos;s spokesman declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Ai and John met briefly before the Beijing show, with Ai subsequently announcing to fans on Twitter: &quot;I super like him.&quot; John was allowed to go ahead with a scheduled concert in Guangzhou in early December. But the English language edition of state-run newspaper Global Times attacked John. It said the singer was &quot;disrespectful&quot; when he &quot;forcibly added political content to the concert&quot;, adding: &quot;If they had known that this concert would be dedicated to Ai Weiwei, many in the audience would not have come. &quot;John&apos;s action will also make the relevant agencies further hesitate in future when they invite foreign artists ... [He] has raised difficulties for future arts exchanges between China and other countries,&quot; the newspaper said in an editorial. The singer&apos;s remarks even prompted the culture minister, Cai Wu, to demand that only stars with university degrees be allowed to play in China in future, according to two sources. They said that days after the concert, Cai gathered those who deal with visiting foreign artists and announced that only graduates should be given performance licences. One source said officials believed it would be difficult to implement the edict, and both suggested it may have been a spur of the moment comment. A culture ministry spokesman said there were no new regulations. They did not address specific questions that the Guardian had asked regarding the meeting, replying: &quot;About what you said in the fax, there is no such thing&quot;. Another source said that since the start of the year, classical musicians had been required to supply proof of degrees and other qualifications when applying for permission to tour China. &quot;There is no doubt at all it has made things harder,&quot; said one of those with knowledge of the meeting, adding that several recent applications for licences had been rejected. &quot;They are looking closely at videos, making sure that the people on stage are exactly the same as in the visa applications, and so on. It&apos;s not a change in the rules as much as a tightening [of existing procedures].&quot; A fourth source said he was not aware of the ministerial meeting, but that local cultural officials had summoned promoters within a fortnight of the incident to remind them of event rules, which included appearances by foreign artists.

Juve, twice winners and seven-time finalists in Europe&apos;s elite club competition, feel like contenders again after the traumas endured in the wake of Calciopoli and the spluttered attempts since to regain lost status. They will emerge into the din at Parkhead on Tuesday a side wary that an awkward evening awaits, but a club that is joyfully bursting back to prominence. The Old Lady of Italian football is revived. It has been a laborious route back. The match-fixing scandal had disgraced the club, condemning them to Serie B back in 2006, wrecking their reputation and gutting what had been an imposing team. Even if life in the second tier was limited to a solitary promotion-winning season, there was a dissatisfaction attached to subsequent campaigns, even those which flirted with the Champions League once more. It said much that Gianluigi Buffon, the only remaining member of the pre-scandal playing staff, recognised this season&apos;s European campaign as a return &quot;through the front door&quot;. This time round they are league champions, Italy&apos;s flag-bearers proper and essentially the team who eliminated the holders, Chelsea, in the group stages. Off the pitch the sparkling new 41,000-seat Juventus stadium, scene of Roberto Di Matteo&apos;s last stand at Chelsea back in November, has offered an opportunity for a fresh start, complete with facilities like those taken for granted in the Premier League if considered eye-catching in Italy. From executive boxes to swish restaurants the corporate experience represents progress in a ground that belongs to the club as opposed to the dilapidated state-owned homes of most of Juve&apos;s rivals. They are generating income off the pitch which can fuel ambitions on it. January may have been relatively quiet but Nicolas Anelka has arrived on loan from Shanghai Shenhua, a decade after he almost signed for the club, and Spain&apos;s Fernando Llorente will join under the Bosman ruling in the summer. Juve retain the pull of old and over the last 19 months have swept all before them. Managers had come and gone in the period since the darkest days, from Claudio Ranieri to Ciro Ferrara, Alberto Zaccheroni to Gigi Del Neri, though it was only when Conte returned in May 2011 to the club where he won a European Cup in 1996 that the team was heaved on to another level. The achievements of a man whose top-flight experience had previously amounted to a fraught three-month tenure at Atalanta have been remarkable. Last season&apos;s Scudetto, technically Juve&apos;s first in nine years, was claimed without a game lost. Saturday&apos;s victory over Fiorentina means they are five points clear again this term. Conte has endured his own traumas, not least the four-month touchline ban for his alleged part in the match-fixing scandal and which left him on the outside looking in as his side gathered momentum in their Champions League qualifying group. Yet even then the 43-year-old&apos;s impact remained clear. &quot;Conte has brought back the &apos;Juventus style&apos;, something which is not really understood outside Juve,&quot; said Marcello Lippi, who had claimed this competition with Conte in his midfield against Ajax in Rome 17 years ago. &quot;His team have speed, style and determination and are well organised. They work hard for each other, all aspects of the Juve DNA but which had been lost.&quot; There is class to go with the tenacity. Tactically Conte is cute and, perhaps critically, more adaptable than some. When he returned to the club in the summer of 2011 he had been intent on employing a 4-2-4 reliant on feverish pressing and energy, only for Andrea Pirlo&apos;s arrival from Milan to force a rethink. The integration of the veteran alongside Claudio Marchisio and Arturo Vidal in a three-man midfield has been key to the team&apos;s smooth progress since, the manager having recognised that area as his side&apos;s forte with the trio a blur of slick interchanges, a unit that functions sweetly. The 4-3-3 has become 3-5-2 and even 3-3-4, constantly morphing. Chelsea never truly came to terms with that flexibility in either tie. In Turin they were pulled out of defensive shape and, eventually, ripped to shreds. There has been shrewd investment, not least across the back line and Kwadwo Asamoah has already proved in this competition that a player once considered a midfield playmaker can flourish as a left wing-back. The hope is that Anelka this term, and Llorente next, add a menacing presence to a front-line heavily reliant upon Mirko Vucinic being in the mood. &quot;We are building something very good here,&quot; said Conte. &quot;It is only a matter of time before we really challenge [for a European Cup] and I just ask our fans to be a bit patient.&quot; Dousing the expectation may be wishful thinking with the momentum that has been built up. Celtic have beaten Barcelona this season but, potentially, they will face a more trying evening against a team who are patient out of possession but eager to spring on the counter. &quot;They have an extremely compact collective and it actually helps that they lack a &apos;star&apos; player,&quot; said Jose Mourinho recently of the Italians. &quot;They remind me of my Porto side in 2004.&quot; That team claimed this trophy.

You can see it in Liverpool, where north of the Liver building several skinny towers of luxury flats crane their necks over the Mersey; you can see it in Leeds, where student-housing skyscrapers dominate the post-industrial city; you can see it in Manchester and Birmingham, where luxury housing towers are dominant in the way that mill chimneys once were. Almost all of the towers you can see in those city centres are recent \u2013 products of the last boom; the residential towers of public housing stretching out from the centre are from earlier times. London shows this to its greatest extent. Each new tower is a little icon, named after an everyday object \u2013 the Gherkin, the Philishave, soon the Cheese Grater, the Walkie-Talkie and the Quill; and of course the Shard, where a 72-floor viewing gallery has just opened to the public. If the old council towers and office blocks were functional and egalitarian, these are skyscrapers, hierarchical, private and instantly recognisable, half-a-dozen little logos. All of them were given the go-ahead by Labour councils, in the case of London, by the seemingly radical Livingstone mayoralty. Most of these were the kind of buildings that Labour politicians would once have campaigned against. How did this happen? In 1987, independent local government in Britain effectively died. For several years, leftwing Labour councils had set up power bases, usually with great public support, to do what Labour councils had always done, or at least always liked to think they had done \u2013 build public housing, build public facilities, serve the people that elected them. Branded by the tabloids as the &quot;loony left&quot; and disdained by the Labour leadership, they were a varied bunch: the selfconsciously new left of the Greater London council (GLC), with its then-novel sensitivity to issues of gender, race, sexuality and international politics, and its predilection for bad mid-80s pop; the strange Trotskyist-Labourist melange of Liverpool council, which recklessly took the government on directly; and several others, such as Sheffield, Lambeth and Manchester, somewhere in between. In 1986, the governing bodies of British urban areas \u2013 the metropolitan county councils of Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, South and West Yorkshire, Tyneside, Greater London and Merseyside, created so that cities could be run like the massive, complex entities they are rather than as quasi-medieval independent boroughs \u2013 were suddenly abolished. Councils were rate-capped, so they could no longer build or spend like they used to. Defying that, as Liverpool did, meant dismissal from office. Most councils desperately hoped they would be saved by Labour winning the 1987 election. It didn&apos;t, of course, and councils suddenly had no raison d&apos;etre. They couldn&apos;t really do anything any more. After a few years of flailing around in search of a point, the cleverer ones \u2013 Manchester city council, or the GLC&apos;s shadow, the Greater London authority (GLA), discovered a\u00a0new purpose. It&apos;s no exaggeration to say that the new skylines, culminating in the towering glazed spike of Italian architect Renzo Piano&apos;s Shard, owe their existence to this moment. They are inadvertent monuments to the routing of municipal socialism in the mid-1980s. It happened under the enthusiastic watch of Ken Livingstone, once leader of the most powerful of the &quot;loony left&apos;s&quot; town halls. Livingstone did, after all, start his victory speech after winning the 2000 mayoral election with the words &quot;before I was so rudely interrupted&quot;. Twelve years later and out of power, Livingstone still evidently sees the Shard, like the Olympics, as one of his triumphs; as a more apparently inclusive and public-spirited skyscraper than most.           It&apos;s strange, given that Livingstone had never previously shown much sign of being a modernist in his architectural tastes. In the early 1980s, the GLC was partisan in a fight over Coin Street, a south London post-industrial site. Developers had proposed a &quot;mixed-use development&quot; designed by Richard Rogers, a young modern architect with socialist sympathies. Rather than the heavily zoned monocultures of previous versions of modernism, Rogers and his developers wanted everything happening at once \u2013 flats, cafes, offices, public spaces, designed in a snazzily metallic architectural style, with staggered skylines and emphasising its contrasts and shapes. Livingstone helped get this scheme defeated, in favour of Coin Street Community Builders, which proposed \u2013 and built \u2013 a scheme of low-rise, low-density, traditionalist stock-brick houses. Community architecture was one of the main enthusiasms of the &quot;loony left&quot; councils. Its meaning often shifted, but it generally meant a way of building public housing that was based on close public consultation rather than de-haut-en-bas state provision, on what was called the &quot;human scale&quot; (as if skyscrapers weren&apos;t something that only humans could ever conceive), on the &quot;vernacular&quot; (which, in the absence of craft traditions, meant building stuff to blend in with what was there already). It ranged in style from the magnificent, confident Byker estate in Newcastle, with its metropolitan scale and architectural warmth, wit and complexity \u2013 to the deeply conservative, low-density, Barratt Homes-like estates built by Liverpool. This was the stuff that set 80s Labour councillors&apos; pulses racing \u2013 the high-end hi-tech of Rogers was not to their taste. Something happened to Labour&apos;s architectural ambitions after 1987. By 1992, Rogers had co-written, with then Labour shadow culture secretary Mark Fisher, a manifesto called A New London. They presented a new architecture and urbanism that flourished on the continent but had no equivalent in Britain. The book showed public housing in the Netherlands, designed in witty, modern forms by young architects Meccanoo; the Olympic village in Barcelona, with its wide streets, mix of uses, cultural facilities and public spaces; and of course the Centre\u00a0Pompidou in Paris, designed by Rogers himself with his one-time partner, Piano. The report argued for opening up the Thames and other post-industrial sites with public-spirited architecture of curved glass and expressive steel. After Labour came to power, Rogers was appointed as head of John Prescott&apos;s Urban Task Force (to investigate the causes of urban decline) and adviser on architecture to the GLA. This European model was going to be given its opportunity, and with the very public support of Mayor Livingstone.     West Tower in Liverpool ... 'The days when the tallest buildings could be council housing are long gone.' Photograph: Christopher Thomond    How this managed to seduce is not hard to guess. In Berlin, Bilbao, Rotterdam and, most of all, in Barcelona, Labour politicians found a novel aesthetic for municipal post-socialism. Modern, but not in the harsh, severe way favoured in the 1960s, when most of these people cut their teeth as young new left radicals, mortified by the concrete cities taking shape around them. It was leisured, sexy, architecturally dramatic and attractive. It was also, importantly, &quot;business friendly&quot;, which suggested some ways in which cash-strapped local authorities might manage to extract much-needed capital. So a Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment was set up to guarantee architectural quality, and the mayor proclaimed that dozens of new public spaces would be created. A developer was planning a &quot;tallest building in Europe&quot; near London Bridge and, after much lobbying, Broadway Malyan, the multinational hacks responsible for the notoriously hideous St George&apos;s Wharf flats by Vauxhall bridge, were replaced with Piano. Instead of the cheap postmodernist tat that defined its 1980s architecture, London would have as its city-crown a monument lovingly crafted by a world-renowned architect, who would create something entirely unique, a sheer spire of steel and glass. &quot;Community architecture&quot; would have entailed something tweedy, worthy and useful on the site, but that was long forgotten. But what of the social functions that councils still had to provide? Unable to seriously borrow, or in the case of the GLA even to tax, other means were necessary. Local authorities all over the country favoured the section 106 agreement \u2013 a form of &quot;planning gain&quot; where developers were legally obliged to provide some sort of public infrastructure as part of their schemes. A complicated game of percentages began. New &quot;luxury&quot; housing developments, of which there have been hundreds since 1997, were obliged by the GLA to provide around 40% &quot;affordable&quot; housing. In theory, this could replace the now-impossible provision of new council housing. Except for another percentage \u2013 the definition of &quot;affordable&quot; is 80% of market rent, which prices out nearly all council tenants. This should have been obvious early on, but it was passed over in silence. Livingstone, convinced of the virtues of skyscrapers after being dazzled by a visit to Shanghai, made the new City skyline a major source of section 106 agreements. Again, this was unexpected. The old corporate skyline \u2013 the NatWest tower (now Tower 42) and Centre Point \u2013 was never popular, least of all among leftish activists. Centre Point, so famously empty that a London homelessness charity was named after it, was specifically cited by one community architecture group, the Architects&apos; Revolutionary Council, which wanted to ensure that &quot;every time an architectural student passes a building like Centre Point he vows that he will never work in a practice that is involved in such obscenities&quot;. The new towers would be different, however. They wouldn&apos;t really be different in function \u2013 most were office blocks for financial institutions, though the Shard&apos;s sheer vastness eventually demanded something more complex \u2013 but they would certainly be different in aesthetic. More friendly, more optimistic, more &quot;inclusive&quot; than the austere or aggressive towers of earlier eras.     The gherkin ... first of the 'cuddly' skyscrapers. Photograph: Grant Smith/Alamy    The Gherkin was clearly the first of these new cuddly skyscrapers. Its originally much-vaunted green technologies barely worked, but its accidental masterstroke was its very name \u2013 its shape eliciting a cabbie&apos;s affectionate monicker. Subsequent towers all came ready-nicknamed \u2013 Helter-Skelter, Walkie-Talkie, Cheese Grater, Shard. Typically, they weren&apos;t much more public \u2013 the days when the tallest buildings could be council housing, like the Trellick Tower, or NHS hospitals, like Guy&apos;s Hospital Tower, neighbouring the Shard, were long gone \u2013 but they were definitely more populist. What, for instance, was the Shard&apos;s contribution to the public sphere? Well, the erection of the tallest building in the EU paid for a new bus station and roof at London Bridge station. This is the eventual upshot of this realignment of local government&apos;s priorities, this doomed attempt to do good deeds by stealth \u2013 little more than skyscrapers in exchange for bus stops. The local politicians in question laboured under the misapprehension that they were smarter than developers, that they could make the private sector play a public game. These things have their own momentum, however, and public bodies that sold this as all-inclusive &quot;regeneration&quot; rather than as a necessary Faustian pact could hardly have objected when each new regenerative structure brought a developers&apos; &quot;quarter&quot; in its train. The Shard, along with the &quot;Philishave&quot; Strata tower of luxury flats in Elephant and Castle, is part of a huge reorganisation of inner south London, involving the demolition and clearance of 1960s council estates, justified via a circular social argument (&quot;they broke up communities, so we have to break them up&quot;), the building of incessant luxury flat complexes, and the opening up of the Thames. It was all promised in A New London, except for the fact that in 1992, Rogers probably thought he would be designing council housing under a Labour government. What he actually designed in SE1 was &quot;Neo Bankside&quot;, a &quot;stunning development&quot; of three towers next to Tate Modern, the transformed Bankside power station \u2013 once a derelict structure highlighted in A New London \u2013 where you can pay \u00a31.5m for a one-bedroom flat. What exactly is the Shard? Luxury apartments, a luxury hotel, a spa, and offices, all swept up into a mute, impenetrable glass skin, owned by Qatari Diar, owners also of the publicly funded Olympic village. It&apos;s incredible to imagine that all this was supported and abetted by people who considered themselves on the left \u2013 but it was. They thought that by trying to make big business look nicer and act nicer they could manoeuvre their way to a social policy. Their mistake is now visible from every corner of London. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 February 2013.

Wang, a businessman, thinks the retired basketball star and idol of Chinese youth has it all wrong about shark fishing. At Puqi, a small town 500km south of Shanghai, the local fish factory employs about 500 people. They are far from happy that Yao has come out against eating shark fin soup. &quot;It has had an impact on our business,&quot; says Wang, head of Haideli Shark Products, which markets about 1,000 tonnes of shark meat a year. &quot;It&apos;s discouraging young people unfamiliar with this dish from eating it, maybe for ever.&quot; Inside the factory they hose down the floor, awash with shark blood. The skins lying on the ground give off a powerful fishy smell. Crates are piled high with the heads of blue sharks. Thousands of fins are spread out to dry in the open air on wire mesh resting on trestles, taking up most of the factory yard. No one can say when Puqi first specialised in butchering sharks. &quot;Long before the liberation of China,&quot; says Li Weijie, the head of a neighbouring factory, referring to the foundation of the People&apos;s Republic in 1949. In the old days methods were more rudimentary, he recalls: &quot;Just a knife and a bag of salt.&quot; But &quot;business is no good any longer,&quot; Li adds. Both he and Wang blame the adverts featuring the former National Basketball Association player, the first campaign having launched in 2009, with a follow-up a year ago. Yao wraps up the clip with a stern warning: &quot;Remember: when the buying stops, the killing can too.&quot; &quot;Society will turn against us; it&apos;s because of all the media coverage,&quot; Wang claims. &quot;They&apos;re trying to make us believe sharks are protected, which is not true.&quot; He is right. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) only covers three shark species: whale shark, basking shark and great white shark. Japan, Indonesia and China, among others, are against adding other species to the list. But according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), out of 270 species surveyed, 55% are endangered or critically endangered by over-fishing. Hammerhead sharks all over the world are under threat. In March 2010 the species almost made it onto the IUCN red list. With 75 votes for, and 45 against, the hammerhead failed to obtain the two-thirds majority required for a ban on trade. Wang consequently has no qualms about showing\u00a0us a vacuum-pack from a freezer. It contains the foetuses of three hammerhead sharks, each about 20cm long. Li assures us that this species is highly prized for its superior flavour.The Puqi factory owners feel they have been abandoned by the Chinese authorities, who, they assert, have populist motives, rather than any concern for the environment. &quot;Our industry is pretty small and Yao Ming is highly respected, so the government doesn&apos;t support us. It&apos;s really frustrating,&quot; Wang laments. The factories here deny buying fins cut off sharks out at sea. The poor animals are thrown back into the water to die in agony, a practice condemned by environmental campaigners. To prove this, the factory-owners point out the many carcasses littering the shopfloor. They go so far as to deny that the practice exists at all. &quot;It&apos;s impossible, the other parts of the shark are valuable too,&quot; says Li. Wang maintains that nothing is wasted: the stomach is fried; calcium powder is extracted from the spinal cord; the meat is consumed locally, or salted prior to export to Sri Lanka; the teeth end up as pendants. But the fins command the highest price. They only represent 5% of body mass, but at least a third of revenue for Li&apos;s firm. The limited availability explains the eye-watering price on restaurant menus. Starting with 5kg of raw produce, the end result, ready for delivery, only weighs 500g. A kilo of blue-shark fin, processed by Haideli, costs 1,000 yuan ($160). Neither Wang nor Li believe the shark population is dwindling. &quot;Resources will carry on increasing,&quot; Wang asserts. &quot;Yao Ming doesn&apos;t get it. The numbers in the sea have not dropped. There are still enough sharks.&quot; \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Marine life", "Fish", "Environment", "Conservation", "Fishing"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-12T14:01:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/feb/16/walking-shangahi-megacity-pudong", "sentences": ["The day before, I had arrived in Shanghai.", "What could be easier?&quot; At Shanghai South bus station, I spent three hours watching hundreds of buses go by, their destinations advertised only in Chinese characters.", "In desperation, I jumped on a bus and 20 minutes later was back at Shanghai South.", "We got off at Zhujiajiao, on the edge of Shanghai municipality.", "If China&apos;s cities carry on growing at the current rate, Shanghai, whose population has doubled in 20 years, will at some stage merge with Nanjing, Ningbo, Hangzhou and others to form a megalopolis of 88 million people.", "A sign read: Shanghai city centre 35km (22 miles).", "Shanghai has three and will add more as the city grows, so that future historians will be able to judge the growth of it by these concentric circles, like a tree.", "It felt as if I had crossed the threshold into Shanghai proper.", "I passed Brobdingnagian factories \u2013 Shanghai accounts for a third of all China&apos;s exports \u2013 and an Ikea distribution centre the size of which might prompt a rethink about the Great Wall being the only man-made object visible from space.", "\"There was no pavement, so as the traffic thundered past, we walked in the lane with the motorbikes and bicycles\"    I ducked down a narrow alleyway of preserved shikumen houses, little stone-arched dwellings that were once ubiquitous in Shanghai but have now largely been demolished, and into the South Xizang Road bird and flower market, the air a thick fug of cigarette smoke and animals.", "Miss Fang would later tell me it was probably, &quot;Where&apos;s the money?&quot; \u2013 the Chinese equivalent of &quot;Say cheese&quot; \u2013 to which the reply is always, &quot;In the bank.&quot; I walked across People&apos;s Square, Shanghai&apos;s municipal hub, with its modern Grand Theatre, whose transparent plastic walls and sweeping concave roof give it the appearance of a giant funky ashtray, and the Shanghai Museum, shaped like a saucepan complete with handle on the top.", "Above the treetops of Renmin Park, encircling the space, was another forest, of futuristic skyscrapers \u2013 it&apos;s said that during the 1990s, half the world&apos;s tower cranes were over Shanghai.", "&quot;She wants to know if you have your own apartment.&quot; Dusk was falling when I met Miss Fang on the Nanjing Road \u2013 Shanghai&apos;s Oxford Street \u2013 as we had arranged.", "At the end of the Nanjing Road, the buildings seemed to part like curtains, and there was the Huangpu river and, beyond, Pudong, until 1990 a boggy swampland, but now packed tight with skyscrapers of every imaginable, and some unimaginable, shape and size \u2013 Shanghai&apos;s iconic and totemic billboard for the restlessness and energy that is modern China.", "\u2022 The trip was provided by On the Go Tours (020-7371 1113, onthegotours.com), which has a five-day Eye on Shanghai break from \u00a3349pp, including four nights&apos; B&amp;B in a hotel, tours, excursions, a Huangpu river cruise, entrance fees and transfers, but not flights.", "Flights were provided by Virgin Atlantic (virgin-atlantic.com), which flies Heathrow-Shanghai from \u00a3556 return"], "title": "Walking Shanghai: from the 14th century to the future", "article": "I had been marching for four hours in 30C heat along the hard shoulder of a busy dual carriageway. With me was a young woman, barely four feet tall. Think Alan Partridge meets Of Mice and Men and you&apos;d be close. The woman was wearing dazzling white pumps and a smile whose dazzle had once matched her footwear but was fading by the minute. She was fresh out of tour-guiding school, and somehow I didn&apos;t think this had been on the curriculum. The day before, I had arrived in Shanghai. With over 25 million inhabitants and growing fast, it&apos;s China&apos;s economic powerhouse, and currently at number five in the world megacity charts. I had been offered the services of a guide. &quot;Pah!&quot; I&apos;d said. &quot;I&apos;m an experienced traveller. All I have to do is catch a bus to the edge of the city and walk the 30-odd miles back into the centre. What could be easier?&quot; At Shanghai South bus station, I spent three hours watching hundreds of buses go by, their destinations advertised only in Chinese characters. I couldn&apos;t find anyone who spoke English. In desperation, I jumped on a bus and 20 minutes later was back at Shanghai South. I was as helpless as a newborn. I took my phone out and dialled. An hour later, the woman in dazzling pumps stood before me. &quot;I&apos;m Miss Fang,&quot; she said. &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; &quot;Go to the edge of the city and walk back to the centre,&quot; I said. &quot;Why?&quot; asked Miss Fang. It was a reasonable question. &quot;It is a great way to approach a city,&quot; I said, &quot;as it slowly reveals itself, like an image gradually coming into focus.&quot; To me, this sounded suitably Confucian. &quot;Oh,&quot; said Miss Fang, to whom it obviously didn&apos;t.   View Walking the world's megacities: Mike Carter in SHANGHAI in a larger map   We sat on a bus for two hours as city&apos;s suburbs rolled past the window. We got off at Zhujiajiao, on the edge of Shanghai municipality. Zhujiajiao is a canal town, one of many that sprang up under the Ming dynasty of the 14th century as a commercial centre, built on the network of waterways \u2013 man-made and natural \u2013 formed by the inundated Yangtze delta. We crossed the graceful five-arched Fangsheng Bridge, and then wandered the canals, lined with stone Ming- and Qing-era houses, and cedar and peach trees, from whose branches vermillion lanterns hung like pendulous fruit. From many of the trees there hung a songbird in a cage, like a loudspeaker. Miss Fang bought us food for the walk: qingtuan, rice balls stuffed with red beans and wrapped in wormwood leaves, which the vendor tied up in straw with her teeth; some crunchy dried fish, which got stuck in my throat, amusing Miss Fang no end; and a couple of bags of spicy chicken feet. &quot;My favourite thing,&quot; said Miss Fang. We hit the road. There was no pavement, so as the traffic thundered past, we walked in the lane with the motorbikes and bicycles, many carrying steel girders that threatened to scythe us in two. The riders wore white gloves and incredulous expressions at the odd couple walking in the middle of nowhere in the afternoon heat. We walked past field after field of strawberries, and clusters of wooden shacks. In the far distance, towards the city, tower cranes filled the horizon, like some Martian army on the move. As we walked, I asked Miss Fang about her life. She was 23, and had moved from the countryside to the city, part of the greatest demographic shift in modern history as the world&apos;s villages empty into its cities. According to US futurist and writer Stewart Brand, by 2050, the world will be 80% urbanised. If China&apos;s cities carry on growing at the current rate, Shanghai, whose population has doubled in 20 years, will at some stage merge with Nanjing, Ningbo, Hangzhou and others to form a megalopolis of 88 million people.     Mike in the canal town of Zhujiajiao, dating from the Ming dynasty, at the start of his walk      Miss Fang told me how she lives in a two-bedroom apartment with five others, how curtains divide the bedrooms. &quot;My boyfriend must have an apartment before I agree to marry him,&quot; she said. It was getting dark as we arrived, some nine miles later, in Sheshan, once a town in the middle of the countryside, but now a suburb of the city&apos;s inexorable westward expansion. I left Miss Fang at a bus stop and walked into an adjacent guesthouse. An ancient woman with leathery skin sat behind the desk. I pulled out my passport. The woman stared at it in horror, then got up and, with great ceremony, shooed me out of the building. Thankfully, Miss Fang was still outside. She spoke to the woman. &quot;Foreigners must get police permission to stay at guesthouses below three stars,&quot; Miss Fang said. She didn&apos;t know why. The police wouldn&apos;t give permission, and didn&apos;t know why either, but did suggest a hotel that would have me. Miss Fang got her bus. Truly alone now and ravenous from walking, I went into a restaurant. A waitress pointed to a wall of Chinese characters and tapped a pen impatiently on her pad. I wanted to cry. On a side-table were two silver lids. The waitress lifted up the first. A pig had exploded, all ears and tongues and snouts. In the second, the same, only duck, with heads and beaks and webbed feet. I&apos;m sure it was all delicious, but I&apos;ll never know. In another blow to my intrepid-traveller ego, I retreated and spent the evening in my room eating the leftover crunchy fish, and crisps from the minibar that tasted like lemon tea. Next morning, I headed east, first through a bamboo forest and then out along the eight-lane Shenzhuan Highway. The road was lined with housing estates under construction, with vast homes, like Brookside on steroids. A sign read: Shanghai city centre 35km (22 miles).     Tea house in Yuyuan Gardens and city skyline behind. Photograph: Alamy    I passed under one of the city&apos;s ring roads. Shanghai has three and will add more as the city grows, so that future historians will be able to judge the growth of it by these concentric circles, like a tree. It felt as if I had crossed the threshold into Shanghai proper. There were pavements and \u2013 joy \u2013 street signs with English translations. I passed Brobdingnagian factories \u2013 Shanghai accounts for a third of all China&apos;s exports \u2013 and an Ikea distribution centre the size of which might prompt a rethink about the Great Wall being the only man-made object visible from space. I walked under road junctions being built, tangles of concrete in the sky, and over railway lines where high-speed trains with platypus-shaped noses flew by every few minutes. And everywhere, there were signs of the old ways, of life lived on the pavement: women played mahjong, and laughed, men played cards, smoking furiously, expressions as stern as Easter Island statues. I picked my way through men bashing and welding metal, vendors with watermelon and aubergines laid out on blankets, and washing strung across the pavement at head height, which led, on unguarded occasions, to a face-full of underwear. Many of the older people wore pyjamas \u2013 Miss Fang had told me that they reminded them of their Zhongshan, or Mao, suits. That night I stayed in Qibao, another canal town. But, unlike Zhujiajiao, this one was under siege from cranes and a glittering new shopping mall. Out walking after dinner, I stumbled across a group of around 100 women who, in the gloaming, filled a square with exquisitely choreographed dancing, arms making great sweeps of the sky, moving as one, like a flock of murmurating birds. The next day, my last, the buildings and apartment blocks started getting much taller, many with pagoda decorations on the rooftops. It was as if I&apos;d traversed the foothills and entered the high mountains. Outside a hair salon \u2013 I&apos;ve never seen so many in one city \u2013 a young man was addressing two rows of workers. They clapped, did a little cricket-bowling action, sang a song, and then all went back inside. I was firmly into that delicious walking reverie now, lost yet untroubled, absorbing this curious world with no desire for answers, my feet carrying me on effortlessly. I walked through Longhua martyrs cemetery, a rare piece of green now, memorialising those who died in the cause of Chinese communism, leading up to victory in 1949. Many of the graves held fresh flowers. An old man did tai chi under the canopy of a cedar.     \"There was no pavement, so as the traffic thundered past, we walked in the lane with the motorbikes and bicycles\"    I ducked down a narrow alleyway of preserved shikumen houses, little stone-arched dwellings that were once ubiquitous in Shanghai but have now largely been demolished, and into the South Xizang Road bird and flower market, the air a thick fug of cigarette smoke and animals. Boxes of rabbits, rats and kittens filled the floor. On tables were glass tanks of turtles and giant frogs and huge lizards. Hundreds of delicate bamboo baubles hung from the walls. In each was a cicada, chirruping loudly and uselessly to another, destined to spend its short time in an apartment as a rural soundtrack to an urban life. On a large table, men were jabbing slithers of bamboo into the mandibles of crickets, trying to gauge their spirit \u2013 for betting on cricket fights is one way to get a surreptitious gambling fix in a country where, on the mainland, it is illegal. I wandered into the exquisite 16th-century Yuyuan Gardens, and walked its serpentine paths, through tunnels of jasmine, mimosa and magnolia \u2013 the city&apos;s flower \u2013 and past lakes churning with carp. A man stopped me and pointed to his family and his camera, which I reached for, but no, he wanted a picture of me with his family. They all held up their Vs, as the Chinese do. The photographer said something. The family replied and smiled. Miss Fang would later tell me it was probably, &quot;Where&apos;s the money?&quot; \u2013 the Chinese equivalent of &quot;Say cheese&quot; \u2013 to which the reply is always, &quot;In the bank.&quot; I walked across People&apos;s Square, Shanghai&apos;s municipal hub, with its modern Grand Theatre, whose transparent plastic walls and sweeping concave roof give it the appearance of a giant funky ashtray, and the Shanghai Museum, shaped like a saucepan complete with handle on the top. And then into the adjacent Renmin Park, where I sat in a bandstand with a dozen locals as an old man in a white waistcoat and a red tie played a haunting song on a zheng, a type of zither. The woman sitting next to me wiped a tear from her eye. Above the treetops of Renmin Park, encircling the space, was another forest, of futuristic skyscrapers \u2013 it&apos;s said that during the 1990s, half the world&apos;s tower cranes were over Shanghai. One looked as if a giant UFO had landed on its roof, another like a praying mantis about to pounce, another like it might take off for the moon. They were beautiful, yet terrifying. I saw a large group of middle-aged people browsing sheets of paper pinned to camellia bushes spouting vivid pink blooms. On each sheet was some writing and, on some, a photograph of a young man or woman. I assumed they were prayers for the dead, but actually they were prayers for the living, as a woman I found who spoke English explained.     Rather a lot to ask of one small motorbike    &quot;These are the parents of of unmarried boys and girls in their thirties looking for partners for their children,&quot; she said. &quot;In China, it was always the parents who made the matches. These people have followed their children into the city from the countryside, desperate to get them married. To be over 30 and single is a source of great shame for the family. But in the city it is hard for young people to meet decent partners.&quot; We had been surrounded by people, clutching sheets of paper. One woman spoke to me. &quot;What did she say?&quot; I asked. &quot;She wants to know if you have your own apartment.&quot; Dusk was falling when I met Miss Fang on the Nanjing Road \u2013 Shanghai&apos;s Oxford Street \u2013 as we had arranged. She seemed relieved and surprised that I had found my way back. &quot;Now that we know each other, you can call me Fang Fang,&quot; she said. Fang Fang and I walked past old couples waltzing to Are You Lonesome Tonight?, weaved between the hawkers selling knock-off Louis Vuitton and Rolex, and past the shops selling the real things, and under a giant screen showing films of pandas and paddy fields. For the odd miraculous second, when the din abated, the plaintive sound of a songbird from a cage on a balcony would hang in the still air. At the end of the Nanjing Road, the buildings seemed to part like curtains, and there was the Huangpu river and, beyond, Pudong, until 1990 a boggy swampland, but now packed tight with skyscrapers of every imaginable, and some unimaginable, shape and size \u2013 Shanghai&apos;s iconic and totemic billboard for the restlessness and energy that is modern China. There was the neon Twiglet of the Pearl Tower; the World Financial Center, at nearly 500m, looking like a giant bottle opener; and the staggeringly beautiful Jin Mao Tower, like a cut-glass pagoda. The buildings started to pulse with light, flashing up giant hearts and teardrops and Tetris games 300m high. Behind us was the Bund, the waterfront of aristocratic Italian Renaissance and art deco buildings that sprang up at the start of the 20th century, the last commercial frenzy in the city. They seemed to seethe at the upstarts across the river. As fireworks filled the sky, I thought about my three-day, 30-mile journey on foot from the 14th-century to Pudong. I would soon be on a 250mph Maglev train to get my flight, which would turn that distance into an eight-minute blur. I was tempted to walk to the airport, I really was. \u2022 The trip was provided by On the Go Tours (020-7371 1113, onthegotours.com), which has a five-day Eye on Shanghai break from \u00a3349pp, including four nights&apos; B&amp;B in a hotel, tours, excursions, a Huangpu river cruise, entrance fees and transfers, but not flights.

Driving 140 kilometres from Tianjin City to Beijing last week, she held her breath as the chalky-white horizon became a charcoal grey haze. The 39-year-old businesswoman has lived in Beijing for a decade, and this past month, she said, brought the worst air pollution she has ever seen. It gave her husband a hacking cough and left her seven-year-old daughter housebound. &quot;I&apos;m working here and my husband&apos;s working here, so we have no choice,&quot; she said. &quot;But if we had a choice, we&apos;d like to escape from Beijing.&quot; A prolonged bout of heavy pollution over the last month, which returned with a vengeance for a day last week \u2013 called the &quot;airpocalypse&quot; or &quot;airmageddon&quot; by internet users \u2013 has fundamentally changed the way that Chinese people think about their country&apos;s toxic air. The event was worthy of its namesake. On one day, pollution levels were 30 times higher than levels deemed safe by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Flights were cancelled. Roads were closed. One hospital in east Beijing reported treating more than 900 children for respiratory issues. Bloomberg found that for most of January, Beijing&apos;s air was worse than that of an airport smoking lounge. The smog&apos;s most threatening aspect is its high concentration of PM\u00a02.5 \u2013 particulate matter that is small enough to lodge deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, causing respiratory infections, asthma, lung cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and possibly damaging children&apos;s development. The WHO has estimated that outdoor air pollution accounts for two million deaths per year, 65% of them in Asia. Yet the smog has become more than a health hazard in China \u2013 it has become a symbol of widespread dissatisfaction with the government&apos;s growth-first development strategy. Feelings of resigned helplessness have given way to fear, anger, and society-wide pressure to change the status quo. The Lunar New Year, which came last Sunday, usually coincides with clear blue skies \u2013 an estimated 9m cars depart from the capital, and its emissions-spewing factories shut down as workers go on holiday. Yet the smog came back with a vengeance on Wednesday. Environmental authorities sent text messages to Beijing residents urging them to mitigate the pollution by refraining from the long-held holiday tradition of lighting fireworks. According to state media, they took heed. Fireworks sales fell 37% compared with last year. &quot;PM 2.5 and data measurement issues with regard to air quality have entered into mainstream Chinese life,&quot; said Angel Hsu, a doctoral candidate at Yale University. Hsu has tracked usage of the term &quot;PM 2.5&quot; on Sina Weibo, China&apos;s most popular microblog, over the last two years. In January 2011, it was mentioned about 200 times. Last month, the number soared above three million. In China, PM 2.5 has acquired a symbolic weight to parallel its medical gravitas. Young internet users post photos of themselves wearing air filtration face masks. One popular mask is hot pink; another looks like a panda bear. Last spring, Shanghai hosted a PM 2.5-themed rock music festival. A music video called &quot;Beijing, Beijing (Big Fog Version)&quot; went viral on video sharing websites. &quot;Who is searching in the fog? Who is weeping in the fog? Who is living in the fog? Who is dying in the fog,&quot; A man croons over images of cars crawling along smog-choked highways. Experts say that the last month&apos;s pollution was probably caused initially by a cold snap, forcing huge use of coal, followed by a rare temperature inversion, which trapped emissions under a blanket of warm air. Others say that it could be related to a prolonged period of high humidity, trapping particulate matter in the air. Pollution levels depend heavily on the force and direction of the wind. A strong north-eastern gust can blow the smog out to sea; a few stagnant hours are enough to make noon look like early evening. The standard international measurement for air quality \u2013 the US Air Quality Index, or AQI \u2013 rates air quality on a scale of zero to 500. With experience, it becomes possible to guess the AQI in Beijing without looking at official readings. One hundred correlates to a thin grey gauze hovering above the horizon. When the index hits 200, the sky is visible only in a small patch directly overhead. An AQI reading of 300 blots out the sun, smothering the city in drab uniformity. When the AQI reached 755 on 12\u00a0January, the worst day on record, the air felt like industrial smoke \u2013 chemical-tasting, eye-watering. On particularly smoggy days, the toxic cloud is visible in satellite photos. The worst of the last month&apos;s pollution stretched 1,100 miles south, closing highways near the south-western city Guiyang. When the smog clears, it doesn&apos;t simply vanish, but instead drifts to surrounding countries. January&apos;s smog spurred Japanese authorities to release health warnings to people living in the country&apos;s western cities. Traces of China&apos;s smog have been detected as far afield as California. The Beijing municipal government has taken steps to curb the pollution, temporarily shutting down factories and ordering government cars off the roads. While propaganda authorities used to quash reports of air pollution for fear that they could spark social unrest, Chinese newspapers were allowed to report freely on the crisis. Shanghai&apos;s Environmental Protection Bureau has designed a cartoon accompaniment to its AQI readings \u2013 a pigtailed girl with big anime-style eyes, green-haired and smiling when the index reads &quot;excellent&quot; but maroon-haired and weepy when smog rolls in. &quot;I&apos;m pretty optimistic that this happened at the right time to prompt the most action possible,&quot; said Deborah Seligsohn, an expert on China&apos;s environment at University of California, San Diego. President Xi Jinping took the reins of the Communist party in November; incoming prime minister Li Keqiang has promised to make environmental protection a focus of his tenure. Beijing authorities hope to wean the city off coal and implement stricter vehicle emissions standards by 2016. Seligsohn added that changes would take a while. &quot;If Beijing were surrounded by cities that were doing the same thing that Beijing was doing, it would be fine, but it isn&apos;t,&quot; she said. A short drive from central Beijing, the landscape fans out into sprawling, dusty plains, where farmers burn coal to heat their concrete homes. Small factories there often escape the notice of environmental watchdogs. PM 2.5, she explained, is produced by four airborne pollutants \u2013 sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, volatile organic compounds, and black carbon \u2013 each of which would require its own slew of regulations to curb. People have begun to take protection into their own hands. &quot;People are starting to treat air purifiers as a necessary appliance like a washing machine or computer,&quot; said Bi Xiuyan, a 56-year-old product salesperson for Amway. Bi has sold about 50 air\u00a0purifiers in the last month, each of which costs \u00a3960, about twice the average monthly income for Beijing residents. &quot;Everybody needs to breathe,&quot; she said. Louie Cheng, the president of Shanghai-based Pure Living China, a small company that tests indoor air\u00a0pollution, said that the current situation boosted the company&apos;s web traffic 30-fold. &quot;Literally you can see it \u2013 this isn&apos;t compared with a year ago, this is compared with a month ago,&quot; he said. Cheng said that he helped start the company three years ago when an expat friend with an asthmatic daughter couldn&apos;t find a local company to competently test his house for pollutants. His client-base has tripled since January, and now includes more than half of Shanghai and Beijing&apos;s international schools. &quot;It&apos;s just hard to keep up with the demand,&quot; he said. Awareness of the problem has spread beyond major urban centres. Ma Shiying, who sells moist towelettes in the small coastal city of Weifang, Shandong province, heeded the government&apos;s warning and lit fewer fireworks this year. &quot;Over the past few months, the whole world has begun to pay close attention to this problem,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s become impossible for anyone to ignore.&quot; Yet interpretations of the issue vary. Eva Zhong, the head of exports for a fireworks manufacturer in Hunan province, said that the government&apos;s fireworks warnings were misplaced. &quot;Fireworks are very innocent,&quot; she said. &quot;Car exhaust is a far greater problem.&quot; Despite the government figures, she added, her company&apos;s sales this year have been unscathed.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Pollution", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-16T19:47:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/feb/19/champions-league-last-16-teams", "sentences": ["They are top of the league, six points ahead of Fenerbahce, and managed two marquee signings in January, Wesley Sneijder from Internazionale as well as Didier Drogba, who had his contract with Shanghai Shenhua terminated."], "title": "This week's Champions League last-16 ties: how the teams shape up", "article": "Porto v M\u00e1laga, Tuesday 19 February M\u00e1laga have enjoyed an incredible start to their first Champions League campaign, going unbeaten through Group C to finish ahead of Milan, big-spending Zenit St Petersburg and Anderlecht. M\u00e1laga, of course, were big spenders themselves recently but the Qatari owners soon lost interest, leading to, among other things, Santi Cazorla being sold to Arsenal and the club being banned from European competitions in 2013-14 because of unpaid bills (a ruling they have appealed against). In January, they sold another played to Arsenal, the left-back Nacho Monreal, but as long as there is Isco, there is hope. The brilliant 20-year-old has gone from making his La Liga debut in November 2011 to being picked for Spain in two and a half years, making his La Roja debut against Uruguay this month. Isco has taken over the playmaking role from Cazorla and will be the key to unlocking Porto, supplying Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1nchez and Javier Saviola with killer passes or, as he did against Zenit in the group stage, scoring a couple of goals himself. M\u00e1laga have replaced Monreal with the Portuguese international defender Antunes, while Lucas Piaz\u00f3n (on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season), Diego Lugano and Pedro Morales were also added to the squad, although the last is ineligible for the Champions League. &quot;We have had an incredible campaign in Europe so far but on Tuesday we are going somewhere where it will be difficult to impose our game upon them,&quot; the M\u00e1laga midfielder Ignacio Camacho said on Monday.

Rodr\u00edguez will probably be on the bench on Tuesday with the main threat to M\u00e1laga likely to come from his fellow Colombian striker, Jackson Mart\u00ednez, nicknamed &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot; for his dance-like moves on the pitch. He has scored an impressive 25 goals in 28 games this season. Prediction: 2-0 Arsenal v Bayern Munich, Tuesday 19 February Bayern have been rampant this season and even Arsenal&apos;s Lukas Podolski (a former Bayern player) admitted at the weekend that the Bavarians are strong favourites for this last 16-tie. He did add that if &quot;everything goes Arsenal&apos;s way we have a chance&quot; but it is easy to see why the Germany international is pessimistic. Bayern lead the Bundesliga by 15 points and have won 10 out of 11 away games in the league, conceding a single goal in 990 minutes. And, for a team with the nickname FC Hollywood, they seem incredibly united in their aim to make up for the disappointment they suffered in the final against Chelsea last season. Arjen Robben, as he does, has been muttering about not being happy on the bench but said before boarding the plane to London that &quot;of course I want to play but this is about Arsenal v Bayern, not about me playing or not.&quot; The Dutch winger picked out Cazorla and Theo Walcott as the Gunners&apos; danger men: &quot;If one of them has a top day then it will be very difficult for us&quot;. Bayern&apos;s starting XI looks impressive, from Manuel Neuer in goal to Mario Gomez or Mario Mandzukic up front. Philipp Lahm, David Alaba and the Brazilian international Dante are the key components in defence while ahead of them Bastian Schweinsteiger and the \u20ac40m summer addition Javi Mart\u00ednez will do everything in their powers to stop Arsenal&apos;s attacking midfielders. In addition, on the attack Franck Rib\u00e9ry and Thomas M\u00fcller have been in the form of their lives. Arsenal have been frustratingly inconsistent, especially in defence. Rib\u00e9ry, in particular, will lick his lips in anticipation at attacking an unprotected Bacary Sagna. The Frenchman has, by his own admission, had a poor season but he has not received much defensive help from the players in front of him. Ever since Theo Walcott&apos;s brief exodus from the team \u2013 culminating in a run through the middle and a new contract \u2013 he has, when playing out wide, tended to drift infield to form a mis-shaped front two with Olivier Giroud, leaving Sagna sorely exposed. This predilection of Walcott&apos;s was clear on Saturday in the loss against Blackburn when at one point the centre-back Laurent Koscielny took it upon himself to march up the right wing ahead of Francis Coquelin at right-back in order to provide an outlet where Walcott should have been positioned. Monreal is ineligible so Thomas Vermaelen is likely to fill in at left-back, but Jack Wilshere showed two years ago against Barcelona&apos;s Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta that he can influence games against the best in Europe. Bayern did concede seven goals in six Champions League group games this season, and they lost to BATE Borisov before securing their place in the last 16. Prediction: 2-2 Galatasaray v Schalke, Wednesday 20 February Where on earth did it all go wrong for Schalke? At the start of November they had beaten Olympiakos and Arsenal away from home in the Champions League, lost only once in the Bundesliga and progressed to the third round of the German Cup. Three months later, they are preparing for their last-16 tie against Galatasaray on a run of one win in 12 league games. They have dispensed with one manager, Huub Stevens, and replaced him with an unheralded Under-23 coach, Jens Keller, a man with a history of dodgy jumpers. They have sold the influential Lewis Holtby to Tottenham, bringing the deal forward to January for a small amount and they have opened a, er, club cemetery. Most of all, however, they have been rubbish. &quot;The team showed that they are alive,&quot; said the sporting director, Horst Heldt, rather worryingly, after the weekend&apos;s 2-2 draw at Mainz. To make matters worse, the main danger man, the striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, has ruptured a blood vessel in his left eye and is unlikely to play. Ibrahim Affelay and Atsuto Uchida are also injured. About the only good news for S04 is that Holtby&apos;s replacement, Michel Bastos from Lyon, has played well, scoring both goals at Mainz on Saturday. The Brazilian Raffael has also arrived \u2013 on loan from Dynamo Kyiv \u2013 to boost Keller&apos;s midfield options. The mood at Galatasaray could hardly be more of a contrast. They are top of the league, six points ahead of Fenerbahce, and managed two marquee signings in January, Wesley Sneijder from Internazionale as well as Didier Drogba, who had his contract with Shanghai Shenhua terminated. &quot;Big clubs can only reach their goals by signing high-profile players,&quot; the club president, Unal Aysal, said proudly while Milan Baros realised how much playing time he would get this spring and joined Banik Ostrava. But there is more to Cimbom than just Sneijder and Drogba. Burak Yilmaz scored six out of the team&apos;s seven goals in the group stage with Selcuk Inan, one of the best passers in the Turkish league, running the midfield. It will be an emotional tie for Galatasaray&apos;s Hamit Altintop, who was born in Gelsenkirchen and started his career at Schalke. Galatasaray beat Manchester United at home in the group stage and it is difficult to see Schalke, on current form, getting a result at the Ali Sami Yen Stadium despite the home team having won only two out of 11 games against Bundesliga opposition at their own ground. Prediction: 3-1 Milan v Barcelona, Wednesday 20 February As if the Milan coach, Massimiliano Allegri, did not have enough to worry about, Silvio Berlusconi was at it again this week (no, not like that\u2026 he was offering tactical advice). The club owner kindly took time out from his election campaign to tell Allegri that Milan should play two up front at San Siro (Giampaolo Pazzini and Stephan El Shaarawy, since you ask) and that they should man-mark Lionel Messi. Clever stuff. Surely no one has tried that before\u2026 Allegri does not have an easy job, and he was missing seven players because of injury in the 2-1 win over Parma on Friday night. He hopes Philippe Mex\u00e9s and El Shaarawy will be fit for this match but will not be able to count on Mario Balotelli, who is ineligible for the Champions League having played for Manchester City in the competition. Balotelli has scored four out of Milan&apos;s five goals since making his debut on 3 February with the fifth an own goal by Parma&apos;s Gabriel Paletta, the former Liverpool player. Milan are not having a bad season despite all the injuries and the fact they sold arguably their two best players, Thiago Silva and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, to Paris St-Germain in August. They are unbeaten in seven league games and third in Serie A. That is unlikely to worry Barcelona, however, who have lost only once in 24 league games this season, scoring 80 goals in the process. The only small note of hope for Milan is that Bar\u00e7a have kept only one clean sheet in their past 11 league games. True, they have won some of those games 5-1 and 6-1 but the back four does not appear watertight. Xavi has been missing in midfield and is unlikely to be fit enough to start this match, but he has been included in the travelling party. David Villa has been in hospital for treatment of kidney stones and missed the 2-1 win over Granada on Saturday.

Mandiant, a security company that has been investigating attacks against western organisations for over six years, said in a report (PDF) the attacks came from a 12-storey building belonging to the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) general staff&apos;s department, also known as Unit 61398. Mandiant said it believed a hacking network named the Comment Crew or the Shanghai Group was based inside the compound, in a rundown residential neighbourhood. Although the report fails directly to place the hackers inside the building, it argues there is no other logical reason why so many attacks have emanated from such a small area. &quot;It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively,&quot; said the report. The discovery will further raise the temperature in the intergovernmental cyberwars, which have heated up in recent years as the US, Israel, Iran, China and UK have all used computer subterfuge to undermine rival state or terrorist organisations. One security expert warned that companies in high-profile fields should assume they will be targeted and hacked, and build systems that will fence sensitive data off from each other. Rik Ferguson, global vice-president of security research at the data security company Trend Micro, said: &quot;We need to concentrate less on building castles and assuming they will be impervious, and more on building better dungeons so that when people get in they can&apos;t get anything else.&quot; . Mandiant says Unit 61398 could house &quot;hundreds or thousands&quot; of people and has military-grade, high-speed fibre-optic connections from China Mobile, the world&apos;s largest telecoms carrier. &quot;The nature of Unit 61398&apos;s work is considered by China to be a state secret; however, we believe it engages in harmful computer network operations,&quot; Mandiant said in the report. It said Unit 61398 had been operating since 2006, and was one of the most prolific hacking groups &quot;in terms of quantity of information stolen&quot;. This it estimated at hundreds of terabytes, enough for thousands of 3D designs and blueprints. &quot;APT1&quot;, as Mandiant calls it, is only one of 20 groups Mandiant says has carried out scores of hacking attacks against businesses and organisations in the west, including companies that work in strategic industries such as US power and water infrastructure. A typical attack would leave software that hid its presence from the user or administrator and silently siphon data to a remote server elsewhere on the internet at the instruction of a separate &quot;command and control&quot; (C&amp;C) computer. By analysing the hidden software, the pattern of connections and links from the C&amp;C server, the team at Mandiant said they were confident of the source of the threat. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman denied the government was behind the attacks, saying: &quot;Hacking attacks are transnational and anonymous. Determining their origins is extremely difficult. We don&apos;t know how the evidence in this so-called report can be tenable. Arbitrary criticism based on rudimentary data is irresponsible, unprofessional and not helpful in resolving the issue.&quot; But Ferguson told the Guardian: &quot;This is a pretty compelling report, with evidence collected over a prolonged period of time. It points very strongly to marked Chinese involvement.&quot; Mandiant, based in Alexandria, Virginia, in the US, investigated the New York Times break-in, for which it suggested Chinese sources could be to blame. President Barack Obama is already beefing up US security, introducing an executive order in his State of the Union speech this month that would let the government work with the private sector to fend off hacking. But it will take until February 2014 to have a final version ready for implementation. The revelation comes days after the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, as well as the social networks Facebook and Twitter, said they had been subjected to &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; hacks that in some cases focused on correspondents writing about China and its government. Separate investigations by the computer company Dell, working with the news company Bloomberg, tracked down another alleged hacker, Zhang Changhe, who has written a number of papers on PC hacking. Zhang works at the PLA&apos;s &quot;information engineering university&quot; in Zhengzhou, Henan province, north-central China. The allegations will raise the temperature in the continuing cyberwar between the west and China, which has been steadily rising since the Pentagon and MI6 uncovered Titan Rain, a scheme that tried to siphon data from the Pentagon and the House of Commons in 2006, and which one security expert said at the time dated back at least to 2004. Ferguson suggested that western governments were also carrying out attacks against Chinese targets \u2013 &quot;but that&apos;s not a culture which would open up about being hit. I would be surprised and disappointed if most western nations don&apos;t have a cybersecurity force.&quot; The Stuxnet virus, which hit Iran&apos;s uranium reprocessing plant in 2010, is believed to have been written jointly by the US and Israel, while Iranian sources are believed to have hacked companies that issue email security certificates so that they can crack secure connections used by Iranian dissidents on Google&apos;s Gmail system. China is also reckoned to have been behind the hacking of Google&apos;s email servers in that country in late 2009, in an operation that files from WikiLeaks suggested was inspired by the Beijing government.", "tags": ["Hacking", "Cybercrime", "China", "Technology", "US news", "Iran", "Bloomberg", "MI6", "Israel", "Gmail", "Wall Street Journal", "Washington Post", "New York Times", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-19T13:03:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/19/the-fiver-arsenal-bayern-munich", "sentences": ["&quot;We have a good chance even though we lost 2-0,&quot; he said, before unveiling his masterplan: &quot;We have to keep a clean sheet and then to score as many as we can.&quot; Didier Drogba&apos;s former club Shanghai Shenhua have been fined, stripped of their 2003 league title and docked points next season, for fixing the result of a game against Shanxi Guoli on the way to the championship 10 years ago."], "title": "The Fiver | Manuel Neuer's pimped right-hand glove | Barry Glendenning", "article": "A TEAM THAT RECENTLY GOT SPANKED BY VASTLY INFERIOR OPPOSITION TAKE ON ARSENAL With Ars\u00e8ne Wenger reduced to puddle status in the wake of yesterday&apos;s well publicised &quot;MELTDOWN&quot;, now is probably a good time for the Fiver to tiptoe around the high viz durable plastic &quot;Caution: Wet Floor&quot; warning sign (complete with a helpful illustration of a Gareth Bale silhouette flinging itself through the air) erected in front of the now dissolved Arsenal manager and see how things are going in the Bayern Munich camp.

As anyone who has ever read a Guardian Sport comments section or listened to a radio phone-in show will know, football is a sport followed by the kind of people whose opinions are always carefully considered and well thought-out and never half-baked or laughably knee-jerk.

Their insights into corruption at the top levels of the game in China cast further light on the problems facing football, after the Chinese Football Association (CFA) fined 12 club teams up to \u00a3103,000 and punished 58 current and former football officials, players and referees for match-fixing and bribery. Chinese footballers were prone to accepting bribes because their salaries were often painfully low and delayed for months, said the ex-footballer, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from former coaches and teammates. Before he retired, in 2009, the player said, he would often receive a phone call from an unknown number the night before a match. The caller, usually from a gambling syndicate, would offer him thousands of pounds to let the other team win. The player never accepted their offers, he told the Guardian. &quot;Most of the time, it was the defenders who got this kind of offer, because they could allow the other team to score,&quot; he said. Goalkeepers, he added, were especially popular targets. &quot;Sometimes the whole team would get involved in match-fixing, but only in rare cases,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of the time, you only need five players or fewer to accomplish the goal.&quot; The footballer said conditions for players had improved dramatically over the past three years. Yet before he retired, less important players on his team made approximately \u00a3200 a month \u2013 barely enough to support their families \u2013 and their wages rarely arrived on time. Before important games, they were sometimes offered up to \u00a35,000 to swing the match. Before the anti-corruption drive, 30% of Chinese football matches were rigged, he said. Despite higher player salaries, football corruption remained a problem because unchecked local government officials often manipulated matches to manage their political relationships, said Ma Dexing, the deputy editor-in-chief of the popular Chinese sports magazine Titan Weekly. &quot;It has nothing to do with money,&quot; he said: &quot;it&apos;s just because of face.&quot; The association had banned 25 former and current football officials, referees and players from the sport for five years and 33 for life, state media reported on Tuesday. The club team Shanghai Shenhua, which once signed the former Chelsea stars Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka, was fined \u00a3103,000 for fixing a match in 2003. It was stripped of that year&apos;s league title and penalised with a six-point deduction for next season, which begins in March. Ma said: &quot;The Chinese Football Association (CFA), they will punish athletes or punish teams or punish referees, but they haven&apos;t punished any local government officials. In reality, it&apos;s local government officials who are conducting things from behind the scenes.&quot; Ma added that local officials often had enormous power over football teams within their jurisdictions. &quot;They can ask the team&apos;s boss to kick a player off the team if the player doesn&apos;t listen to him,&quot; he said. This week&apos;s punishments mark the end of an extensive anti-corruption campaign that kicked off in 2009 under the 58-year-old association president, Wei Di. He put up a hard fight against match-fixing but recently resigned &quot;over poor results&quot;, according to state media. China has not fielded a team at the World Cup since 2002. Its national team failed to reach the 2014 World Cup in Brazil after it ranked below Iraq and Jordan in qualifying rounds. Among those banned for life are the former Fifa World Cup referee Lu Jun, four former national team players, and the former CFA leaders Nan Yong and Xie Yalong, who were both sentenced to over a decade in jail last year for accepting bribes. According to state media, Nan once said players could purchase a spot on the national team for about \u00a310,000. Official efforts to clean up Chinese football may be gaining some traction. The New York-based firm IMG Worldwide Inc will soon assume management of China&apos;s most prestigious professional league, and foreign star players have become an increasingly common sight on football fields across the country. Despite the league&apos;s notorious corruption problems and low standards of play, China&apos;s stadiums are often packed with fans clad in team merchandise and hurling obscenities. The senior Communist party leader Xi Jinping has said he is a fan of the sport. Yet some experts are sceptical that the CFA&apos;s anti-corruption measures are strong enough to have an effect. &quot;These are not really serious punishments,&quot; Yan Qiang, vice-president of the sports publisher Titan Media, told the French news agency AFP. &quot;The professional football league is getting more popular and attracting more public attention. But where there is profit, there will be more people trying to get into it with illegal ways, so it will be a continuing fight.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "Didier Drogba", "Nicolas Anelka", "Fifa", "Chelsea", "New York", "Football", "World news", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-20T12:40:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/feb/21/technology-links-newsbucket", "sentences": ["According to Mandiant the address is: Datong Road 208, Pudong District, Shanghai."], "title": "Boot up: Samsung's copy/paste problem, Google's AdBlock block, HTC One, and more", "article": "A burst of 12 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Samsung devices crash after multiple uses of clipboard &gt;&gt; SAMSUNG Developers  Please pass this information on to the appropriate development team.

Linked Data: Connecting together the BBC&apos;s Online Content &gt;&gt; BBC Internet Blog  Free text searching (like a Google search) would get you so far but would probably return false-positives too (it can&apos;t disambiguate between Shakespeare and Shakespeare).  It would be even harder (or maybe impossible) to do something more complex like find the latest 20 pieces of content about environmental issues or people who have been in northern Britpop bands. Here text searching starts to become significantly less powerful. The primary goal of the Linked Data Platform is to make sense of all the BBC&apos;s creative works and provide an API to allow the retrieval of any creative work about any &apos;thing&apos;, with the added benefit that we hold a semantic graph of data behind the &apos;things&apos;.  This means the platform doesn&apos;t just know that tomorrow&apos;s episode of the Culture Show features Jarvis Cocker. It also knows that Jarvis is from Sheffield, was the lead singer in Pulp, that Pulp were a Britpop band, that they had a single called Common People, and that Common People was played on 6 Music this morning.

What&apos;s the betting a serious Java vulnerability will be found in the wild before then? China&apos;s army recruited hackers directly from universities &gt;&gt; gbtimes  China&apos;s army - the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) - was already looking for new young computer hackers in 2004, a publicly available job advert show. The job advert, which is still posted on Zhejiang University School of Computer Science and Technology&apos;s website, shows that the Chinese military&apos;s Unit 61398 is the employer. This is significant because in a recent report published by US security company Mandian, the 12-story building that hosts the PLA&apos;s &apos;Unit 61398&apos; is identified as the location from which the PLA&apos;s most active cyber espionage unit operates. The Chinese government has staunchly denied these accusations. According to Mandiant the address is: Datong Road 208, Pudong District, Shanghai.  The Chinese government is going to find it increasingly hard to deny the existence of its hacker army. The US&apos;s NSA used to be secret too. No longer.

Nexus 7 maths &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans  So: \u2022 Around 4.8m tablets sold by the company since the Nexus 7 went on sale\u2022 Verbal comments indicate 2.1-2.2m in Q3, which is consistent with the total figure\u2022 However, that would imply a collapse in sales of all other products (616k in Q2), and might perhaps include product ramp-up in June\u2022 2.4m tablets sold in Q4\u2022 Therefore total possible Nexus 7 sales of say 2.2m in Q2/Q3, plus at most 2.4m in Q4, and probably a hundred thousand or so less (given sales of other devices)\u2022 Hence, total Nexus 7 sales of 4.5m to 4.6m, and no more than 4.8m It&apos;s worth pointing out that Nexus 7 distribution was somewhat patchy - for example, it only went on sale in Japan at the end of September. Apple doesn&apos;t disclose iPad Mini sales separately, but going on the ASP, my estimate is that it sold 10m in Q4, despite the fact that it wasn&apos;t available until the beginning of November. Kindle Fire sales numbers aren&apos;t much better than guesswork, given that Amazon doesn&apos;t disclose anything, but my guess is that it outsold the Nexus 7 as well.

The study was part of a broad package of policies announced on Wednesday to combat cyber threats. It comes at a time when the issue is front and center in the US after numerous revelations about hacking. They include reports that hackers based in China have tried to penetrate the security of media organisations like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and a report by US cyber-security firm Mandiant, which has accused a secret Chinese military unit in Shanghai of years of cyber-attacks against more than 140 US companies. The Chinese government has denied being involved in cyber-theft, with China&apos;s defense minister calling the Mandiant report deeply flawed. It has also furiously denied being involved in attempts to hack American media organisations. In its section on China, the report said the Chinese intelligence services, as well as private Chinese companies, often used people with family ties to China as a way to hack into sensitive information. &quot;[They] frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal trade secrets using removable media devices or e-mail,&quot; the report said. The Obama administration&apos;s new initiative includes a new diplomatic push to discourage intellectual property theft abroad, along with better co-ordination with American companies so that they can improve their defences against hackers. It also wants to improve co-operation between its law enforcement agencies and those of other countries. Aside from rival countries, the new report has also warned of the threat by online activist groups looking to leak secrets. &quot;Political or social activists may use the tools of economic espionage against US companies, agencies or other entities, with disgruntled insiders leaking information about corporate trade secrets or critical US technology to &quot;hactivist&quot; groups like Wikileaks,&quot; the report said. The mention of WikiLeaks in such a high-profile government document is likely to provide ammunition to supporters of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is currently claiming asylum in Ecuador&apos;s embassy in London while he fights extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual assault and rape.

PlayStation 4 launch: no glitz, just an old school press conference &gt;&gt; guardian.co.uk Our own Keith Stuart:   No one should have expected a price. Possibly we shouldn&apos;t have expected a launch date or an actual console either. This is the way Sony rolls. Think back to 2005 if you can. The PS3 reveal. There was an event early in the year to announce the console, then another at E3 to actually provide lots of the intrinsic detail. The same thing happened with the PS2. And with the original machine, Sony&apos;s first press releases didn&apos;t even name it. So anyone who sat through last night&apos;s two-hour extravaganza thinking &quot;hang on, what does it LOOK like?&quot; just hasn&apos;t been to enough Sony hardware reveals.  Secretly?

Researchers develop technique to remotely control cockroaches &gt;&gt; North Carolina State University  Researchers from North Carolina State University have developed a technique that uses an electronic interface to remotely control, or steer, cockroaches. &quot;Our aim was to determine whether we could create a wireless biological interface with cockroaches, which are robust and able to infiltrate small spaces,&quot; says Alper Bozkurt, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at NC State and co-author of a paper on the work. &quot;Ultimately, we think this will allow us to create a mobile web of smart sensors that uses cockroaches to collect and transmit information, such as finding survivors in a building that&apos;s been destroyed by an earthquake.&quot;  Anonymous helps researchers link hackers to Chinese army &gt;&gt; Huffington Post  In February 2011, Anonymous gained access to the website rootkit.com - an online forum where hackers and researchers share information about hacking techniques - and published personal data of more than 40,000 registered users online. The data included email and IP addresses. The breach was one of dozens by Anonymous over the past two years and gained relatively little media attention. But now, two years later, security researchers say the data was valuable in helping them find links between hackers and the Chinese military. &quot;We are fortunate to have access to the accounts disclosed from rootkit.com,&quot; the Mandiant report said. Anonymous&apos; disclosure of the rookit.com information included an email and IP address for the username &quot;uglygorilla.&quot; The IP information, which identifies the location from which the user is accessing the Internet, pinned the hacker to a place close to a 12-story office tower in Shanghai that researchers believe is the headquarters of P.L.A.

Maybe everyone has this, or maybe it&apos;s a luxury we only have in the developed economies of the world. But I was there 20 years ago. I&apos;d been working for seven years for Unilever \u2013 a wonderful business education. But I was the son of a shopkeeper and somehow it was in my blood to start my own business one day. So in 1992, I teamed up with Dave Allan, a fellow Unilever marketer, and we formed a company with the glorious name of ?What If! Our dream was to help large organisations develop their innovation muscles. Today we are 300 strong and work with global companies such as Barclays, Pernod Ricard, Pfizer and Telefonica. But back to 1992. Dave and I really had nothing \u2013 no mortgages, no savings, no families. I think that&apos;s what enabled us to cook up such crazy schemes in the early years. The two of us would meet up in the Hope Working Men&apos;s Caf\u00e9 on the Holloway Road in North London and compile our to-do list for the day and then go our separate ways to tick them off. (I&apos;m still a compulsive list maker and tell my kids: &quot;If you&apos;re listless make a list!&quot;.) Through our Unilever network we knew a lot of people in consumer goods companies. A contact at Cadbury Schweppes asked us on a Friday to investigate ideas for the soft drinks market in Europe. So we jumped in Dave&apos;s old banger and spent the weekend driving around Europe collecting fizzy samples and swapping ideas. On the Monday we were able to knock our client&apos;s socks off with a terrific presentation. You don&apos;t do things like this if you think too hard or have too much to lose. &quot;What the heck, lets give it a go&quot; Over the years we developed a clear set of operating principles around innovation projects; work in bursts, always involve customers, make ideas real, pay attention to team behaviour and recruit the absolute best talent. Our client partners found this way of working really got results and in the mid 1990s several of them asked us to translate these principles into a training course. I remember that at the time we debated whether we were destroying our core business. This is the quintessential innovation debate \u2013 one that&apos;s incredibly hard for incumbent companies with healthy market positions to answer clearly. Fortunately, we didn&apos;t think too much and decided &quot;what the heck, let&apos;s give it a go.&quot; Today our innovation training business accounts for half our revenues and is hard at work with organisations as diverse as Google, the civil service and AstraZeneca. Understanding our limits as people has helped Dave and I make ?What If! the success it is today, but it was also one of the hardest things to accept. We recognised that we were good starters but not necessarily the best finishers. Lose the ego In the early 2000s we asked Sal Pajwani, who had been with us for years, to become the company CEO. He drove a period of rapid growth and just recently Sal, Dave and I asked Barrie Berg, who heads our US office, to lead the group. I truly believe that entrepreneurs have to lose the ego and do whatever it takes to grow the business and do what&apos;s right for customers. Things work best as a series of projects, and permanent roles just get in the way. Over the years, we&apos;ve worked hard to discover how employees can get the most out of each other and partner best with clients. In my view, it all comes down to how we behave together; how we build one anothers&apos; ideas, how we give each other feedback and even how we argue. To help us with this we talk a lot about five things: impact, audacity, love, passion and adventure. These words headline concepts that help us do our jobs better. For instance, audacity is all about the fact that innovators hate mediocrity. So it&apos;s important at work that we all drive for an unimaginably outstanding result. These values are the only real rules we have at work, they&apos;re surprisingly hard edged and we include our clients in them as well. Today, ?What If! has offices in London, Manchester, Shanghai, Singapore, New York and any minute now in Sao Paulo. We&apos;re busy translating our core products into digital offerings \u2013 an exciting project that&apos;s opening up new markets to us. Nothing will ever feel as entrepreneurial as the early days, but I&apos;d like to think that by driving the business through values, cutting out hierarchy and constantly focusing on how we can better partner with our clients, we will stay positive, audacious and valuable.

Not even propaganda posters on walls surrounding it or People&apos;s Liberation Army guards standing at the gates made the building stand out. Yet last week an American private security firm, Mandiant, based in Virginia, identified it as the headquarters of Unit 61398, a PLA army grouping suspected of waging cyberwarfare. The study revealed that 150 highly sophisticated cyber attacks against targets in the US had originated from inside. Last week international journalists and TV crews suddenly descending on Unit 61398 were chased away, even as an angry Beijing government denied the allegations. One BBC team was briefly detained. But the real story was not the existence of the building or the hackers inside. It was that it was merely the tip of an iceberg of cyberwarfare that is now rising dramatically into view. For years experts have warned of a global epidemic of hacking. But now those dire predictions have come true. It is clear that the world&apos;s emerging superpower, China, is now engaged in a battle with an older superpower, the United States. It is a fight raging across the internet in a proxy for the old spy versus spy games of the Cold War: except that it drops honey traps and prisoner exchanges at Checkpoint Charlie in favour of the planting of malware, beating firewalls and hijacking servers. But this new world is not just about rivalries between Beijing and Washington. Other governments or those acting on their behalf, such as India and Russia, are also big players. Huge corporations are being dragged in, trying to defend themselves against a legion of hackers, or as unscrupulous firms poaching the valuable secrets of rivals. And instead of hiding it, they are now speaking out and the cyber-underworld is hoving into view. &quot;It is a change of perception. There has been a shift in willingness to make a public disclosure,&quot; said Kurt Baumgartner, a senior security researcher at the Moscow-based cyber-security firm Kaspersky Lab. Crime has moved online. From hacking into private computers to access bank details, to scams aimed at the naive promising instant riches, to all-out identity theft, the PC sitting in your house is no longer an innocent device. It is a trapdoor that can lead straight to the darkest corners of the web. &quot;There is black ice on the internet. There are things out there where there is a tremendous risk to being attacked,&quot; said John Strand, a senior instructor at American cyber-security firm Sans, based in Maryland. Where criminals have gone, some fear terrorists might follow. Already the world of cyberwarfare has seen the emergence of powerful &quot;non-state actors&quot; such as WikiLeaks and the &quot;hacktivist&quot; collective known as Anonymous. Both groups fight for their beliefs, using the internet to spread information or act against those that have offended them. But coming behind them might lie other groups with agendas of nationalism or religious extremism that might plot to replace old-fashioned bombs with devastating acts of internet sabotage. This is what Unit 61398 really represents: not just the ambitions of a stirring China, but the growing to maturity of a new ecosystem of warfare, espionage, activism and criminality. Last week a retired CIA director, Michael Hayden, compared it to the dawning of the atomic age at Hiroshima, saying: &quot;This has the whiff of August 1945.&quot; As a result of the Mandiant report, published by its founder and chief executive, Kevin Mandia, a retired military cybercrime investigator, we now know about some of the players in this strange new world. The firm built up a portrait of a few of the Chinese hackers it believes work in the Shanghai complex. One was revealed as a retired PLA rear-admiral whose online nom de guerre is UglyGorilla. Another apparently had a fondness for the works of JK Rowling, as their answers to a security question featured the (misspelled) name Harry Poter. A third was called SuperHard \u2013 perhaps showing that frustrated machismo is universal among geeks whether you are in Shanghai or San Francisco. But such hackers and Unit 61398 are only a tiny part of the action. In recent weeks revelation after revelation has emerged about how prevalent Chinese hacking has become. After publishing details about the wealth of the family of a powerful Chinese politician, the New York Times was targeted for infiltration. The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal said that they too had come under attack, while on Friday Microsoft revealed that its servers had also been hacked \u2013 as fellow technology giants Facebook and Twitter have also been this year. The problem does not stop at spying on pesky media outlets. Chinese hackers have relentlessly watched all aspects of Washington. Thinktanks, government agencies, human rights groups and law firms have all been penetrated. The Post reported the astonishing extent of the activity last week under the headline: &quot;Chinese cyber-spies have hacked most Washington institutions, experts say.&quot; The problem is, many experts agree, that is still very easy. Nor does one need to be commanded by Beijing officials to do it. Chinese denials of much hacking activity often have an air of plausibility due to the lack of sophisticated security for many organisations&apos; networks and the fact that individual hackers, motivated by patriotism or simple mischief, can do it. In 2011 one assault was traced to Chinese academic bodies. Of course, China is not the world&apos;s only hacker. Few people doubt that American spies and companies give as good as they get. Even though Beijing lurks behind the Great Firewall of China and strictly regulates its internet, the country in 2011 suffered some 500,000 cyber-attacks \u2013 with around 15% of them from the US. The most dramatic act of cyber-espionage is believed to have been a joint project by the US and Israel in which the Stuxnet computer virus was used against Iran. One report claimed that the code damaged up to 1,000 centrifuges at Iran&apos;s Natanz enrichment plant, which many suspect is key to developing nuclear weapons. Other countries are in on the act too. A report released by the White House last week identified Russia as a major source of hacking. It warned that other countries were also likely to emerge. &quot;One or more fast-growing regional powers may judge that changes in its economic and political interests merit the risk of an aggressive programme of espionage,&quot; the report said. In private industry, it appears that cyber-espionage \u2013 whether by rivals or criminals \u2013 is already the norm. Every year, tens of thousands of hacks hit companies, trying to steal secrets or access data. In one report, Dmitri Alperovitch, of security firm McAfee, based in California, wrote: &quot;I am convinced that every company in every conceivable industry with significant size and valuable intellectual property and trade secrets has been compromised (or will be shortly).&quot; But the real new frontiers of this emerging shadow world lie away from big companies and sovereign states. In the parlance of espionage, they are &quot;non-state actors&quot;. Their most famous grouping is perhaps Anonymous, the amorphous grouping of hackers that has adopted a range of causes, attacking websites, individuals and organisations as it sees fit. Some causes are small. Members have leapt to the defence of people being bullied at school, attacking tormentors online and forcing them to apologise. In a recent case of alleged rape by members of the football team in the Ohio town of Steubenville, the group published claims culled from social media accounts and vowed retribution against the accused and local officials it accuses of covering up a crime. Anonymous has also tangled with huge corporations and law enforcement, launching hacks on their websites. &quot;It has become a global phenomenon,&quot; said Fruzsina Eordogh, a freelance technology writer who has covered the activities of the group. &quot;It is becoming more and more mainstream. It won&apos;t be called Anonymous any more.&quot; Perhaps the scariest aspect of cyber-espionage is how far some might go. Whether a country, a terrorist group or an individual, one possibility looms above all else: an attack on critical infrastructure, such as the power network. That could cause planes to fall out of the sky, cars to crash or power stations to explode. &quot;That is an act of war. It is beyond civilisation,&quot; said Professor John Steinbruner from the University of Maryland. Beyond civilisation, perhaps. But no longer beyond belief. Steinbruner believes America, China and other nations should draw up a sort of Geneva conventions of the cyber-sphere, taking certain acts off the table and allowing co-operation to ensure that they never happen. But he is pessimistic about that happening before some sort of catastrophic event forces the issue. &quot;We ought to be doing that.

The Welsh wizard sends the keeper the wrong way and that is that. 16:38: &quot;I live in Guangzhou and once ordered a dish called &apos;Snake Bite Chicken&apos;.&quot; says Will. &quot;It was fresher than I thought. It turned out that in the kitchen they get a living snake to bite and kill a chicken and then cook them both. The restaurant kitchen had big windows where you could view your dish being &apos;prepared&apos;. Interesting stuff.&quot; 16:37: Goal! WBA 2-0 Sunderland (Lukaku) Why did Chelsea let this guy go on loan? He is a great player and he has just got his second goal of the game. That one should give his side an insurmountable lead and all three points. Sorry for the delay on that goal being reported, more technical problems here in the GU. 16:30: By the way, if you think some of things people are confessing to eating here are strange, you should see the amount of emails that are simply unprintable. Honestly, it has opened my eyes wider than the Grand Canyon. 16:26: Goal! Arsenal 1-1 Aston Villa (Weimann) Villa break quickly from an Arsenal corner and Weimann, leading the break, has team-mates either side of him. But he don&apos;t need them, oh no. He looks up and he hammers one past Szczesny from about 25-yards out. The keeper really should have done better despite the lack of defensive cover. Oh Arsenal. 16:22: Remy has come on for QPR and sparked his side into life. They have just missed a decent opportunity as they pour the pressure on the Manchester United defence. Dave in Hong Kong has some culinary tips for all of us. &quot;I&apos;ve eaten caterpillar larvae encrusted in fungus. Steam for 15 minutes with a little salt added. Tastes like turnip but less crunchy.&quot; 16:18: You know that feeling you get when your stomach turns because you&apos;ve got some bad news or you have to fly or you&apos;ve just watched 90 minutes of Scottish football, well that&apos;s how I feel having read what Michael from Cork ate when in Japan. Let me share that feeling with you by printing his email. &quot;At the risk of infuriating eco-warriors when I lived in Japan the strangest thing I had was undoubtedly raw whale ovaries. It was vile \u2013 extremely rubbery&quot;. 16:15: RED CARD! It&apos;s a high tackle, it&apos;s up Figueroa&apos;s leg and Pogrebnyak is off for an early shower after what can only be described as an industrial tackle. Just when you thought it couldn&apos;t get any worse for Reading, it does. Figueroa was lucky to leave that challenge with his leg intact. 16:11: &quot;Strangest thing I&apos;ve eaten?&quot; asks Pete in China &quot;Deep-fried ice-cream was surreal. Scorpion is crunchy. Bees served in honey was most apposite and probably the weirdest taste sensation so far.&quot; Conor Aherne&apos;s title for eating the oddest thing ever is safe for now me thinks, though bees does come close. 16:07: Goal! Reading 0-3 Wigan (Figueroa) Figueroa picks the ball up at the half-way line plays a lovely-jubbly one two and then slots the ball home. Game! Over! Reading are heading for the second slot form the bottom of the table and very possibly relegation. 16:05: We&apos;ve yet to hear back from Pete in China about the oddest thing he has ever eaten but it will take a lot to beat Conor Aherne in Tokyo, Japan. &quot;As for the strangest thing I have put in my mouth in Japan: Shirako \u2013 Fish Sperm! What a night that was!&quot; 16:01: We&apos;rrrrrrrrrre back. By the way, in all the madness of the Wigan goals, forgot to mention that Manchester United fans should be down on their knees and saying their prayers as RVP has been taken off injured. It looked like a hamstring-gah! but he did run off the pitch so maybe it won&apos;t be too bad. Eeeeep. 15:56: Much to my amazement, there seems to be loads and loads of people out there in China reading this blog. One of them is Liam. &quot;Greetings from China! Shanghai in fact. Monday is the Lantern Festival, the final day of the New Year Festival, so the fireworks are going off again. Fireworks &amp; Footie and a few cans of Tsing Tao at midnight. Can&apos;t beat it. Kung hei fat choy!&quot; Tsing Tao is an absolute belter of a beer, from what I remember. 15:50: Pete in China, are you still out there? The questions are flooding in for you. Nick Williamson was first so we will start with him. &quot;Can you ask Pete what the strangest thing he has eaten (at least to Western eyes) since he has been there? And did he enjoy it?&quot; I once ate scorpion in China, beat that Pete! Some half-time scores: Arsenal 1-0 Aston Villa Norwich 0-1 Everton QPR 0-1 Manchester United Reading 0-2 Wigan West Brom 1-0 Sunderland 15:46: Goal! Reading 0-2 Wigan (Kone) Oh this is nice and there is no doubt over who got the final touch this time as Kone dinked the ball over an Federici. There is little better than a dink is there? Wigan are well on their way to their fourth away win. 15:44: Goal! Reading 0-1 Wigan (Kone) There is some confusion over who got this for Wigan but from here, it looks like Kone was the man with the final touch though Figueroa is trying to claim it. 15:39: Goal! Norwich 0-1 Everton (Osman) Baines whips one from the wing and Leon Osman rises above the defence to nod it home and his side into the lead. So a few minutes ago when I asked if someone was out there, someone in China perhaps? Well, Pete is in China and has emailed in to say hello. &quot;What would you like to know?&quot; he asks. I&apos;ll level with you Pete. I didn&apos;t expect someone from China to really email in so I don&apos;t really have anything to ask. Does anyone else have a question for Pete? 15:36: Goal! WBA 1-0 Sunderland (Lukaku) Steve Clarke was angry a few minutes ago but he can smile now that his side have been awarded a penalty for a handball by a Sunderland defender. Lukaku steps up and slams the ball down the middle of the goal and into the welcoming arms of the net.   15:31: Ben Roberts was at the early game today and he has some very positive things to say about his experience. Here&apos;s what he has to say. &quot;I just went to watch Fulham vs stoke in the &apos;neutral zone&apos; for a fiver. What a bargain! I&apos;m a Huddersfield Town fan, so even though I&apos;m used to a higher quality of football, this was decent enough. It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve watched Berbatov live, and I kept an eye on him throughout the march. A few neat passes aside, he really did spend most of the match propping up the advertising hoardings with a fag and a pint. But then all of a sudden, there he was, underneath the ball as it ballooned out of the 6yard box. He almost seemed offended that he had to lift his leg up to send the ball arcing and fizzing into the top corner. Fulham fans and neutrals alike leapt to their feet in awe. A wonderful moment.&quot; Steve Clarke, meanwhile, looks angry. How angry? Very. The reason? WBA have just had a goal disallowed when the referee called them back instead of playing advantage. 15:26: Goal! QPR 0-1 Manchester United (Rafael) Oh wow! Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow. Rafael has scored the goal of his life. He has just belted one from about 25-yards out. It&apos;s an absolute screamer. He will never do anything better than that. Never. He should just walk off the pitch right now and never play football again. 15:22: There be may no action out east or in the middle of the country but there is quite a bit in west London with Hernandez and Manchester United at the centre of it all. The striker has just had two good opportunities but the deadlock remains in place. 15:18: Aston Villa, and Agbonlahor in particular, has just missed a decent chance to bring his side back into the game. Meanwhile, Rohit Kapur has been in touch. &quot;I&apos;m sitting at my girlfriend&apos;s house in rural Wisconsin, with no cable, and the only internet connection available on the computer being dial-up. DIAL-UP. My cellphone is infinitely faster. So today, I&apos;m totally reliant on your text-based updates to guide me.&quot; I apologise in advance Rohit. Elsewhere, there is zero goalmouth action at Norwich v Everton. The same applies for WBA and Sunderland. 15:13: Speaking of leagues we don&apos;t like to mess with on Clocko, Simon McMahon has just sent in his standard Saturday Scottish email update. Here&apos;s the words he has typed out on his fancy iPad for your pleasure. &quot;Afternoon Ian. Game of the day in Scotland is tomorrow when the upwardly mobile Dundee United FC take on Hibs at Tannadice. If other results go our way in today&apos;s games involving Kilmarnock, Aberdeen, St. Johnstone and Inverness we could go third with a win tomorrow. It is ON!&quot; 15:10: Ehhhhhhh, we don&apos;t generally mess with the lower leagues in this here Clocko business but it&apos;s probably worth mentioning that Bolton are already 3-0 ahead of Hull. Three! After 10 minutes! Woof! 15:06: Goal! Arsenal 1-0 Aston Villa (Cazorla) Well that did not take very long did it? Santi Cazorla drives low and hard past Brad Guzan to record his 10th goal of the season for the Gunners. After an awful few days, Wenger can finally smile and smile like he means it. 15:05: Hellllllloooooooo. Anyone out there? China? There has been an early chance at Reading by the way. Federici pulled off a magnificent save to keep it level however. 15:00: Herrrrrrrrre we go! Big Stan is at the Arsenal game by the way, that&apos;s the Kroenke version of Big Stan, not the ex-Ireland manager version of Big Stan. 14:55: The first email of the afternoon comes from Ryan Dunne, who really should have better things to do today. Here&apos;s what he has to say: &quot;Hawrite Ian! Ooh, with all the tech troubles it&apos;s like a post-apocalyptic MBM! Don&apos;t worry, if robots, monkeys or mutants ever rise up and become humanity&apos;s overlords, I&apos;ll still be here, bashing F5 and invoking romantic desperation and the Glorious Glasgow Rangers! Given that you&apos;re a family friend of Daniel Day-Lewis, I was wondering if you could tell us if he&apos;s planning any special hat-trick celebration if he wins his third Best Actor Oscar tomorrow. Is he essaying Tardelli as we speak? That would be cool!&quot; I think &quot;family friend of Daniel Day-Lewis&quot; is stretching it just a tad so I&apos;m afraid I am unable offer any insight into his celebrations for tomorrow night. Ho hum. I haven&apos;t been to the cinema since Holy Motors so have no idea re the upcoming Oscars. Is he going to win? 14:40: Fulham have taken all three points from Stoke by the way, thanks to an absolute belter of a goal from Dimi Berbatov. 14:34: Folks, a word of warning, we are having something of a technical meltdown here in GU Towers in a cloudy north London, that has me, at least, weeping like a new-born baby. We have limited access to just about everything but we&apos;ll be doing our best to bring you all the usual jazz and bells and whistles that accompanies the Saturday Clockwatch. With that warning out of the way, here are today&apos;s teams.

Starting in order of the home team that has the least letters in their name, it&apos;s the battle of the As as anxious Arsenal altercate against atrocious Aston Villa. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will have quite the job on his hands to motivate his players for this encounter after, you know, what happened the other night. Luckily enough for him, Aston Villa should not provide anything like the challenge posed by the Bavarian boys. Paul Lambert&apos;s lads have won just two games on the road this season and are not exactly in the form of their lives, with just the width of a paramount point separating them from the rest of the relegation fodder. Despite that, they do have hope and that comes in the colossal constitution of Christian Benteke; the forward has now scored six goals in his last five all-competition games for the Villains (this is most consistent form of his entire career). Not bad, not bad at all. Will he still be there next season? Eh, no. Next up then is what is going to be the most exciting game of the day *insert sarcasm here* as Reading welcome Wigan to Junction 11, M4, Reading, Berkshire, RG2 0FL. OK, OK, maybe it won&apos;t be that bad. There will be goals after all, especially with cALamity Habsi in goal (see what I did there? Clever, eh? What do you mean, no?) \u2013 the Wigan keeper has made more errors leading directly to a goal than any other player in the Premier League this season, consistently costing his side points and places in the league. The only thing is you&apos;re going to have a long-ass wait for those goals to come. You can&apos;t be relying on Wigan to score \u2013 they only average one per game away from home this season \u2013 while a whopping-would-you-believe-it 42% of Reading&apos;s goals have come in the finishing 15 minutes this season. 42! Seriously. After all that jazz, all signs point to a draw at Carrow Road where the Canaries host Everton. &quot;If you have a problem, if no one else can help and if you can find them \u2013 maybe you can hire the A-Team,&quot; ran the introductory voice over for the greatest TV programme ever but the A-Team wouldn&apos;t have been able to help you eke out a 0-0 draw in the Premier League like Norwich could. No other side has managed as many of them this season than these birds. Added to that, the last three games between them and Everton have all ended in draws (1-1, 2-2 and 1-1) and the fact that neither are in sparking form and you see why all signs point to a draw. Finally, nothing else is surer today than Queens Park Rangers will get stuffed by Manchester United which leaves us with West Bromwich Albion v Sunderland, a match that will cure any insomniacs within a 1,000 mile radius and West Brom will win 2-0. All in all, should be more fun than a weekend with Banana Man. 14:00: In episode 3F17, when Martin Prince earns $600 from &quot;Go to work with your parents day&quot; he decides to treat himself to a sinful shopping spree of the goods on offer at Wee World. The young man buys Flipsy the flipping, yelping, tartan-dressed dog and, as he approaches Bart, Milhouse and Nelson to inquire about their various days at &quot;work&quot;, he can clearly be seen holds a stuffed-bag of other assorted goods from the shop. But then a strange conversation takes place: Bart: We are having the best spring break of our lives and we don&apos;t need you around nerding it up. Milhouse: That job is taken Martin: But surely I and my $600 could play some part in your vacation fun? I mean, what are we to believe, that this is some sort of a *snorts and chuckles* magic wad of cash or something? And when Homer meets George Harrison, he sees that the best Beatle has a brownie in his hand. Given Homer&apos;s predilection for all things sweet, he squeals in delight, and when Harrison point him in the direction of a massive bank of brownies, he displays sprinting skills usually devoid in a man of his girth. However, when Homer rushes over and starts cramming his kisser with the good stuff, the pile doesn&apos;t get any smaller. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is some sort of a *snorts and chuckles* magic mountain of cash or something? Those are two thundering questions that need answering ASAP but there is an even more pressing one than that \u2013 yeah I know, I am surprised too \u2013 and that&apos;s how is today&apos;s football going to pan out? But before we answer that, let&apos;s have a look at what&apos;s on offer today: Arsenal v Aston Villa Norwich v Everton QPR v Manchester United Reading v Wigan West Brom v Sunderland", "tags": ["Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2012-13"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-23T14:06:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/24/five-star-billionaire-tash-review", "sentences": ["The five main characters, three men and two women, all come to Shanghai (by some definitions the world&apos;s largest city) from Malaysia, though their backgrounds range from old money to rural deprivation.", "Three of the characters are connected by past events, while the other two, despite similar humble backgrounds, have highly contrasting encounters with Shanghai.", "Implosion of this sort is a permanent possibility, in a sense the proper response to Shanghai.", "Yes, she can see Shanghai.", "But Shanghai can see her."], "title": "Five Star Billionaire by Tash Aw \u2013 review", "article": "At one point in Tash Aw&apos;s fine new novel about what people call &quot;the new China&quot; a young woman is trying to photograph herself on her mobile phone in a park in Guangzhou, hoping to enliven her internet dating profile with an image that doesn&apos;t make her look like an immigrant factory worker (which she is). An old man who sells tickets for the rowing boats on the lake offers to take the picture for her. He looks uncertainly at her phone. She wonders if he understands how to work it. Then he says: &quot;This phone is so old. My grandson had one just like this three years ago when he was still in middle school.&quot; This is the world of the book, where traditional societies seem to have leapfrogged their way into a modernity without signposts, where the past isn&apos;t solid enough to build on but too substantial to be ignored. The five main characters, three men and two women, all come to Shanghai (by some definitions the world&apos;s largest city) from Malaysia, though their backgrounds range from old money to rural deprivation. As a title, Five Star Billionaire is close to brash, and the book&apos;s storyline could persuasively be pitched to a producer in search of a blockbuster miniseries, but the reading experience it offers is coolly engrossing \u2013 with elements of frustrating evasion \u2013 rather than propulsive. Tash Aw doesn&apos;t exactly kill plot momentum or the emotional impact of the situations he creates, but he certainly keeps them in check. Narrative hints are often indirect, like clues in a detective story, as when a passing reference to a character having written an article deploring the architecture of Gaud\u00ed suggests that a conversation almost a hundred pages earlier wasn&apos;t in fact\u00a0spontaneous. It&apos;s possible to reach the book&apos;s final stretch without being sure that this is a story of revenge. If it is, then revenge is being eaten very cold indeed, from the chiller cabinet if not the freezer. Three of the characters are connected by past events, while the other two, despite similar humble backgrounds, have highly contrasting encounters with Shanghai. Phoebe the factory worker reinvents herself as the manager of an upmarket beauty spa thanks to an appropriated identity card, while Gary the manufactured pop star falls from grace when a drunken outburst in a bar, captured on a mobile phone, punctures his angelic image. Implosion of this sort is a permanent possibility, in a sense the proper response to Shanghai. Phoebe&apos;s roommate Yanyan simply vegetates after losing her job, and the property developer Justin Lim, designated as the family fixer because he&apos;s reliable and can hold his drink, has his health break down in a way that has clear existential overtones. Even Phoebe, when she looks down on the city at last from a penthouse apartment, is as much frightened as thrilled. Yes, she can see Shanghai. But Shanghai can see her. She and Gary both feel like fakes, not cheap market-stall knock-offs but the sort of high-grade counterfeit that has its own lesser exclusiveness. Their falsity has become part of their true selves. The book teems with advice, slogans, formulas for success. Chapters have headings such as &quot;Choose the Right Moment to Launch Yourself&quot; or the more Confucian &quot;A Strong Fighting Spirit Swallows Mountains and Rivers&quot;. Phoebe reads self-help books with titles such as Sophistify Yourself or indeed Secrets of a Five Star Billionaire. She makes a list to help her navigate western-style meals (&quot;1 Soup (+ bread). 2 Fish (flat knife). 3 Meat. 4 Cheese. 5 Dessert. 6 Coffee&quot;). Preparing for a date, she decides to &quot;Dress for Sex-Cess&quot;, following the advice of one book, while Yanyan, reading from another, tells her that beauty comes from inner confidence. It&apos;s never clear, either to the characters or the reader, whether the breakthrough moment comes when people manage to strike a balance between conflicting codes, or when instinct overrides them altogether. The book is full of missed connections. When Phoebe was a factory worker, for instance, she had a poster of Gary on her wall. After his disgrace he strikes up an internet friendship with her, incognito. She helps him survive emotionally, and gives him the confidence to reinvent himself \u2013 though his transformation in a few months from showbiz puppet to singer-songwriter is the only unconvincing strand in the book. He feels she knows the real him, and wants to have no secrets. Can&apos;t their counterpointed lives be brought into some sort of harmony? One of the book&apos;s techniques is to describe something from two sides, but with a delay. So Gary&apos;s comeback concert in a tiny bohemian venue is described from his point of view, and then 60 pages later as experienced by someone in the audience. The accounts aren&apos;t dramatically different, but the delay prevents them from coalescing into a single impression. They&apos;re notes that refuse to become a chord, in a way that is characteristic of the book&apos;s seductive if slightly perverse preference for the muted and the unresolved, even when portraying the seething life of a city that is more like &quot;a whole continent, with a heart as deep and unknown as the forests of the Amazon and as vast and wild as the deserts of Africa&quot;. But there&apos;s never a moment that describes Phoebe&apos;s online friendship with the unrecognised Gary from her point of view. I have to admit that I started inventing plot on my own account to explain this absence of what had promised to be the heart of the book. Had Yanyan hacked into Phoebe&apos;s email, for instance? But the second shoe never dropped, whether it would have proved to be a fake \u2013 high-end or low \u2013 or even the real thing.", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "China", "Culture", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-24T00:05:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/25/airport-tantrum-arrogance-entitlement-china", "sentences": ["&quot;My irrational actions and rudeness have caused some losses to the airport as well as bad effects to the public, so I sincerely apologise to the airport and public,&quot; he told the airport&apos;s deputy manager, according to the Shanghai Daily."], "title": "Airport tantrum becomes latest symbol of arrogance and entitlement in China", "article": "       Anyone could understand Yan Linkun&apos;s frustration when he was informed that he had missed his flight. But the way Yan reacted to the news \u2013 banging on doors and smashing computers \u2013 has turned him into the latest symbol of the entitlement and arrogance increasingly associated with China&apos;s political elite. A surveillance video showing the mining company deputy chairman&apos;s violent tantrum at Kunming Changshui airport, Yunnan province, went viral on Chinese microblogs after it was uploaded to the internet this weekend. The four-minute video, captured last Tuesday morning, shows Yan standing by a check-in counter as an airport employee informs him that he has missed his flight to Shenzhen. Yan \u2013 who is also a member of a political advisory body in Qujing, Yunnan \u2013 responds first with incredulity, then rage. He destroys two computers and a telephone before dismantling a free-standing poster and using its metal frame to banged on the flight gate door. A crowd gathers, but nobody attempts to restrain him. The mining company has suspended Yan, and the political advisory body has threatened punishment. Since the incoming Chinese president, Xi Jinping, launched a crackdown on corruption last autumn, dozens of officials have been exposed as crooked by the country&apos;s internet users and subsequently reprimanded. The crackdown has done more to expose the scale of China&apos;s corruption problem than validate the high-level efforts to tackle it. Yan has expressed remorse for his behaviour. &quot;My irrational actions and rudeness have caused some losses to the airport as well as bad effects to the public, so I sincerely apologise to the airport and public,&quot; he told the airport&apos;s deputy manager, according to the Shanghai Daily. The tantrum is not the only incidence of high-level misbehaviour that has gripped China during the past week. The Communist party secretary of a district bureau in Nanyang City, Henan province, drove a government car into a cinema on Sunday morning, injuring 26 people, according the state news agency Xinhua. Eight of the injured were hospitalised, two of whom remain in a critical condition. The official, Liu Xianchong mistook the accelerator in his government-issued vehicle for the brake, reported Xinhua. The report cited local police as saying that Lie had been off work for seven months because of a cerebral infarction, a type of stroke. A special group to &quot;handle the incident and its aftermath&quot; was set up by the local party committee, Xinhua said. Liu has been detained. Last week party disciplinary authorities said a former official in Shaanxi province had been expelled from the party for &quot;serious wrongdoing&quot; and &quot;suspected crimes&quot;. Yang Dacai rose to notoriety last August after he was photographed smiling at the scene of a road accident in which 36 people died. He became a symbol of official corruption when further photographs appeared on the internet of him wearing a number of luxury watches that many in China believe he could not possibly afford on a public servant&apos;s salary.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-25T16:24:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/25/gabriele-basilico", "sentences": ["From his early work documenting the coastline of France and the ruins of Beirut following the civil war of the 1980s, through to portraits of Shanghai, Istanbul, Moscow and Rio de Janeiro, and images of former industrial powerhouses now decayed and abandoned, his domain was the relentless decay of the old and the burgeoning new megalopolis."], "title": "Gabriele Basilico obituary", "article": "The Italian photographer Gabriele Basilico, who has died of cancer aged 68, was arguably the best internationally known photographer of urban landscapes. From his early work documenting the coastline of France and the ruins of Beirut following the civil war of the 1980s, through to portraits of Shanghai, Istanbul, Moscow and Rio de Janeiro, and images of former industrial powerhouses now decayed and abandoned, his domain was the relentless decay of the old and the burgeoning new megalopolis. Born in Milan, Basilico trained as an architect and graduated from Milan Polytechnic in 1973. Architecture informed his work throughout his life but with the recent exception of a book on (and sponsored by) Scavolini kitchens, the interior world did not feature any more than the residents of the apartment blocks and factories he documented. On the rare occasions when people did figure in his photographs, it was not to inhabit, still less to belong there, but to exaggerate the monumental scale of the apparently empty buildings. According to the photographer and writer Italo Zannier, Basilico&apos;s place in 20th-century Italian photography was assured by his style of &quot;1930s sophistication&quot;, his &quot;controlled and knowing metaphysical tension&quot; and his achievement in &quot;combining a postmodernist taste for peripheral architecture with an archaeological approach \u2026 documented in an intense chiaroscuro&quot;. Although Basilico latterly explored colour and digital photography, his lifelong passion was for often ominous shades of black and white and the use of classic cameras, particularly his large-format Rolleiflex. At times, he would employ a still older tripod and black cloth technique. Italy inspired his portfolio throughout his life. His first major exhibition, held in Milan, presented factory portraits \u2013 not of the workers but of the buildings. It represented three years of work undertaken between 1978 and 1980. He then undertook a project documenting modernist architecture in Milan, seeking to give the impression in the photographs that time had been suspended. This was achieved, he explained, through lighting and the absence of traffic. Commissioned by the French government&apos;s Mission Photographique for the Bord de Mer project, he created a study principally of Norman seascapes exploring the point where land and sea merge, almost without a border, in a bleak diffusion he called apocalyptic. During the second half of the 1980s, he explored Europe through its cities (Trieste, Antwerp, Geneva, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Vigo), his eye always more on the margins than the centre. Basilico&apos;s fascination with harbours and the liminal edge of things led to a book and exhibition of seaports in 1982, and a book of collected projects, Porti di Mare, in 1990. He exhibited at the Rencontres d&apos;Arles festival (1987) in Provence, the Philippe Daverio gallery in New York (1987) and Mois de la Photo in Paris (1990), and undertook work for the Milanese Progetto Beni Architettonici e Ambientali (Project for the Architectural and Environmental Heritage of Milan). In 1990 Basilico went to Berlin to document the aftermath of the fall of the wall: the largely untouched, decaying grand avenues of the eastern zone were perfectly suited to his eye for the relics of abandon. In 1991, he accepted a commission to document Beirut in the wake of the 15-year-long Lebanese civil war. The bleak formality of the bullet-riddled, empty arcades was captured only with available light. Basilico&apos;s sense of scale and absence was unique in this group project, sponsored by the foundation belonging to Rafik Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister assassinated in 2005, and including work by Josef Koudelka, Ren\u00e9 Burri, Raymond Depardon, Robert Frank and Fouad Elkoury. Basilico, who later returned to Beirut, wrote on his first visit: &quot;There were almost no street lamps and buildings looked like ghosts. The only noise was that of electricity generators. Space was perceptible but not matter. The atmosphere was heavy and intriguing.&quot; He later concluded: &quot;It seemed to me some people had just left and others were about to return. All in all, the situation seemed almost normal \u2013 the city had just entered a long period of waiting.&quot; For the next 20 years, Basilico&apos;s publications and exhibitions gathered pace, as he zigzagged between familiar places and obsessions. He continued to focus on European cities as industrial centres; times of violence and dislocation; and themes of collapse and decay. Rio de Janeiro, San Francisco and Kwangju joined the panorama, alongside Oporto, Marseille and Bolzano. There were also occasional shifts of scale to studies of benches and bollards, girders and staircases, worthy of Eug\u00e8ne Atget. At the Venice Biennale in 1996, he received the Osella d&apos;Oro award, a most prestigious trophy to add to the rest. He continued to work up until his death: during his career there were more than 100 group and 50 solo exhibitions, with a major retrospective at the Galleria Civica d&apos;Arte Moderna, in Turin, in 2001. The scholar and curator Francesco Bonami said that, in his urban landscapes, Basilico was &quot;like a doctor examining a patient who has survived a deadly disease. He observed destruction and at the same time acknowledged the incredible possibilities offered by survival.&quot; \u2022 Gabriele Basilico, photographer, born 12 August 1944; died 13 February 2013", "tags": ["Photography", "News UK"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-25T18:38:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/25/austerity-not-the-only-response", "sentences": ["Looking out of the window at some of Shanghai&apos;s 2,500 skyscrapers, I am reminded there&apos;s more than one economic model in the world (Former Tory chancellors warn on economy, 25 February)."], "title": "Letters: Austerity is not the only response", "article": "Looking out of the window at some of Shanghai&apos;s 2,500 skyscrapers, I am reminded there&apos;s more than one economic model in the world (Former Tory chancellors warn on economy, 25 February). In 2008, after the western financial crisis, it was predicted that China&apos;s economy would falter, as 22% of China&apos;s exports went to the EU and 15% to the US. A drop in economic growth to less than 8% was forecast. In fact, the economy grew 9.6% in 2008, 9.1% in 2009, 10.6% in 2010, 9.6% in 2011, 7.8% in 2012. Moody&apos;s predicts 7.8 to 8.5% for 2013. This was caused by internal investment of $560bn in 2009/10, leading to huge developments in health, education and infrastructure. In one year, national educational expenditure rose by 45%. The Chinese government reacted to the crisis by building things, not giving money to banks. Steve ElsworthWeymouth, Dorset \u2022\u2009The downgrade of British government bonds is partly a reflection of the nervousness of investors because the British government, having remained outside the euro, enjoys greater sovereignty in the conduct of economic policy. Greater sovereignty comes with the ability to devalue the currency to gain international competitiveness and the ability to monetise the debt through the Bank of England. Greater sovereignty thus carries the danger, in the eyes of investors, that the value of the stock of debt might be inflated away in some disorderly fashion if the current policies, which appear to conflate deficit reduction with effective debt management, are recognised too late by government as unsustainable.SP ChakravartyBangor \u2022\u2009If you always do what you&apos;ve always done, you&apos;ll always get what you&apos;ve always got. The chancellor can&apos;t admit that his economic policy has been a car crash. When the Tories took over government with the Lib Dems in tow, they had a worldwide economic crisis to act as a smokescreen for them to do what they would have wanted to do anyway: shrink the state and its influence for the benefit of the few. We might have hoped that the loss of the prized AAA rating would lead to a rethink but George Osborne says more of the same, only more so, is what is needed. At a time when Lincoln is in the news the Tories have their own Gettysburg address: Government of the rich, by the rich, for the rich. But it won&apos;t win George an Oscar. Alan HealeyMilson, Shropshire \u2022\u2009I remember Denis Healey&apos;s return from the airport and the IMF in 1976. I remember the screaming headlines, and the indignant opposition at the fall of the last redoubt of a collapsing orthodoxy. Where are they now? These are defining times, but not by our media, who offer us tepid talk from Cable, or the official opposition, who offer us nothing at all. Michael BallLondon \u2022\u2009The downgrading of the UK&apos;s AAA credit rating, and the inevitable fall in the value of sterling, has torpedoed one of the key arguments against Scottish independence. We have for years been told of the merits of being in the UK because of its credit rating, but this bubble has been burst with the warning by Moody&apos;s that growth will remain &quot;sluggish&quot; over the next few years, and the risk of slipping back into recession for the third time. Contrast this with the news that investment in North Sea oil and gas is at a 30-year high, with companies looking for offshore energy investing \u00a311.4bn in 2012. The number of projects given development approval by the Department of Energy and Climate Change almost doubled between 2011 and 2012, and there are still 24bn barrels of oil to be recovered, with an estimated wholesale value of \u00a31.5tn.

It was very full of excited people talking about their new venture with some of the leading mobile operators to launch a new phone OS, aimed at the tier just below &apos;real&apos; smartphones. There was much talk of openness and other ideologically correct things, and none at all about any consumer benefits. I did hear someone from Mozilla say that &apos;Firefox is a great consumer brand&apos;, though, which is a pretty questionable claim: the target consumers would be pushed to name ANY browser, let alone Firefox. There is a reference phone from ZTE (and also one from Alcatel I haven&apos;t seen yet): the software is slow and not especially elegant, and the device is targeted to cost $100. 50 yards away there is a half-empty stand from Haier, a second-tier Chinese OEM. Their W619 is a 2G android smartphone running Android 4, with 2 SIM slots, a 3.5&quot; screen and an MTK chipset. It is very solid and the UI is perfectly fluid. The wholesale price is $50: 3G versions are $75.  Quite a punchline too. Apple supplier penalized for polluting nearby river in China &gt;&gt; Computerworld  An Apple supplier known for making iPads has been penalized by Chinese authorities for turning a nearby river in Shanghai &quot;white&quot; after dumping pollutants during the nation&apos;s Spring Festival holiday. The supplier, RiTeng Computer Accessory, had wrongfully dumped waste water used for cleaning processes due to suspected staff negligence, according to a Friday statement from a parent company.  The water couldn&apos;t be used for watering crops; the waste killed all the shellfish. RiTeng also assembles for HP, Dell and Asus; it has had industrial accidents before, including explosions. Basically, China needs to take tough action against polluters like this. Three reasons I still have a BlackBerry and won&apos;t switch &gt;&gt; Forbes Boiled down, they are: (1) BBM, even though he says that WhatsApp actually does all he needs; (2) a physical keyboard, unlike the one on his last BlackBerry which broke (not an argument for the Z10); (3) he doesn&apos;t care about apps such as Instagram. Compelling? Trying the Microsoft Surface Pro &gt;&gt; Penny Arcarde&apos;s Gabe He thinks:   As a mobile solution for a digital artist I&apos;d say the Surface Pro is a winner. Now obviously if you need Photoshop you will probably want to wait until they get their driver issues worked out. If you&apos;re a Sketchbook user (or you could be) then this thing is ready to go right now. I had some people on Twitter asking if the Surface Pro makes sense as an alternative to a Cintiq at home or the office. That one is harder for me to answer. I personally really like my Cintiq 24HD and I would not use the Surface pro at the office instead of it.  He&apos;s generally positive, but notes some downsides: heat, battery life, storage, non-adjustable kickstand angle. Still, he thinks it could replace his iPad for a number of tasks. Hands-on with the HP Slate 7 - it&apos;s just another cheap tablet you shouldn&apos;t buy &gt;&gt; Android Police  While the Slate 7 does perform decently, it is noticeably slower than a Nexus 7 even in basic UI navigation tasks (thank that 1.6GHz dual-core processor), and that&apos;s really just the tip of the drawback iceberg. The 1024x600 screen is terrible. Let me say what I mean by terrible: the Nexus 7&apos;s display isn&apos;t winning any awards (it&apos;s good, but by no means great), and the Slate 7&apos;s display is pretty crappy even from that point of comparison. An aspect ratio of 16:9 and unusually large bezels on the top and bottom make the Slate 7 look unusually tall, too, and I can&apos;t say I&apos;m a fan. The unit I played with also had some weird UI scaling issues going on (everything look &apos;squished&apos;). There&apos;s no NFC, no GPS, and just 8GB on-board storage. \u00a0The upshot is that HP hopes you&apos;ll buy into are the presence of a microSD card slot, HP ePrint, and a 3MP rear camera, all at a cost $30 less than the Nexus 7. Maybe for some these could be a legitimate draw, but honestly, you&apos;re likely to pay for it in the long run - who knows what HP&apos;s software update schedule is going to look like (it&apos;s running Android 4.1.1 in our hands-on), or how well this untested hardware will age (a dual-core A9 processor isn&apos;t exactly cutting-edge).  Something priced to make a retail profit is bound to struggle against something being sold at wholesale prices. Samsung ditches AMOLED and Exynos for Galaxy S4? Supposed image leaks &gt;&gt; Android Authority  [Saturday] morning, noted rumor purveyor Sam Mobile dropped a bomb on Samsung Galaxy S fans, with a report that allegedly contains the official specifications of the upcoming Galaxy S4. The shocker is that Samsung will supposedly not be using an Exynos processors nor an AMOLED display on their 2013 flagship. Before we go any further, note that Sam Mobile claims that, while the information comes from a &quot;trusted insider&quot;, it&apos;s not official.

The relatively numerous east Asian students who, by virtue of an intense regime of exam-oriented drilling \u2013 including hours of after-school tutorial classes \u2013 acquire a facility in applying a given set of formulae to a clearly delimited range of problems are not guaranteed to become innovative geniuses. Indeed, recent years have witnessed plane-loads of East Asian educational policymakers flying westwards in search of the elixir of &quot;creativity&quot; and &quot;critical thinking&quot;. The claim that &quot;education has historically been highly valued&quot; in east Asia is simplistic. The readiness to sacrifice one&apos;s youth to the earnest pursuit of high test scores is certainly deeply embedded. The emphasis of these tests on factual recall and the &quot;correct&quot; application of set formulae is part and parcel of a process of socialisation that aims to produce obedient workers reluctant to question established authority \u2013 though thankfully it often fails. Both Labour and Tory spokesmen call in response for a strengthening of maths teaching. Ensuring all students have a solid grounding in basic numeracy is certainly necessary. However, what is going to give way in a crowded timetable? Modern languages, perhaps? If one is really looking for a weak spot in English schooling, the pitiful neglect of foreign language teaching stands out. In order to flourish, England needs active, responsible citizens, aware of and comfortable with the diversity of their own society and the wider world, equipped both with the skills required for their personal advancement, and with a commitment to advancing the interests of the broader community. Combining a resolute monolingualism, after-school tutoring in maths and test-oriented pedagogy all-round is impoverishing, in every sense.Dr Edward VickersKyushu University, Japan \u2022 Prior to starting my PGCE at the Institute of Education, I taught a range of pupils \u2013 Chinese, Japanese and Korean, among others \u2013 at an international school in Shanghai for two years. While their maths calculation skills were very advanced, their ability to problem-solve, to think creatively or to answer word problems was much more limited. The statistic that Asian pupils outperform UK pupils in mathematics does not take this into account. The claim that Asian pupils are two years ahead of UK pupils by the time they reach their GCSEs is wholly unsurprising given that they have probably had the equivalent of two years&apos; extra education (if not more) through late-night crammer schools and private tutoring. I knew many teachers who worked in such schools, often from 3pm to 10pm or later. With limited university places available in these Asian countries (particularly South Korea), each consecutive generation has to meet growing expectations. The cost of this extra cramming is that pupils have significantly less free time to develop hobbies, to play, to relax, to sleep, to form friendships.

Cristobal Balenciaga, who died in 1972, was the fashion designer&apos;s designer, the man of whom Christian Dior said: &quot;He is the maestro, the rest of us just musicians.&quot; The names of Chanel and Dior may pack more punch in modern popular culture, but the cognoscenti revere the legacy of Balenciaga above all others. The recent appointment of Alexander Wang as the house&apos;s new designer was therefore something of an eyebrow-raiser. How can a 29-year-old designer whose clothes are rooted in the Californian beach culture of his teens and the downtown New York slouch-chic of his student years make sense of Balenciaga, which for the past 15 years has been steered by the very French, very intense Nicolas Ghesquiere?     Balenciaga Autumn/Winter collection at Paris Fashion Week Photograph: Balenciaga    Wang&apos;s debut suggested that the commercial instincts which led PPR, the luxury brand group behind Balenciaga, to hire him were shrewd. Francois-Henri Pinault of PPR has said he hopes Wang&apos;s Balenciaga will be &quot;approachable&quot;, which is an only slightly coded way of saying he hopes it will sell. There is frustration within PPR that the reverence in which Balenciaga is held within the fashion world does not translate into brand visibility on a wider scale. The Lariat bag was the one barnstorming commercial success by Ghesquiere, who otherwise continued in the grand Balenciaga tradition of making exquisite clothes aimed rather narrowly at a fashion elite. The stardust in Wang&apos;s own-label collections at New York fashion week has always been a sixth sense about what young women want to wear, and it is that connection which PPR hope he can bring to Balenciaga. Backstage, Wang referred to the show as &quot;the first chapter&quot; in a mission to retell the story of Balenciaga so that it strikes a chord with a broader audience. Where Ghesquiere&apos;s design processes were intricate and multi-layered, Wang&apos;s approach was to present the subtle, nuanced codes of Balenciaga in a new, simple way. As Wang commented after the show, Balenciaga himself &quot;took the avant-garde, and made it everyday&quot;.     Balenciaga Autumn/Winter collection at Paris Fashion Week Photograph: Balenciaga    This was a confident, uncomplicated debut. For chapter one, Wang took as his touchstone the &quot;semi-fitted&quot; silhouette which was Balenciaga&apos;s response to the hourglass New Look with which Christian Dior seduced the postwar fashion world. Semi-fitted jackets accentuate the waist at the front, but are puffed with volume at the back, a shape which Wang infused with a new sportiness. The rounded shoulders which are a Balenciaga signature were given a playful teddy-bear fur finish. In the draping of a cutaway evening dress there was a nod to the loose fit of the racer-back vests which are a signature of Wang&apos;s own label collection \u2013 but here on the Avenue George V, a gleaming sculpted bodice was glimpsed beneath. While the silhouette made reference to Balenciaga&apos;s mid-century rivalry with Dior, the slick, minimal take on couture suggested that the aesthetic of Wang&apos;s Balenciaga might run alongside, rather than diametrically opposed to, that of Christian Dior under its current designer, Raf Simons. The debut was imbued with cool precision. The venue was the historic headquarters of Balenciaga on the Avenue George V, where a suite of elegant first floor rooms were made over in stark monochrome: whitewashed walls, doorframes picked out in black paint, the parquet a deep black walnut. Window boxes were filled with black-sprayed box hedge, out of which grew slim budded branches rising to the top of the glass to make the prettiest of blackout blinds and protect the carefully calibrated lighting from rogue sunbeams. The slim silver benches padded with black velvet snaked maze-like around endless corners, so that the audience were given a view of each outfit from different angles as the models turned: crucial at a house where silhouette has always ruled over decoration.     Balenciaga Autumn/Winter collection at Paris Fashion Week Photograph: Balenciaga    The message that shape is key was underlined at every stage, even in the decorative motifs themselves, by the theme of marble. The invitations were backed with an image of white-veined black marble, while the catwalk was a reverse image of black-on-white. Marbled green and black fur and a stunning intarsia knit which mimicked a cracked, marbled finish featured, as did sections of marbled lining exposed in a simple, chic touch where the edges of a neckline were pinned back. This collection will be judged by Wang&apos;s new bosses not by how well-received it is by those who attended Thursday&apos;s show, but by whether it can reach a new audience. Pinault recently told CBS that Wang &quot;is young and has a very universal culture. He is American with Chinese roots. His family are based in Shanghai.&quot; Wang, who speaks Mandarin, has a high profile in China where his own-label already has a Beijing flagship. There seems little doubt this is part of his appeal to PPR. Balenciaga has recently stepped up its Asian presence, with new openings taking the total number of stores in mainland China to 11.

He is not a man.&quot; Sutil had been upset by Hamilton&apos;s refusal to appear as a defence witness after he had been given an 18-month suspended prison sentence and fined \u00a3167,000 after being found guilty of grievous bodily harm. He had assaulted the Lotus executive Eric Lux in a Shanghai nightclub in 2011. Sutil suggested that his relationship with Hamilton was still extremely cool when he said: &quot;I&apos;m not in contact with him any more, so we have no relationship at the moment. I&apos;ve not seen him, I&apos;ve not spoken to him. For sure, I will meet up with him but I don&apos;t know what will happen.&quot; But Hamilton appeared keen to be friends again. He said: &quot;I emailed him on the way here as soon as I found out and congratulated him. I haven&apos;t heard back from him but I am sure at some stage we will get to talk.&quot; Sutil said he deserved a second chance in Formula One. &quot;Everyone can make mistakes in life,&quot; he said. &quot;If you never make mistakes you will never grow.

She smiled, shrugged, and pronounced it &quot;flattering. I do notice, of course I do; I see it in the street.&quot; Is she ever tempted to buy the endless high street versions of her signature minimal chic? &quot;I don&apos;t have time to go shopping, otherwise I totally would,&quot; she said. It was the perfect C\u00e9line answer. Cool and laid-back where others would be shrill and overblown; classy without being snobbish; quietly resonant of the fundamental issues of modern life (time, the lack of); reinforcing an image of a woman who loves clothes but maintains a sense of proportion. These, even more than the round-shouldered coats and the funnel-neck sweaters, are the codes Philo has written for C\u00e9line during her six years in charge. After taking an obtuse turn with her collection last season, which included flat walking sandals lined with brightly coloured teddy bear fur \u2013 soon to go on sale for \u00a3840 a pair \u2013 this collection had the makings of an instant hit. The mood as the show ended was a feeling that even by C\u00e9line standards, this was particularly strong. &quot;Intimacy, softness, instinct and desire&quot; were Philo&apos;s words. The shape and colours were feminine, with skirts in nubbly cream or peach wool cut in a close curve over the hips before fluting to below the knee. The C\u00e9line woman can at times seem cool to the point of guardedness, but she seemed softer, more approachable this season. Handbags were made from the same fabrics as the clothes, and hugged the body, so although styled for the outdoors the models looked cosy rather than armoured. Oblique references and unnerving touches are part of any C\u00e9line show. On each seat was a scrapbook of visual references, including a detail from Van Eyck&apos;s 1434 painting, the Arnolfini Marriage; photographs of cloud formations; and an image of NUD 3, Sarah Lucas&apos;s abstract nude sculpture made from breezeblock and tights. On the catwalk were nuggets, curveballs and in-jokes. The idea of softness was elaborated into fur dresses, and coats which featured trompe l&apos;oeil sleeves tied around the shoulder; there was a wink to fashion&apos;s vogue for checks with clothes in the checked weave of plasticised laundry holdalls. It may be significant in terms of where the winds of fashion blow next that there was some synergy between this show and that of Miuccia Prada, who like Philo is a designer who goes her own way on what seems like an emotional hunch. (If there is a more strategic plan behind their fads and foibles, neither are telling.) Elements in this C\u00e9line collection \u2013 the naive cut of the coat collars, the just-below-the-knee-length skirts, the soft shell pinks \u2013 chimed with Prada, in a way that may indicate romance, intimacy and femininity, and may come to be repeated around the echo chambers of fashion. Like Philo, Clare Waight Keller of Chlo\u00e9 is a Briton at the helm of a French label. Chlo\u00e9 is so fundamentally Parisienne that it is tricky territory for a British designer to inhabit while maintaining her identity, but Waight Keller is managing the balancing act. Her fourth collection blended Parisian polish (plenty of navy, touches of flirty sheer net) with London punch: the pinafore shapes and high-heeled loafers were an Alexa Chung-ish touch, while the designer credited &quot;night buses, bike sheds, bare legs and cold nights&quot; among her inspirations for the season.", "tags": ["Paris fashion week autumn/winter 2013", "C\u00e9line", "Paris fashion week", "Life and style", "Fashion weeks", "Fashion"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-03T20:20:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/mar/05/vegetarian-food-tour-in-shanghai", "sentences": ["It was hearing countless similar tales of vegetarian woe that prompted Jamie Barys and Kyle Long to offer a vegetarian-themed guided walk around Shanghai&apos;s food streets.", "&quot;We&apos;ve been running street food tours under the name of UnTour Shanghai for about two years, and we were getting a surprising number of emails from people saying: &apos;I&apos;m a vegetarian, can you help me?&apos;&quot; Barys says.", "Barys starts by taking us for a stroll through Xiangyang park, in an area of Shanghai known as the French concession.", "Leaving the park we turn on to Xiangyang Road \u2013 one of Shanghai&apos;s few remaining food streets.", "I won&apos;t be losing weight in Shanghai this time around.", "\u2022 Frederika Whitehead went on the Vegetarian Voyage food tour of Shanghai&apos;s street food with Untours."], "title": "A vegetarian food tour in Shanghai", "article": "Ask any vegetarian who&apos;s been to Asia about the food and they will tell you something along these lines: &quot;I told them I was vegetarian and they offered me chicken&quot; or: &quot;I ordered vegetable noodles and they came with bits of pork in the broth&quot; or even &quot;I went to Asia a vegetarian but gave up and came back having eaten sparrow, dog and snake as well as beef and chicken.&quot; Six years ago, I went on an escorted press trip around China. I told the organisers I was a vegetarian. They gave me a funny look but said: &quot;OK, fine.&quot; And then served me pork dumplings, seafood and beef noodles \u2013 all of which they said &quot;wasn&apos;t meat&quot;. So for three weeks I got by eating just the boiled rice and bags of peanuts from the hotel bar, and lost a stone. It was hearing countless similar tales of vegetarian woe that prompted Jamie Barys and Kyle Long to offer a vegetarian-themed guided walk around Shanghai&apos;s food streets. &quot;We&apos;ve been running street food tours under the name of UnTour Shanghai for about two years, and we were getting a surprising number of emails from people saying: &apos;I&apos;m a vegetarian, can you help me?&apos;&quot; Barys says. &quot;We were incorporating advice for vegetarians in our regular street food tour but there was enough demand to launch a separate tour. We launched Vegetarian Voyage in May and at the moment we are getting enough requests to run it about once every two weeks.&quot; &quot;Chinese people don&apos;t really understand what being vegetarian means, or why someone wouldn&apos;t want to eat meat. Most of their dishes are not a slab of beef \u2013 they use meat to flavour their food, or they garnish it with a little sprinkle of pork. 60% to 90% of the dish is vegetarian and vegetarians are expected to pick around the meat,&quot; Barys says. UnTour&apos;s vegetarian tour takes place at breakfast time. Barys starts by taking us for a stroll through Xiangyang park, in an area of Shanghai known as the French concession. We pass Chinese pensioners walking backwards around the perimeter of the park to improve their co-ordination and balance. Leaving the park we turn on to Xiangyang Road \u2013 one of Shanghai&apos;s few remaining food streets. Next to each stall a few plastic seats and tables are strewn across the pavement. A woman hoses down the pavement to wash away the debris from a previous batch of diners. And all kinds of food are being prepared. Barys orders our first dish of the day: qingcai baozi, a steamed bun with a bok choi, mushroom and tofu filling. One bite of this and I am determined to hunt these out when I&apos;m back in the UK. It&apos;s absolutely delicious \u2013 like a tofu casserole inside a bread roll. There is a faint whiff of star anise from the marinade of the tofu. The same stallholder also sells &quot;tea eggs&quot; (cha ye dan), hard-boiled eggs which have had their shells cracked and have been marinaded in tea with soy sauce, vinegar, star anise and cinnamon. When buying these you need to be careful that you aren&apos;t pointing at a tray of similar-looking Maodan \u2013 fertilised eggs, boiled with the foetus inside \u2026 Barys also orders us a da congyou bing \u2013 a big pancake made from a millet batter. An egg is broken on top of the partly cooked pancake, this is chopped up and spread over the pancake so it covers the whole surface, then brushed with hoisin sauce and sprinkled with chilli flakes and finely chopped spring onions and coriander. Finally it is folded several times to form a thick, many-layered wedge. The hoisin sauce runs through it like a thin layer of jam. The egg gives each layer of the fold a crispy skin. It is delicious, doughy, very filling and best eaten immediately. A little further up the same road we taste bamboo tofu fried with fresh green peppers and dried red chilli peppers. &quot;Bamboo tofu is the butter of tofu, the stuff that floats to the top of the pot; they scrape it off and dry it out, and then dehydrate it to store it,&quot; Barys tells us. It looks a bit like tree bark \u2013 hence the name. &quot;The stuff they sell as tofu in the west \u2013 in the plastic trays with water \u2013 of course it tastes awful; any food left sitting in water would taste awful,&quot; she continues. I&apos;m smitten with the dish, and my eyes light up when we reach another tofu stall a bit further down the road. Barys sees me heading towards it. On the hot plate are pinky-red squares of infused beancurd, and I wonder what it has been spiced with. &quot;Yeah, you want to watch out for that tofu&quot;, she says. &quot;That&apos;s been marinaded in pigs blood.&quot; We finish our breakfast with pudding \u2013 a danta, or Macanese egg tart, from Lillian&apos;s bakery in the Paris Spring Mall near South Shaanxi Road metro station. This egg custard recipe has been popular in Southern China since the Portuguese ran Macau. &quot;When KFC moved to Chin,a they were reported to have paid millions for the original recipe and they now sell 450bn of these egg tarts a year,&quot; Barys says. As an aside, as she leaves us Barys points out a building site near the metro station. &quot;People are getting very excited. The rumour is that Jamie Oliver took a look at this site for a possible new venture.&quot; He will have his work cut out if he wants to compete with the food the locals are producing. I won&apos;t be losing weight in Shanghai this time around.

The Peel group also wants to build two clusters of skyscrapers, including a 55-storey tower, which would become the tallest building in north-west England. Liverpool city council initially granted planning permission for the scheme \u2013 which officials say will create 20,000 jobs \u2013 in March 2012, with conditions on timescale, the heights of buildings and phasing of works, and it was formally submitted to the Department for Communities and Local Government in October. The communities secretary, Eric Pickles, wrote to the council on Monday to say he would not &quot;call in&quot; the project for a public inquiry as it was a decision best taken by Liverpool&apos;s councillors \u2013 effectively giving a green light for bulldozers to move in on the north bank of the Mersey, formerly known as Central Docks.

The committee has the option of striking Liverpool off the list immediately or giving the UK government a chance to intervene. However, Liverpool&apos;s civic leaders are ebullient about what such a high-profile scheme means for the city in the context of the UK&apos;s flatlining economy. The mayor, Joe Anderson, said: &quot;This is fantastic news for Liverpool. I&apos;m absolutely delighted that the secretary of state shares the confidence we have in our ability to deliver this vitally important regeneration scheme, while protecting our architectural heritage. &quot;Liverpool Waters will create thousands of jobs and opportunities for local people, as well as providing new housing and attracting new businesses and visitors. &quot;It&apos;s a huge boost for our city and yet more evidence that despite the recession, regeneration is forging ahead here. We can now look forward to the plans moving forward on this once-in-a-lifetime scheme which will bring huge, lasting benefits to future generations in this city.&quot; Peel&apos;s development director Lindsey Ashworth said: &quot;This is a well-deserved reward and justice for all those who never gave up supporting this scheme \u2026 English Heritage together with the World Heritage Body Unesco put up massive obstacles to prevent this development proposal getting permission. &quot;Their studies and arguments have all collapsed and rightly so as it&apos;s simply not right to expect derelict parts of cities with such a rich history to stand still and be fossilised. &quot;This consent will open up opportunities and new prospects to link our UK businesses with other international businesses such as Asia. All cities in the UK have to compete with each other and each has to compete with rival European cities. Liverpool is now well placed to be alongside the best of the best.&quot; A spokesman from the communities department said: &quot;Ministers&apos; general approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities.

CHELSEA: HISTORY MAKERS? &quot;It dawned on me recently that if Chelsea were to go on and win the Europa League this year on 15 May that, for a period of 10 days, they would be the holders of both major European trophies (as well as being technically the holders of the Cup-Winners&apos; Cup),&quot; wonders Brian Quinn. &quot;Has there ever been another brief period like this when a team held two European honours simultaneously? Perhaps going back to when there were three distinct European competitions?&quot; Chelsea will indeed claim a unique honour if they triumph at the Amsterdam Arena in May. Only four sides have ever won different European competitions in consecutive years \u2013 Juventus, Milan, Porto and Liverpool - and in each instance the teams were deposed as holders of one trophy before getting their hands on the other. Milan won the much-missed Cup Winners&apos; Cup on 23 May 1968, but Slovan Bratislava were crowned the new champions on 21 May 1969, seven days before Milan hammered Ajax in the Bernab\u00e9u to win the 1969 European Cup. Similarly Juventus won the Cup Winners&apos; Cup on 16 May 1984, but Everton won that tournament almost exactly a year later on 15 May 1985, a fortnight before Juventus won the European Cup in a final overshadowed by the Heysel tragedy. Likewise, Porto fell a week short in 2002-03 and 2003-04 after winning the Uefa Cup then the Champions League under Jose Mourinho, as did Liverpool between their Uefa Cup and European Cup wins in 1975-76 and 1976-77. FROM BOARDROOM TO PENALTY BOX &quot;I read your story on the most likeable players, and the section on Juninho brought back fond memories,&quot; writes Archie Whirlwind. &quot;I looked the fellow up on Wikipedia, and read there that he ended his career as player-president of his youth club Ituano. I have never heard of anyone being player-president, player-chairman or holding similar posts in a club while playing on a professional level. Is this case unique?&quot; They don&apos;t exactly fit the bill, but two that instantly spring to mind are the larger-than-life figures of John Ryan and Zhu Jen. The Doncaster chairman Ryan became the oldest player to appear for a professional British club when he made a substitute appearance for Rovers in 2003. At the age of 52 years and 11 months Ryan made a brief cameo at Edgar Street as Rovers came from behind to beat Hereford 4-2. &quot;I came on when the ref put his board up for an extra three minutes of injury time,&quot; said Ryan. &quot;I didn&apos;t actually get a kick of the ball but I had a good run around.&quot; Also having a good run around was Zhu, owner of Shanghai Shenhua, who was in the starting XI when his side faced Liverpool in a friendly in 2007. He was substituted after five minutes. And the 45-year-old repeated the trick in May this year, this time lasting 45 minutes alongside a presumably nonplussed Nicolas Anelka in the Shenhua attack against Argentina CN Sports. &quot;He&apos;s played in games before to let us see his love for football,&quot; said the Shenhua manager Sergio Batista before the game. &quot;No matter if he appears on or off the pitch, I look forward to him standing shoulder to shoulder with us in battle.&quot; Any more for any more?

This despite the concerns of English Heritage and UNESCO who have suggested that the plan could jeopardise Liverpool&apos;s World Heritage Site status.  Of course in this 30 - 50-year project, the builders will not be moving in tomorrow, but the announcement was still greeted largely positively in Liverpool. The support for what is unabashedly a capitalist scheme in the city&apos;s more deprived areas seems to have surprised some national commentators - to the point that some seem to be patronisingly suggesting that &apos;those poor provincial folk, they don&apos;t know what&apos;s being done to them.&apos;  On the contrary, people living next to the central docks know better than anyone what a general eyesore they have been for most of the last 40 years and the desperate need that Liverpool has to gain more jobs and a stronger economy, especially in the face of devastating public sector cuts.  To recap, Liverpool Waters is a massive redevelopment of Liverpool&apos;s dockland between the city centre and the still active modern port. It is huge in scale, up to 1,691,000 square meters, which it is planned will include offices, homes, cultural facilities, retail and leisure provision and a second, larger cruise ship terminal. It has been suggested it could create as many as 17,000 jobs, have up to 23,000 apartments and four hotels on what is presently, for the most part, flat Brownfield land. Its centrepiece would be the &apos;Shanghai Tower&apos;, at 55 stories the tallest building in the UK outside of London.      Liverpool Waters masterplan. The project includes 9,000 apartments, hundreds of offices, hotels, bars and a new cruise terminal. It's a heck of a lot of space to fill. Photograph: Rust Design    With a scale like that, there are legitimate concerns about who will fill that huge amount of space. Especially when there is a fair amount of unused Victorian office buildings in the city and when Liverpool has a relatively poor, if slowly improving, economy. The developer Peel&apos;s argument is that the sheer scale of the plans will attract foreign direct investment in a way that piecemeal development would not, and that many of the older buildings in the city are not suitable for modern office accommodation.  Similarly heated debates were made about the Liverpool ONE retail development, with many commentators suggesting that Liverpool&apos;s poor retail market could not stand any more units and that Liverpool ONE would destroy the city&apos;s existing retail areas. While there are indeed empty units in Liverpool, as there in most of the UK&apos;s cities and towns, the destruction of the older retail areas hasn&apos;t happened and the critical mass of the transformative development shoved the city back into the big league of UK retail centres, from 14th to 5th place in three years. New occupiers continue to move in, even in the current depths of retail recession.  What has also been consistently ignored by critics dazzled by the glass towers in Peel&apos;s admittedly brash artists&apos; impressions is the solid economic development work underway in relation to it. A huge new container shipping terminal is being built in Peel&apos;s modern Seaforth docks just north of the scheme. It will be the first one in the north of England capable of handling the new, larger container ships that will fit through the widened Panama Canal from 2015. With road transport costs increasing and the UK&apos;s markets shifting from Europe to the wider world, there&apos;s huge potential for the city to reclaim its place as the north&apos;s premier port and create a large number of jobs in the process. A new Maritime College is already under construction on part of the site to help train young people for this.  Meanwhile, over the river Mersey, Liverpool Waters&apos; sister project, the Wirral Waters redevelopment of the Birkenhead dockland is also significant. It&apos;s actually even larger in scale than the Liverpool plan, but with it not being in the World Heritage Site, has attracted a lot less media attention. About to begin construction there is the International Trade Centre, a new business start-up hub for foreign inward investors that is the first of its kind in the UK and one of the biggest in Europe. It alone has vast potential to attract new investors from growing countries such as China, India and Brazil which are looking for a route into Europe. Once they become more established, they&apos;re likely to require more space and suitable accommodation, leisure and retail space to support their facilities, and the Liverpool and Wirral Waters plans offer that. More recently, also at the Wirral Waters site, Peel has announced a manufacturing park, with plans to capitalise on the booming motor industry on Merseyside and possibly also expanding manufacturers in the energy and railway rolling stock sectors.  The heritage arguments against the plans are something that many people local people have struggled to understand when most of the development site is literally flat. The main argument from UNESCO seems to be that the new buildings would detract from the older ones up the river, much has also been suggested with London&apos;s Shard. This may be true, but I haven&apos;t seen the queues for the Tower of London getting any shorter recently. The other crux was the archeology of the site, where they have a stronger point. Yet without development, the archeology will remain there unexamined until someone comes along with the money to dig it up. To leave the site in its present state because of what is possibly buried underneath it would be folly.      Unesco has got a bit wobbly at this sort of image. But Peel has a decent heritage record. Photograph: Rust Design    No doubt the architecture critics will be sharpening their knives to criticise the scheme. Again, they may have a point. MediaCityUK and The Trafford Centre, Peel&apos;s successfull developments in Greater Manchester, are not beautiful. Yet they did restore redundant industrial land to productive use and have created thousands of jobs. And that will carry more weight in the deprived parts of Liverpool than hand-wringing about aesthetics by a few people who live far, far away.  However, Liverpool is a city that loves its heritage and most citizens will hope that Peel will keep its promise that what historic structures there are in the development site will be restored and re-used. The group has a decent track-record in this already, spending money in the last couple of years to restore the historic but unlisted Bascule Bridge and dock police hut on its estate, which had been left to rot for decades by its predecessor, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. It remains to be seen if they will restore more. I have no doubt though that both the council and Peel will fight to retain the World Heritage status alongside the development if they can, not least for the pragmatic reason that it adds significant marketing value to the area.  So, when is all this going to happen? That&apos;s the big question. Those suggesting that the whole thing is pie in the sky should consider why Peel would have spent several years and millions of pounds on planning and preparation in the middle of the recession if they didn&apos;t have serious intentions. It is true, however, that the time scale is a long term one.      A vulgar dome of commerce; but the Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester has been a runaway success. Photograph: Aidan O'Rourke    Almost certainly the first elements will be the &apos;business generator&apos; ones on the fringes of the developments. The post-panamax terminal and the International Trade Centre are under construction or about to commence. I would expect a start on the manufacturing park in Wirral as well soon, and with Liverpool&apos;s cruise business growing, the second cruise terminal could start in the next few years. With these in place, then we can expect the first leisure and retail development to support the area and the first offices going up in the central part of Wirral Waters and just north of Liverpool city centre. All this will probably take at least 10 years to complete. The &apos;second cluster&apos; of tall buildings further north, which was the real bone of contention with UNESCO, not the Shanghai Tower as some commentators have suggested, are unlikely to be built within the next 20 years.  An International Festival for Business is being held in Liverpool in 2014, a large part of it on these very development sites. This will no doubt see a big investment push by the city and we may see the breakthrough of the first few key deals in relation to these schemes. Certainly the citizens of Liverpool will be hoping so.  Now, the ball is in Peel&apos;s court to prove they can deliver. The city council, the Government and the majority of people in Liverpool have endorsed the plans. Peel Holdings, it&apos;s up to you to show the city that you can do more in Liverpool than create shiny pictures of a better future.

Today it is both. Tricky dilemma over, although not, it seems, for the rest of the nation&apos;s football hacks, who arrived at Carrington this morning to hear Ferguson&apos;s weekly lecture and were alarmed to see a hairdryer ominously perched on his desk and pointing their way following reports that Wayne Rooney is to be wedged through the exit door by Manchester United. Naturally much 2+2ing followed, leading to Ferguson revealing that he&apos;s put some of the Fiver&apos;s Big Paper colleagues on the naughty step until they apologise for the heinous crime of suggesting that Rooney may be sold. &quot;He [Rooney] will be here next year, you have my word on that,&quot; Ferguson roared. &quot;There is no issue between myself and Wayne Rooney. To suggest we don&apos;t talk is nonsense.&quot; Now, the Fiver&apos;s idea of a searching question is usually along the lines of &quot;Where is the gents, Mr Ferguson?&quot; and is eager not to get into any trouble for any spurious nonsense, so with that in mind it would like to take this opportunity to congratulate United on winning Big Cup for a fourth time, Ferguson for inventing The Harlem Shake and Rooney for his magnificent hair. There, that should secure a pass for life at Carrington and all the sausage rolls and pork pies a hungry hack could want! Ferguson&apos;s denial that Rooney is off to Barcelona/Real Madrid/Manchester City/Paris Saint-Beckham/Shanghai Shenhua has, of course, led to people who just want to Have Their Say having their say, thereby making the world a better place. Because there&apos;s quotes, you see, and any journalism expert with a degree in Posting Stuff on Twitter knows that a story can only be true if there&apos;s quotes. Because, quotes, end of. Yeah. Nuance be damned. The only problem with adopting that line, of course, is that it&apos;s usually best to look under the sauce to see if it&apos;s really pasta or a steaming pile of horse manure instead. After all, get a load of this from April 2003, as Ferguson and United denied rumours that David Beckham was going to join Real Madrid in the summer. &quot;It is totally inaccurate to suggest a deal has been done with Real Madrid for David Beckham,&quot; said Ferguson, while United added in an official statement: &quot;We can categorically deny that any deal is in place to sell David Beckham to Real Madrid. David will be a Manchester United player next season.&quot; But David was not a Manchester United player next season! Ooohh, they got us good, just like they did in 2008 when Ferguson said that he wouldn&apos;t sell Real a virus, let alone Cristiano Ronaldo. The Fiver forgets who Ronaldo plays for now. All of which means that by the end of Ferguson&apos;s press conference this morning, the Fiver was beginning to question the very existence of this &quot;Wayne Rooney&quot; character and even &quot;Manchester United&quot;. What&apos;s certain is that Rooney&apos;s future remains up for debate, even if he should return for Sunday&apos;s FA Cup quarter-final against Chelsea, a match which brings us to the best Ferguson soundbite of all: his incredible refusal to give Rafael Benitez a good kicking. &quot;I&apos;m not going to kick anyone when they&apos;re lying down. That&apos;s not my style,&quot; he smirked, giving his rival a good shoeing while somehow managing to keep a straight face. Farewell, Wayne.

Four Malaysians are trying to make it in Shanghai, the new capital of the eastern world \u2013 but when we meet them, each of their lives is in freefall. There&apos;s Phoebe, the ambitious young Malaysian village girl who passes herself off as Chinese and has arrived in Shanghai on the broken promise of a\u00a0job and a new life. There&apos;s Gary, a &quot;Taiwanese&quot; pop star who finds his fall from grace in a Shanghai bar endlessly replayed on YouTube and is reduced to\u00a0singing in shopping malls. There&apos;s Yinghui, a steely and successful businesswoman whose friends tell her\u00a0that to really succeed in Shanghai, she needs a man. And, finally, there&apos;s Justin, the lonely businessman adopted into a wealthy Malaysian family, who has lost his way while his\u00a0family have lost their fortune. He and Yinghui knew each other in an earlier life and their reconnection is one of the\u00a0fine threads that link the characters in this book. Though how many of those threads are held by the fifth character, Walter Chao \u2013 the mysterious &quot;I&quot; and author of the bestselling self-help manual Five Star Billionaire \u2013 remains to be seen. Shanghai values are the values of a new age. Nobody wants to change the world \u2013 they only want to get out of it what they can, whatever it takes. With her &quot;good fake&quot; designer bags, stolen ID and forged early life in Guangdong, Phoebe&apos;s transformation is the most extreme. Before Gary became a Taiwanese pop star, he was just a poor kid from rural Malaysia with a bullying stepfather. Yinghui&apos;s drive masks a shameful family secret and a broken heart that has never quite healed. In Shanghai you can be whoever you want to be. Some connections are rooted in a shared history: Justin knows Yinghui&apos;s story and her shaming past. But mostly the characters nudge and slide past each other, without knowing it. Phoebe keeps a picture of Gary on her wall and chats to him in a cyber room, unaware of his real identity. Phoebe gets a job managing Yinghui&apos;s spa. Justin encounters Phoebe&apos;s flatmate on one of his aimless evening strolls and finds in her someone else who is giving up on the dream of Shanghai. Soon Walter Chao is dating Phoebe and proposing a new business idea to Yinghui, a venture remarkably similar to the one that failed when she was a young woman in love. They celebrate in the same bar where Gary&apos;s drunken brawl was recorded on a dozen mobile phones. How many of these encounters are coincidental isn&apos;t\u00a0always clear, but gradually the possibility of something new is offered to each person. To Gary, a new career. To Phoebe, a wealthy husband. To Justin, freedom from his\u00a0domineering family. To Yinghui, a\u00a0chance to make good on her youthful\u00a0ideals. Aw is a master storyteller and Five\u00a0Star Billionaire can be read as The\u00a0Way We Live Now for our times, for\u00a0with the global triumph of capitalism, New York and London pale\u00a0in comparison with the financial behemoth of Shanghai. Like Trollope&apos;s Augustus Melmotte, the\u00a0mysterious Walter Chao has moved his base of operations to the new city: Phoebe, Yinghui, Gary and Justin stand in for the speculators and wealthy families ensnared by his plotting. At 400-plus pages, Five Star Billionaire is\u00a0only half the length of\u00a0Trollope&apos;s masterpiece. Still, it&apos;s a long book; and if there&apos;s a criticism to\u00a0be made it is that the pace is too unvarying. Even where the narrative takes a dramatic turn, it is\u00a0delivered in Aw&apos;s spare, fresh, cool, almost dispassionate prose, which though it succeeds in many ways somehow never quite leaves the page. Instead the characters drift towards their various destinies, caught in the whirlpool of Shanghai. There&apos;s more than a hint of fatalism in the air. Even when Yinghui is warned about her new business partner, she fails to conduct the most basic credit check on Walter Chao; she is too desperate, her dream too fragile. Behind it all, perhaps rather predictably, is a tale of ruin and revenge. But it matters little, because by the time you work out that what you thought was going to happen is indeed going to happen, you realise that Five Star\u00a0Billionaire is a gentler story than at\u00a0first appeared: one of lives lost and found, of the transience of material success and the courage required to hope and to trust again, to forgive oneself and to believe in the possibility of love. \u2022 Aminatta Forna&apos;s The Hired Man (Bloomsbury) is published this month.", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-08T19:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/09/live-music-booking-now", "sentences": ["In more exciting news, it&apos;s moving to a new site at Duncombe Park (23-25 Aug, Duncombe Park, Helmsley, nr York) \u2026 Speaking of disappointment and heartbreak, Lucinda Williams is touring her brand of sultry country at a series of intimate shows (13 May-29 Jun, tour starts Limelight, Belfast) \u2026 Poli\u00e7ia, Kindness and Mount Kimbie are the first acts to be announced at the xx&apos;s &apos;London&apos; leg of their Night + Day event (23 Jun, Osterley Park, Isleworth) ...

NOSE JOBS Formula One, vain? Surely not, yet having an aesthetically pleasing appearance is clearly a priority this season after all those\u00a0cruel snipes at the raised noses of 2012&apos;s four-wheeled missiles. To cover up that oh-so horrible stepped nose cone, Formula One&apos;s engineers have now come up with something called a &quot;vanity panel&quot; to conceal the offending area. This creates a nice smooth look but does little to improve the air flow. Next up, Botox bumpers anyone? 2. DOUBLE DRS RIP DRS alone was not enough for Mercedes or Red Bull last season and they came up with Double DRS. Too clever by far, clearly \u2013 it&apos;s been banned for 2013. However, passive drag-reduction systems (they get going once a certain speed is achieved, not by the flick of a switch) are allowed. Plus, it is being limited to designated DRS zones in all sessions, ruling out its use at any point during practice and qualifying. 3. GETTING HEAVIER Pirelli has changed the structure of this season&apos;s tyres, making them 2kg heavier. This means each car&apos;s minimum weight limit has been increased to 640kg. Which in turn means a slide-rule job is required to get the weight distribution right. The\u00a0minimum figures are now 292kg:343kg front to rear. With tyre compounds softer, Pirelli reckons they will warm up quicker and improve grip by 3%, allowing drivers to turn into corners a fraction later and so go faster. 4. Q1 CHANGE The HRT team are no more, so qualifying has been tweaked to accommodate fewer cars on the grid. Last season, seven cars were cut to run in Q2; this season six are dispatched in Q1, which means two midfield drivers will go out instead of one. That leaves 16 drivers to jostle for position in Q2, with 10 going through for the 10-minute Q3 harum-scarum. 5.

Pollution has emerged as a source of widespread anger in China. Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters    China&apos;s toxic smog, rubbish-strewn rivers and contaminated soil have emerged as a source of widespread anger over the past few weeks, as profit-minded officials jostle with aggrieved internet users over how to balance the country&apos;s economic development with its environmental concerns. Experts say the groundwater in half of all Chinese cities is contaminated, most of it severely, and that soil pollution could be widespread in 15 of the country&apos;s 33 provinces. Villagers found the first pig carcasses near a water treatment plant on a creek upstream from Shanghai on Tuesday, but clean-up efforts did not begin until the weekend, according to the news portal Xinmin Online. Shanghai initially dispatched six barges to remove the corpses, and added another six when the problem&apos;s scope became clear.

Xu Rong, director of Shanghai&apos;s Songjiang district environmental department, told China&apos;s state broadcaster CCTV that she saw dead pigs floating along an 11km stretch of the river&apos;s Pingshen waterway, which extends to a cement plant in nearby Zhejiang province.

The Jiaxing Daily newspaper in northern Zhejiang province quoted a villager as saying that over the past two months almost 20,000 pigs in his village have died of unknown causes. While Shanghai compensates its farmers for properly disposing of dead swine, the newspaper said, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces lack a comparable incentive system, so farmers there often dump their pig carcasses directly into local rivers. &quot;The local authorities are conducting co-ordinated efforts to stop the dumping of dead pigs from the source,&quot; said China&apos;s official newswire Xinhua.", "tags": ["China", "Pollution", "Animals", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-11T11:57:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/11/force-india-f1-2013-team-guide", "sentences": ["Don&apos;t mention And so we come to the second driver, the team&apos;s 2008-11 pilot Adrian Sutil, who took a sabbatical last year after being convicted of causing grievous bodily harm to Lotus co-owner Eric Lux in a Shanghai nightclub."], "title": "Force India: F1 2013 team guide", "article": "TEAM DETAILS Debut 2008, Australia Grands prix 93 Wins 0 Poles 1 Constructors&apos; titles 0 Drivers&apos; titles 0 Based Silverstone Team principal Vijay Mallya Technical director Andrew Green THE DRIVERS Paul di Resta 26, Great Britain Former touring car champion who had the upper hand on Sutil when team-mates in 2011 Adrian Sutil 30, Germany Ninety F1 starts have yielded as many points and two front-row starts but no win.

Bucking the trend for evolutionary designs before next year&apos;s rule changes, Force India launched with what technical director Andrew Green says is a complete redesign. And it looks as though it has been time well spent, as Jules Bianchi set some impressive times in testing. Not that he can look forward to starting the season in a half-decent machine.

The world of Formula One \u2013 with the possible exception of the 10 other teams and 21 remaining drivers \u2013 will join together in an outpouring of support for the British driver who is the sport&apos;s most luminous presence. When the lights go out at Albert Park the focus of attention will not be on Fernando Alonso, the most complete driver in the sport, nor on Sebastian Vettel, whose astonishing efflorescence has brought him a hat-trick of world championships. It will be on Hamilton. We will not be looking at the biggest team in F1, which is Ferrari, or Red Bull, who have dominated recent years and look in the mood to carve out an epoch, or McLaren, with their proud record stretching back over decades of trophy gathering; we will be looking at Mercedes, who have won a solitary race since rejoining the noisy fray three years ago. Hamilton sells Formula One as no other driver. Like a number of other gifted sportsmen, including Ian Botham, Daley Thompson, George Best (the biggest sports star, as well as the greatest footballer these islands have produced) he has a box office appeal that goes beyond the sum of his considerable gifts, as well as an occasional maladroitness which can lead to less wanted headlines. This is the driver who is smiled upon by the ghosts of Gilles Villeneuve and Ayrton Senna. Other drivers are fast but Hamilton soars and, when he does, our hearts soar with him, which is the very essence of sport. That is why the whole big village of F1 has an investment in his success at Mercedes. His decision to quit McLaren for the German team still looks a questionable call. There was undoubtedly a temptation to break free from his old nurturer-mentor, as well as its very demanding corporate ethos, especially after the tenebrous season of 2011. But there was a counter-pull to stay exactly where he was, to remain within the familiar, familial embrace that had brought him fame and fortune, as well as the 2008 world championship. The vast majority of impartial observers felt he would be daft to leave McLaren but the attraction of even more money and greater control over image rights, together with the fact that most people who talked to him were probably in favour of a switch, eventually swung the fine balance. So, it could be argued, Hamilton made the move for the wrong reasons. And yet, with only a few days to go before the opening race, everything looks better for both parties. After three testing sessions it is clear that Mercedes have a well balanced car that is a substantial improvement on their 2012 model. Hamilton might win races with this. He might even dream of a second title. What would Jenson Button think about that, the Jenson Button who could scarcely believe his great fortune when Hamilton handed the McLaren team over to him? So what about Mercedes? In many ways Hamilton was not the ideal fit for them. OK, he is phenomenally quick but, unlike Senna or a younger Michael Schumacher, he is hardly the man to shape a team with his technical prowess and strength of will. But such thoughts were confounded in Spain recently. Those who travelled to Jerez and Barcelona for testing, who spent time with Mercedes, witnessed a lifting of the spirits within the team. Hamilton might just be very fast and not much else but in Formula One very fast can galvanise an entire set-up and inspire designers, engineers and mechanics to turn a good car into a winning one. Nor does the sight of a British driver in a Mercedes strike a dissonant note. In 1937 Richard Seaman, then the bright young thing of British motorsport, was signed by the Silver Arrows and in the 1950s the team brought in Stirling Moss to race alongside Juan Manuel Fangio. Even without Hamilton there were signs of improvement at Mercedes. Ross Brawn, remember, was at Ferrari for some time before his formidable organisational and strategic skills began to bear heavy fruit. Reports of Brawn&apos;s demise, once Paddy Lowe arrives from McLaren at the end of the year, have been exaggerated, by the way. Brawn and Lowe may co-exist at Brackley for some time before there is a transfer of power. Early-season optimism at Mercedes is hardly new. In Shanghai last season Nico Rosberg scored his maiden victory \u2013 Mercedes&apos; first as a constructor since Monza in 1955. But the car did not progress, its development potential restricted by an unconventional double DRS system, and the team managed only fifth place in the championship. It is possible that the car will fail again. Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari all look competitive, while the over-achieving Lotus team are confident they can make a push for the top three. If there is disappointment, how will Hamilton respond? He can hunker down and wait for 2014, of course, when radical engine changes are expected to hand an advantage to works teams such as Mercedes. But what if the car fails in 2014 too? Once things start going badly for him, as they did in 2011, he can drift into a negative mind-set, though it must be added that that was not the case last year, when he drove brilliantly and was not fairly rewarded. As for Mercedes, still the most evocative name in the sport after Ferrari, they have hinted in the recent past that they might walk away from F1 if they are not successful. If Hamilton does not turn it round for them in the next season or two, those whispers are likely to be heard again. That is why Sunday, and the season, means so much to Hamilton and Mercedes \u2013 and to the whole travelling furore that is Formula One. \u2022", "tags": ["Formula One 2013", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-11T14:05:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/mar/11/hollywood-kowtows-to-china", "sentences": ["The setting of large sections of Looper was transferred from Paris to Shanghai."], "title": "Why Hollywood kowtows to China", "article": "Last week North Korea threatened America with a nuclear strike. This week sees the UK release of Red Dawn, which features a North Korean invasion of the US. An impressive instance of Hollywood&apos;s far-sightedness? Not quite. Red Dawn is the reboot of a cold war thriller that&apos;s much cherished in some quarters. Back in 1984, when the original appeared, the aggressor could only have been the Soviet Union. With the new film comes a new commie bogeyman \u2013 but it was not supposed to be North Korea. These days, it&apos;s not so much Kim Jong-un&apos;s eccentric dictatorship that makes Americans tremble, it&apos;s their newfound rival for superpower status, China. So, MGM&apos;s re-imaginers decided to reallocate Russia&apos;s role to the Chinese People&apos;s Republic. Fancifully enough, they envisaged Beijing &quot;repossessing&quot; an America that had defaulted on its huge Sino debt. However, this storyline didn&apos;t go down well in China. When excerpts of the script leaked out in 2010, they prompted the headline &quot;US reshoots cold war movie to demonise China&quot; in the Beijing-based, 1.5m-circulation Global Times. Buyers told MGM that distributing Red Dawn in China would prove problematic. So the studio decided on a change of tack. Unfortunately, the film had already been shot. No matter. During post-production, $1m was spent on digitally erasing Chinese flags and symbols and changing sequences and dialogue to turn the invaders into North Koreans. Of course, Hollywood would never have dreamed of bowing like this to Soviet displeasure, but China is different. The world&apos;s most populous nation has become the second-largest overseas market for American films. Its increasingly avid cinemagoers can easily add $50m to a Hollywood movie&apos;s gross. The number of screens in the country, already more than 11,000, is expected to double by 2015. In a recent report, Ernst &amp; Young predicted that China&apos;s box office would overtake America&apos;s by 2020. Sadly for movie-makers, this burgeoning treasure trove is guarded by a censorious state. China&apos;s government imposes a quota on film imports and keeps a careful eye on the content of those it allows through. Back in the 90s, Disney, Sony and MGM all had their Chinese business blocked after releasing the movies Kundun, Seven Years in Tibet and Red Corner, all of which were deemed critical of the regime. Nowadays, any such potential transgressions are usually nipped in the bud. When censors objected to a bald Chinese pirate in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&apos;s End, he was edited out of the film&apos;s Chinese version. Footage was similarly removed from Men in Black 3 because unpleasant aliens had dared disguise themselves as Chinese restaurant workers. In the Chinese version of Skyfall, references to prostitution and corruption in China were removed or obscured in opaque subtitles. All mention of the torture inflicted on Javier Bardem&apos;s villain when he was an MI6 agent in Hong Kong was carefully expunged.     Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith in The Karate Kid    Accommodations like these are not enough for some film-makers, who opt instead for proactive ingratiation. The setting of large sections of Looper was transferred from Paris to Shanghai. In Battleship, it&apos;s Hong Kong that is credited by Washington with divining the alien origins of the earth&apos;s attackers. The 2010 remake of The Karate Kid saw the young hero&apos;s family turned into importunate migrants leaving decaying Detroit to seek a better future in thriving Beijing. In spite of the film&apos;s title, the all-conquering martial art becomes kung fu instead of karate, and the fount of all skill, wisdom and fortitude is an altogether Chinese kung fu master. It seems to pay off. Looper, like The Karate Kid a co-production with a Chinese partner, was gifted a much sought-after Golden Week holiday release; all-American blockbusters such as The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises are often forced to play against each other to stop them squeezing out indigenous productions. Audiences, as well as the authorities, seem to appreciate a Hollywood kowtow. In disaster epic 2012, a White House staffer lavishes praise on Chinese scientists when an ark they&apos;ve designed saves civilisation. At this point in the proceedings, filmgoers sometimes rose to deliver a spontaneous standing ovation. Among Hollywood&apos;s old guard, all this has provoked a certain amount of disquiet. A producer, anonymous for fear of offending his industry&apos;s new masters, was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as complaining: &quot;It&apos;s a clear-cut case \u2013 maybe the first I can think of in the history of Hollywood \u2013 where a foreign country&apos;s censorship board deeply affects what we produce.&quot; There have been complaints that both America and the rest of the world are being given an unduly rosy portrait of a repressive behemoth. China&apos;s social injustices, human rights abuses and imperial aspirations are, it&apos;s suggested, being discreetly veiled from view. Still, what&apos;s happened with Red Dawn isn&apos;t exactly unprecedented. During the first world war, Cecil B DeMille made a film called The Cheat with a Japanese villain. In 1923 the film was reissued, but by then Japan had become an American ally. Without benefit of digital technology, the wily oriental was quickly turned into a Burmese ivory king. If Hollywood now finds itself cheerleading for an assertive superpower, that isn&apos;t new either. For almost a century, Tinseltown buttressed America&apos;s own hegemony by puffing up the American way to sell more movie tickets on the home front.

China&apos;s defence ministry had already denied the claims of military involvement in hacking, adding that almost two-thirds of the cyber-attacks on its own military websites originated from the US.

The most recent offender is Ben Affleck&apos;s Argo, based on the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1981 and winner of this year&apos;s best picture Oscar. Others named include 300, The Wrestler and Not Without My Daughter. The representation of Iran in Argo is certainly questionable but, as when the Kazakhstan foreign ministry threatened to sue over Borat, the prospect of a lawsuit doesn&apos;t seem entirely realistic. Do nations or governments have a right to accurate representation in fiction? In what jurisdiction could such a case be brought? Wouldn&apos;t there be some sort of statute of limitation on suing over, for example, Not Without My Daughter, which was made 22 years ago? Bearing in mind that &quot;Hollywood&quot; is not a single or coherent entity, who would actually be sued? And, if this story is true, will the organisers of the Hoax of Hollywood conference turn out to be the adorable Thermian aliens out of Galaxy Quest, who come from a planet without fiction, mistake old broadcasts of a Star Trek-like television show for &quot;historical documents&quot;, and end up kidnapping the show&apos;s ageing cast to defend them in a real intergalactic war? Picture poor Ben Affleck as the film&apos;s clapped-out Captain Kirk character, having to explain the concept of movies to the uncomprehending faces at the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance: &quot;On our planet, we, er \u2026 we pretend. To \u2026 to entertain. I am so sorry. God, I am so sorry.&quot; Furthermore, should the Canadian government get in on this? According to former US president Jimmy Carter, &quot;90% of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of the plan [in Argo] was Canadian&quot;, not the work of the CIA as it is shown almost exclusively to be. Indeed, one of the fishiest things about this entire story is that the Hoax of Hollywood conference lasted just one day. Hollywood has made up far too much stuff to cover in a mere day. In the wacky parallel universe where this suit succeeds and sets a precedent, lots of countries could have a case for &quot;unrealistic portrayal&quot;: Mongolia National pride offended by perhaps the worst casting decision of all time, when John Wayne played Genghis Khan in The Conqueror. North Korea ... is not all that ronery, Team America. New Zealand ... has really had enough of people turning up and demanding to see hobbits. Italy, India, Indonesia Teaming up to take down Eat Pray Love. Pakistan Upset at the possible damage to its badass reputation, sues for appearing too stable in Charlie Wilson&apos;s War. Ireland Just wants Hollywood stars to stop trying to do its accent, whether it&apos;s Orson Welles in The Lady from Shanghai or Tom Cruise in Far and Away. United States of America Though Hollywood is sometimes presumed by Iranian officials to be an instrument of the US government, there&apos;s no reason, in this wacky parallel universe, why it shouldn&apos;t sue itself. Oliver Stone&apos;s JFK, for instance, flat-out invented a case to support the view that John F Kennedy was murdered by the CIA in cahoots with Cuban exile organisations. United Kingdom Hollywood misattributed great military feats by Britain and its allies, such as the capture of the Enigma machine in U-571 and the liberation of Burma in Objective, Burma!, to American forces. In Anonymous, it said that England&apos;s greatest playwright was an illiterate fraud and England&apos;s greatest queen was a ditzy nymphomaniac. In Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, it got everything wrong about England&apos;s greatest folk hero. And \u2013 from a Scottish point of view as much as an English one \u2013\u00a0don&apos;t even get me started on Braveheart. If the Iranian ministry of culture and Islamic guidance genuinely has an interest in putting forward a positive image of Iran in cinema, it could allow Iranian filmmakers freedom to make great films about their own country or cease its harassment of industry bodies.

Aw, who has a kinship with Tan Twan Eng, author of the Booker-shortlisted The Garden of Evening Mists, casts one\u00a0eye on the past in a place whose full-throttle growth leaves scant time for the backward glance. &quot;I&apos;m not naturally nostalgic for a cosy, bygone era,&quot; he says, &quot;but a lot of my work is concerned with what we give up in the march forwards.&quot; He lives alone in a basement flat near Old Street in east London, with a tiny garden in which he grows bamboo and banana palms. Bashful about being there for 12 years, he murmurs: &quot;There&apos;s a lack of momentum.&quot; He visits Asia &quot;several times a year&quot;, and\u00a0can reel off the merits of its cities and street food from Bali to Penang. Compared with Bangkok, Manila and Jakarta, he says, &quot;Shanghai is the only big city where you can go for a stroll. It&apos;s slower and very seductive, with real soul and romance.&quot; A Malaysian national, and now teaching in Singapore for part of the year, he launched his new novel in the city-state last month, and in Malaysia, both of which he sees as &quot;home territory&quot;. Twenty years ago, he says, &quot;people of my generation would gravitate towards the great cities of the west,&quot; but he began travelling to China a decade ago because he &quot;was struck that more and more people seeking a better life abroad seemed to be heading to China&quot;. The new novel was sparked by some &quot;weird coincidences&quot;, he says. &quot;I kept bumping into people who knew people who knew me from childhood. I&apos;d hear Malaysian accents across a restaurant, then actively search them out.&quot; Glancing connections emerge between five main characters, including a &quot;philanthropist&quot; who writes self-help books, and a spa receptionist who devours them. There is a pop idol who disgraced himself in a brawl, a political radical turned businesswoman and a\u00a0real estate dealer who burns out, his own desires subordinate to crushing family duty. As Aw sees it, &quot;his secure place comes at a price. One sees that a\u00a0lot in Asia.&quot; The chapter headings, such as &quot;Move to Where the Money Is&quot;, borrow from Chengyu \u2013 Chinese idioms of parental advice \u2013 that have been hijacked within contemporary culture to serve a ruthless self-advancement. He read over people&apos;s shoulders on the Shanghai Metro. &quot;Eight out of 10 bestsellers in Asian bookshops are self-help books. They&apos;ve adopted the worst American excesses and run with them.&quot; That may be most evident in advice to women on &quot;How to snare a rich husband&quot;. He laments the &quot;culture of\u00a0&apos;remaindered women&apos;, who are still single after the age of 26 \u2013 which is every woman I know in Shanghai. They have the outward trappings of modern, feminist success, but their lives are geared to despairingly searching for a husband. It&apos;s atavistic.&quot; In a novel of missed connections, characters can prove as fake as the handbags in Shanghai&apos;s markets. &quot;People are incredibly lonely in this huge city, twice the size of London,&quot; Aw says. &quot;They&apos;re swept up by the tide of energy and forget what they&apos;re looking for. The don&apos;t just want money or a business deal, but something deeper.&quot; Two writer&apos;s residencies in Shanghai between 2009 and 2011 helped him shed some prejudices, on internet censorship, for example: &quot;People think\u00a0the Chinese must live in total ignorance, but Chinese my age are so skilled, they have access to everything they want. There are blogs and Twitter \u2013 but in Chinese, so most people don&apos;t read them. I saw more freedom of speech in Shanghai than I see in Singapore or Thailand.&quot; China &quot;exists on so many levels. The official level is\u00a0incredibly chauvinist, and the patriarchal system drives me nuts \u2013\u00a0it\u00a0reminds me of my upbringing. But\u00a0when you get past that it&apos;s like any\u00a0other Asian city: there&apos;s a colour, vitality, local and regional identities.&quot; When in Shanghai, he lived in a block where the average age was over 70, and people had endured China&apos;s cultural revolution of 1966-76. &quot;But even though they&apos;ve been through such a lot, I was the recipient of so many acts\u00a0of kindness every day.&quot; His understanding has another source. &quot;I\u00a0have first cousins from a branch that didn&apos;t make it out of rural Malaysia, from a horrible little village. My parents were lucky \u2013 they went to college and moved to Kuala Lumpur, so\u00a0I had a suburban childhood. To them, China represents opportunity. When I see it through their eyes, it&apos;s a\u00a0marvellous thing.&quot; He was born in 1971 in Taipei, to Malaysian parents working in the Taiwanese capital. His father was an electrical engineer, and his mother a quantity surveyor. By the time he came back to Malaysia he already felt like an\u00a0outsider. He grew up in ethnic Chinese neighbourhoods. His\u00a0parents were from &quot;very poor backgrounds&quot;, their families part of the large-scale migration from China to Malaya from the 19th century to the 1930s. Aw, who grew up speaking Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese and English, regrets that he\u00a0never learned his father&apos;s Hainanese dialect, a &quot;magical, warm, rich and unsual language. It wasn&apos;t considered an educated dialect so he didn&apos;t speak to us in it.&quot; Nor did he know his mother&apos;s Hokkien dialect, so he found it\u00a0hard to communicate with his cousins, which reinforced his sense of\u00a0being an outsider. All his grandparents lived &quot;deep in\u00a0the heart of the Malaysian jungle&quot;, in the Kinta valley, the setting for his first novel. He recalls &quot;terrifying and exciting&quot; school holidays in his grandmother&apos;s house on the banks of a &quot;big muddy river&quot;, where his uncle still lives. &quot;Big extended Chinese families can be warm and enveloping, not just ghastly structures. But the house was rudimentary, with monitor lizards eating shit off the outside toilets, and rats in the rooms.&quot; During the second world war, the area had been a support base for Chinese communist guerrilla resistance to the Japanese occupation of 1942-45. &quot;So entire villages were singled out for brutal treatment by the Japanese army. I&apos;m not sure if my maternal grandfather was tortured, but I know that behind the silence there were untold stories.&quot; While, to his own generation, &quot;Japan meant cool, electronic gadgets,&quot; his\u00a0parents grew up with\u00a0&quot;anti-Japanese sentiment in their blood&quot;. That animosity might have been behind their perverse choice of a\u00a0Ford Cortina when Malaysia&apos;s prime minister Mahathir Mohamad launched his &quot;Buy British Last&quot; campaign in 1981,\u00a0and urged the country to look east\u00a0towards Japan. &quot;The wave of nationalism was strange,&quot; Aw recalls. &quot;The street names were changed to Malaysian ones, but the middle classes were still speaking to each other in English.&quot; In the late 1970s and 80s, &quot;we were distracted because we were all getting richer. I was only a teenager, but I knew something was not right; that we should be thinking more about where we came from and who we were. Who\u00a0are the indigenous people, the bumiputra or &apos;sons of the earth&apos;? There\u00a0have been immigrant Chinese families in Malaysia for 200 years. Where do they fit, if not as part of the fabric of the country?&quot; One cost of what Aw terms &quot;this crazy march forward&quot; was the &quot;gleeful destruction of old buildings in the name of anti-colonialism. It&apos;s only now, when we&apos;re settled and affluent, that we think: &apos;Oh my God, what did we do?&apos; Old mansions have been replaced by giant, soulless shopping malls.&quot; In his ambitions as a writer, Aw had\u00a0&quot;zero role models. My parents encouraged reading, but to pass exams.&quot; He came to Cambridge to study law in 1991. Writing his first novel, he worked as an auction-house porter and a Chinese-language tutor, before the need for money drove him into a law firm for four years. He quit in 2002 to enrol at the University of East Anglia&apos;s creative writing school (&quot;very cutthroat&quot;) and sold his debut novel by the end of the academic year. Though keen on Conrad, he found much writing about his native region, from Anthony Burgess to JG Farrell, &quot;unsatisfactory \u2013 it didn&apos;t speak to me&quot;. Somerset Maugham was &quot;invariably writing about white people \u2013 except for\u00a0coolies or servants, who were slightly shifty&quot;. Though he admires the\u00a0Malaysian writer KS Maniam, he felt, along with Tan, that &quot;we had to reinvent the south-east Asian novel&quot;. His narratives circle events, viewing the\u00a0same scenes through different eyes \u2013 reflecting his quarrel with &quot;how history is rewritten in a country like Malaysia. A lot of modern Asian narratives seek refuge in homogeneity. But we know it\u00a0doesn&apos;t exist.&quot; He grew up with TV dramas and music from the giant neighbour, Indonesia. Map of the Invisible World is\u00a0a tale of two separated orphans during President Sukarno&apos;s &quot;year of living dangerously&quot;, a time of anti-communist purges. The two countries, Aw says, are spoken of as brothers, united by a common language and religion. &quot;We were supposed to bond against the Zionist-supporting Singapore, with its pork-eating Chinese population. But people forget Malaysia was Sukarno&apos;s arch enemy&quot;, during Konfrontasi \u2013 Indonesia&apos;s undeclared war against Malaysia. Aw&apos;s impulse was the &quot;sense of losing our past. My parents&apos; generation lived through it, but mine had no idea.&quot; Countries are &quot;absurdly retreating into the security of borders&quot;, he says, &quot;but coming from a small country, you can&apos;t help but see Malaysia&apos;s place in a wider world&quot;. That vision may chime with a growing readership in Asia&apos;s burgeoning leisured classes, with the new-found time to look back. For Aw, dislocation from the past &quot;invariably means you&apos;re not going to know where your future lies&quot;.", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-15T08:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/15/british-unknowns-celebrities-abroad", "sentences": ["After school, I started a course in classical music and Mandarin at Sheffield university, and the second year, in 2009, took me to Nanjing university, near Shanghai."], "title": "Big in Belgium: the British celebrities you've never heard of", "article": "Taylor Jones, 19, is a rapper who lives in London and\u00a0has recently found fame in Belgium It was late last summer, just after I stepped off the\u00a0stage at Bobbejaanland, that it really hit me. I&apos;d been performing in the theme park, I went\u00a0for a walk around after the show\u2026 and I was being mobbed by fans \u2013 so much so that the organisers gave me security. It seemed surreal, especially because a few days earlier I&apos;d been in\u00a0London, where nobody gives you a second\u00a0glance. But this isn&apos;t something that I fell into \u2013 I&apos;ve\u00a0always dreamed of it. I sat in my bedroom in\u00a0Swindon, where I grew up, singing, practising, working hard to make it happen. The rapping part\u00a0was an accident. I had a bad\u00a0cold one day and\u00a0couldn&apos;t hit the notes, so\u00a0I\u00a0talked instead. I\u00a0knew it sounded good. I\u00a0could hear it. So I tried to break into the UK music scene, but\u00a0there is a lot of competition. I was just 16, and\u00a0every disappointment knocked my confidence \u2013 three years is a long time when you&apos;re not making money. I made some headway, met a producer and signed up with a booking agent. I even had a single, Fallen Out, which made\u00a0it to number two in the Official UK Urban Charts about two years ago, but after a year the hype died down. I wasn&apos;t going to give up that easily, so I made a\u00a0plan. I thought, where can I go where there&apos;s nobody quite like me, a young British white rapper? It wasn&apos;t random \u2013 I did my research. And\u00a0it worked. I signed a management deal in Belgium, and got some sponsorship and label support. It&apos;s all been pretty recent. The weird thing is, I&apos;ve only been out to Belgium three times. The first was to meet the team, and\u00a0by the second trip I&apos;d already been on\u00a0TV and\u00a0premiered on radio, so I was starting to\u00a0be pretty well known. I played to a crowd of 42,000 over two days in the biggest arena in Belgium. The third time I went was for the Ostend Big Live\u00a0festival last year, which was amazing \u2013 girls\u00a0were holding up signs saying, &quot;I\u00a0love Taylor.&quot; I&apos;d be lying if I said I didn&apos;t like the attention. I\u00a0do. It&apos;s cool. At the moment, I&apos;m actually considering moving over to Belgium, just to try it\u00a0for six months. I did a signing session after the festival, and the fans were going absolutely crazy, climbing over fences to get to me, throwing things, screaming my name. I couldn&apos;t help thinking that\u00a0people back in my home town wouldn&apos;t even\u00a0believe me if I told them. I probably wouldn&apos;t mention it, though. I&apos;d rather just be me, Taylor. That&apos;s the benefit of being famous somewhere else. You get to come back down to\u00a0earth. Twenty-two-year-old Mary-Jess Leaverland, from Gloucestershire, won\u00a0a\u00a0Chinese TV talent show       Mary-Jess Leaverland: 'People recognise me in Jiangsu province, where the show was aired.' Photograph: David Yeo for the Guardian    For a 12-year-old, I was pretty focused. I knew I\u00a0wanted to be a professional classical singer \u2013 that\u00a0had been a given for as long as I could remember. But I also knew that I needed a back-up, so I chose Mandarin as one of my GCSEs. It seemed like a good contingency plan. I didn&apos;t realise that decision would put me in front of 70m television viewers a few years later. After school, I started a course in classical music and Mandarin at Sheffield university, and the second year, in 2009, took me to Nanjing university, near Shanghai. One day I was keeping a fellow student company \u2013 he was at some TV studios filming a game show \u2013 and I got bored waiting for him. I wandered about, stumbling on a studio where what looked like a talent show was going on. I asked the producer if\u00a0I\u00a0could be in it \u2013 life throws opportunities at you, and sometimes you just have to take them. The show, Min Xing Chang Fan Tian (I\u00a0Want To\u00a0Sing To The Stars), is a Chinese version of The X Factor. They called me back a couple of weeks later. I sang Time To Say Goodbye, and sailed through the heats, ending up in the finals. You have to sing every day for two and a\u00a0half weeks, so you&apos;re live on TV every night. The stylist always wanted to curl my hair and make me look whiter, because they were fascinated by my pale skin. And then I won. I\u00a0thought they&apos;d want a Chinese winner, but\u00a0they voted for me. It was unreal. I came back to the UK at the end of that year, but I can never stay away from China for long \u2013 I love it there. People recognise me in Jiangsu province, where the show was aired. You&apos;re always going to get looks in China, because being western is a novelty, especially in rural areas, but for me it was more than that. I got followed in a supermarket once. I just put down my basket and ran, though \u2013 I didn&apos;t hang around. I would live in China again, but my boyfriend is\u00a0a vegetarian and has a difficult time of it there. At the moment, we&apos;re moving in together in Warwickshire. I&apos;d really like to break through over here in the same way. I&apos;ve got an album out, called Shine, and I&apos;m going to be Aled Jones&apos;s special guest for two dates of his cathedral tour.\u00a0I&apos;m really excited about that. I want my experience in China to have been just the start. In London 44-year-old Rita Campbell is a session singer. In\u00a0Russia and Siberia she&apos;s a headline act      Rita Campbell: 'I remember arriving in Kazakhstan for the first time, getting in a cab and hearing my song on the radio.' Photograph: David Yeo for the Guardian    I&apos;ve been a session singer since I was 16. I&apos;ve made TV appearances and toured with well-known artists and bands such as D:Ream and the Brand New Heavies, but always as a backing vocalist. It\u00a0wasn&apos;t until I was asked to sing lead vocals on\u00a0dance tracks by the Hed Kandi label in the late\u00a01990s that I began to get a taste of fame. My\u00a0breakthrough was called Runaway Love, and it\u00a0was a big hit in Russia, Kazakhstan and Latvia, where the club scene is huge. I remember arriving in Kazakhstan for the first time, getting in a cab and hearing my song on the radio. I just said, &quot;Oh, wow, that&apos;s me!&quot; I guess when I started out I did have an ambition to be famous and one day be up there at the Brit Awards. But by then I had realised it wasn&apos;t going to happen for me and I was quite happy being in the background. So when this popularity in Russia began, it took me by surprise. Every time I step off the plane in Siberia, I make sure I have my &quot;diva coat&quot; ready. It&apos;s a leopard print, and I\u00a0wouldn&apos;t be seen dead in it in Waitrose, but people expect you to look the part. I&apos;m prepared now \u2013 I was caught out the first few times looking tired and jetlagged. It&apos;s surreal when I arrive \u2013 like stepping off the plane on another planet. I&apos;ve been greeted with bouquets, upgraded when airline staff recognise me, and I&apos;ve signed everything from plaster casts to arms, legs and even a few pairs of boobs. I&apos;ve got some great fans, but there will always be a few &quot;very enthusiastic&quot; ones who get a little carried away. Luckily, my boyfriend is in the industry and tours all over the world, too, so we&apos;re understanding of each other&apos;s work. It&apos;s all very different from my life here. In the UK, I&apos;m a songwriter and I&apos;m always busy with touring, vocal sessions and coaching \u2013 I work on The X Factor and Britain&apos;s Got Talent, as well as on TV and radio commercials. I&apos;m in my studio at home a lot, so I don&apos;t bother with the makeup and false lashes I wear in Russia. I just put on comfy clothes and Uggs. I like being at home, I like cooking. It&apos;s a great life, and I&apos;ve got a great career \u2013 but I&apos;m a voice, not a face, over here. I like the balance, so I&apos;d never consider moving to one of the places where I&apos;m famous. I get to travel around the world and get treated like royalty, but then I can return to normality when I\u00a0get home. And the weather is a factor, too. I seem to have success in freezing cold countries and I\u00a0like heat \u2013 so relocating to Siberia is not really on\u00a0my agenda. Izzy Gunnars, 32, is an aspiring actor in London, but in Iceland she&apos;s a popular TV presenter, actor\u00a0and singer     Izzy Gunnars: 'When I get off the plane from Reykjavik, I love the anonymity of London.' Photograph: David Yeo for the Guardian    It&apos;s quite a strange experience, walking through an airport and seeing photos of yourself on\u00a0the front cover of gossip magazines with the headline Leaving For London. And then, when I\u00a0get off the plane in London, I&apos;m totally anonymous. My parents are Icelandic, and I&apos;ve lived in Los Angeles, London and Reykjavik. I first came to London for\u00a0drama school, and loved it, but about\u00a0a year after I finished my course I headed back to Iceland and got a part in my first feature film, Eleven Men Out. After appearing in a couple\u00a0of independent plays, I was hired at the national theatre. That led to working for the national TV\u00a0channel, first on a\u00a0kids&apos; show and then as a presenter. The first CD I\u00a0sang on was music from the show, but after that I made an album of my own. Being famous in Iceland is different from over here. Everyone knows someone who knows someone \u2013 it&apos;s like high school. If you get &quot;papped&quot;, you&apos;ll know the papper, or they&apos;ll know your mum, or your aunt, so they&apos;re always polite \u2013 they would never harass you. Most people&apos;s phone numbers are listed, too, so I used to get calls from fans sometimes. One was a nine-year-old boy who sang down the phone to me. When I get off the plane from Reykjavik, I love the anonymity of London. During the time I was presenting the kids&apos; TV show, a woman came up to me in a bar and told me I was a bad example for\u00a0having a glass of wine. Over here, I could have a whole bottle and nobody would bat an eyelid. I\u00a0quite like that. I did my first British film last autumn \u2013 a thriller called Four Walls. Everyone in Iceland&apos;s been asking me when it&apos;s out, and I have to say I don&apos;t know \u2013 it might just be shown at festivals. They don&apos;t understand it. If a film is made in Iceland, everyone knows, and then it&apos;s at the cinema. It&apos;s\u00a0a\u00a0much bigger industry here.

But after a rally in the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets, the fund has made up nearly all its losses. Will 2013 be the year when Bolton finally starts to deliver? The launch story for the fund in 2010 was seductive. Bolton was convinced a consumer revolution would follow China&apos;s industrial revolution, and invested in the type of consumer-friendly stocks that would benefit. But after an initial surge, which took the share price from \u00a31 to \u00a31.25, his fund fell to a low of 70p, a drop of over 40% and a significantly worse performance than the China index. In perhaps the most embarrassing failure, one of Bolton&apos;s investments, China Integrated Energy, lost 90% of its market value. But the last three months have been kinder to Bolton. China Special Situations&apos; share price has jumped from 70p in September last year to touch 98p in recent trading, or just a whisker from its 100p initial price three years ago. His biggest holding, Tencent, an internet company that has more than 700m active users of its instant messaging service and up to 145m on the system at any one time, has seen its share price rise from HK$200 to HK$280 over the past year. Bolton is convinced the recovery is not just temporary. &quot;This year there are a lot of things that are aligned positively,&quot; he says, citing the once-in-a-decade leadership change, with the president Hu Jintao passing control to Xi Jinping and a revival in economic growth with credit surging but inflation remaining under control. &quot;After a long period in which people have been withdrawing money from Chinese shares, the money is now coming back. It is helping the parts of the market that have hurt me most. The small companies that dominated the downside will help me most in the upturn.&quot; New curbs on China&apos;s overheating property market have sent stock prices in Shanghai downwards in the past two weeks (and the Fidelity fund has fallen back to 93p), and many economists are fretting over rising inflation. But Bolton says: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t put too much emphasis on the changes to property taxes, which have been in the pipeline for some time, and I think inflation is 2014&apos;s problem, not this year&apos;s. There is unlikely to be any real tightening [interest rate rises] until next year. What I&apos;m interested in is the long-term change in China as it moves from investment to consumption. If you look at the degree to which wages are rising, that very much underwrites the consumption story. The demand side of the economy is looking fine.&quot; One sector where Bolton is hoping to capitalise on increased consumer spending is airline companies, and he has been building up significant holdings in China Southern Airlines and Air China. China Southern, although virtually unheard of in the UK, is the world&apos;s sixth biggest airline, carrying more passengers than British Airways, Air France or Ryanair. &quot;I don&apos;t normally like airline stocks, especially in the west, where there is so much competition from budget airlines. But in China it&apos;s different, with a heavily regulated market and just three players serving a market where there is a huge desire to travel, both domestically and internationally.&quot; The blow-up at China Integrated Energy has not deterred Bolton from investing in power companies. He reckons that a difficult time for power companies, which have been unable to pass on rising costs of coal and other raw materials, may now be over. He likes Huaneng Power International, which he believes will benefit from recent falls in coal prices. He is also investing in what China hopes will be a shale gas revolution akin to that in the US \u2013 but Bolton prefers the companies supplying services to the explorers rather than the explorers themselves, investing in Anton Oilfield Services and SPT Energy Group. Since October last year, the share price of SPT has doubled while Anton is up 150%. However, the bit of China we see most in the west \u2013 its enormous export machine \u2013 is about the worst place for investors, says Bolton. &quot;The exporters are being squeezed by a stronger currency and higher wages,&quot; he warns. Independent investment adviser Jason Hollands of Bestinvest.co.uk says the revival of Bolton&apos;s fund is welcome news, but it is not in the clear just yet: &quot;The launch of Fidelity China Special Situations was, to say the least, &apos;unfortunate&apos; in its timing as it has had a torrid first couple of years both as a result of a weak market and underperformance of the trust against the index. But there is some scope for optimism. More recently the fund has had a very strong six months and the medium-term outlook for China has also improved as fears of a &apos;hard landing&apos; for the Chinese economy have subsided, the leadership transition appears to have gone smoothly and latest wave of infrastructure spending will boost economic data. Of course, China is not out of the woods yet, with a key concern being the risks linked to its shadow banking system.&quot;", "tags": ["Investment funds", "Investments", "Money", "Investing", "Financial sector", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-16T07:00:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/campaigners-sceptical-china-environment-changes", "sentences": ["Authorities recently revealed that the country&apos;s soil pollution levels are classified as a state secret, and more than 13,000 rotting pig carcasses were discovered last week in a river that cuts through Shanghai and supplies tap water to more than a fifth of its people."], "title": "Activists voice doubts over politicians' vow to 'build a beautiful China'", "article": "Officials at Beijing&apos;s stately National People&apos;s Congress, an annual conclave held by China&apos;s political leadership, were full of promises to &quot;build a beautiful China&quot; of blue skies and pristine rivers \u2013 promises which, as the air in adjacent Tiananmen Square settled into smoky grey, critics derided as more talk than action.

Authorities recently revealed that the country&apos;s soil pollution levels are classified as a state secret, and more than 13,000 rotting pig carcasses were discovered last week in a river that cuts through Shanghai and supplies tap water to more than a fifth of its people. This weekend, almost a third of delegates to the NPC refused to rubber-stamp a fresh batch of environmental committee appointments, suggesting that the issue has become as unbearable among some government officials as it has among ordinary people. Out of 2,944 delegates, 850 voted against the new lineup of the congress&apos;s environmental protection and resources conservation committee; another 125 abstained. According to the South China Morning Post, the delegates &quot;greeted the result with a long boo&quot;. Zhou Shengxian was re-elected as the minister of environmental protection after spending five years in the position. Ma Tianjie, the head of toxics campaign at Greenpeace East Asia, said that despite the lack of concrete anti-pollution action at the congress, bold environmental legislation may yet emerge over the next five years as new leaders acclimate to their roles and cement their alliances. &quot;Because they&apos;re changing a lot of positions at the top, they have been a bit cautious in revealing their agenda,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem is not that the top doesn&apos;t get it \u2013 they have got it for a while now. The problem is with lower level authorities, whether they can translate that kind of top-level consciousness to actual actions on the ground.&quot; Yet some official responses at the meetings belie the question of who, exactly, will lead the charge.

The attempt to codify how international law applies to online attacks includes a provision for states to respond with conventional force if aggression through hacking into computer networks by another state results in death or significant damage to property. The handbook, written by 20 legal experts working in conjunction with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the US Cyber Command, says full-scale wars could be triggered by online attacks on computer systems. It also states that so-called &quot;hacktivists&quot; who participate in online attacks during a war can be legitimate targets even though they are civilians. The group of experts was invited to draw up the handbook by Nato&apos;s Co-operative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. The project took three years. The centre was established in 2008 following a wave of cyber-attacks on the Baltic state from inside Russia. The denial-of-service attacks crashed websites and damaged Estonia&apos;s infrastructure, raising awareness about the damage that online operations can inflict in an increasingly computer-dependent era. In January David Cameron announced that the UK would be joining the CCDCOE this year. The UK ambassador to Tallinn, Chris Holtby, said then: &quot;The UK will send an expert as well as continue the wider co-operation between the UK and the centre which already exists. The UK values strongly the work of the centre and looks forward to increasing our contribution.&quot; The Tallinn manual, which contains 95 &quot;black letter rules&quot;, was formally launched at the London thinktank Chatham House last Friday. Colonel Kirby Abbott, an assistant legal adviser at Nato, said at the launch that the manual was now &quot;the most important document in the law of cyber-warfare. It will be highly useful.&quot; Professor Michael Schmitt, director of the project, who works at the US Naval War College, said there was relatively little consensus about how existing legal regimes governed online activities. The Stuxnet attack on Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, which physically damaged sensitive centrifuges, divided opinion among experts in the Tallinn group as to whether it constituted an armed conflict. The computer worm is widely believed to have been created by the US and/or Israel. Rule 22 of the handbook states: &quot;An international armed conflict exists whenever there are hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations occurring between two states or more.&quot; An attached commentary adds: &quot;To date, no international armed conflict has been publicly characterised as having been solely precipitated in cyberspace. Nevertheless, the international group of experts unanimously concluded that cyber operations alone might have the potential to cross the threshold of international armed conflict.&quot; The manual suggests &quot;proportionate counter-measures&quot; against online attacks carried out by a state are permitted. Such measures cannot involve the use of force, however, unless the original cyber-attack resulted in death or significant damage to property. Formulating a framework for permitted counter-measures should not lower the threshold for future conflicts, Schmitt told the Guardian. &quot;You can only use force when you reach the level of armed conflict. Everyone talks about cyberspace as though it&apos;s the wild west. We discovered that there&apos;s plenty of law that applies to cyberspace.&quot; It is often difficult to locate the source of an online attack. Publicity last month about a tower block in Shanghai said to contain a Chinese army unit and to be the source of numerous global cyber-attacks highlighted the difficulty of proving who is responsible for causing damage to computer systems. Rule seven of the manual declares that if a cyber operation originates from a government network, &quot;it is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that state but is an indication that the state in question is associated with the operation&quot;. The handbook says that, in accordance with Geneva conventions, attacks on certain key civilian sites are outlawed. Rule 80 of the handbook states: &quot;In order to avoid the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population, particular care must be taken during cyber-attacks against works an installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, as well as installations located in their vicinity.&quot; Hospitals and medical units are also protected as they would be under rules governing traditional warfare. The handbook is not official Nato document or policy but an advisory manual. It is published by Cambridge University Press. A retired UK air commodore and several British lawyers were among those who worked on the project. In 2010 the UK&apos;s national security strategy characterised cyber-attacks, including those by other states, as one of four &quot;tier one&quot; threats alongside terrorism, military crises between states and major accidents. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 March 2013.

When Norway and China fell out two years ago over a Nobel prize awarded to a Chinese dissident, the spat had little wider resonance. But diplomatic relations are thawing as quickly as Arctic ice \u2013 and the upshot could be significant for the frigid northern wastes of the planet, which are thought to sit on formidable quantities of mineral reserves. China has been cosying up to Arctic countries as part of its effort to secure &quot;permanent observer&quot; status on the Arctic Council, an eight-country political body that decides regional policy. Norway was initially sniffy at the approaches because of the Nobel row, but appears to have changed its tune before a formal decision in May. Last week, the Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told reporters in Oslo that he strongly supported China&apos;s application. The &quot;argument for opening up for more observers in the Arctic Council is that they will then be a member of our club,&quot; he said, according to Norwegian media. &quot;Then the danger of them forming their own club will be smaller.&quot; &quot;There are not many areas where Norway is important to China at all, but the Arctic is one of them,&quot; said Leiv Lunde, director of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Lysaker, Norway. China, he added, was beginning to realise that its diplomatic boycott &quot;is not good PR in sort of bolstering the positive image that China wants to bolster as an Arctic player&quot;. Currently, 80% of China&apos;s imported energy passes through the Strait of Malacca \u2013 a crowded, heavily pirated waterway that squeezes past Singapore. Yet over the past few years, melting Arctic ice, a casualty of climate change, has turned the frigid north into a viable shipping route. The newly navigable northern sea route above Russia would cut the distance between Shanghai and northern Europe by 4,000 miles, saving medium-sized bulk carriers about two weeks and \u00a3260,000 on each journey. Three years ago, no ships made the voyage. Last year, there were 46. Last August, Chinese scientists aboard a Ukrainian-built icebreaker, the Xuelong, or Snow Dragon, completed the country&apos;s first trans-Arctic ship voyage from Shanghai to Iceland. The trip&apos;s leader, Huigen Yang, told Reuters this week that Chinese shipping companies, encouraged by the ship&apos;s success, may be planning a commercial voyage along the same route as soon as this summer. Scandinavian shipping companies \u2013 long an influential force in the region&apos;s politics \u2013 are also ebullient about the development. &quot;For the producers up north, all of a sudden they have a two-tier market to play on,&quot; said Henrik Falck, a project manager at Norway&apos;s Tschudi Shipping Company. &quot;They can either ship their cargo to China or the far east, or they can send it to the continent as they are doing today. And the transportation cost is no longer killing the deal.&quot; Although China has never announced an official Arctic policy, some fear that its regional economic interests could have military implications. Furthermore, the US Geological Survey estimates that 30% of the world&apos;s undiscovered natural gas reserves lie above the Arctic Circle, in addition to vast deposits of oil, coal, rare earths and uranium, and experts say that China wants to get in on the ground floor. &quot;The way I see it, very minor investments for China now can warrant very big rewards in the future,&quot; said Malte Humpert, founder and executive director of the Arctic Institute in Washington DC. &quot;It&apos;s a low risk and obvious choice.&quot; One indicator is China&apos;s recent interest in Greenland. The vast, self-governing country&apos;s parliament is considering approving a $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn) mining project north-east of the capital, Nuuk, which would be led by the UK-based London Mining plc but supply China with 15m tonnes of iron ore a year. The project, which may kick off this summer, would require a team of 3,000 Chinese workers, adding more than 4% to the country&apos;s population of 57,000. Some fear that it would affect Greenland&apos;s pristine natural environment, which locals rely on for hunting and fishing. Greenland&apos;s prime minister, Aleqa Hammond, who was elected last Tuesday, has promised to assuage these fears by limiting inflows of cheap labour from abroad. &quot;What could the creation of a mine and the arrival of some 3,000 Chinese workers mean to me as an inhabitant of a hamlet? What will it mean to me and my hunting grounds?&quot; she told the Associated Press. Tiny, 320,000-population Iceland may best represent the polarity of Europe&apos;s reactions to China&apos;s Arctic aspirations. Last year, Icelandic authorities rejected a Chinese billionaire&apos;s bid to turn land in the country&apos;s barren north into a holiday resort. Some said that the development&apos;s proximity to deepwater ports could pose security risks. Yet former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao made Iceland his first stop on his European tour last spring, signing Arctic co-operation agreements with the Icelandic prime minister. China&apos;s $250m embassy in Iceland&apos;s capital, Reykjavik, can accommodate 500 personnel; in contrast the US embassy has a staff of 70.

I do not know who these advocates of miracle cures may be, but I suggest their views can be reasonably ignored in favour of the views of those who hold that there is another way \u2013 taking steps to encourage growth of production and wealth, and thus increasing the power to reduce the national deficit without all the pain he is inflicting on the poor and innocent. In short, by following the teaching of JM Keynes. No one is suggesting that the austerity path may not eventually end in success. Pre-Keynesian economic policies practically accepted booms and slumps as almost a law of nature. Osborne&apos;s policy resembles the plan of a man deciding to journey from London to New York by travelling eastwards. Eventually he may arrive and claim that his method was a success. But there really is a better way.Francis WestobyHitchin, Hertfordshire \u2022 Among the economic gloom announced by the chancellor, there was one welcome piece of news for the fast-growing co-operative sector. The government announced a consultation on a much-overdue increase in the amount of money that members of co-operatives can invest. This vital change will be a boost to the growth and development of co-operative enterprises with farmers&apos; co-operatives and local communities clubbing together to save shops and services. A co-operative renaissance is underway as people seek out businesses they can trust. Ed MayoSecretary general, Co-operatives UK \u2022 Last year the US Congressional Research Service published data showing there is no relationship between low rates of income tax and an improved economy. The period studied was the 1940s to 2010. The marginal rate of tax of 90% was maintained for 20 years after the war and fell to around 75% for the next 10. There were similar rates in western Europe compounded in Britain at least with very heavy debt that was not cleared till 2002. I seem to remember a top rate of 98% here. Yet those 30 years\u00a0transformed life for the better with\u00a0the creation of welfare states, much\u00a0reduced inequality, and amazing growth and prosperity.Katerina PorterLondon \u2022 Yet again Osborne has elected to use taxpayers&apos; money to subsidise those who own land and buildings. Would-be home-owners do not need help to get into debt, they need houses to come down to prices they could afford without government interference.

In the past two weeks, the number of dead pigs recovered from rivers that supply water to the great financial centre has risen to more than 16,000. The authorities say there is no risk to health, but no one has much confidence in that appraisal. Contaminated water is now one of the greatest causes of illness in China. A report from Greenpeace East Asia suggests 320 million people \u2013 nearly one in four of the population \u2013 are without access to clean drinking water, while 190 million people are drinking water that is severely contaminated. A Chinese government study conducted in 2011 found nearly half of all cities had &quot;seriously contaminated&quot; groundwater supplies. The alarming figures are backed by Unicef, which in a report published on Friday says that almost 90% of child deaths are due to diarrhoeal diseases caused by contaminated water, lack of sanitation or inadequate hygiene. They report 760,000 deaths in 2011 \u2013 an appalling statistic that nonetheless represents a 30% improvement on the 1.2 million annual deaths recorded in 2000. Meanwhile, the latest water outlook report of the OECD, the thinktank of the world&apos;s 27 richest countries, suggests global water demand will increase by 55% worldwide between 2000 and 2050. The increase in demand, the report says, will come mainly from manufacturing (+400%), electricity (+140%) and domestic use (+130%). Groundwater depletion, which more than doubled between 1960 and 2000, may become the greatest threat to agriculture and urban water supplies in several regions in the coming decades. Fifteen years ago, world leaders listened to scientists and committed to tackling climate change. Vast political and financial resources have since been invested in trying to reduce emissions and develop alternative energy supplies. They may be nowhere near enough, but more than 120 countries are now committed to changing the way they generate and use energy. The water and sanitation crisis has been largely ignored by world governments, however, even though it is possibly more urgent than climate change and is already affecting billions of people. Governments have invested comparatively little in water saving, industry has been allowed to pollute on a massive scale, farmers have been left to take too much, and consumers have been able to waste water. Provision has been left to the market, which clearly has not worked, and though the UN has declared water a human right, countries have been able to ignore the problem. Even the millennium development goals have not been enough to encourage governments. The world is on track to halve the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water, but half the population of developing regions still has no sanitation, the target for which will be hopelessly missed.", "tags": ["Global development", "Water", "Access to water", "Environment", "China", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-22T13:02:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/23/china-loves-pork-pig-carcasses", "sentences": ["Over the last fortnight, more than 16,000 dead pigs have been recovered from tributaries of the Huangpu, the river that arcs through Shanghai.", "What worries Shanghai residents is that the waterway supplies more than 20% of the city&apos;s tap water.", "&quot;It&apos;s also not news that 20 million Shanghai residents have drunk dead pig broth for half a month.", "What&apos;s news is that the Shanghai water bureau claims the Huangpu&apos;s water meets health standards.&quot; Others responded more humorously.", "A Shanghai resident retorts: &quot;That&apos;s nothing, we turn on our taps and have pork chop soup.&quot; My reaction is more despondent."], "title": "China loves pork too much | Nicola Davison", "article": "Over the last fortnight, more than 16,000 dead pigs have been recovered from tributaries of the Huangpu, the river that arcs through Shanghai. Mottled and swollen, adult hogs and piglets were first spotted upstream in Henglaojing creek, their bellies forming pearlescent domes among the river debris. Finding a dead hog in this creek isn&apos;t an anomaly. Farmers have been using the waterways as a dumping ground for deceased stock for decades, residents say. It is the numbers that the locals find shocking. What worries Shanghai residents is that the waterway supplies more than 20% of the city&apos;s tap water. Early tests revealed the pigs carry porcine circovirus, which isn&apos;t infectious to humans, and the water was ruled safe. Though there has been no official explanation for their appearance, tags in the pigs&apos; ears trace them to Jiaxing in the neighbouring Zhejiang province. Jiaxing is an area where the pork industry flourishes and where 70,000 pigs died this year because of extreme weather conditions and &quot;crude raising techniques&quot;, according to state media. Citizens have responded with outrage to the Henglaojing incident. &quot;That thousands of dead pigs were dumped in the Huangpu secretly isn&apos;t news&quot;, said Li Mingsheng, a well-known writer, on his weibo (microblog) account. &quot;It&apos;s also not news that 20 million Shanghai residents have drunk dead pig broth for half a month. What&apos;s news is that the Shanghai water bureau claims the Huangpu&apos;s water meets health standards.&quot; Others responded more humorously. In one joke spread through weibo, a Beijing resident boasts that he just has to open the window to have free cigarettes. A Shanghai resident retorts: &quot;That&apos;s nothing, we turn on our taps and have pork chop soup.&quot; My reaction is more despondent. I visited Zhejiang late last year to report on the booming factory-farm industry, interviewing a young man whose local eco system has been decimated by the arrival of a factory farm. A dead pig in a river is gripping, sensationalist, macabre. But it hints at a deeper crisis: the impact the burgeoning meat industry in the developing world is having on the planet. As the world&apos;s population expands, incomes rise \u2013 and we eat more meat. In 1999, annual meat production worldwide was around 218m tonnes. By 2030 it is projected to be 376m, according to the World Health Organisation. To accommodate the extra 2 billion people expected to be alive by 2050, we need to eat a quarter of the meat we do now. Tell that to the Chinese, who are particularly fond of pork. Mao&apos;s favourite dish was hongshao rou, a fatty braised pork belly. The country produces and consumes half the world&apos;s pork, around 50m tonnes in 2011. The average person eats four times what they ate in 1980, but a third less than the average Briton. To satiate rising meaty appetites, animal husbandry is in a state of rapid change. Backyard pigpens, the method by which Chinese people raised hogs for centuries, are being replaced with Cafos (concentrated feeding animal operations), copycats of the American versions, which the Chinese government is subsidising heavily. A Cafo is likely to be where the hogs in the Henglaojing waters came from. Jiaxing accounts for a quarter of the pigs raised in Zhejiang province, around 4.5m each year. A downside of the Cafo system is that it&apos;s inefficient. The amount of grain \u2013 usually soy \u2013 that it takes to feed so many animals renders the energy ratio from crop to pork at 4:1 (beef is 7:1). They are also breeding grounds for viruses \u2013 such as porcine circovirus as seen in the Henglaojing pigs, but also foot-and-mouth disease and hog cholera. More worrying for humans is that the use of antibiotics in Cafos is linked to the development of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The proper disposal of diseased animals should be a global concern. From the &quot;hogwash&quot; incident, the Chinese government should take stock. It must move swiftly to regulate Cafos, particularly the smaller holdings that have grown haphazardly and without sufficient checks. The farmers involved in this incident made the unwise decision to dump the carcasses rather than burn them (which is more expensive), but why hadn&apos;t the local government stopped similar behaviour before? At least the hogs weren&apos;t sold. In October, a court in Jiaxing heard a case in which 77,000 tonnes of dead pigs had been illegally processed and sold as meat to locals. The defendants made 8.6m yuan (\u00a3900,000) from the deals. Chinese friends and acquaintances are initially bemused by my vegetarianism. Despite the country&apos;s rich Buddhist tradition, they think it&apos;s a quaint, foreign quirk. Something hardwired into the nation&apos;s psyche is the association of meat with progress. I find it difficult to explain to people who had one of the world&apos;s deadliest famines in living memory that I think people today eat too much meat for the good of the planet and themselves.

Merlin ended 2012 with \u00a31.27bn of debt, broadly the same as a year before, after spending \u00a392m on improving its existing sites and \u00a371m on new businesses. &quot;IPO markets are open again in the UK and Merlin is a very good business that has been well run. Despite the recession, people continue to spend money on leisure and Merlin has some great assets that it would be difficult to replicate,&quot; said Nick Batram, an analyst at Peel Hunt. Visitor numbers at Merlin&apos;s UK attractions were flat last year as the weather hit outdoor parks such as Alton Towers but benefited indoor attractions such as the London Dungeon. Legoland Windsor, boasting a new themed hotel, was one of the few outdoor parks to see a rise. The group&apos;s top performers were overseas ventures such as its Madame Tussauds attractions in Asia and Legoland in California. A fifth of turnover now comes from North America and 14% from Asia and the Pacific region, which accounted for just 2% of sales two years ago. Varney said he expected a bounce back in the UK this year as there would be no competition from the Olympics, which drew 10m visitors away from alternative days out. Elsewhere, Merlin is opening Legoland Discovery Centres in Canada, Germany and Westchester, New York; a new Madame Tussauds in Tokyo; a Dungeon in Berlin and a Sea Life Centre in Manchester. It will also open a 250-bedroom Legoland hotel at its California park, as it continues its strategy of adding themed accommodation at its parks. The scariest new ride will be The Smiler at Alton Towers, which is still under construction. &quot;It&apos;s the first ride I&apos;ve looked at and wondered if I could go on it,&quot; said Varney. &quot;It&apos;s a spaghetti of twists and turns and loops and we&apos;ve been adding psychological tricks that make you feel like you&apos;ve been hypnotised.&quot; Merlin worldwide: Numbers of attractions \u2022 44 Sea Life centres, including the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and Germany \u2022 14 Madame Tussauds, including Bangkok, Shanghai and Las Vegas \u2022 10 Legoland discovery centres, including Manchester, Tokyo and Chicago \u2022 8 Dungeons, including The London Dungeon and Hamburg Dungeon \u2022 6 Legoland parks, including Windsor and California \u2022 5 theme parks, including Alton Towers and Chessington World of Adventures \u2022 It also owns two ski resorts, The London Eye, Blackpool Tower \u2022 Tree Top adventure parks based in Australia and Warwick Castle", "tags": ["Travel & leisure", "Business", "Stock markets", "Investing", "Financial sector", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-03-27T20:20:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/28/green-light", "sentences": ["Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Media    \u2022 Earth Hour 2013 celebrations around the world \u2013 in pictures\u2022 Ecology in action photo competition winners \u2013 in pictures Best of the web \u2022 Green heating scheme delayed again until spring 2014\u2022 Shanghai&apos;s dead pig story stretches back upstream\u2022 Over 10% of a single tortoise species&apos; population found in smuggler&apos;s bag  ...

In 2011, Bob Dylan defended himself from allegations that he had allowed the Chinese government to censor his setlist for shows he played in Beijing and Shanghai.  On a post on his website, Dylan wrote: &quot;The Chinese government had asked for the names of the songs that I would be playing.

In the early part of the twentieth century, up until the Second World War, left-handedness was seen as the mark of an infidel, schoolchildren often forced to write with their right on pain of violence. And even later than that, Abram Blau, head of child psychiatry at New York&apos;s Mount Sinai Hospital, described left-handedness as &quot;an expression of infantile negativism&quot;. As regards John McEnroe, he was half right. So glorious was his childishness that when Thomas Hulce was preparing for the role of Mozart in Amadeus, he watched tapes of McEnroe in action. &quot;Tennis players had had tantrums before, had yelled at umpires before,&quot; McEnroe recalled in his autobiography, &quot;but no one had done it quite the way I did \u2026 Maybe my rages stirred up something that they&apos;d had to bury or swallow as kids \u2026 Whatever it was, the public really sat up and took notice.&quot; Of course they did, and how couldn&apos;t they? There&apos;s been nothing in sport comparable to the roller coaster of a McEnroe rage: the slow, cranking escalation backed by goading anticipatory oooohs, then a racing, spiralling unpredictability that lasts longer than you can possibly anticipate without ever quite losing control. While plenty of other folk have got vexed playing sport, McEnroe&apos;s outbursts were uniquely in public and audible to all, taking him above even Roy Keane, his most obvious comparator in that aspect - and there can be no finer anger-off scalp than that. Of course, the media got well and truly stuck in, building an equine pyramid on top of Mount Everest, spiking its members with DMT, and vaulting aboard. &quot;The worst advertisement for our system of values since Al Capone,&quot; deadpanned the New York Times. &quot;A young man who raised perfectly placed strokes to a high art form, only to resort to tantrums that smear his masterpieces like graffiti,&quot; said Newsweek. These were, apparently, intended as insults. McEnroe&apos;s own relationship to his personality is predictably mixed, &quot;as you know&quot; and &quot;proud&quot; modal phrases in an autobiography that does not shy away from noting its subject&apos;s significance. Accordingly, being informed by strangers that he&apos;s the greatest player ever, or that tennis is not the same without him &quot;is not exactly difficult to swallow,&quot; nor does he tire of hearing such praise, admitting an addiction to the attention and desire to explore his relationship to it. &quot;I truly do wonder,&quot; he wrote, &quot;Will I be totally forgotten at some point? Will I end up walking around wishing for what I don&apos;t have anymore? ... At worst, people have seen me as a kind of caricature ... I sometimes wonder that as I get older, that caricature is getting more deeply etched - that maybe it&apos;s all I&apos;ll get to leave to posterity.&quot; But as a tennis player, McEnroe was relentlessly positive, his game &quot;based on moving forward, always forward, then making the winning shot&quot; - the sporting embodiment of a lifelong determination never to hold back and to be honest at any cost. In typically lefty style, he managed this by combining intellect and instinct, formula and improvisation and formula. Describing himself as &quot;somebody who&apos;d think almost obsessively in numerical terms&quot;, he saw tennis as as geometry and commanded angles like they were his private property - but there was more to it than could be measured empirically, a sense, not just of where his opponent was going to hit the ball, but &quot;another dimension,&quot; the ability to &quot;feel the ball through the strings&quot;. This brought him a spontaneous delicacy and allowed to perform not just the incredible but the inconceivable, perhaps the strongest strain of genius. Winning the French Open mixed doubles at the age of 18 almost by mistake, he then reached the semi-finals at Wimbledeon - where he was &quot;incredulous at all that bowing and curtsying&quot;. There, he lost to Jimmy Connors, another bad-tempered lefty, later admitting that he was not mentally tough enough to compete against the elite - and his body wasn&apos;t quite ready either. Though an exceptional athlete, McEnroe wasn&apos;t especially strong. Growing up, he idolised Rod Laver but was unable to replicate the absurdity of his left forearm, a bursting hunk of muscle that must have made for an uncomfortable adolescence. Instead, he opted for control and consistency via a Continental grip that is now almost obsolete, and completely remodelled his serving action by mistake - or using what the National Bureau of Economic Research call &quot;divergent thinking&quot;, a strain of creativity in which the brain switches &quot;from conventional knowledge into unexplored association&quot;. In all sports, left-handers have an inherent more of you fewer of us advantage, but in tennis can also rely on a serve that swings out wide to the backhand side, forcing opponents to stretch across their body to reach it with what is usually their weaker shot. The exaggerated mechanics of McEnroe&apos;s new action were perfect for taking advantage of this. Starting almost entirely side-on and facing away from his opponent, he would gently shokl back and forth, head down, curled almost, before suddenly flinging his body into the serve and towards the net - not with the easy, flowing power of, say, Sampras, but with a contorted torque, every fibrous effort directed towards making its return as unpredictable as possible for his unsighted opponent. Though McEnroe is known for his rivalry with Connors, it was his battles with Bjorn Borg that consumed him, a meeting of minds and clash of everything else, devil versus angel. Initially, Borg, the archetypal calm and predictable righty, had the upper hand and was the crowd favourite, particularly at Wimbledon, whose the nob culture reufsed to properly appreciate McEnroe until he was on the way down. The pair played their first Grand Slam final at SW19 in 1980, which was apparently a fairly decent match with a handy tie-break, and came less than two months after Trevor Brooking supposedly settled an FA Cup final with a reportedly rare header. But that was as good as it got for Borg. Only a few months later they played another five-set Grand Slam final in New York, and this time McEnroe won. Then, when they met in the same finals the following year, McEnroe won with relative ease after ceding the first set each time. Soon afterwards, Borg retired, possibly forced into it, and for McEnroe, tennis was never the same again. Though he&apos;s more than a little fond of stating his stats - 77 titles in both singles and doubles, &quot;more than any other player,&quot; \u2013 he was motivated by the challenge, not the triumph. Every protagonist needs an antagonist. No player in the history of tennis has brought the undiluted thrill of John McEnroe. Clearly, Roger Federer was better, and when he plays, there&apos;s a sense of greatness - but of greatness defined by the textbook and doing everything perfectly, where the joy isn&apos;t so much in the anticipation of what might happen, but of marvelling at it subsequently. McEnroe, on the other hand, was unorthodox and peculiar, the distinction that between serene and savage beauty. Which makes you feel more intensely depends on your aesthetic bent - some prefer gardens, others waterfalls - but for those who like a bit of attitude with their achievement, John McEnroe was the man. DH 2) Dorothy Kamenshek Baseball was designed for right-handers, which, odd as it sounds, is perhaps why lefties do disproportionately well - while only one in 10 people is left-handed, apparently one in four baseball players is. There are some basic advantages, like being a few yards closer to first base when batting (a reason that some right-handed players, struggling to do much with the bat, start switch-hitting), and being able to carry your swing momentum in to the first base line, rather than away from it. Left-handed hitters also benefit from a better line of sight as the ball comes at them from a right-handed pitcher, making it easier to tell how fast it&apos;s travelling. And the right field is almost always shorter than the left, which means that a lefty who can really slug the ball, swinging through it, can more easily hit a home run. There are some positions that don&apos;t suit southpaws (the term comes, since you didn&apos;t ask, from the fact that diamonds were typically set out so that batters faced east, and thus a left-handed pitcher&apos;s &quot;paw&quot; was on the south side), but first base ain&apos;t one of &apos;em, as ably demonstrated by Dorothy Kamenshek, the finest female player the All-American Girls&apos; Baseball League ever did see. Running up the league&apos;s highest career batting average - .292, since you probably did ask, which in her final season her average rose to an impressive .345 - Dottie (who was one of several Rockford Peaches to inspire the Geena Davis character Dottie Hinson in A League of their Own, though Hinson is a catcher) made all seven All-Star teams. She didn&apos;t only aim for that short right field, either, but hit to all fields. &quot;She could hit with power, she could lay the bunt down and steal the base,&quot; said Pepper Davis, who wrote about beating the Peaches to the 1946 championship with Racine Belles in her autobiography, Dirt in the Skirt. &quot;She would arrive just in time for the ballgames, go in cold, without any batting practice, and still play a great game. She was a complete ballplayer.&quot; Signed up at 17 having been refused permission to join the army (her mother only allowed her to try out for the AAGBL because she assumed it would come to nothing), Kamenshek was originally put in the outfield, but after a dozen games she was switched to first base. &quot;She was a great first baseman,&quot; said Davis. &quot;She could go off the ground three feet and grab it, or dig it out of the dirt.&quot; Although Kamenshek said of baseball that she &quot;didn&apos;t have to work at it too hard&quot;, she trained diligently for her new role. &quot;I threw the pillow on the floor in front of a full-length mirror and pretended it was first base,&quot; she said. &quot;You try to make yourself as long as possible. I practiced shifting my feet.&quot; It is largely thanks to Kamenshek that first basemen tend to nestle the side of their feet against the bag and reach for a thrown ball - her defensive abilities had the New York Yankees&apos; Wally Pipp smitten. &quot;She&apos;s the fanciest fielding first baseman I&apos;ve ever seen, man or woman,&quot; he told a reporter. In fact in 1947 she was offered a contract to play minor league baseball with Ft. Lauderdale, but wanted no part of the publicity stunt. GT 3) Brian Lara Anything that demands dancing feet and waving arms gives significant scope for elegance, but even so, the balletic batsmanship of Brian Lara was quite thoroughly something. Perhaps the most natural swordsman of all-time, his twinkling, skipping, scrolling movement made it seem like he was switching from left to right-handed and back again, such were the absurd places in which the middle of his bat turned up. But his essence was unmistakeably lefty, characterised by a carefree style and refusal to be dictated to, whether by circumstance or opponent. If he had his eye in there was pretty much nothing that could be done whatever the opposition did, the standard that marks a true great in any sport. No line could contain him and there was no style against which he struggled, which explains why the top end of his record is without compare. He owns the only Test score of 400, achieved a previous record mark of 375, made seven Test double hundreds including two against Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne in their pomp and one against Muttiah Muralitharan in his, the highest first class score ever, plus the most and third most runs ever taken from a Test match over. You can argue that he wasn&apos;t the best because the averages insist so, but it&apos;s almost impossible to argue that anyone else&apos;s best was better than his. But where McEnroe was obsessive, Lara was flighty, his problem not one of temper but of temperance. His relentless commitment to the effortless was nothing new, but no one else made it work so much of the time. Players like David Gower, Mohammad Azharuddin and VVS Laxman may have been as pretty, but ultimately their style defined them, whereas Lara could scarcely have been more gluttonously substanceful. Batsmen can be split in various ways: on-side and off-side, front foot and back foot, top hand and bottom hand, orthodox and unorthodox, better against spin or pace \u2013 unless you&apos;re talking about Lara. With him, the ball simply disappeared to wherever the fielders weren&apos;t in the most expedient manner possible \u2013 he was, along with Viv Richards and with the exception of Donald Bradman, the least bowlable-to batter of all time. But where Viv&apos;s principal weapons were a power and fear that seemed to intimidate the ball to the boundary, Lara ushered it there however he fancied, and with a smile. No human endeavour has ever been made to look less difficult. The only dichotomy of which he was not the master was attack and defence, a strength often presented as a weakness. A more circumspect approach might have resulted in more runs here and there, but at what cost? In similar vein, Maradona could have passed it more, or used his right foot more \u2013 and the world would lack a solo run spanning half the length of the pitch using eleven consecutive left-footed touches. You&apos;d be as well ragging God for a lack of humanity. DH 4) Kelly Smith Many are the occasions that have hinged on the health or otherwise of Kelly Smith&apos;s left leg. In 2005, when England hosted the women&apos;s European Championships, Smith was still recovering from a stress fracture in her left foot and her playing time had to be carefully managed; in the first two group games she could play only the first 45 minutes, and the difference after half time showed terribly. She is a player to elevate teams above the ordinary, and that fact, combined with her insatiable desire to play, has made for some exceptional moments as well as some very poignant ones; the sight of Smith struggling through matches, palpably lacking fitness yet still England&apos;s best player, has been a regrettably familiar one. Nursing a rolled ankle, Smith could barely walk for the final 40 minutes of England&apos;s extra-time-and-penalties defeat to France in the quarterfinals of the 2011 World Cup, but stepped up to smash home the first penalty after Camille Abily had missed for France. &quot;I usually place my penalties,&quot; she wrote in her autobiographer, Footballer, &quot;but this time, due to where I was at with the ankle, I was angry and decided to go for power. I just wanted to blast it.&quot; By this point she knew that if there were to be a next match for England at the tournament, she would be watching from the sidelines. As the ball shot past C\u00e9line Deville, Smith shifted uncomfortably on her throbbing ankle and threw her fists up at the crowd, inadvertently summoning 1996-vintage Stuart Pearce, before hobbling back to the halfway line. Perhaps the most famous image of Smith is the one taken inside the Hongkou Stadium in Shanghai in September 2007. In it, she holds her left boot to her lips, planting a smacker on the spot at the front with which she has just scored England&apos;s equaliser against Japan in a World Cup group match. She ran to the corner flag with the boot aloft, and the wonderment on her face as she does, her gaze passing through the boot and almost quizzically in to the crowd, thoroughly undermined the accusation that she had been instructed to whip off the boot by Umbro. &quot;I had just scored my first ever goal in a World Cup finals and I really didn&apos;t know what to do or how to feel,&quot; she said. &quot;I simply had no idea how to celebrate the goal.&quot; Despite the criticism, and regardless of whether it was planned, it seemed entirely appropriate that Smith should focus on the left foot that she had so neatly crafted the opportunity for, rather than, say, turning her back to gesture at the name printed across her shoulders. She has always let her football do the talking. When the England manager Hope Powell told her there would be no repeat performances, she was not worried about the fillip for sponsors, but the additional emphasis it put on her left peg. Smith&apos;s injury record is down in no small part to the battering she takes from opposition defenders never quite able to follow her feints (last summer&apos;s Olympic tournament was the perfect example: Smith was so brutalised in the group matches, particularly by Cameroon and Brazil, that she started the quarterfinal on the bench). It is surely only the injuries that have cost her the full recognition of the FIFA World Player of the Year vote. Smith turned 34 earlier this season but has still repeatedly been the difference for an Arsenal side hardly short of talent. When she limped off after little over 30 minutes of last week&apos;s Champions League quarterfinal first leg against the Italian side ASD Torres, she was not the only one glowering. Smith had in that spell been Arsenal&apos;s key player, and they were leading thanks to an instinctive flick with the outside of her left boot. When Smith was a child, shifted from one team to another as boys grew tired of being outclassed by this girl, she would play keep-uppy endlessly, practice controlling a dropping ball, and dribble around cones laid out in the back garden. &quot;I would practice with a golf ball as well, because it was a lot smaller, and working with it improved my touch.&quot; Every week she would record Match of the Day so that she could add new moves to her repertoire. Yet there is evidently something innate about what she does. &quot;Left-footed players just seem to have a little bit more spark, a little bit more magic,&quot; says Powell. Smith is good with both feet, but there is something about the sweep of her left boot that has even the most vigilant journalists typing c-u-l-t-u-r- before they&apos;ve realised it. &quot;I think she was blessed with natural talent,&quot; Powell adds. &quot;That&apos;s not to say that she doesn&apos;t work, because she trains hard, not just on technique but on the physiological side of her game, which then allows her to do things a lot easier. Quite often it appears that the ball is stuck to her foot, she&apos;s able to manipulate the ball at ease and at pace. She&apos;s as quick running with the ball as without it.&quot; As she has got older and had more injuries to manage, Smith hasn&apos;t just been a striker to dread but has become more of a pivot. &quot;She brings other players into the game more now. Passing is a big part of her game, and with that left foot, she executes it very well. If you ask defenders in our league which player they least like to play against, it probably is Kelly.&quot; GT 5) Monica Seles &quot;It&apos;s the way I first picked up the racquet, so I stayed with it.&quot; As Seles began collecting title after title \u2013 eight Slams by the time she turned 19 \u2013 she was often asked about her curious grip. It wasn&apos;t just that she hit all of her groundstrokes two-handed (there are examples going back to the 1940s, and not so long ago the American Gene Mayer had done the same), but also that despite being left-handed, she always played with her right hand on top. Up close in stills the forehand looked awkward and uncomfortable, her right wrist crooked around the grip, compromising her reach and any chance to ponder on the ball \u2013 instead she would hit the ball on the rise, thwacking it back across the net earlier than opponents liked. &quot;She goes more for the big shots,&quot; her brother Zoltan said in those early years. &quot;She doesn&apos;t have any choice.&quot; It is true that Seles was the first of the power-game women; she considers herself the first to play &quot;aggressive tennis&quot;, winning matches from the baseline by putting her body weight through the ball. Watching back the tapes from the early 1990s, Seles said: &quot;I was one-dimensional, but I had this focus, this drive.&quot; She was fearsome all right: after 15 minutes&apos; practice with a 12-year-old Seles at the Bollettieri Academy, Jim Courier walked off court having failed to return the ball, and Martina Navratilova described their meeting at the 1990 Italian Open as &quot;like being run over by a truck&quot;. It was arguably that relentlessness that was missing when Seles returned to the tour after being stabbed. Yet the argument undersells a player who would surely have shaped a decade of women&apos;s tennis but for the intervention of Gunter Parche. The power and the depth of her shots unsettled her opponents but the angles that she could find - on both sides - were superb, and she was a better strategist than the grunting, big-hitting caricature allows. At the French Open final in 1990, her first Grand Slam title, Seles all but laughed in the face of Steffi Graf&apos;s slice backhands. Two years later, as the third set drained both women, Seles decided at 40-30 \u2013 Championship point \u2013 to send the ball repeatedly to Graf&apos;s backhand; on the third occasion Graf ran around it to play a forehand, as much to say &quot;Ha!&quot; as to return the ball, and put it straight into the net. GT 6) William Thompson Unless you happen to be David Warner, being a lefty is a compulsion, not a choice \u2013 and, Ned Flanders might argue, a way of life. But in combat sports, things are very different. Traditionally, fighters use their weaker hand to clear the way for the power shot behind it, but a significant number of righties box in southpaw stance. Some just prefer it, while others want their stronger hand as near their opponent as possible - and in MMA, a southpaw stance might suit their kicking or takedown game. But what&apos;s for sure is that it&apos;s generally a helpful technique in a ruck, acknowledged as such at least since Ehud dispatched Eglon King of Moab. The technical stuff is, of course, very interesting, the formula for a goodly number of the broken phizogs and battered brains that give us so much pleasure - but have you ever heard of William Thompson? Born in Nottingham in 1811, Thompson was the third of triplet boys, and went by his middle name, Abednego, to fit in with brothers Shadrach and Meshach, named after Daniel&apos;s biblical companions. The youngest of 21 children, following the death of his father Thompson and his mother were sent to the workhouse, until he left to sell oysters on the street, vowing never to return. When this didn&apos;t work out, he became an iron turner, and by the age of 18 was the proud owner of what folk nowadays are wont to call biceps, triceps, lats and obliques \u2013 and which helped him win a bet, when he successfully luzzed a half-brick across the Trent. But there was a time when men did not fritter lives lifting heaviness simply to feel good about themselves poncing in front of the mirror, and with bare-knuckle boxing at the zenith of its popularity, he became a prize fighter. Standing only 5&quot;10, he befuddled many a lumbering windmiller with his phenomenal strength and agility, earning the nickname Bendy Abednego - later portmanteaud to Bendigo. But it was his nature as showman that endeared him to the fancy. Like Muhammad Ali and Nick Diaz after him, he would taunt his opponents during competition with rhymes and tales about them, their wives and their mothers, accompanied by a variety of faces and gurns. Soon, his bouts were attracting crowds in excess of 10,000 people. The only rules for such scraps had been drawn up in 1743, and were not extensive. A round was of indeterminate length, ending when a fighter was knocked or thrown down. After that, he was given thirty seconds to reach a marker at the centre of the ring known as the &quot;scratch&quot; \u2013 and if he could not come up to it, the fight was over. If a man &quot;fell without taking a blow,&quot; he was instantly disqualified, though Bendigo was considered a master at manipulating the reality. In a career of 21 fights, he lost only once, to Benjamin Caunt in 1838, - a man who outweighed him by more than 40 pounds. The fight was called after Bendigo appeared to fall without taking a shot, and a writer commented that he was &quot;as deadly and as poisonous as a rattlesnake with about the same ethics.&quot; But a year later, he was on the right side of a disqualification, winning the English championship by beating James &quot;Deaf&quot; Burke, whom he provoked into a headbutt. Though he subsequently retired, like many others he was unable to remain so, returning for a second tussle with Caunt, which he won in a mere 75 rounds. Because fistfighting was considered to be a breach of the peace, Bendigo was regularly arrested after competing, and even in retirement, was imprisoned for brawling and drinking. Eventually, he was touched by one of the many chaplain&apos;s sermons through which he sat, experiencing a religious epiphany and becoming a Methodist evangelist. He would assume his boxer&apos;s stance, point to his trophies and proclaim: &quot;See them belts, see them cups, I used to fight for those. But now I fight for Christ.&quot; Bendigo died in August 1880, aged 69. In 1891, the city of Nottingham dedicated a graveside memorial, inscribed &quot;In life always brave, fighting like a lion, in death like a lamb, tranquil in Zion&quot;, and Victoria, south-east Australia, there is a city named in his honour. He was inducted into Ring magazine&apos;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 1955, and remains one of the doublest hard bastards ever to bestride the earth. And he had nice muscles too.

But she isn&apos;t smiling. The 48-year-old fisherwoman, who lives in Xinfeng, a sleepy country village, recalls splashing about in the river as a child on sticky summer days. Today it is inky black, covered in a slick of lime green algae, and it smells like a blocked drain. &quot;Look at the water, who would dare to jump in?&quot; says Wu. At her feet a dead piglet bobs on the river&apos;s surface, bouncing against the shore. This area of Zhejiang province, 60 miles from Shanghai, has become the subject of public and media scrutiny after more than 16,000 dead pigs were found in tributaries of the city&apos;s river, the Huangpu, a source of tapwater. As clean-up efforts wind down, mystery surrounds the cause of the pigs&apos; demise and their appearance in the river. As public concerns about water safety grow, what has emerged is a picture of a rural region marred by catastrophic environmental damage, inherent malpractice and a black market meat trade. The first pigs were spotted on 7 March and were soon traced to Jiaxing through tags in their ears. Early tests show they carry porcine circovirus, a common disease among hogs not known to be infectious to humans. Shanghai&apos;s municipal water department maintains that the water meets the national standard, but hasn&apos;t said much more. Official opacity has only embittered a public who are increasingly vocal about environmental gripes. &quot;A sluggish response, a lack of disclosure of official data and muddled information has done nothing to quell our doubts,&quot; says Weibo (a microblog) user diamondyangxiaowu. &quot;In this environmental crisis China&apos;s rivers are facing, there&apos;s no time to dally.&quot; For Mrs Wu and her community it may be too late. Over the last decade she has witnessed the near collapse of her livelihood as pig farming in this region has prospered. Her house, a one-story breezeblock box, sits next to Jiapingtang river. Ten wooden flat-bottomed boats with makeshift roofs of plastic and tarpaulin are tethered to the quay. It is on these boats that Wu and her fellow villagers head out on to Jiaxing&apos;s network of waterways, though these days they are more likely to do clear-up work for local authorities than fish. A fisherman doing cleaning work from 7am-5pm seven days a week can earn up to 10,000 yuan (\u00a31,000) a year, with an extra 150 yuan (\u00a310.50) a day for carcasses. &quot;A decade ago this village was prosperous and we lived a comfortable life,&quot; says Wu. She is dressed in a leopard-print padded jacket and black wellington boots \u2013 her work gear. &quot;We paid for our houses by ourselves, sent our children to good schools and supported the elderly. Now things are a mess.&quot; The pig industry blossomed in Jiaxing in the 1980s. Last year China produced and consumed half the world&apos;s pork, about 50m tonnes. One village, Zhulin, which is at the centre of the scandal, earned the nickname &quot;to Hong Kong&quot; for its steady supply of meat to the territory. Most families in Zhulin keep pigs; the village&apos;s ample fields, which in March are covered in yellow rapeseed flowers, yield hundreds of squat concrete barns holding dozens of squealing hogs. This upsurge is one explanation for the carcasses, though officials are reluctant to say so. &quot;We have seven dead pig processing plants. Each is 100 cubic metres large and can gather thousands of dead pigs,&quot; says Chen Yuanhua, party secretary for Zhulin. According to a 2011 report by Zhejiang province&apos;s environmental protection bureau, 7.7m pigs are raised in Jiaxing. With a mortality rate of 2-4%, up to 300,000 carcasses need to be disposed of each year. &quot;We have some difficulties with the growing number of pig farms and a lack of funding and land to build more plants,&quot; Chen says. He concedes that some farmers throw dead pigs into the rivers &quot;for convenience&quot;. There could be another, murkier reason behind the pig manifestation. On 23 March, state-run China Central Television (CCTV) exposed how illegally processed pigs have been making their way into markets for years. While farmers are required by law to send animals that die of disease or natural causes to processing pits, black market dealers intercept the chain, butchering the hogs to sell as pork. Last November a Jiaxing court sentenced three such butchers to life in prison. The offenders had processed 77,000 carcasses, making almost 9m yuan (\u00a31m) profit. Because of the crackdown, black market traders have stopped buying the dead stock and farmers have resorted to dumping. Pan Huimin, a Zhulin resident who is in custody on suspicion of dealing in dead pigs told CCTV there was &quot;a 100%&quot; correlation between his arrest and the dead pigs incident. News of this illicit meat trade doesn&apos;t faze the residents of the Jingxiang fishing commune, a few miles from Zhulin. The trade is considered not ideal, but normal. Inside the common room, bare lightbulbs illuminate a poster of Mao Zedong on the wall, as a group of elderly residents play mahjong in the corner. There used to be 250 fishermen here, but because of the rampant pollution the 60 left mainly clean rivers. One resident, Mr Li, says his community has been complaining since 2003. &quot;Things changed in the early 2000s when more pig farms turned up and their waste water, manure and carcasses poured into the river,&quot; he says. &quot;Though we&apos;ve been petitioning for years, rather than an improvement the situation has deteriorated. The local government&apos;s slow responses always pass the buck.&quot; Such negligence exacerbates the serious water quality issues China faces. Greenpeace East Asia estimates that 320m people in the country are without access to clean drinking water. A 2011 study by the ministry of environmental protection found that of 118 cities, 64 had &quot;seriously contaminated&quot; groundwater supplies. Yang Hanchun, of the Chinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, says China has comprehensive laws for the protection of the environment against animal husbandry, but authorities often fail to uphold them. Protests quashed Over the weeks since the discovery of 16,000 pig carcasses in Shanghai&apos;s water supply, authorities have consistently worked to quell public outcry, reiterating that drinking water is safe. While there have been reports and discussion of the incident in state media and on the country&apos;s rollicking microblog network, which is curtailed by censors, attempts to organise protests have been swiftly quashed. Pan Ting, an outspoken Shanghainese poet, was detained for questioning by police after she posted a call for a mass walk along the Huangpu, the city&apos;s central river, on her Sina Weibo account. The post, which went out to her 50,000 followers on 14 March, called for a &quot;pure stroll&quot; without banners or slogans. Soon afterwards she was asked to &quot;drink tea&quot; with the police \u2013 an idiom used to describe interrogations. On her other Weibo account she later posted: &quot;I feel very disappointed. You even shut out a voice concerned about local pollution and your own lives. I will see how long you will shut me out. At least uncle tea said to me: I understand where you are coming from.&quot; As news about Pan&apos;s detention spread through Weibo, prominent users voiced support. &quot;Just because a young woman said a few honest words about the dead pig issue, she was detained, banned and forced to hand in all of her communication devices,&quot; said Li Minsheng, a well-known writer. &quot;She was even &apos;missing&apos; for three hours! Her only request was: &apos;Please do not come ring my doorbell early in the morning or in the middle of the night to scare my mum.&apos; As a big city that has hosted the World Expo, why can&apos;t Shanghai tolerate a poet? What law has Pan Ting violated?

Murray, who will move above Roger Federer to No2 in the world rankings if he wins the tournament, recovered from losing the first set in a tie-break to triumph 6-7, 6-1, 6-2 against the Frenchman and will renew his rivalry with the Spaniard Ferrer, who produced a similar performance to win the earlier semi-final against Germany&apos;s Tommy Haas. Murray leads Ferrer 6-5 in their head-to-head and the pair traded quarter-final grand slam victories last year, with Ferrer triumphing in the last eight of the French Open in Paris and Murray gaining revenge the following month at Wimbledon.

Murray had won his previous four meetings with Gasquet but the world No10 surprised him in the opening set, breaking Murray in his first service game and racing into a 3-0 lead. The British No1 recovered and looked ready to take the set when serving at 5-4 but a poor game was compounded by a double fault that allowed Gasquet to break back and the Frenchman then took the tie-break 7-3. However, Murray was more focused in the second set, reeling off five successive games to win it 6-1, and then in the decider he broke in the third game and produced some magnificent winners against a tiring Gasquet to win in just under two hours.

Five Super Lig titles, two domestic cups and one Uefa Cup have been won during three separate spells as manager, but now the &apos;Grande&apos; of Turkish football turns his attention towards a bout with another of Europe&apos;s heavyweight managers. Loved by Galatasaray but loathed by Fenerbahce, their great rivals from across the Bosphorus, Terim is preparing for a Champions League quarter-final with Real Madrid and, significantly, a meeting with his old friend Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. &quot;I&apos;ve known Jos\u00e9 for many years,&quot; Terim says. &quot;He&apos;s not your typical coach, he&apos;s different. We have always enjoyed a good friendship and the game between us will not change that.&quot; This season is the first since 2001 that Galatasaray have qualified for the last eight in the Champions League. When Terim, who has previously managed Milan, Fiorentina and Turkey, rejoined the club in 2011 they were languishing in eighth place and Fenerbahce were overwhelming favourites to secure a successive title. However, eight back-to-back league wins over winter turned the season in Galatasaray&apos;s favour and they eventually secured the Super Lig by an impressive nine-point margin. It had been four years since their previous title and Terim is now determined to transform them into the dominant and formidable force of old, feared across the continent. &quot;When I took over here Galatasaray were in eighth place, but everyone at the club, the technical staff, the administrative staff and our board worked together well to become champions,&quot; he says. &quot;At the beginning of this season we won the Super Cup and we are doing well in the league and Champions League. Good things don&apos;t happen by accident \u2013 we are a family, believe in one thing and are all united. It is easy when you are a family. &quot;We are adapting all the time and are very happy to be in the quarter-finals, but our work is to be here all the time. Nobody can be champions every year, but to be in the Champions League consistently, that&apos;s what we want. Our aim is to be one of the biggest clubs in the world \u2013 permanently. It is steady progress. Consistency is the problem, but we have the capability, experience and courage to do it.&quot; Teams travelling to Istanbul are rarely treated to a warm welcome. Madrid will hope to win their first-leg match at the Bernab\u00e9u on Wednesday and not be reliant on victory in the hostile Turk Telekom Arena during the return fixture. It has been Galatasaray&apos;s new home since January 2011, when they relocated from the cauldron of Ali Sami Yen, and they have since added world-class talent to their squad to signify a new era. Didier Drogba signed a one-and-a-half-year contract in January after his short and unfortunate spell at Shanghai Shenhua, while Wesley Sneijder agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal in the same month. &quot;In China Drogba didn&apos;t play for two months, then he joined up with the national team and then he came to us when we were already in the middle of two competitions,&quot; Terim says. &quot;He is getting better and better physically each day. When he first arrived he wasn&apos;t at that level, but now he is improving. &quot;He has incredible character and he is willing to work. He wants to be part of the team, he is focused and gives 100% during training and the games. There is no need to talk about his ability. He is a big brother to all of the young players \u2013 leadership suits him really well because it is coming naturally from inside him.&quot; With dynamic players such as Hamit Altintop and Burak Yilmaz already making a significant impact Terim believes Galatasaray have the ability to take the game to Real Madrid and do what Manchester United could not. Drogba may be the star name for Galatasaray but in Yilmaz they boast the top scorer in the Champions League this season and a striker who has been linked with some of the biggest clubs in Europe, despite only signing from Trabzonspor last summer. &quot;He listens, he is 27 but he is still open to learning new things. Burak senses goals; he can score any time and from anywhere. I&apos;m really fond of him; he has been a miracle signing,&quot; Terim says. &quot;Andriy Shevchenko was the same. If you substituted him in the 89th minute he would be angry; Burak is the same. He is always thinking about scoring one more goal. Loving football is very important. I think he is going to get better and better. &quot;It&apos;s not going to be easy to keep him. He has targets but it will be his decision; being wanted is a good thing, but we are fond of him and believe he will do great things for us in the future.&quot; Terim was impressed with United&apos;s display against Madrid, especially at Old Trafford, but described the Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir as &quot;very successful \u2013 we respect and trust him&quot;, despite the controversial red card he gave to Nani that changed the complexion of that tie. There will be no special attention for Cristiano Ronaldo, instead Terim wants his side to ignore the occasion and play their own game. &quot;United played very well, but sometimes that is not enough against Real Madrid,&quot; he says. &quot;We don&apos;t need to describe Real Madrid, everyone knows they are a very good team, known across the world, and they eliminated Manchester United. But we are also a good team, with good players. We respect them, but we have confidence for the game. &quot;Ronaldo is one of the best players in the world at the moment. He can do everything, but we can&apos;t just approach Madrid as if they have only one good player. They are playing as a team and have [Mesut] Ozil, [Sergio] Ramos and Angel di Mar\u00eda. We don&apos;t change our plans for Ronaldo. We want to play football; if we lose the game it does not matter as long as we play.&quot; For the Emperor, this could just be the beginning of yet another Galatasaray era\u00a0to savour. &quot;The supporters gave me that nickname of the Emperor,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s nice to accept it.

His arrival in Istanbul, along with the former Internazionale midfielder Wesley Sneijder, has added sparkle to Galatasaray&apos;s side and their manager, Fatih Terim, said last week that Drogba has been a &quot;big brother&quot; to the younger players in the squad. The Ivorian has faced Mourinho before, when Chelsea played Internazionale in the Champions League in 2010, but this time the striker admits it will mean more due to the connections with his former club. &quot;It&apos;s going to be different because I play against Jos\u00e9, who is ex-Chelsea, Michael [Essien], who is ex-Chelsea, and Ricardo Carvalho, who is ex-Chelsea,&quot; Drogba said. &quot;It&apos;s going to be nice to see the Chelsea boys in this quarter-final but I would love togo through.&quot;", "tags": ["Didier Drogba", "Football", "Chelsea", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-02T22:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/02/didier-drogba-jose-mourinho-chelsea", "sentences": ["When you do things like that, it really gives me one more reason: &apos;I only see you and I have to win.&apos; It had the opposite effect.&quot; A new chapter has begun for Drogba at Galatasaray after an unfortunate period at Shanghai Shenhua, who are still pursuing Fifa over an alleged breach of contract by the 35-year-old, something he strongly denies."], "title": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will always be special to me, says Didier Drogba", "article": "Emotionally it was difficult for me,&quot; says Didier Drogba when asked about Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s departure from Chelsea, almost six years ago. &quot;I did not understand. My reaction was I want to go; he has left, I want to go, everything is finished. I was in this mood. But then I was still under contract and I always said that as long as I was wearing the Chelsea shirt I will always give my best, no matter what. I will always give my best. For two weeks it was very difficult.&quot; Drogba casts his mind back to that turbulent period at Stamford Bridge when Roman Abramovich lost patience with a manager who had secured five major trophies for Chelsea and was still adored by the supporters. &quot;All the players who were there at that time, we still have that winning mentality. It is something you do not lose,&quot; he says. &quot;It was unique, in a way, but it is like when you learn how to ride a bike, even if you do not do it for years, when you find a new bike, you don&apos;t forget. That&apos;s why Jos\u00e9 needs to come back.&quot; Drogba has a new life in Istanbul with Galatasaray but when discussing Chelsea it is clear that the intimate bond formed during eight hugely successful years will never die. There remains a burning passion, love almost, 10 months after scoring the most crucial goal in the club&apos;s history to secure a first European Cup. It was the perfect way to end a spell during which he became intrinsically associated with Stamford Bridge. Even now when watching Chelsea play it somehow feels strange not see Drogba leading the line, battering seasoned defenders to the ground and rifling in goal after goal to the delight of the Shed End. On Wednesday at the Bernab\u00e9u he will be reunited with Mourinho, as Fatih Terim&apos;s side try to upset Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Drogba&apos;s relationship with the Portuguese is beyond one normally shared between a manager and player. Mourinho recently described the striker as &quot;out of this world&quot; and said that, of all the people he has worked with, the Ivorian would top his list. &quot;People say Mourinho liked me, I was his son. But in fact, if I was not performing, then I did not play,&quot; Drogba says. &quot;That is the good thing with him. Even if he likes you outside football, if you do not perform on the pitch, you do not play. That is really what is his signature. You have to perform, you have to be the best. It is only business. I think we have a good understanding, we don&apos;t have to talk every day to know what we think about each other. After the draw I text him and have seen him at one game since, that&apos;s it.&quot; Mourinho is renowned for the loyalty and affinity he shares with players. Tears were shed with Marco Materazzi during an emotional arrivederci at Internazionale and Drogba believes these relationships are required to build a winning mentality. &quot;We call him daddy. I don&apos;t know about all of us but he did a lot of things for me during that moment where I had a lot of critics. He was supporting me and helping me. He signed me for Chelsea and did everything. &quot;He knows how to win and how to create the mentality. For example, when Barcelona were dominating the Spanish league and all the cl\u00e1sicos against Real Madrid, he lost 5-0 at the Camp Nou but he knew that one day they would take over and he would change it, and that&apos;s what is happening now. I think Barcelona now are unplayable so for him to win the league last year was something great, unbelievable I think. &quot;He knows how to create this winning mentality. During a game a player could score two goals but he will go to one midfielder or one central defender and say, &apos;For me, you were man of the match.&apos; You know if you scored two goals that you had a good performance but to score those goals somebody had to work behind for you not to concede.&quot; There were many amusing and controversial moments during an incident-filled tenure. Allegedly ducking a Uefa ban by clandestinely burying himself in a laundry basket in 2005 (&quot;did that happen? I don&apos;t remember,&quot; says Drogba with a smile), the infamous &quot;Special One&quot; declaration, throwing his Premier League medal into the crowd \u2013 the list goes on. &quot;We laugh, we laugh because we know managing is his passion and he likes to play with the media as well. It&apos;s just football and a way for him to have fun. But at the same time when he goes back to his team he says, &apos;Now, we have to do this, this and this to win. We win this game and we are champions.&apos; He gives you the boost in confidence and you go for it. Asked if Mourinho was any good with the ball at his feet in training, Drogba laughs before adding: &quot;During the circle he would come to try to impress but, you know, no!&quot; Since Mourinho departed in 2007 Chelsea have had seven managers. Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guus Hiddink, Carlo Ancelotti, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas and Roberto Di Matteo have all held the post and, with the exception of Hiddink, all have been sacked by Abramovich. Drogba is still close with the Russian oligarch but is perplexed at why Frank Lampard has not been offered a new contract and admits it is difficult to observe Chelsea struggling this season. &quot;When we speak about important players who have made history for a club, I think of Ryan Giggs at Man United or [Paolo] Maldini at Milan. Of course there will be new players, young talents to keep improving the club but players like John [Terry] and Frank should stay at the club to give this passion, to share this passion for the club and the mentality to these young players. For me they should stay. What Frank is doing now is unbelievable. To be two goals from being the best-ever scorer is remarkable. He has to stay. &quot;They have played so many games, they can be tired and you cannot go against this. Also, there is a change. Some players left \u2013 me, [Jos\u00e9] Bosingwa, [Florent] Malouda is not playing \u2026 [Raul] Meireles, Kalou. These were important players for the team as well. They brought a lot of new, young players who do not know the league, who need to adapt. There will be ups and downs next season but they will fight again for the title.&quot; On the reign of Villas-Boas Drogba adds: &quot;He came with his ideas and it was difficult for him to adapt to the situation. Sometimes you come with your ideas and stick to it but when he came he could have handled the situation differently. He is still a good friend. I have known him for nine years. It was really sad that he left but what he is doing now with Tottenham we can see that he is a great manager.&quot; However, there is no such admiration for Rafael Ben\u00edtez, who was appointed on an interim basis in November and has received hostility from the Chelsea fans ever since. &quot;Yes [I was surprised]. I went to see a game at Stamford Bridge and the fans were not so happy with him coming as manager. It must be tough to manage a team in these conditions. With the history he had with the club, I can understand the fans a little bit,&quot; says Drogba, who was criticised as a diver by Ben\u00edtez during the Spaniard&apos;s time as the Liverpool manager. &quot;Yes, it was before a Champions League semi-final. You know, that is football. I celebrated right in front of him. That is part also of the game. It was more like a mental game and he was playing. It was a mistake. When you do things like that, it really gives me one more reason: &apos;I only see you and I have to win.&apos; It had the opposite effect.&quot; A new chapter has begun for Drogba at Galatasaray after an unfortunate period at Shanghai Shenhua, who are still pursuing Fifa over an alleged breach of contract by the 35-year-old, something he strongly denies. He insists he has &quot;no regrets&quot; about the move to China and although it was a &quot;risk&quot; to join the Turkish league he has been impressed by the standard of football. &quot;Believe me, you have to see what we are doing in the Champions League, against Schalke [whom Galatasaray beat in the previous round]. The league is good, the league is competitive and we are improving because I think more quality players are going to come here. Maybe I&apos;m lucky. As long as I have the passion \u2013 that&apos;s what drives me, the passion. As long as I have this, I will always try to compete for the best.&quot; As for Drogba, Chelsea and Mourinho, one feels the sun has yet to set on this unique triangle. &quot;I think the club is more important than us,&quot; Drogba says. &quot;I think it goes together, we share these things. We both love Chelsea.&quot;", "tags": ["Didier Drogba", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Galatasaray", "Chelsea", "Real Madrid", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport", "Champions League 2012-13"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-02T22:04:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/03/make-work-pay-poor-law", "sentences": ["The genius of future companies is up in the bedroom (pronounced bejjum) at the moment, contacting like minds in Shanghai or Seattle.Max and Felicity HebditchTaunton, Somerset"], "title": "Letters: Make-work-pay economics and poor-law politics", "article": "Your editorial (2 April) on the coalition&apos;s squeeze on the welfare budget lacks a conclusion. Alongside your criticisms of coalition policy, you ought to be arguing for a positive alternative: which, following the logic of your argument, is clearly for a larger state, with a higher proportion of national income passing through the state, which must continue to rise further as our population ages. This was, after all, the logic of the position that the Labour government adopted after 2001, when it allowed spending on welfare to rise more rapidly than national income. Labour&apos;s failure to raise taxes to match this rise in spending led to successive fiscal deficits from 2002 onwards \u2013 even while the economy was booming \u2013 thus leaving to the coalition government the overhang of debt that it has been struggling to reduce.\u00a0 Labour&apos;s platform for the next election must therefore include substantial rises in taxation, across the board. Ed Balls&apos;s repeated suggestions that somehow enough can be raised from the top 1% alone, without affecting &quot;the squeezed middle&quot;, is not credible. In any event, the coalition government has done more to close tax loopholes and bring the richest back within the tax system than Labour did in the years before 2010. If a returning Labour government also commits itself to a like-for-like replacement for the UK nuclear deterrent, as many leading Labour politicians are urging, that will further add to the necessity for higher taxation. There are some very hard spending choices here, which the Guardian appears happy to allow the Labour party to evade.William WallaceLib Dem, House of Lords \u2022 In claiming that he\u00a0will &quot;make work pay&quot; (Osborne: we will make work pay, 2 April) George Osborne may think he has discovered an important new principle of social policy. In fact he is merely echoing in modern words the Poor Law report of 1834, which led to the setting up of the workhouses. A central principle of the report was that of &quot;less eligibility&quot;, meaning that those supported by the state should be kept in a condition more miserable than that of the lowest-paid labourer. After 180 years\u00a0it appears that social policy has come full circle.Geoffrey RenshawDepartment of economics, University\u00a0of\u00a0Warwick \u2022 John Harris sounds reasonably even-handed (We have to talk about why some people do want cuts, 1 April) though the figures he quotes should mean the article&apos;s heading ought to say &quot;why most people\u2026&quot;. But, like most people on the left, he cannot accept the validity of this view or that it is arrived at freely, rather than being the result of ordinary people being manipulated by the right and holding opinions based on &quot;wildly inaccurate views&quot;. Until the left accept that those they patronise as hard-working families who are, in many cases, able to judge from their day-to-day experience that the benefit system is not working and that significant changes are needed, the situation he laments will continue.Mike ShepherdBridport, Dorset  \u2022 Pity the poor workers on the receiving end of the coalition&apos;s new schemes to penalise them for not working enough hours (Poor could be told: earn more or lose tax credit, 3 April). At a time when jobs are either scarce or part-time and some exist only because employers want to hold on to them on a &quot;just in case things improve basis&quot; or offer only zero-hours contracts (Report, 3 April), the thought that employees are in any position to ask for more hours is\u00a0ludicrous.The government&apos;s policies are becoming more like the goading of medieval bear-baiting than fairness. Gillian DalleyLondon \u2022 The current debate about the bedroom tax touches on a wider malaise. Because renting or buying a home is so incredibly expensive as a proportion of one&apos;s income (spending 40% is not uncommon), once people get into social housing many tend to hang on to it at all costs. Ditto with transport to and from work; rising petrol prices and the astronomical costs of public transport deter many people from taking work outside their local area. This leads to the situation where many people would rather struggle on paltry benefits than struggle on paltry wages. The costs of accessing the infrastructure necessary for work need to be addressed, as the implications of people opting out of the working world are cause for concern.Karl ChadsLondon \u2022 The paradox of the coalition government&apos;s claim that it will make work pay is that for a substantial section of the labour force it is locking in place a system which ensures that work may never pay. More and more workers will not be paid what they are truly worth, but will have to depend on means-tested wage top-ups or credits.Government policy perpetuates and encourages the development of a systemically unequal labour market in which many of those who aspire to decent work must compete for under-paid and precarious jobs. George Osborne&apos;s idea of &quot;fairness&quot; is that taxpayers should subsidise the exploitation of hard-working people by low-paying employers. Why not make the employers pay and use taxes to pay down the deficit?Professor Hartley DeanLondon School of Economics \u2022 One aspect of the changes to welfare is the way that the government is making it harder for people to claim benefits. The introduction of universal credit is being combined with the requirement for all benefit claims to be made online. Many people who claim benefits do not use the internet. At the same time, access to the internet is being cut as councils are forced to close libraries. This double-whammy is a part of the long list of ways in which those in most need of help are being forced to pay for the mistakes made by some of the wealthiest. Many people will simply not be able to claim.Bill Esterson MPLab, Sefton Central \u2022 Governments should be giving grants to bedrooms, not axing them.

Since Chinese media reported late last month that avian flu virus H7N9 had killed two men in Shanghai, additional reports of the disease have emerged in eastern Anhui and Jiangsu provinces and the metropolis Hangzhou, triggering fears of an incipient pandemic. Three people have been killed by the virus. The remaining six are in critical condition. The World Health Organization (WHO), which is monitoring the cases in cooperation with Chinese authorities, said the strain was not transmittable from human to human. China&apos;s state newswire Xinhua reported that almost 200 people who came into contact with infected patients had tested negative for the virus. Among four people to contract the disease in Jiangsu province, only one of them \u2013 a 45 year-old poultry butcher \u2013 has had long-term exposure to fowl, state media reported on Tuesday. One infected man in Hangzhou has died of the disease, China&apos;s state broadcaster CCTV announced via its official microblog on Wednesday afternoon. The other, a 67-year-old retiree, is in critical condition. Two people in Shanghai died of the disease last month, according to Xinhua: an 87-year-old surnamed Li and 27 year-old pork butcher Wu Liangliang. The former&apos;s two sons, aged 69 and 55, were admitted to hospital with flu-like symptoms over a 10-day span in mid-February, according to the Shanghai Daily newspaper. Both have tested negative for avian flu. &quot;He was a perfectly healthy man who walked into hospital unaided and came out a dead body,&quot; said Wu&apos;s uncle, also surnamed Wu. Though Wu died on 10 March, for 20 days afterwards his family understood the cause was pneumonia until they saw the news on television. &quot;We were not notified about the bird flu virus from the start to the finish, and didn&apos;t understand how a small cold could be fatal,&quot; said the uncle, who declined to give his full name when he was interviewed by the Guardian at Shanghai&apos;s Jingchuan vegetable market. According to the uncle, Wu caught a cold in late February. After it persisted, he visited the Fifth People&apos;s hospital on 1 March, a 15-minute walk from the market and the site where another H7N9 fatality, 87-year-old Li, died on 4 March. Wu was put on a saline drip and returned home the same afternoon. When he didn&apos;t feel better the next day he repeated the action. Eventually, on 4 March he returned to the hospital and was diagnosed with a pulmonary infection, and was admitted to the hospital&apos;s respiratory department with pneumonia. &quot;The hospital just treated the disease as normal pneumonia, they didn&apos;t take it seriously enough&quot;, said Wu&apos;s uncle. Before the recent spat of cases, H7N9 was not deemed transmittable to humans and other animals. Its more virulent, long-circulating cousin H5N1 has killed 360 people worldwide since it decimated poultry farms across Asia in 2003. Public health authorities throughout eastern China have ordered hospitals, schools, nurseries and poultry farms to step up monitoring for flu-like symptoms. Vietnam has temporarily banned mainland poultry imports. Stock shares of Chinese poultry-meat producers have slumped on mainland markets. On Wednesday afternoon, &quot;bird flu&quot; and &quot;H7N9&quot; were trending topics on China&apos;s wildly popular microblogging platform Sina Weibo, with over 40,000 searches each. Some users suggested that the disease had spread to Beijing, causing one hospital in the capital to issue a denial. Others insinuated that bird flu may have been responsible for the deaths of thousands of pigs dredged from a Shanghai river last month. Shanghai authorities quickly rebuffed the claim, saying that 34 of the pig carcasses tested negative for H7N9. A man in Anhui using the handle Fen1234 castigated Shanghai&apos;s health authorities for taking significantly longer to announce the first avian flu diagnosis than to deny its connection with the dead pigs incident.&quot;You&apos;re completely unscrupulous when working to absolve yourselves of any crimes,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Yet when working to ensure the health of common people, for the sake of stability maintenance and political necessity ... you cover up whatever you can.&quot; The post has been forwarded over 5,000 times.", "tags": ["Bird flu", "China", "World Health Organisation", "World news", "Society", "Health", "Asia Pacific", "Social media", "Digital media", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-04T03:17:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/05/bird-flu-shanghai-poultry-market-cull", "sentences": ["Officials closed Shanghai&apos;s poultry market on Friday and slaughtered more than 20,000 birds as the death toll from a new outbreak of bird flu rose to six.", "Since last month, 14 cases of H7N9 infection have been reported in Shanghai and four eastern provinces, the first time the strain has been detected in humans.", "According to Xinhua, Shanghai&apos;s health authorities announced on Thursday night that someone who had close contact with one of the city&apos;s H7N9 victims was currently being treated for flu-like symptoms The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention announced it was developing a vaccine for the virus.", "Many users wondered why the Shanghai authorities waited weeks to announce the first two cases in March.", "Some cast doubts on the government&apos;s assertion that the virus had no connection to the thousands of dead pigs that were dredged from a Shanghai river last month."], "title": "Bird flu fears lead to Shanghai poultry market cull", "article": "Officials closed Shanghai&apos;s poultry market on Friday and slaughtered more than 20,000 birds as the death toll from a new outbreak of bird flu rose to six.

China&apos;s public health system has changed dramatically since 2003, when the Sars virus killed hundreds of people in southern China and the government hushed up news of its spread.

On Friday, H7N9 was the most-discussed topic on the social network Sina Weibo. Most threads concerned ways to prevent the disease but suspicions of a cover-up were also widely voiced.

Although the post was initially censored, health officials later confirmed the case. &quot;If there is anything that Sars has taught China and its government, it&apos;s that one cannot be too careful or too honest when it comes to deadly pandemics,&quot; the Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday. &quot;The last 10 years have taught the government a lot, but it is far from enough.&quot; Vietnam and Hong Kong have temporarily banned Chinese poultry imports, and airports in Japan have put up notices warning passengers from China to report any flu-like symptoms to medical professionals.", "tags": ["China", "Bird flu", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Society", "Health"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-06T13:39:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/09/avian-flu-chinese-vaccinate-birds", "sentences": ["Since last month, the virus has infected 24 people and killed seven of them; cases have been reported in Shanghai and throughout three eastern provinces.", "In Shanghai, authorities ordered the slaughter of at least 100,000 chickens, ducks and geese after a national laboratory found traces of the virus in two pigeons near one of the city&apos;s live poultry markets.", "&quot;Right now, pigeons in [Shanghai&apos;s] squares and public parks have all been caged,&quot; reported the China Sports Daily website."], "title": "Avian flu: Chinese pigeon fanciers vaccinate tens of thousands of birds", "article": "Pigeon fanciers in eastern China are caging, cleaning and vaccinating tens of thousands of the birds in an attempt to contain the spread of avian flu as the death toll from the disease continues to mount. &quot;We&apos;ve been cleaning a lot of cages,&quot; said a man from the Beijing Fengtai District Carrier Pigeon Association who gave his name as Mr Wang. He added that the Beijing government had required the association to cancel upcoming long-distance races and instruct members to keep their birds caged for at least a month. State media reported four new cases of H7N9 avian influenza on Monday, including one death. Since last month, the virus has infected 24 people and killed seven of them; cases have been reported in Shanghai and throughout three eastern provinces. The World Health Organisation said it had not yet found evidence that the virus could be transmitted from person to person. In Shanghai, authorities ordered the slaughter of at least 100,000 chickens, ducks and geese after a national laboratory found traces of the virus in two pigeons near one of the city&apos;s live poultry markets. Now the country&apos;s pigeons have become a focus for concerns over the spread of the disease. The Hangzhou Carrier Pigeon Association said it planned to suspend races and vaccinate up to 90,000 pigeons, according to state media. &quot;Right now, pigeons in [Shanghai&apos;s] squares and public parks have all been caged,&quot; reported the China Sports Daily website. Pigeon racing is a popular pastime in China dating back to the Ming Dynasty, which ended in 1644. Almost 300,000 people across the country participate in the sport. According to the news portal Zhejiang Online, a complaints hotline in the metropolis Hangzhou received a flurry of pigeon-related calls on Sunday, when local media reported that samples of pigeon feathers found at a local market had tested positive for the virus. Chinese researchers have identified the H7N9 virus as a &quot;genetic mix from South Korean migratory birds and ducks from Zhejiang province&quot;, the independent magazine Caixin reported on Tuesday. Chinese health authorities have not detected any flu-like symptoms in 621 people who have had close contact with infected patients, the director of China&apos;s National Health and Family Planning Commission, Liang Wannian, announced on Monday. The outbreak has had an effect on China&apos;s capital markets: shares of mainland poultry-meat producers have slumped since reports of the disease surfaced last week. Chinese airline and hotel stocks have also taken a hit, suggesting fears that the outbreak could affect the country&apos;s tourism industry.", "tags": ["China", "Bird flu", "Birds", "Asia Pacific", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Society", "Health", "World news", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-09T13:03:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/09/jerry-brown-ed-lee-china-trip", "sentences": ["He is due to open a state trade office in Shanghai."], "title": "San Francisco strengthens ties with China despite Washington suspicion", "article": "Tai Chi practitioners stretch in its parks. Restaurants offer copious soy sauce and ginger. An exhibition of terracotta warriors from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor, draws huge crowds. Downtown bristles with signs in Mandarin. The mayor, the son of migrants from Guangdong province, gushes about China&apos;s prosperity. Welcome to mainland America&apos;s biggest Asian city: San Francisco. The home of the Grateful Dead, the Golden Gate bridge and the 49ers is fast reacquiring an identity as China&apos;s portal to the United States. A burgeoning Chinese presence is transforming the city&apos;s demography, culture and economy, a trend observers expect to accelerate. &quot;China looks here and it sees opportunity,&quot; said Eugene Zhang, president of InnoSpring, Silicon Valley&apos;s first US-China technology start-up incubator. &quot;It&apos;s very, very attractive for investors. Things are stepping up.&quot; Beijing&apos;s political and business elite feted San Francisco&apos;s mayor, Ed Lee, the first Chinese-American mayor of a major US city, as a celebrity during his recent 10-day official tour of China. He touted his city as an opportunity to invest in real estate, information technology and other sectors while enjoying Chinese culture \u2013 as well as sunshine and vineyards \u2013 on US soil. Governor Jerry Brown will follow in Lee&apos;s footsteps this week bearing a similar message: all of California, not just San Francisco, welcomes Chinese investment, the more the better. &quot;We&apos;re going to facilitate billions of dollars of investments,&quot; Brown said last week. &quot;Not overnight, but over time.&quot;  The courtship contrasts with Washington suspicion towards China. Last year the House Intelligence Committee urged US firms to avoid partnering with Chinese telecom firms, to safeguard customer data, and the Obama administration stopped a Chinese company buying wind farms in Oregon on grounds of national security. California, on the other hand, can barely restrain its enthusiasm. Hollywood tweaked movies such as Red Dawn, 2012, Battleship and Iron Man 3, dropping Chinese villains or massaging plots to woo China&apos;s growing box office. Increasingly films are partly shot in China to circumvent a limit on foreign films. Brown will lobby Chinese investors to back California&apos;s $68bn bullet train, among other projects. He is due to open a state trade office in Shanghai. Since 2005 China&apos;s foreign investments have increased sixfold, reaching $77bn last year, according the China&apos;s commerce ministry. Some analysts expect the existing figure to triple by 2020, a huge kitty. California has so far reaped a relatively modest share, only $1.3bn in 2011 according to the Asia Society, but even that is already having an impact, most notably in and around San Francisco. Last year InnoSpring, a collaboration between Chinese banks, Tsinghua university and Silicon Valley firms, set up a 13,500 square-foot complex in Santa Clara to incubate technology and media startups. It now hosts more than 40 firms. &quot;It&apos;s a good start. We&apos;re happy with progress. The weather and the wine adds to the appeal of living here,&quot; Zhang said. A major Chinese biotech company has been mooted to take over the sprawling Bayer HealthCare campus in Richmond and the China Development Banks has agreed to bankroll ambitious building projects on Treasure Island and Hunters Point shipyard, the San Francisco Chronicle recently reported. &quot;The Chinese are most definitely coming.&quot;     The election of Ed Lee, the first Chinese-American mayor of a major US city, jolted Chinese interest in the city. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    &apos;The potential is 10 times greater than what we&apos;re seeing&apos; Chinese and Japanese immigrants flocked to the bay area two centuries ago in hope of gold and work, establishing thriving communities swollen in recent decades by Vietnamese, Thais and other Asians. The city&apos;s most recent census showed that whites, at 48%, no longer comprise a majority. The proportion of Asians has jumped to 33%. Among young people the proportion is nearly 40%. Demographers expect Asians to become the biggest ethnic group. &quot;Politically and culturally, the result is something of a rumbling mid-Richter scale earthquake,&quot; said an essay in Highbrow magazine. San Francisco Magazine caused a stir last year when it ran a cover story on Rose Pak, a legendary Chinatown activist, under the headline: &quot;Who Runs San Francisco?&quot; New arrivals are swelling Chinese clout and visibility, but they remain a small fraction of what may come, said Skip Whitney, who heads the China Services Group of the real estate broker Kidder Matthews. &quot;We&apos;re at the tipping point. The potential is 10 times greater than what we&apos;re seeing today. But we need to be patient.&quot; Cultural and language barriers were still damming the flood, said Whitney, who co-founded ChinaSF, a public-private initiative to strengthen business ties. Lee&apos;s election in 2011 had jolted Chinese interest in the city, he said. &quot;It&apos;s been huge. They are very pleased.&quot; The Asian Art museum, which opened in 1966 with the mission of making San Francisco America&apos;s bridge to China, is now growing into that role, said its director, Jay Xu. China has lent 10 terracotta warriors \u2013 the maximum it allows leave China \u2013 for an exhibition which has broken attendance records at the museum&apos;s new home opposite city hall. A Chinese American mayor and ubiquitous Chinese culture and cuisine reassured visitors from the Middle Kingdom, said Xu. &quot;Many think the US is very unsafe and filled with gun violence. When they come here and see other Chinese on the streets, it&apos;s a comfortable environment for them.&quot;", "tags": ["San Francisco", "China", "California", "Technology startups", "Film industry", "US news", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Business", "Chinese economy"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-09T15:40:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/apr/10/information-beautiful-who-can-catch-which-flu", "sentences": ["A new, deadly strain of &quot;bird flu&quot; - H7N9- has broken out in the Shanghai area of Eastern China."], "title": "Information is Beautiful: who can catch which flu?", "article": "H7N9?

The new season&apos;s double-header opened with Don and Megan on an all-expenses-paid holiday to Hawaii, but as it was more than seven minutes before Don said his first word and thereafter he remained in turn jowly, gnomic, laconic, morbid and drunk, while delivering a suicidal (literally) advertising pitch and having an affair with the wife of the only man he truly respects, it&apos;s fair to say his existential crisis is still alive and kicking. All that was missing was a smattering of Sartre. Elsewhere, it was business as usual in Mad Men world. Roger continues to be one of TV&apos;s great tragicomic creations as he gets more and more marginalised; Betty still has time for everyone but her own daughter; Peggy is successfully morphing into a mini-Don; and Pete is still an annoying little shit. Nothing to disturb the horses here. Only ... it did, at times, feel as if it was just going through the motions a bit. As if everyone involved knew they had their audience in their pocket and felt no need to raise their game. Mad Men may be cult TV in Britain but it&apos;s big-budget, mainstream television in the US. Not that you would always have known. The hippy squat looked like a cheap, not very artfully distressed cable TV set: something that might have been knocked up quickly by someone leafing through an old issue of Time devoted to &quot;Understanding the Hippy Lifestyle&quot;. Part of the pleasure of the early seasons of Mad Men lay in their attention to detail. Everything felt authentic to the period. Now that we&apos;ve reached the late 60s it feels more like a series that is replicating an era rather than living it. Ah well. It&apos;s a small quibble and Mad Men is still superior viewing. If you watched the first five series, you won&apos;t want to miss this: if you didn&apos;t, I&apos;m not sure there&apos;s enough here to make you want to go back and start from the beginning. Rather better than expected was Victoria Wood&apos;s Nice Cup of Tea (BBC1) which promised nothing more than a stroll through a few tea plantations, a nice river cruise or two, along with a few awkward mentions of Britain&apos;s proud colonial history of flogging opium to the Chinese. And that&apos;s pretty much what we got, but what raised it above the mundane was Wood herself. In many of these authored documentaries, the star wanders round like a zombie, as if unable to believe they&apos;re getting paid to go on holiday. Wood looked as if she, too, couldn&apos;t believe she was being given such a massive freebie: the difference being, she chose to work for her money. The first 10 minutes were spent discovering Shanghai has been invaded by Starbucks, and much of the rest was padded out with lengthy shots of tea bushes, tea musicals and tea museums. In someone else&apos;s hands, this would have been tedious. But Wood was delightfully subversive, talking to the camera as if she couldn&apos;t quite understand why she was being made to go up yet another hill to look at some tea plants that looked the same as all the others. She also had a lovely way of deflating all the nonsense the PRs spoke about tea&apos;s calming/energising/cleansing/spiritual properties with a quizzical look or a quick aside. &quot;It&apos;s a bit milky,&quot; she said at one point. &quot;I&apos;m sorry not to be more analytical.&quot; At another, she was in a cafe at a tea theme park in China, eating an egg that had been hard-boiled in Red Robe tea. &quot;I&apos;m living the dream,&quot; she observed. For a moment, I almost felt sorry for her. They probably get through a fair few cups of tea in 24 Hours in A&amp;E (Channel 4). I&apos;ve had a soft spot for the A&amp;E department at King&apos;s College hospital ever since it patched me up 30 years ago when I wound up with a pool cue in my eye, and I&apos;ve got more than a soft spot for this programme, as everything about what it means to be human \u2013 love, loss, kindness, hate, brilliance, stupidity \u2013 is here. It has to be said \u2013 as in my case \u2013 that the stupidity often lies only with those who are admitted. Not last night, though. The stupidity was restricted to the CCTV footage of the mugger who left Suzanne for dead in Herne Hill. Elsewhere, all was kindness and love. It even had a family feel for me, as the 90-year-old man who came in after a fall was a relation of an old friend of my sister. Suzanne survived, as did Frank. All it needs to make a great programme perfect is for someone to identify the mugger. \u2022 Watch this: TV highlights \u2022 Full TV listings", "tags": ["Mad Men", "Drama", "Historical drama", "US television", "Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-11T06:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/11/mark-webber-red-bull-future", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;m definitely keen to finish the season \u2013 a lot of people were questioning that, but that wasn&apos;t something on my mind,&quot; Webber said in Shanghai on Thursday."], "title": "Mark Webber says he will see out season with Red Bull", "article": "     Mark Webber has refused to commit to Red Bull beyond the end of the 2013 campaign, though he did say he would see out the rest of the current season. &quot;I&apos;m definitely keen to finish the season \u2013 a lot of people were questioning that, but that wasn&apos;t something on my mind,&quot; Webber said in Shanghai on Thursday.

According to Sky Sports News, Webber said of Vettel: &quot;Obviously the relationship has been strained and it&apos;s not the first time. At the moment we will just focus on our individual performances and go from there. &quot;I think the team did not do a bad job in Malaysia actually.

We&apos;ve proved the car is pretty competitive at the first two races, but nobody is dominant and we know we have work to do. We didn&apos;t have a car good enough to win in Australia but in Malaysia we certainly did.&quot; Vettel made it clear this week he would not apologise for his behaviour in Malaysia. &quot;I think there is not much to add than what happened,&quot; he said. &quot;I apologised to the team straight after for putting myself above the team, which I didn&apos;t mean to do.

Tarantino, Django Unchained&apos;s director, had already reined in the movie&apos;s gore for the Chinese market, retouching footage to tone down the colour and bloodshed. &quot;What we call bloodshed and violence is just a means of serving the purpose of the film, and these slight adjustments will not affect the basic quality of the film,&quot; the director of Sony Pictures&apos; China branch, Zhang Miao, told the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper. Django Unchained is Tarantino&apos;s first film to be released in China, where cultural authorities restrict the number of foreign films in cinemas each year. Despite the edits, Django Unchained was set to run for its full 165 minutes. In contrast, the Chinese release of Skyfall lost an entire scene in which James Bond kills a security guard in Shanghai. Meanwhile, censors reduced Cloud Atlas by nearly 40 minutes, primarily because of its graphic sex scenes.

Qiu Baoqin, of the National Poultry Industry Association, told AFP that H7N9 had been a &quot;devastating blow&quot;. There are 33 cases of H7N9 in Shanghai and its neighbouring provinces with nine fatalities. Microbiologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences attribute the strain to a mingling of viruses from migrating birds with those found in chickens, pigeons and ducks in the Yangtze river delta.

That is the outcome of last month&apos;s grand prix in Malaysia, when Vettel&apos;s alarming decision to disregard pitwall instructions by the team principal, Christian Horner, to remain behind Webber lobbed a large incendiary device into the most successful Formula One team of recent years. Horner, after insisting that he was still in charge, was then asked if the incident in Kuala Lumpur might happen again. He said: &quot;If they were in the same situation, exactlythe same would happen again because they would race each other. If those two guys are in a position to win in the final 10 laps of a grand prix, they are going to race each other. As far as orders in the future, we will let our drivers race. We will not impose team orders at the end of a race. However, we expect the drivers to act on theinformation they have from the team.&quot; He added: &quot;All we can do from a team point of view is [ensure] that they know what they risk. They don&apos;t want to take each other out because they need the points as much as the team does. They have the facts and if they don&apos;t deal with those facts, they are answerable. They both know that. They are not stupid.&quot; Horner also admitted that he knew exactly what Vettel was about to do in Malaysia. He said: &quot;I knew as soon as he left the pitlane on that final set of tyres the likelihood was that it would be difficult to control because of all the history. &quot;These two guys are never going to spend Christmas together. There is a lot of history between them. That&apos;s not something that&apos;s new to Malaysia, it has existed for the last four or five years, and in that time we have won more than 2,000 points with them, 36 grands prix and six world championships, more than 40 pole positions. It is nothing new, having to manage this situation.&quot; But while no one can deny that Red Bull have enjoyed phenomenal successes, or that Horner himself has been the outstanding leader of his short era, the fact remains that the team have been substantially damaged in recent weeks. Webber has been hurt, because his relationship with Vettel is now so poisonous that his own position within the team looks untenable. Vettel, likewise, has been diminished because his bullish, self-confident air here makes a mockery of his contrite, apologetic demeanour in Malaysia. However unpalatable team orders are, they should be respected when they come, and they came in Kuala Lumpur. Horner&apos;s authority has been badly undermined, even though he bridled at the suggestion that it is now Vettel who runs the team. He said: &quot;I don&apos;t think Sebastian for one moment thinks he runs the team. He knows what his job is, he knows what we employ him to do. He&apos;s made a decision in a race as a hungry driver. But he&apos;s made his position clear, he&apos;s apologised to the team and he&apos;s apologised to me. It&apos;s happened and we move on, but it doesn&apos;t change anything.&quot; The fact is, though, that a monster has loomed out of the Shanghai smog this week, and it is the same, smiling cherub who won his first race at this track four years ago, changing forever the dynamic between himself and Webber. Horner is loth to admit it, but things have changed even more radically now. When Vettel said here on Thursday that Webber didn&apos;t deserve to win the Malaysian race and that he would probably do the same thing again he effectively tore asunder his apology of three weeks ago. Horner and Red Bull must take responsibility for this. They should have acted more decisively when their two drivers collided in Turkey in 2010, and then when there were further conflicts at Silverstone in 2010 and 2011 and in Brazil in the final race of last year. Then, Webber hindered his team-mate&apos;s chances of winning his third-consecutive world title. Webber has not been blameless in all this. Horner insists: &quot;I get the best out of them, I really do. How many happy ex-McLaren drivers are there? Both drivers have plenty of choice and any team in the pitlane would love to have our driver pairing.&quot; But many in the paddock have been shocked by Vettel&apos;s behaviour. McLaren&apos;s Jenson Button said: &quot;I&apos;m surprised he [Vettel] said what he said, personally. Lots of people have won world championships without being like that. He&apos;s going to get asked so many questions in many different ways until he cracks.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s unnecessary isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s such a small thing that he&apos;s done that&apos;s wrong, I&apos;m sure he thinks, but to go against a team orders is pretty big. I don&apos;t like team orders full stop. But you&apos;re allowed to have them in the sport and you have to stick with what he team says. They employ you. They pay you money to go racing.&quot; Meanwhile, at Mercedes \u2013 whose authority over their drivers in Malaysia was never questioned \u2013 appear to be moving against team orders too. Their chairman, Niki Lauda, said: &quot;We sat around the table and decided with immediate effect that our drivers may freely race against each other.&quot; And the team principal, Ross Brawn, added: &quot;We want our drivers to race. The rule is don&apos;t hit each other.&quot; Whether that message survives the season, though, remains to be seen.", "tags": ["Red Bull", "Sebastian Vettel", "Mark Webber", "Formula One 2013", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-12T21:00:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/14/fernando-alonso-wins-china-gp", "sentences": ["The lucky people in town might have visited the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall, or perhaps mooched about at one of the many dumpling stands while discussing the merits of the new deep water container port at Yangshan."], "title": "Fernando Alonso surges to China GP victory", "article": "The lucky people in town might have visited the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall, or perhaps mooched about at one of the many dumpling stands while discussing the merits of the new deep water container port at Yangshan. Those who did not know how to have such a good time came, instead, to the International Circuit for an afternoon of noisy tedium in which Fernando Alonso and Ferrari won their first race of the season. This was a race dominated by the different demands of soft and medium tyre strategies but for the spectators the best strategy of all would have been to remain at home. Perhaps the one consolation was that boredom has seldom been as frenetic as this. There was a certain energy in the ennui. But while a lot of people were moving quickly, like wind-up toys, very little was actually happening. Alonso will not see it quite the same way. He is many people&apos;s pick to win his third championship this year and he stamped his nonchalant authority on proceedings, winning by more than 10 seconds. Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s wonderfully consistent run continued, with second place, and there was a third for Lewis Hamilton, just as there had been in the previous race in Malaysia. There was another heroic drive from Jenson Button, just as there has been in Kuala Lumpur, but this time it was rewarded with 10 points. McLaren, one senses, will not be happy until theirMP4-28, as originally conceived, is as perfectly dead as an expertly embalmed corpse. This was a car that needed not so much modifying as rebuilding but Button continues to keep alive their outlandish hopes of championship success. Sebastian Vettel, like Button, based his plan on running on soft tyres at the end and finished with a charging fourth, just failing to get past Hamilton. So he still leads the championship ahead of Raikkonen, Alonso and Hamilton, though his advantage is only three points. Vettel&apos;s team-mate, Mark Webber, had an unhappy afternoon to add to his wretched season. He started from the back of the grid and, after losing a wheel following a collision with Toro Rosso&apos;s Jean-Eric Vergne, he was penalised three grid positions for next Sunday&apos;s race in Bahrain. But all the talk through two hours of racing was of primes and options, mediums and softs. It was a rubber-fest of a race. And people do not pay for expensive tickets in order to watch tyre changes. It would be churlish to complain too much because F1 has provided a great deal of spectacle in the past three years. And that is partly down to Pirelli&apos;s unpredictable tyres. &quot;It&apos;s all tyres, tyres, tyres, tyres,&quot; a distraught Webber said at the start of the season, and on Sunday it was difficult to argue with him. Conserving rubber does not make for exciting racing. &quot;I suspect it was a reasonable spectacle,&quot; said Martin Whitmarsh but McLaren&apos;s team principal suspected wrong. &quot;I didn&apos;t watch the race. Oddly you don&apos;t. You watch what&apos;s going on with your car, and you&apos;re thinking about that. You&apos;re not sat back, dispassionate.&quot; Whitmarsh did get it right when he said: &quot;I think the tyres are a little too fragile at the moment. And that has some impact on how all of us run our weekends. That&apos;s a shame.&quot; Paul Hembery, Pirelli&apos;s motorsport director, said: &quot;It was degradation, rather than actual wear, that dictated the strategy.&quot; But race fans will find that as difficult to understand as the actual race. Alonso, though, was fully able to comprehend his 31st victory that puts him level with Nigel Mansell and fourth in the list of drivers with most wins. He said: &quot;It felt good. It has been a long time since my last victory here eight years ago. It was a nearly perfect race for us, it was clean and good. The team did a perfect job. They executed the pit stops perfectly, after the disappointment in Malaysia. It is a positive start to this championship.&quot; Hamilton said: &quot;It was a good race for me and I was trying to apply a bit of pressure to Kimi at the end but my tyres were shot trying to keep ahead of Sebastian.&quot;     Fernando Alonso celebrates. Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP    Over the in-car radio Ross Brawn was left breathing a sigh of relief to Hamilton. &quot;Phew! That was close,&quot; the Mercedes team principal said. &quot;We are not quite there yet but we are not so far away so let&apos;s keep working hard.&quot;Those who doubted the wisdom of Hamilton&apos;s move from McLaren to Mercedes are not doing so not any more. The driver who has replaced him, Sergio P\u00e9rez, has been told to toughen up by McLaren after winning only two points from the first three races of the season. Whitmarsh said: &quot;I think he&apos;s been very polite so far this year. He needs to toughen up. He&apos;s been generous in allowing people past him. He&apos;s still a very young guy in a big team with lots of expectations so you&apos;re under a lot more scrutiny and it&apos;s tougher. And he&apos;s got a team-mate [Button] who&apos;s doing a great job, so there&apos;s some pressure there, and this won&apos;t go down as his best weekend, of that I&apos;m sure.&quot; McLaren must have been relieved that P\u00e9rez showed some aggression, making life difficult for Raikkonen, who ran into him as he tried to pass. Whitmarsh said: &quot;Sometimes you have to be robust and have elbows. And I think he was robust.&quot; But what was needed in China was a robust defence of an expensive anticlimax.

On their first date, in a teahouse, he admired her femininity. They married a year later and are now negotiating the decor of their new flat. Wang hopes they will grow old together, yet refused to pay for her wedding ring and is wary of having a child. &quot;I have a headache when I talk about that,&quot; said the 40-year-old software engineer, with a half-smile, half-grimace. His wife is not family; not even a friend, he said \u2013 merely a partner in their joint endeavour. He is gay, she lesbian. The marriage is a facade, erected to satisfy their parents and protect their careers. Though homosexuality was illegal in China until 1997, and remains a sensitive issue, the country does not have the deep-rooted, vicious homophobia of many other places. For most of its history, it &quot;not only tolerated male same-sex love but also celebrated it&quot;, writes Richard Burger in Behind the Red Door, a history of sex in China. But such relationships supplemented marriage rather than replaced it. According to the tenets of traditional society, the worst kind of unfilial behaviour is failing to continue the family line. Even now, the pressure to marry and have children is intense. Zhang Beichuan, an expert on homosexuality at Qingdao University, believes about 80% of gay men and lesbians marry. Most wed straight partners unaware of their spouses&apos; sexuality. Others, such as Wang, find a homosexual partner of the opposite sex by asking friends or advertising online. One woman in her early 20s writes on one such website: &quot;I have promised my parents I will marry by 2014 \u2026 I am looking for someone who is simple, honest, has an apartment, does not want a child. &quot;We won&apos;t disturb each other. The marriage will last at least five years.&quot; Another says she and her girlfriend are out to please their parents, but want a baby. As an openly lesbian couple they would face social stigma; birth control policies also make life harder for children born to single mothers. &quot;I want to find someone who is healthy, not bad looking, intelligent, kind and cheerful,&quot; she states. &quot;You don&apos;t need to raise the kid, but I hope you are a father who will love the kid and be a male role model.&quot; Wang (not his real name) spent five years seeking a suitable bride. For men, the pressure to marry starts in their early 30s, he said; for women, much earlier. His wife, almost a decade younger than him, also wanted to allay her parents&apos; suspicion after they reacted angrily to her attempts to come out. Wang bought time by telling his family that Shanghai girls would not look at him until he had a flat. His sister asked outright if he had physical problems. &quot;My parents are from the countryside. Everyone compares themselves with each other, especially about their children,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a big deal that I went to university in the city and got a good job \u2013 so why couldn&apos;t such a great guy find a wife and have children? That was a lot of pressure for my parents.&quot; Even in the city, being openly gay could really harm you at work, he says. Simply being single is a problem: &quot;I work for a foreign company so it&apos;s not so bad, because they respect personal privacy, but they still want you to take your girlfriend or wife to company events. If you are single, people think you&apos;re weird. They feel you are more responsible and mature after you marry. They also feel you have a family to feed so maybe they should give you a chance,&quot; said Wang. Thanks to such pressures, as many as 12m gay men are married to straight women, estimates Xing Fei, of the Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences. Wang said he never considered that option: &quot;I know if a woman loved me, I couldn&apos;t give her the love she would expect or want. For a woman, that&apos;s tragic,&quot; he said. Xing said others wanted to avoid a straight partner&apos;s sexual demands. But marriages of convenience bring their own difficulties. &quot;Some of these marriages are good \u2013 they can help and support each other \u2013 but most don&apos;t last long,&quot; warned Zhang. Couples may agree in advance to an early divorce. Others find cohabiting and sharing family duties harder than expected. Splitting up can bring disputes over children and property. In Wang&apos;s case, their property is registered in their own names. They have also covered every detail they could think of \u2013 he will pay all travel costs for visiting his parents, for example \u2013 in written terms that are not legally binding but make their mutual expectations clear. They will have separate rooms, but share a bed when his family comes to stay. They will not give a key to her parents, who live nearby, lest they pop in unexpectedly. &quot;I&apos;m really lucky to find her, and she&apos;s a generous person,&quot; Wang said of his wife. &quot;But there will be more problems later. With love you can put up with a lot. Without love, it&apos;s harder.&quot; Additional research by Cecily Huang", "tags": ["China", "LGBT rights", "Marriage", "Life and style", "Society", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-14T18:52:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/14/fernando-alonso-chinese-grand-prix", "sentences": ["The lucky people in town might have visited the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall, or perhaps mooched about at one of the many dumpling stands while discussing the merits of the new deep water container port at Yangshan."], "title": "Fernando Alonso wins Chinese Grand Prix with ease in Shanghai", "article": "The lucky people in town might have visited the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall, or perhaps mooched about at one of the many dumpling stands while discussing the merits of the new deep water container port at Yangshan.

The government-owned Shanghai United Circuit then issued an emergency notice requiring the city&apos;s cinemas to halt screenings of the film and grant refunds to ticketholders, according to reports. Since then, the film has not been shown in any Chinese cinema. Censors are thought to have been offended by a scene that included full-frontal shots (of male slaves), which would usually earn any film an automatic ban under Chinese screening rules. However, Chinese publicists for the film said at the weekend they were working to secure a new release date. &quot;Thanks to all our friends and enthusiastic fans,&quot; the publicists said on Weibo, China&apos;s version of Twitter, before adding: &quot;We will try our best to do our job, so as to allow Django Unchained to meet all of you as soon as possible.&quot; Distributor Sony has also said it is working with the Chinese authorities to reschedule the release.

The BBC declined to comment, but the Guardian understands the appointment will be confirmed to staff on Tuesday. Harding resigned abruptly as Times editor after five years in December, telling shocked staff he did so after being told that Rupert Murdoch wanted to replace him. The Guardian revealed in February that the new BBC director general, Tony Hall, was talking to Harding about a senior role. Harding took a holiday immediately after the furore surrounding his Times departure, and has kept a low profile ever since. However, he is believed to have been approached about a number of potential jobs in the media and politics. At the Times, he was a popular editor among many reporters, but others complained that he lacked the visceral judgment that distinguishes great editors from good ones. &quot;He was responsible for some great campaigns, but didn&apos;t make enough of them. If it was the Mail or the Telegraph, they would have gone for beyond broke on the offshore tax campaign like the Telegraph campaign on MPs expenses.&quot; Many believed that the writing was on the wall for Harding following Rupert Murdoch&apos;s testimony at the Leveson inquiry during which he lamented his editor&apos;s failure to get the MPs expenses story. He was also forced to apologise to a high court judge over a computer hacking scandal involving a young and inexperienced reporter on the paper who admitted hacking into a policeman&apos;s email account to unmask his identity. Harding&apos;s decision to maintain a strong independent editorial line on News International and the phone hacking scandal is unlikely to have gone down well with Murdoch. Just before the Leveson inquiry, Harding wrote how the company had &quot;succumbed to most dangerous delusion of the powerful, namely that it could play by its own set of rules&quot;. Then, after Murdoch&apos;s testimony the leader pointed figures at its own management. &quot;Instead of listening and responding to those asking legitimate questions, the company instead pursued its critics as enemies.&quot; It was reported that Murdoch wasn&apos;t on speaking terms to Harding since last summer, after his Leveson appearance, and didn&apos;t talk to him during his many visits to Wapping. It is not clear why he was forced to resign, but senior insiders say that Murdoch felt he was the wrong person to complete the shift of the Times from a cerebral paper of record to a &quot;more newsy paper&quot;. Those who know him say that despite his editorship of a Tory-supporting paper, he is not a Conservative. &quot;He is centre-ground, if not a bit left,&quot; said one. They also say the resolute independent line he took during the Leveson inquiry and over the phone hacking scandal shows how robustly independent he is. Educated in St Paul&apos;s in Hammersmith, one of the top private schools in London, and Cambridge where he got a first class history degree, Harding speaks fluent Mandarin and Japanese, He stared his journalistic career at the Financial Times in 1994 and opened its Shanghai bureau. He was also the paper&apos;s media correspondent. Harding will take over a BBC News division still recovering from last autumn&apos;s Jimmy Savile crisis and now embroiled in controversy over John Sweeney&apos;s Panorama documentary on North Korea. In a strongly worded report on the corporation&apos;s handling of the Savile affair published in December, the former head of Sky News Nick Pollard was particularly scathing about BBC News, saying Harding&apos;s predecessor Helen Boaden should have taken &quot;greater responsibility&quot; as her division went into &quot;virtual meltdown&quot; in October and November Boaden, who moved to a new BBC job as director of radio this week, offered to resign at the height of the scandal last year, but the offer was not accepted by the former director general George Entwistle. BBC News is also adjusting to its recent move from Television Centre to its vast new double-atriumed newsroom in the new \u00a31bn Broadcasting House redevelopment in central London.", "tags": ["James Harding", "BBC", "The Times", "Media", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-15T18:54:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/16/weekly-sports-diary-barney-ronay", "sentences": ["The Formula One season came thrumming back into life in Shanghai as Fernando Alonso won the Chinese Grand Prix, his first victory of the year, after a race dominated by the endless fascinations of tyre-politics."], "title": "Puzzled Alonso takes the chequered flag in Shanghai", "article": "The Formula One season came thrumming back into life in Shanghai as Fernando Alonso won the Chinese Grand Prix, his first victory of the year, after a race dominated by the endless fascinations of tyre-politics. &quot;It was not always easy to understand the race,&quot; Alonso admitted afterwards, frowning into his steering wheel. Happily there was none of the in-fighting that has blighted previous races as three separate teams got to spray the champagne, Kimi Raikkonen and Lewis Hamilton taking second and third and thereby maintaining a veneer of genuine sporting-style competition. Sebastian Vettel, who came fourth, is still 12 points clear in the championship. It&apos;s just not cricket Spare a thought for the simple heroism of the county cricketer, roused this week from his winter sun southern hemisphere sinecure, his job at the garden centre, his burbling Xbox, in order to don his heavy tog merino wool thermal two-piece (sewn-in until the end of May) and pretend briefly to be playing a summer sport. The first round of championship matches saw victories for Middlesex and Sussex, who thrashed an already harrumph-ridden Yorkshire by an innings. And there was intrigue in Pakistan, meanwhile, as umpires Nadeem Ghauri and Anis Siddiqi were banned for four and three years for making &quot;favourable&quot; decisions. Not in the nice sense of the word. The bans relate to an Indian TV sting last year that, frankly, threatened to blow the lid off the whole thing. Fight-tarnished Cup The magic of the FA Cup was slightly obscured by violent fisticuffs and massed vacant seats as Wigan Athletic reached the final for the first time at a quarter-empty Wembley in a match marred by a violent disturbance in the Millwall end (fighting update: the next day 29 people were arrested after Sunderland&apos;s 3-0 defeat of Newcastle). Wigan will play Manchester City, who beat Chelsea 2-1, setting up an all-Lancashire final between the DW Stadium&apos;s small-town have-nots and their neighbouring big city have-everythings. Mass baseball hissy fit At least, though, it&apos;s not come to this just yet. LA Dodgers pitcher Zack Greinke had his collarbone broken in a bench-clearing brawl during a game against the San Diego Padres, won 3-2 by the Dodgers, but overshadowed by the spectacle of 30 men in cotton tracksuits having a violent hissy fit. After a mass bundle near the pitching mound, Greinke was eventually helped from the field by his manager. And 15 minutes later everybody was back having a game of baseball.

Then everything changed: in 1979, it was designated the unlikely site of the nation&apos;s first Special Economic Zone. After years of quiet subsistence, the village was turned into a deregulated playground for experiments in western capitalism. Fuelled by more than \u00a320bn of foreign investment, the city has swollen to house a population of 15 million. The skyline is a forest of skyscrapers; below them nestle private golf clubs and shopping centres devoted to luxury brands. &quot;A new high-rise every day and a new boulevard every three&quot; became Shenzhen&apos;s motto in the 1990s. Rice fields gave way to roads, lined with ever more fantastical buildings. It is now the biggest, most densely populated and fastest-growing city in the Pearl River Delta, the world&apos;s largest manufacturing megalopolis, home to 50 million people. Today, the view from the 46th floor of Shenzhen&apos;s new stock exchange is filled with an endless army of towers. Dual-pronged spires and spear-shaped peaks thrust upwards into heavy skies. There are cliffs of curtain-wall glazing, rendered in metallic blues and greens, pinks and golds. The city already has replicas of the Taj Mahal and Eiffel Tower, its own pyramids and Sydney Opera House (all marshalled into the Window of the World theme park) \u2013 so where do you start with something like a stock exchange? What structure best symbolises the summit of all capitalist ambition, the pinnacle of former Communist party leader Deng Xiaoping&apos;s dream of wealth\u00a0creation? The architects hired to answer this \u00a3300m question are OMA, the Dutch practice headed by Rem Koolhaas and in China best known for Beijing&apos;s outsize CCTV headquarters, completed last year. Rather than compete with Shenzhen&apos;s proliferating skyline \u2013 which OMA partner David Gianotten describes as a &quot;cacophony of shape-making&quot; \u2013 they have elected to build something calmer and quieter. At first glance the results are slightly nondescript: a 250m-high concrete office building punctuated by a monotonous grid of square windows. But get a little closer and you find that the podium, on which the tower would normally sit, has been hoisted 10 storeys upwards, where it hangs improbably above a public plaza. The size of two football pitches, this gargantuan floating slab is now a breathtaking and decidedly menacing sight, glowering over the city like an alien spaceship come to deliver its final reckoning. In Gianotten&apos;s view, raising the podium &quot;liberates the ground&quot;, while its looming presence &quot;frames views of the city&quot;. How liberated the ground will really be at the foot of a high-security building remains to be seen; and if the podium frames the view, it does so by blocking out the sky. The building&apos;s unusual, hoisted form has already earned it the local nickname &quot;the miniskirt&quot;, something of an improvement on the moniker given to OMA&apos;s CCTV building: &quot;the giant underpants&quot;. (CCTV HQ has also been likened to someone squatting over a toilet.)     OMA's CCTV Tower in Beijing, dubbed 'the giant underpants'. Photograph: Eric Gregory Powell/Getty    But while CCTV&apos;s daring form was inspired by New York&apos;s Twin Towers, bent double to kiss in an implausible cantilever, Shenzhen stock exchange&apos;s look-no-hands gesture is a collage of two buildings by Mies van der Rohe. OMA&apos;s original 2006 competition entry depicted the strong horizontal slab of Mies&apos;s (unbuilt) Chicago Convention Centre impaled on the sleek vertical shaft of his Seagram Building. A surreal marriage of two archetypal forms, this Mies kebab had a compelling, absurdist simplicity, as Koolhaas explained in his original pitch: &quot;As if lifted by the same speculative euphoria that drives the market, the former base has crept up the tower,&quot; he wrote. Now that it is built, it remains the ultimate example of building as diagram, a symbolic totem of capital \u2013 particularly given the fact that modern trading barely needs any space at all. Founded in 1990, Shenzhen&apos;s is the third stock exchange in China, after Shanghai and Hong Kong, with around 1,500 listed companies (many of which remain state-owned) and a market capitalisation of \u00a3700bn. But gone are the days of frenzied men in coloured jackets shouting across a pit. &quot;Contemporary securities trading is totally virtual,&quot; says Gianotten, as we walk around one of the echoing 15,000\u00a0sq m floors of the floating plinth. This three-storey sandwich, which is held up by a 27,000-tonne steel truss, will house staff offices and meeting rooms, as well as the building&apos;s real heart: an entire level of computer servers, their proximity to the traders essential given that deals are now done in nanoseconds. Elsewhere, there are a number of ceremonial spaces: a\u00a0&quot;listing hall&quot; where new companies will be ritually welcomed with the ringing of a great bronze bell; and a private art gallery, to which each new company must donate an\u00a0artwork. It is these theatrical stage sets that OMA usually does so well \u2013 from the dramatic halls of its Casa da Musica in Porto, to the ornate private meeting rooms of the Rothschild bank in London. But here in Shenzhen, there is little of that wit and charm, that nuanced understanding of performance and ritual. Gianotten describes the stock exchange as a deliberately &quot;generic tower&quot;; these enormous rooms, crafted with a blunt corporate hand, make you wonder if OMA has taken that idea a little too\u00a0far. Unusually for a building of this size and location, the architects have had control over the entire project, even down to the scale of furniture, much of which has been designed especially. In the Orwellian-sounding Market Watching Department (a kind of mission control where 30 overseers will sit at a bank of eight screens to check for market irregularities), the monitors are set low in special V-shaped desks, allowing colleagues to see each other. On the floor above, desk cubicles are kitted out with napping beds that fold out of a filing cabinet, providing brief respite between shifts \u2013 another feature that recalls the working regime of Nineteen Eighty-Four. The tower above the podium houses leasable office space designed to lure high-end clients. The lobbies are lined with Italian marble, and there are double-height entertainment foyers inscribed with gold-leafed graphs inspired by market fluctuations. The summit is reserved for a VIP dining club, its banqueting halls upholstered with leather and raw silk; there are bamboo floors and aluminium walls, and views of a private roof garden planted on the podium. But once again, these spaces lack character or meaning, giving a bland sense of lobotomised\u00a0luxury.     'Liberate the ground' ... the Shenzhen stock exchange's podium has been hoisted to free up the plaza beneath. Photograph: Philippe Ruault    Down on the expansive plaza, the clouds have shifted to reveal the facade in a different light. The entire building, which reads as dull grey concrete on an overcast day, is in fact wrapped in a diaphanous cocoon of textured glass \u2013 the kind usually used to obscure bathroom windows. &quot;It is the first time it has been used on this scale,&quot; says Gianotten, describing months of testing to achieve the desired finish (a three-layer panel of low-iron, ceramic-coated and textured glass sheets). This gives the building an enigmatic, alchemical air, changing its character throughout the day. When the sun comes out, the entire tower sparkles; at dusk it becomes an ethereal ghost; at night, it glows from within like a crystalline shell, as the latest stock market figures chase around the perimeter of the podium. In the end, it is this that marks the project apart from its neighbours: a muted grey cadaver among a riot of mirrored facades and faux-stone panelling. As we leave, the building begins to dissolve into the haze. This seems fitting: OMA&apos;s hollow shell, built to house a largely virtual process, is eerie, tyrannical, arresting. But it also looks as if it might not be there at all.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Rem Koolhaas", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-16T17:56:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/17/cities-good-you-hollis-review", "sentences": ["In between, Hollis travels through time, giving a highly partisan and select history of urban theory and town planning; and through space, hopping from the US to Bangalore and\u00a0Mumbai, to Shanghai, to Songdo in\u00a0South Korea, Santiago in Chile and Bogot\u00e1 in Colombia, then back home to his own Metroland on the outskirts of London for a little rest and reflection."], "title": "Cities Are Good for You by Leo Hollis \u2013 review", "article": "Don&apos;t allow that seductive 99p deceive you \u2013 with Leo Hollis&apos;s Cities Are Good for You you&apos;re definitely getting seventeen pounds&apos; worth of book; \u00a317, and possibly somewhere approaching 17lbs as well, because this is a hefty tome, not quite lavishly tooled enough for the coffee table, but nor entirely a comfortable proposition when lying abed. Which rather raises the question, who exactly is it aimed at? People who see the city as a backdrop of fashion plates against which they can strike physical and intellectual attitudes, or\u00a0those for whom urbanism is just another wanky trend? Two years ago the world reached a tipping point, with more urban than rural inhabitants, and this is being reflected in the cultural superstructure: there are increasing numbers of books, films and TV and radio programmes about the city. Hollis&apos;s is a reasonably efficient addition to the genre \u2013 a comprehensive overview of the state of the city and contemporary thinking in urbanism. He\u00a0begins and ends his tale \u2013 which takes the form of an extended multi-city-break \u2013 with musings occasioned by Manhattan&apos;s High Line park, the\u00a0curiously luminal green space established on the derelict elevated railway line that runs down the Lower West Side. In between, Hollis travels through time, giving a highly partisan and select history of urban theory and town planning; and through space, hopping from the US to Bangalore and\u00a0Mumbai, to Shanghai, to Songdo in\u00a0South Korea, Santiago in Chile and Bogot\u00e1 in Colombia, then back home to his own Metroland on the outskirts of London for a little rest and reflection. At its best Cities Are Good for You resembles a collection of readable feature articles on contemporary cities. Hollis is informative about public transport in South America and the economics of Mumbai&apos;s infamous Dharavi \u2013 a slum that, once penetrated, is exposed as not just a colourful backdrop for fictional slumdog millionaires, but a complex and curiously efficient human anthill. He also covers Chinese urbanisation well, carefully describing the punitive Hukou system of residential registration that\u00a0allows for the ever-accelerating migration from rural areas, while simultaneously ensuring that these former peasants can be maintained in a\u00a0state of perpetual peonage. Hollis is at\u00a0pains to retain a global perspective, writing more about the cities of the emergent BRICK economies than he does about the boring old bricks-and-mortar town I live in. He rightly sees the future of the city as being shaped by developments to the east and the south, where the megalopolises of the 21st century will\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or so late capitalism&apos;s flag-wavers\u00a0believe \u2013 arise, replete with gleaming towers worthy of Oz. But at its worst Cities Are Good for You is a pretty vulgar garment; an appliqu\u00e9 of Panglossian optimism and theoretical banality stitched together by stylistic cliche. Does it matter that in a book about cities the author uses such expressions \u2013 quite without irony\u00a0\u2013 as &quot;vibrant art scene&quot;? Well, yes, I think it does, just as writing the sentence: &quot;For centuries the city has been the perfect place to develop the killer app&quot; should&apos;ve at least given Hollis&apos;s editor cause for thoughts of the form: what was I put on earth for, if not to excise anachronistic drivel like this? But then this is a writer who will never use the expression &quot;low tax&quot; when he\u00a0can reach for that providential euphemism &quot;light touch fiscal policy&quot;. To seriously tackle his infelicities and solecisms would&apos;ve placed someone in the unenviable position of a barber shaving a dog: where do you stop? I think the problem with Cities Are Good for You derives from its title. It doesn&apos;t matter whether the emphasis is\u00a0placed on &quot;are&quot; or not, the end result is that I \u2013 or indeed you \u2013 feel hectored. Try telling the single mother with children who has just had to leave London because of the new benefit cap\u00a0that cities are good for her; or why\u00a0not convey the advantages of a\u00a0vibrant art scene to the urbanites who\u00a0live in\u00a0the shanty towns of Lagos and Johannesburg, or the slums of Jakarta and Dhaka? Even at the level of\u00a0what objectively are high-class problems, there are still those of us who experience on a daily basis profound alienation from the city \u2013 from its moiling crowds and roiling psychic miasmas, from its chilly depersonalisation and its fervid marketisation \u2013 an alienation that we yet feel perversely ambivalent about, loving and hating it as we love the cities that produce such powerful feelings. For clap-happy Hollis there can be no such ambivalence, nor are there any\u00a0ambiguities. He may begin his excursus with a view of the city as an organic phenomenon, perhaps one not\u00a0best understood by rationalist thought, but by concepts derived from the sociobiology of EO Wilson et al, yet his\u00a0daft title pulls him back time and again to a simplistic meliorism of the form: cities are good for you \u2013 and you had better work really hard to ensure that they are (and by extension to validate the title of my book). It&apos;s not that Hollis doesn&apos;t acknowledge the downside of cities \u2013 he\u00a0includes a section on the 2011 London riots, and is not unsympathetic to the malcontents. Nor does he ignore the implications of the Gini coefficient, which indicates that widening inequality may be an ineluctable aspect of larger and larger conurbations. Yet behind all this apparent balance lies a\u00a0curious kind of neoliberal civic virtuousness \u2013 Hollis says that for the\u00a0city to remain good for us it must address three primary problems: sustainability, trust and inequality. He\u00a0acknowledges that the balm for the\u00a0festering urban sores so painfully anatomised by Mike Davis in his Planet\u00a0of Slums cannot be found in the market,\u00a0and yet what he offers is no real alternative, but rather a hotchpotch of bike-hire schemes and superannuated hippies growing tomatoes on Brooklyn rooftops. In part this has to be attributable to his Manichean and partial view of urbanism and urban development. For\u00a0Hollis the mantra is:\u00a0Jane Jacobs and &quot;soft modernist&quot; Patrick Geddes good; Le Corbusier and Robert Moses (who are seen crudely as counterparts) bad, bad, bad! It&apos;s true enough that the legacy of\u00a0the pioneering urban activist and\u00a0theorist Jacobs is due for a re\u2011evaluation. Her key work The Life\u00a0and Death of Great American Cities\u00a0eloquently makes the case for communitarianism trumping dirigisme long before &quot;stakeholder&quot; was a twinkle in Tony Blair&apos;s eye. Jacobs viewed the &quot;eyes on the street&quot;, and the sidewalk &quot;ballet&quot; of her Greenwich Village neighbourhood as key to an understanding of how cities can happily and safely function, and she took up the cudgels against the New York city planner Robert Moses, who was intent on driving an expressway through this happily cosmopolitan district. But to condemn Moses out of\u00a0hand as a proponent of autogeddon is facile in the extreme, as is Hollis&apos;s determination to demonise Le Corbusier as a modernist Moloch intent on feeding the children of the proletariat into high-rise sarcophaguses. Ultimately, all\u00a0these people were seeking solutions to particular problems at given stages of cities&apos; development \u2013 Moses zoned for parks and public housing because these were what New Yorkers needed; initially he was a hero of the people. As\u00a0for Le Corbusier, by his works shall\u00a0you know him, and frankly I&apos;d rather read a single paragraph of his pellucid and revolutionary prose than a whole chapter of Hollis&apos;s bumf, no matter how packed the latter is with useful\u00a0information. Then there&apos;s the built environment; for someone prepared to spend 400 pages telling us how great cities are, Hollis seems remarkably untouched by\u00a0the aesthetics of buildings. Say what\u00a0you will about Le Corbusier, he did know how to design a beautiful building; and modernism was a genuine response to the technological zeitgeist, and often an attempt to\u00a0remake the city as a haptic phenomenon. (Think of the wood grain\u00a0impressed into the brutalist concrete beams of the Hayward Gallery.) I tend to think of cities first and foremost in this sensual way, and to register my response to them by my transit of the urban scape; whereas for Hollis the flaneur is, presumably, a rather recondite \u2013 if not irrelevant \u2013 figure, although he professes to be a great urban walker himself. In place of this shifting, evanescent and endlessly creative perspective of the city, we are offered a lot of\u00a0wittering about Twitter. During Hollis&apos;s extended paean to the delights\u00a0of Call\u2011me-Dave&apos;s &quot;silicon roundabout&quot; in London&apos;s hipper-than-thou Shoreditch, I kept being reminded of that YouTube sensation &quot;The Dickhead Song&quot;, which mercilessly satirises the\u00a0&quot;creatives&quot; of east London, and in particular of its rousing chorus: &quot;I love my life as a dickhead / All my friends are dickheads too \u2026&quot; Because all sorts of dickheads meet with Hollis&apos;s\u00a0approval \u2013 including the mayor of London \u2013 while he&apos;s never happier than when extolling the virtues of the latest killer app. In truth, the real killer app in the city where Hollis and I are both domiciled is\u00a0the light fiscal touch \u2013 insignificant local tax-raising powers \u2013 and the sham it makes of a true local democracy. It&apos;s\u00a0a\u00a0killer app that&apos;s murdered the municipal socialism that\u00a0once made London a livable city\u00a0for people of all classes, and has\u00a0left the way open for the city to\u00a0increasingly resemble Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s zero-tolerance-for-the-poor Manhattan. I don&apos;t imagine these developments \u2013 taking place in cities all over Britain \u2013 will be good for you, no matter the gloss this handsomely produced book puts on them. \u2022 Will Self&apos;s novel Umbrella is out in paperback.", "tags": ["Society", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-17T10:17:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/17/urbanisation-force-good-jobs-services", "sentences": ["Growth will not only be in today&apos;s megacities of Shanghai or Mumbai, but also in secondary cities such as Huambo in Angola, Fushun in China and Surat in India."], "title": "Urbanisation can be 'force for good' with better jobs and cheaper services", "article": "Urbanisation can accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals (MDGs), but careful planning is essential to prevent the growth of slums, pollution and crime that can derail achievements, according to a report card on the MDGs. In their annual progress report on the MDGs, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) focus on the positive effects of urbanisation. The report says urbanisation provides higher incomes than workers would earn on a farm and yields further opportunities to climb the income ladder. &quot;Virtually no country has graduated to a high-income status without urbanising and urbanisation rates above 70% are typically found in high-income countries,&quot; said the report, which noted that urban poverty rates were relatively low and declining in all regions between 1990 and 2008. &quot;Governments should not be afraid of urbanisation,&quot; said Jos Verbeek, lead author of the report. &quot;If managed well, it can be a force for good.&quot; In addition to creating better-paid jobs, cities allow better and cheaper access to services. In Niger, for example, the average price of water is 182 West African CFA francs (\u00a30.24) per cubic metre for piped water from a network, CFAF 534 from a public fountain and CFAF 926 from a vendor in rural areas. Poor access to basic infrastructure has a disproportionate effect on rural women as they perform most of the domestic chores and often walk long distances to fetch water. About 2.7 billion people in the developing world live in urban areas and 96% of the additional 1.4 billion people in the developing world by 2030 will live in cities. Growth will not only be in today&apos;s megacities of Shanghai or Mumbai, but also in secondary cities such as Huambo in Angola, Fushun in China and Surat in India. The report says many emerging urban centres are still taking shape, providing policymakers with a unique but rapidly closing window of opportunity to get their cities &quot;right&quot;. Slum warning     Poverty_rates2 Photograph: Graphic    &quot;If the forces of urbanisation are not managed speedily and efficiently, slum growth can overwhelm city growth, exacerbate urban poverty, derail MDG achievements and reduce, if not eliminate, cities&apos; comparative advantage regarding attainment of the MDGs,&quot; the report warned. About 1 billion people live in urban slums in poor countries and their numbers are projected to grow by nearly 500 million by 2020. These populations are growing fastest in sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia and western Asia. 62% of Africa&apos;s urban population live in slums. &quot;Slums are the result of an unfettered approach to urbanisation,&quot; said Hans Timmer, director of the World Bank team that produced the report. &quot;If you plan right, you would not see the emergence of slums.&quot; A key message of the report is that governments should provide basic services for people in slums, just like in rural areas or cities. In Laos, for example, the government has given squatters long-term leases to public land, formalising their status on the land they already occupied. In Vinh, the Vietnamese government is trying to provide slums with better services by adjusting planning standards to make them more realistic and cheaper. The report emphasises the importance of planning; making markets (labour, goods and services) accessible to other neighbourhoods in the city, other cities and export markets; and financing for large infrastructure projects. &quot;Of the three, planning for land use and basic services is the most important,&quot; said the report. &quot;The challenges for countries at all stages of urbanisation is strengthening institutions for land management \u2026 Financing should be city leaders&apos; last concern rather than their first.&quot; Timmer said planning should ensure big cities are connected to small cities and rural areas. &quot;Small cities are very important for rural areas as farmers can get better prices,&quot; he said. &quot;There must be an emphasis on connectivity and you can&apos;t leave all the planning to municipalities as they all compete with each other. You do need some kind of master plan to focus on exchanges between rural areas and small cities.&quot; Sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s poor people are concentrated in rural areas and cannot migrate at once to urban areas, so any strategy to achieve the MDGs should include increasing rural productivity through the introduction of technology and investment in the health and education of villagers, said the report. Mixed news on MDGs     Poverty_rates1 Photograph: Graphic    Only four of the 21 MDG targets or sub-targets have been met worldwide, two years before the 2015 deadline. New estimates confirm that MDG1.a on reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty, on less than $1.25 a day, was reached in 2010. The world has also met MDG7.c, to halve the proportion of people without access to drinking water. MDG7.d \u2013 to significantly improve the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020 \u2013 was achieved, and the elimination of gender disparity in primary education (part of MDG3.a) was reached in 2010.

Online grocery sales rose 12.8% to \u00a33.2bn last year and Philip Clarke was keen to stress how important a multi-channel presence is for the business. Tesco now has five &quot;dark stores&quot;, where employees assemble customers&apos; online orders, to serve its web business. A sixth opens later this year. However, the non-food website Tesco Direct suffered as sales of electrical products were squeezed by competition from the likes of Amazon, while Clarke admitted that Tesco&apos;s in-store displays of electricals were not up to scratch. Bank Tesco began trialling banks in its stores in 2006 and said it hoped to offer current accounts from 2009. It has since expanded into mortgages, insurance and credit cards, but the current account is not set to arrive until 2014. Meanwhile, revenues at the bank slid 2.2% to \u00a31bn and profits dived 15.1% last year as Tesco took a \u00a3115m hit from PPI mis-selling. Tesco&apos;s overseas ventures China Launched 2004 Number of stores: 131( incl 117 hypermarkets)  Revenues: \u00a31.4bn Three years ago Tesco said it wanted to open 80 shopping mall developments in China by 2016, amounting to 40m sq ft of floorspace- bigger than its UK estate. Today it has just over 10m sq ft and recently announced the closure of five under-performing hypermarkets.Its plan for shopping malls has not proved as popular as it hoped and it aims to &quot;refocus on a more profitable approach&quot; in the country. Still, China remains &quot;strategically important&quot; to Tesco. It opened 12 new hypermarkets last year and will launch online groceries in Shanghai later this year, with ambitions to go to up to 50 cities. India Launched 2008 Number of stores: 0  Revenues: \u00a357m Tesco set up a wholesale business and provides 70% of the products used in the Star Bazaar hypermarket chain owned by the Tata group. It had planned to be in the country when law changes allowed foreign retailers to open up \u2013 but a change in government strategy continues to face delays and the business is tiny. Total sales growth fell back to 25%, in local currency, from 40% last year. Tesco says it wants to &quot;refocus on a more profitable approach to growth&quot; Malaysia Launched 2002 Number of stores: 47 Revenues: \u00a3937m (up 6%) Tesco is Malaysia&apos;s biggest operator with 11% market share via a partnership with local group Sime Darby. It is one of only three countries where Tesco saw underlying sales growth last year (0.5%). South Korea (Homeplus)  Launched 1999 Number of stores: 520 (inc 133 hypermarkets) Revenues: \u00a35.3bn (no growth) Tesco is the second largest grocer in South Korea, its biggest and most successful overseas business. Its Homeplus chain, has proved a hotbed of innovation, developing &apos;virtual&apos; stores which allow shoppers to buy items displayed on subway walls via their phones and cultural centres where locals can take classes in everything from the cello to French. Korea is one of three countries where Tesco plans to focus capital investment, but sales have taken a battering since the South Korean government restricted Sunday trading hours in a bid to protect small stores. Tesco said the new laws cost \u00a3100m of profits last year and expects a \u00a330m-\u00a340m hit this year as restrictions continue. Thailand (Tesco Lotus)  Launched 1998 Number of stores: 1,433 (inc 149 hypermarkets) Revenues: \u00a33.7bn Thailand was Tesco&apos;s fastest growing market in 2012 with sales up 16% in total and 3.1% when the impact of new store openings is stripped out. The supermarket controls 15% of Thailand&apos;s grocery market making it the country&apos;s biggest player. Online groceries launched in Bangkok in February and the company says this is one of three international markets where it will focus international investment. Japan Launched 2003 Number of stores: was 121 \u2013 all now sold One of chief executive Philip Clarke&apos;s first major decisions on starting work was to pull out of Japan where the British grocer had struggled to compete in the notoriously tricky market. Tesco was forced to pay local group Aeon \u00a340m to take its loss-making Japanese business off its hands last year and only managed to finally extract itself earlier this year. Czech Republic Launched 1996 Number of stores: 376 Revenues: \u00a31.35bn Tesco is focusing on the internet and almost halting new store openings. Last year it launched an online grocery service and snapped up the Zabka and Koruna chains three years ago. It has begun reducing the size of its largest stores by renting out space to retailers like C&amp;A and Sports Direct. One of the markets worst affected by the economic crisis with four consecutive quarters of declining GDP. Sales fell back 2% last year or 7%. Still Tesco opened seven hypermarkets there last year, and 40 other shops. Hungary Launched 1995 Number of stores: 216 Revenues: \u00a31.8bn Growth stalled completely last year and profits were held back after the government imposed a crisis spending tax three years ago. It was Tesco&apos;s first international business . The supermarket is now market leader but opened just one new hypermarket last year and plans for more are on hold. Poland Launched 1996 Number of stores: 446 Revenues: \u00a32.2bn Tesco says it has no plans for more hypermarkets and is focusing on expanding its online business. Sales slipped back 4% once the impact of new store openings is stripped out. Poland as a whole saw consumer spending slip back in the fourth quarter. Republic of Ireland Launched 1997 Number of stores: 139 Revenues: \u00a32.4bn Tesco now claims to be Ireland&apos;s leading grocer. No major new stores are planned as consumer spending has been hit by austerity measures. Tesco didn&apos;t open any hypermarkets there last year and only five small stores. Underlying sales slipped back 1% as austerity measures continue to bite. Slovakia Launched 1996 Number of stores: 126 Revenues \u00a31.1bn Slovakia is now home to Tesco&apos;s international clothing division, providing non-food stock to all the supermarket&apos;s central European stores. Tesco says it sees Slovakia as one of its strongest positions. Sales rose 6% last year but underlying sales fell 1%. The country is facing serious economic difficulties and is a small market. Turkey (Kipa) Launched 2003 Number of stores: 191 (inc 56 hypermarkets) Revenues \u00a3745m After 10 years in Europe&apos;s most eastern country, Tesco has been forced to scale back its ambitions dramatically. It has dropped plans to open large stores in the East of the country amid intense cost inflation and tough competition. Total sales rose 13% last year but underlying sales were flat and the business made a loss amid high cost price increases. USA (Fresh &amp; Easy) Launched 2007 Number of stores: 199 Revenues: \u00a3700m Tesco said it wanted 1,000 stores across the west coast of the US when it launched its Californian offshoot in November 2007. It booked a loss of \u00a31.2bn on the business, including trading losses for the current year of \u00a3169m, as Tesco confirmed it was quitting the country. Early mistakes such as automatic tills and ready meals were a turn-off for American shoppers.", "tags": ["Tesco", "Supermarkets", "Retail industry", "Business", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-18T07:54:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/19/global-development-podcast-transcript-slavery", "sentences": ["&quot;He brought me to Shanghai to get on the plane and then someone else met me on the other side."], "title": "Global development podcast transcript: modern-day slavery in focus", "article": "AK: Annie Kelly LS: Leonardo Sakamoto BA: Beate Andrees RC: Romana Cacchioli AW: Andrew Wallis AK Hello and welcome to the Global development podcast. I&apos;m Annie Kelly and in this episode we&apos;ll be looking at the hugely complex issue of modern-day slavery. We&apos;ll be asking why more than 150 years after global slavery was abolished, an estimated 21 million people are trapped in some form of forced labour. What does slavery look like in today&apos;s globalised labour market? And who is profiting from the global trade in people? We&apos;ll discuss these issues in just a moment. According to the United Nations, people-trafficking is the world&apos;s third largest criminal industry. And the international labour organisation estimates the profits from global forced labour to be at least $44bn a year. But as we&apos;ll hear later, reliable data on this issue is thin on the ground, making it difficult to really assess the scale and scope of the modern-day slave trade. With me today I have three guests who&apos;ve been tackling these issues head on. But before we get into the discussion let&apos;s hear from Leonardo Sakamoto, a journalist and activist, who&apos;s been tracking forced and bonded labour in the Brazilian Amazon and pioneering what he considers a new approach to ending the criminal exploitation he&apos;s witnessed there. I spoke to him earlier today and started by asking him how the slave trade operates in Brazil. LS Slave labour is illegal in Brazil since May 13 1888, of course, but this kind of exploitation is still used in the way of cutting costs in the very competitive environment. You have slave labour. You have illegal work connected in legal networks of trades, of networks of production in Brazil. AK And can you tell me a bit about the conditions that you&apos;ve witnessed first-hand in Brazil, so the conditions of some of the workers engaged in this kind of forced labour? LS The conditions depends where the place where the workers were found in the slave labour situation. When you see workers in areas in the Amazon, the conditions are the worst possible. The workers don&apos;t receive enough food for their needs. The workers, they must make camps inside the jungle. The workers don&apos;t have access to salaries. The workers are sometimes are threatened to death. And sometimes the workers have to pay for their own tools to work. Sometimes you see very big cattle ranches \u2013 there is a care of the workers that is smaller than the care of the cattle. AK Why or how is this being allowed to continue in Brazil? LS They used to say here in Brazil that slavery is sustained by a tripod: poverty, impunity and greed. And of course poverty is a very bad condition, the lack of opportunities. We&apos;re not talking about just money, we&apos;re talking about the conditions to have a good life. And this is the first. And they push the workers to try jobs in very far places with no share that we receive, for example. Second, we have the impunity even [though] the Brazilian government, Brazilian state, has been getting good goals, good advances [in] the last 18 years of fighting against slavery in the country. We&apos;re still facing problems to get rich people that are using slave labour in jail, for example. And the third, of course, people use slave labour in Brazil not because they are evil, we&apos;re not talking about \u2026 it&apos;s not a moral issue it&apos;s about an economic issue. The people use slave labour in the way to cutting down costs in their production. I like to say that slavery is not a disease, slavery is a symptom. If you take malaria, for example, if you use just a medicine, just a pill to headache you will die. In the same way if you stay and rescue workers, for example, it&apos;s good everybody will see it&apos;s OK, it&apos;s good to rescue workers but we need to go beyond not just rescue workers but to change our model of development; that is the disease. Our model of development excludes concentrate wealth and create problems, for example, to the worker that has their own lands to plant and to produce. And this model is seen in the last ways responsible for the slavery in Brazil. AK Leonardo Sakamoto talking to me earlier from Brazil. So on the panel today: on the line from Beirut we have Beate Andrees, head of the special action programme to combat forced labour at the International Labour Organisation; and with me in the studio Romana Cacchioli from Anti-Slavery International; and Andrew Wallis, the chief executive of Unseen, a UK-based anti-trafficking organisation. Thank you all for taking part. So let&apos;s get into it. What exactly do we mean when we talk about modern-day slavery? Romana, can you help us define this? RC Well for people at the coal face, if you like, in slavery it&apos;s about being treated as property. It&apos;s about being controlled. It&apos;s about a denial of all their rights and I mean all of those rights. It&apos;s about being forced to work, coerced to work under threat. It&apos;s about having your freedom of movement curtailed and, in some cases, people fall into slavery or are forced into slavery because of debt. Other times it&apos;s because of the low status of individuals get caught up in debts or in situations where they can&apos;t remove themselves. So, essentially, for people in slavery, it&apos;s about control and it&apos;s about being treated as property and as a workforce, an engine to be exploited for, usually, commercial gain, for financial gain. AK And Beate, slavery is obviously defined in various international conventions and under various international codes of law. Can you just explain a little bit about that and how slavery is defined on an international legal platform? BA Yes indeed. There are a variety of international instruments to define slavery and related practice such as forced labour, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. The first instrument was adopted in 1926 by the League of Nations, the slavery convention. And then we had subsequent instruments; one, for instance, adopted by the ILO in 1930 defining forced labour. And then the most recent one, the trafficking in persons protocol adopted by the UN in 2000. I think what&apos;s the common element of all these definitions is pretty much what Romana just said; it&apos;s the element of coercion, it&apos;s the element of overbearing a person&apos;s power and it&apos;s often through deceit, false promises, a way of treating people as commodities and not as workers, restraining their free choices and decision-making power over the conditions of their work. So, essentially, the key element is really coercion. These forms of coercion can be very subtle in modern times. People are not held in chains; in most of the cases they are really, in principle, free to, by law at least, to leave, but they are constrained. And that&apos;s precisely what [constitutes] slavery today. AK And that&apos;s a very complex issue isn&apos;t it, because you ask where do you draw that line between cheap labour or exploited labour and then forced or slave labour. I mean \u2026 BA Absolutely. AK Andrew, do you think that part of the problem is that slavery in today&apos;s globalised labour market is really hard to define and it&apos;s really hard for consumers to recognise as well? AW Yes it is. It&apos;s also really important in terms of how we express what slavery is, how we understand it because that then leads to how we&apos;re going to tackle it. So, for me, I think the understanding around it is a form of illicit trade where a human being has been commodified in order to earn their slaver vast profits, in some cases with very little risk of being caught. And so the motivation for someone commodifying and enslaving someone is a financial motivation. Now that then works out in terms of the globalised labour trade because there are two issues at play: one is the demand that we have for cheap goods. And as soon as you put that demand into the equation it works its way down a supply chain and creates vulnerabilities where you&apos;re going to have to have slaves involved. And on the other side you have an illicit trade with very smart business people that are looking to make profit and their commodity is trading in human beings. AK And, Beate, Andrew&apos;s raised some really interesting points there. I wanted to ask you why is it that the ILO uses the term &quot;forced labour&quot; instead of the word &quot;slavery&quot;? Can you tell me about some of the subtleties around that? BA Well first of all it&apos;s because we \u2026 by mandate from the Forced Labour Convention that was adopted in 1930 in which it was very much meant as a complementary tool to the slavery convention, it was meant to address, in particular, state-imposed forced labour, and at the time, forced labour imposed by the colonial states in particular. One problem I have with the notion of trade and the definition which you have in the slavery convention, the condition of ownership, it kinds of misleads us in understanding the more subtle and modern forms of slavery. And I think what you have in the definition of forced labour, the ILO definition, is basically the focus on coercion, it&apos;s the manners of penalty, it&apos;s to understand how people are constrained in their choices. So sometimes these people end up in a situation of forced labour without any deception, without any intermediary; they&apos;re not being traded in a sense as they were traded 200 years ago. They just end up in a situation of forced labour because they&apos;re in a very vulnerable situation and they have no bargaining power. So I think in this sense the definition of forced labour is very helpful because it helps us focus on the exploitation and less so on the transaction that may or may not precede a situation of exploitation. AK I guess one of the problems is when you&apos;ve got a word like coercion it&apos;s really, really hard to define exactly what is coercion and what is willingness on the part of the person who is being exploited. I mean, Romana, in terms of your work at Anti-Slavery International, how do you see those issues playing out? RC I would totally agree with what Beate&apos;s saying, actually. I think that sometimes it is a bit of a distraction really to focus too much on the issue, to sort of look at it in terms of a trade and a movement of people, because actually what we&apos;re really all working towards is to stop the exploitation, the gross exploitation of people. So I also agree with Beate that the Forced Labour Convention is the most helpful because that&apos;s what covers most of the forms, the contemporary forms of slavery today in the world, whether we&apos;re looking at bonded labour in South Asia or even child labour, the worst forms of child labour; trafficking is the movement of people. But at the end of that there has to be an exploitation and, for the most part, that is in labour exploitation; the big numbers of people who are trafficked are in fact trafficked for labour. And the coercion is central. AK And we heard Leonardo earlier saying that this wasn&apos;t a moral issue it was an economic issue, Andrew, would you agree with that? AW I think it can be both because I think in some of the equation, the morality is around the demand that then creates the environment for that slavery to exist. But maybe the dividing line between what is exploitative behaviour and what then tips us over that line into slavery is around the issue of is that person free to leave. So if they&apos;re not, and that could be a whole number of reasons why they can&apos;t leave, they could just be in an exploitative situation but they could walk away from that situation. Is that slavery? For my definition, no, it isn&apos;t, because the moment that someone is not free to leave, they&apos;re coerced and they&apos;re controlled, they&apos;ve become a commodity. And actually that state goes all the way back to slavery thousands of years ago, which is where a human being is a commodity. So in the Roman Empire, the view of a slave was, well, it&apos;s just like a hammer: I can use it as a tool and then if it breaks I just toss it away. That still exists today in terms of that&apos;s what slavery is. So, yes, that&apos;s a moral issue around should a fellow human being be viewed as just a commodity to be used? But then the economic issues are also in play as well, in terms of complex supply chains, the desire to have cheap goods and all of that then plays in and creates an environment in which the illicit trade in human beings can take place. AK It&apos;s probably quite a good moment now to read a comment from theguardian.com. One of our readers, degutsdeybust has just come back from working in India and he can&apos;t believe that the statistic of 21 million people trapped in forced labour can be accurate. But he says maybe it depends on the definitions. And he says: &quot;In India there are around 300 million people who are routinely excluded from normal life because of their caste and many who have no option but to work cleaning out latrines or sewers. How do we address this kind of slavery when people aren&apos;t necessarily forced into this work but when there are no other options? What&apos;s the difference between this and slavery?&quot; Romana, have you got anything to \u2026 RC Yes, I do understand where he&apos;s coming from because it is really hard. And I&apos;m sure Beate will also agree that it&apos;s very difficult to draw the line, so you have a continuum and I think that&apos;s how, as Andrew was saying, a continuum of practices of experiences from the worst end where people are really enslaved, they can&apos;t move, they&apos;re forced to work, all their rights are completely taken away from them; right down to exploitative labour; you know you&apos;re working overtime perhaps and not being paid for it. So a whole continuum range of experiences. In India, it is true and the majority of people who are in bonded labour are from the Dalit or tribal castes. AK Can you just very briefly explain exactly what you mean by bonded labour? RC So, bonded labour is that people are coerced into forced labour, forced to work to pay off a debt. So they&apos;ve incurred a debt often for either subsistence or to pay medical costs or marriage costs or even migration costs; in India that&apos;s what we&apos;re finding more and more is that people are migrating to work, they have to take a loan and then they end up working and not being paid and not being aware how much they owe. And that debt, then with interest, accrues and they may not be able to leave that job. They may be coerced, forced to work under threat of violence. And so there are many, many hundreds of thousands of people who are really in that very dire situation. But discrimination is pervasive in India and not everybody who is a Dalit or from a tribal group will be in a situation of bonded or forced labour. AK So, Beate, you heard there that our commenter doesn&apos;t believe that the ILO&apos;s figure of 21 million people can be accurate. Do you believe that it truly reflects the scale of the problem on a global level? BA Well, absolutely, otherwise we wouldn&apos;t have published it. But I should probably include one caveat and we said it very clearly in our report: that this is based on the best possible methodology and data available today. We think it is a conservative number, it could well be higher, it&apos;s unlikely that it is lower. But as long as we don&apos;t have reliable national estimates, we can&apos;t have a more reliable figure. Now, of course, it depends a little bit, the scale of the problem, and the measurement depends on how you define it, that&apos;s very clear. We have based our estimate on the ILO&apos;s definition of forced labour, which means that the cases we have verified and counted as a forced labour case have to have an element or coercion. So the simple fact that you are in a vulnerable situation in itself is not forced labour. There has to be an intent on the part of the employer, the abuser, to exploit the person for financial gain. AK Andrew, really briefly, what conclusions do you believe we can draw from the fact that the ILO is saying that this is a conservative estimate because it&apos;s only based on the available national data that it&apos;s been able to acquire? AW I think there&apos;s three issues at play. One is the issue around definition; what are we talking about and where&apos;s the dividing line between what&apos;s slavery and what isn&apos;t? Whenever you have definitions that you&apos;ve got to get governments to agree to you always have a race to the bottom; what&apos;s the lowest common denominator that everybody can agree on. So that then immediately skews your figures, I would argue. Secondly, I think there&apos;s a systemic fear at government level and a society level to actually be honest and say, regardless of abolishing slavery 200 plus years ago, we still have slavery. So I think we have to have that honest debate at government level, at society level, that says this is still a problem that exists. Therefore you then get the impetus to actually shine a light on it. And that then leads to the data issue, which you know the ILO have identified it, we identified it in terms of the report that&apos;s just come out, which is to try and get hard and fast data is next to impossible for all the reasons that have just been listed. But also I think it&apos;s just this, do we want to lift this rock knowing underneath there&apos;s this gunk that we&apos;ve got to look at. And my observation is we don&apos;t.

AK So, as we&apos;ve been discussing, slavery is a global problem and I wanted to try and really unpick what are the big underlying structural causes of the modern day slave trade. Romana? RC A weak legal framework; so weak laws, weak enforcement; where we have laws they&apos;re not enforced. Discrimination, because often the people who are in situations of slavery come from groups that are marginalised in society and so they&apos;re very vulnerable. Other factors which, sort of push factors, if you like, can be conflict, migration and food scarcity issues which force families and their children out to work; it&apos;s a whole myriad really of push factors and reasons why slavery continues today and is with us today. Is that the question you asked me, I can&apos;t remember? AK And, Beate, have you got anything to add to that from your work collecting this data in your office at the ILO? BA I think Romana has summarised it very nicely. The key structural causes are very much linked to big institutions in a broad sense, not just laws but also ministries, governance in a broader sense. And the other one we see very clearly coming out of all of our research is indeed discrimination. AK Andrew, your organisation, Unseen, was recently involved in a study looking at the scale of modern slavery here in the UK. What were the main points that you took from that? AW So the Centre for Social Justice commissioned in effect what was a two-year, evidence-led review of what was the state of modern slavery in the United Kingdom. So, yes, it was UK-focused but obviously we were all aware of the global context. I think right off the top what we discovered was a lack of leadership on this issue. And probably problematic within that as well was wanting to see the issue framed just within an immigration debate. And yet if you look at the legal structure, the UK, and increasingly around the globe, what you have is legislation that views it as a criminal act. So you have a perpetrator of a crime and you have a victim of crime. And in the globalised world we need to move it away from just being a debate about immigration and I think we need to move it back to being a debate about: here is a crime that&apos;s taken place. We also found that data was a big issue, which, in trying to ask the question what is the size of the problem, we took the decision very early on that we would not be able to answer that question. So here&apos;s a first-world country, and the UK government would admit this as well, that we have no handle on the data. The only data we have are those that have chosen to access the government&apos;s care programme. But we know, as an organisation, that isn&apos;t the true figure; and whether you talk to law enforcement, statutory agencies, everybody will tell you that is not a true figure. AK And obviously behind that data are the people who are affected by this globalised labour situation. Let&apos;s hear from someone now with direct experience of being trafficked into the UK. Last week, reporter Harriet Grant interviewed a young woman originally from China, who says she was a victim of forced labour by a criminal gang. Her name&apos;s been changed to protect her identity. HG In a cramped bedsit in a northern English town Min talks about the man who brought her here from China. She tells me that her family were being harassed by the police because they were followers of the banned spiritual group Falun Gong. So her grandmother put her into the hands of a man who said he could help her get to Britain, where he said the government would offer her protection and the chance of a new life.  &quot;He brought me to Shanghai to get on the plane and then someone else met me on the other side. He brought me to a house where I stayed for a long time. I was just locked inside the house. They told me that I could not escape and if I tried they would kill my grandmother in China, that it was dangerous for me to escape.&quot;  After taking a boat, then a train, still confused about where she was, their final destination was a cannabis factory in England where she was again held prisoner.  &quot;I had to tend to the plants, water, pick them and fertilise them. They said that if I didn&apos;t my grandmother would have to pay money and that if I escaped they would kill her. I was really scared.&quot;  In 2008, the police discovered the factory and closed it down. Despite telling them what had happened to her, Min was charged with cannabis cultivation and sentenced to 12 months in prison. It was only after she finished the sentence that the UK Border Agency acknowledged she was reasonably likely to be a victim of trafficking. Last year they wrote to Min saying that because she escaped from that situation, she cannot now be described as a victim of trafficking, even though they do accept she was under the control of her trafficker when arrested. The letter tells her that as a foreign criminal, she&apos;s now subject to deportation for the public good. Min has a life in England now. She&apos;s pregnant and frightened about being sent home where her trafficker might find her. There&apos;s a test case at the Court of Appeal in May that is going to look at four cases similar to Min&apos;s. When I spoke to Min&apos;s lawyer, Hani Zubeidi at Fadiga &amp; Co, he told me that he hopes these cases will set a precedent which will allow Min to challenge her own conviction. Until then she waits, unable to sleep at night, fearful of being sent home, branded a foreign criminal. AK That was Harriet Grant reporting and you can read the full Observer article at theguardian.com. So, Andrew, what does Min&apos;s case tell us about the failure of international efforts to tackle trafficking? AW Unfortunately her case is atypical. Just going through her story, you&apos;ve got issues of a misunderstanding around immigration; you have criminalisation of a victim; you have identification of that victim but then being told but you&apos;re still an immigrant therefore we&apos;re going to turf you out of the country. So not only do we not recognise the victim, but we then penalise that victim. And then that plays into other issues around what is the awareness within statutory agencies and front-line agencies of what is being presented in front of them. Is it a cannabis factory with a drug cultivator; or is it actually a victim of crime who is there against their will, who, under the threat of violence, coercion, fear of retribution to their family is held there and will work there? And then behind that you have, well, why are they in this country producing cannabis in the first place? Because society wants a demand for it. The UK is now net exporter of cannabis. So there&apos;s your pull factor into the UK. And where&apos;s our reintegration of survivors? That individual remains vulnerable. If returned to the situation where they&apos;ve come from, in all likelihood will be retrafficked. And so there are so many issues at play that just basically shows you, to quote The Thick of It, an omnishambles of a response. AK And, Beate, do you have a response to that? Obviously, that goes back to a lot of what you were saying when you were defining forced labour for us at the beginning of the programme. BA Yes, absolutely. You have all the elements here: the deception, restriction of the freedom of movements, where that&apos;s a clear case of trafficking. And what it really shows is the failure of identification systems. It should have been, from the beginning, this person should have received assistance, there should have been no doubts about her circumstances. And yet it just didn&apos;t happen. And it&apos;s very symptomatic, particularly for workers and sectors that are informal, so, obviously, cannabis production is an illegal activity in most countries, but also the sex industry is a very typical, not being protected as victims of forced labour. The same is true for other activities like forced begging or more formal activities, domestic work and even construction and so on. So I think it&apos;s a clear problem here to properly identify potential victims and then provide them with the necessary care. AK OK. And we had a question from a listener that kind of ties into this. ValentinaCaron, who worked for an NGO in Cambodia, this is what she wrote to us. She said: &quot;It&apos;s a shame that western donors rarely include activities like police training, I&apos;m not saying that giving money for children&apos;s education is less important, but I feel that police training could really change the legal environment in which the Cambodian people live. Without an effective implementation of the international standards that bind Cambodia, it would never be possible to have this justice.&quot; She&apos;s offering some kind of solution. Romana, obviously Anti-Slavery International, a global organisation, have you seen these kind of issues that play around \u2026 RC Absolutely. I think we would all agree that we need better training and awareness-raising amongst law enforcement. But immigration officers, particularly on many of the borders in the global south, but also immigration officers in Europe, but all criminal justice actors. So for the UK it would be about the CPS, the Crown Prosecution Service, clearly being able to access, not just the police being able to identify a potential victim of trafficking but it&apos;s also the criminal justice actors all the way through, right through to judges. And also being able to communicate that to juries in trafficking trials so that clearly victims&apos; stories are well represented because they&apos;re very complex stories often. If we look at a couple of cases that have been held here in the UK on domestic servitude, trafficking for domestic servitude, where you&apos;ve got issues around witchcraft and how children have been, or adults have been controlled through issues around witchcraft, this really needs to be unpacked, so there has to be a real understanding by all actors that are working to what are the patterns of trafficking, what are the coercive methods that are used? And what are the areas of exploitation, because as we&apos;ve heard, cannabis \u2026 who would have thought that people are being trafficked into cannabis a few years ago? So this is an emerging area where now we&apos;re finding people are being trafficked into criminal activities like forced begging, many Roma and Bulgarians on the streets of London and elsewhere that are being forced to beg. And this is a new area. AK Do you think that part of the problem is, is that it has evolved, it has changed? So if you ask maybe the average person on the street here in the UK: what is slavery today? they may think of children in brick kilns in Pakistan; they may not think that it happens here in the UK or in other developed nations. And I just wonder whether there was that problem with the language that&apos;s being used, people not understanding the different types of modern day slavery that are going on; what&apos;s the difference between someone who&apos;s been trafficked, what&apos;s the difference between that and migration patterns? It&apos;s a very complex language being used. RC It is complex. And it&apos;s also going back to that image of expecting people in slavery to be in chains, and it&apos;s not at all like that now. And it&apos;s not just people being locked into factories. It&apos;s also people, you know, could be working in a bar or in restaurants, in construction, so forced labour situations are really around us all the time. It&apos;s just that we&apos;re not seeing it in that sort of framework, really. AK And Beate was mentioning earlier that she felt that there had been progress made by some national governments in acknowledging this problem; I was wondering in terms of the anti-slavery movement, the NGOs, the civil society groups who are working on this issue, do you believe that you&apos;re really making an impact in global efforts to end slavery? RC I think we are. Sometimes I think it&apos;s a drop in the ocean. But I think agree with Beate there has been a movement over the last few years to recognise the issue and the importance of the issue. Over the last 10 years the issue has become more and more at the top of the political agenda. Of course we&apos;re not there yet. I wouldn&apos;t want to pat anybody on the back, we need to do a lot more. In terms of civil society I think there are lots more \u2026 we&apos;ve got business that are coming on board now as well, so I think it&apos;s about everybody being involved in this campaign, everybody being aware of what it is and being able to identify it and report it to the authorities when they see it. AK And Andrew, you actually come from a corporate background, don&apos;t you? I was wondering what your views on this might be? Do you think that things need to change if we&apos;re really going to make strides forward? AW I&apos;m going to be slightly controversial and I think what we&apos;ve got better at is identifying it. Have we got better at eradicating it? I don&apos;t think we have. And I think it&apos;s an issue of systems process. So systems deliver processes and deliver results. And if you look across the globe and say, well, what are the results five years, 10 years, 100 years? The results are we have slaves. The results are: there are very few prosecutions. The results are: it&apos;s a high-return, low-risk industry to be involved in. And if you approach it as a commercial business, and back to what I was saying earlier about let&apos;s frame it as an illicit trade, and let&apos;s understand that the people that get involved in this and turn human beings into a commodity are doing it for business reasons, they&apos;re doing it to make money, they&apos;re doing it to get a return on their commodity. Then, are we winning? No, we&apos;re not. And I think there&apos;s a whole list of reasons why we&apos;re not. I think governments are glued to bureaucratic response and traffickers are, like, fair enough, carry on doing that, because we&apos;re fast, we&apos;re nimble, we&apos;re lean and mean and we can evolve. So I actually think we need to be honest with ourselves, be it the NGO community, government community or the business community, and say are we actually tackling this and dismantling it? And I would say we&apos;re not. I think we can do it. I think the tools are there to enable us to do it, but is the will there, is the political will there, is the will there amongst NGOs to do it, is the will there within society to change practices that create the demand and the pulls for slavery to exist? AK So, our appetite for cheap products as well, I imagine? AW For sure. RC I do hear what you&apos;re saying, Andrew, but I do also think that things have come a long way, honestly, in the last 10 years. We wouldn&apos;t have been having this conversation. It was really difficult to get any journalist or anybody to talk about slavery and forced labour. And just in the last 10 years, when you see the proliferation of NGOs just in the UK working on this issue. I mean for a very long time, Anti-Slavery International was one of the only organisations working, and the ILO of course, Beate of course, and so there&apos;s a lot more awareness. I mean, clearly, there&apos;s a lot more to do. Clearly, in terms of business needs to also take its responsibilities. We need a transparent supply chain which is audited and that audit needs to be transparent. And we need accountability. Governments, yes, we do need to make it more of a priority but I do think we are making steps, I don&apos;t want to be the doom and gloom merchant, there are solutions out there because I&apos;ve seen communities change. Empowerment can happen quite quickly. AK And, Beate, are you optimistic about the way forward? BA It&apos;s an area where change will only emerge very slowly, because it&apos;s linked to a change of attitudes and behaviours of different groups of people, be it government, business and the people concerned. I&apos;d like to come back quickly on the economic interest, because Andrew is also right in saying that as long as we don&apos;t understand these economic drivers, we won&apos;t really move the agenda forward. And that&apos;s very true. I mean, that&apos;s one of the reasons why we have worked on the profit figures, we will produce a new figure this year, it&apos;s most likely to be much higher than the one you have quoted in the beginning. We need to understand the economic interest and we need to get business involved. And it&apos;s very much on the ILO&apos;s agenda. AK Fabulous. So, in conclusion, we need to really understand the money and who&apos;s profiting and understand it as a criminal business as well. Well, I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s all we&apos;ve got time for today. My thanks to my guests: Beate Andrees; Romana Cacchioli; Andrew Wallis; Leonardo Sakamoto and Harriet Grant and Min.

Two panda cubs fall from the bamboo platform where they&apos;ve been playing. Cheng Shuang and Cheng Dui are seven months old and without doubt the cutest animals I&apos;ve ever seen. It&apos;s 8am at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in western China, and for a few precious minutes I&apos;m alone watching the two youngsters. It&apos;s like a real-life cartoon, with all the sound effects \u2013 thump, thwack, bang, crash, eek, splat \u2013 as they roll, bite each other and tumble slowly off their bamboo platform on to the grass. Their mother, Cheng Ji, keeps on chewing her bamboo breakfast, unconcerned. Panda tourism is big business in China. Each year 800,000 people visit the country&apos;s best-known centre at Chengdu \u2013 which is almost 2,000km southwest of Beijing. If you like your animals black, white and unabashedly cuddly, this is the place to be. There are 41\u00a0panda reserves across China and seven are open to the public, including the zoos in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. But Chengdu is\u00a0the easiest to get to, and it will get even easier when British Airways begins direct flights. To reach Chengdu, we drive through the Qin Ling mountains where, we are told, a small number of pandas still paw around the forests. But they are so threatened that they are heavily protected and it is virtually impossible to see pandas in the wild. The closest we get is spotting a\u00a0sign saying: &quot;Home of the Panda&quot;. According to the Chinese State Forestry Bureau there are only 1,600 pandas in the wild, with some 300 in captivity, but even those figures may be optimistic: the United Nations reports just 800 wild pandas remaining. So Chengdu, with its 70\u00a0residents, is panda central (40\u00a0more are on loan around the world). This could soon be the only way to see pandas \u2013 research published last November claimed that global warming is set to wipe out much of the bamboo the bears rely on for food. Chengdu wouldn&apos;t necessarily strike you as a great place for a\u00a0nature reserve. A city of 14 million people produces a lot of pollution, and a\u00a0yellow haze hangs over its valley. The locals joke that dogs from Chengdu bark when they see the sun because they don&apos;t know what it is. But once we&apos;ve inched through traffic for an hour to the panda base, the smog lifts. The 100-hectare site is built on the hillsides, and we walk through bamboo groves and little woodlands of cherry and almond laced with winter jasmine. Spring is a great time to visit \u2013 Chengdu is basking in a balmy 20C, and everywhere trees are in blossom. Pandas dislike temperatures over about 25C, when they retreat to their air-conditioned cave cages. But at this stage of the year they&apos;re at their most lively, out and about, climbing trees; as pandas are born in mid-to-late summer, it is also the time to see the youngest cubs at play. I arrive at the Sunshine Nursery House, home to the baby pandas, as the gates open. The animals live in large enclosures made as much like their natural habitat as possible, with trees, rocks, streams and pools. Neither am I watching from behind glass: the enclosures have a ha-ha to keep the tourists out and the pandas in. So I&apos;m standing, alone, with Cheng Ji and her cubs less than 10ft away. The juveniles are not dissimilar to a group of human teenagers, jumping on each other in a bundle and trying to beat each other to the best food. They often stop doing something \u2013 climbing, playing, fighting, eating \u2013 midway through and fall asleep, as if their batteries have run out. One of the centre&apos;s educationalists, Bo Xiang, tells me that pandas absorb just 20% of what they eat. That requires hours of eating: a typical day is a heady round of eating, sleeping and pooing. Acting as a volunteer for the morning gets you closer to the pandas, so I sign myself up for some poo picking. Robed fetchingly in turquoise overalls, with plastic shoe covers and gloves, I set to work on the morning clean of Ouu Ji&apos;s cage. Ouu Ji is a bit of a celebrity; when he was born six years ago he was the smallest baby panda ever to survive. Part of my job is to feed him treats of apple on a long bamboo pole, and he squeaks with excitement at his ration as I reach it towards him.     An apple a day: Hazel feeds Ouu Ji a treat. Photograph: Clare Kendall    We head for Renmin Park, in the centre of Chengdu, a great destination for people watching when you&apos;ve had enough of all things furry. A cacophony greets us even before we&apos;ve walked through the gates, and the reason is soon apparent \u2013 the park is home to one of China&apos;s favourite pastimes: square dancing. Eight groups, each with enormous loudspeakers, are competing to be the loudest. In the centre of the park 60 elderly Chinese men and women are strutting their stuff &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;, po-faced with concentration. Round the corner, on bamboo poles, are posted details of people available for marriage. Relatives and friends charged with finding them a partner guard the poles, and, flatteringly, I&apos;m propositioned several times. Later we head for Kuan and Zhai Lanes, streets that were once part of a Qing dynasty garrison. Their ornately tiled roofs are a whisper of the old China that&apos;s largely been bulldozed. They&apos;re full of tea shops and bars, and a great place to unwind. But, however memorable that Gangnam dance was, it&apos;s the pandas that are going to stay with me. With the species&apos;s future in the balance, Chengdu&apos;s visitors help to fund a new reserve where it is hoped pandas will ultimately be reintroduced into the wild. &quot;We want future generations to see the pandas,&quot; Bo Xiang says to me. Having seen these engaging, charming animals up close, so do I. Essentials Hazel travelled with On the Go Tours (onthegotours.com; 020 7371 1113).

On a cool spring day, trade is modest but steady, with no hint of the economic malaise that some investors fear is about to grip the world&apos;s second largest economy. While the markets fret about a collapse in China&apos;s huge shadow banking system, there is nothing covert about the shoppers at Sparkle Roll Plaza or the goods they are examining. For the pessimists, problems that have been lurking beneath the surface glitter are starting to appear. Three months ago, the sense was that carefully calibrated policy action by Beijing would ensure strong growth with low inflation. But last week, the fears of a hard landing were back. Put simply, the concern is that China in 2013 is the US in 2007 \u2013 about to experience its very own sub-prime crisis. Exhibit number one in the prosecution case is that the property market is running hot. The cost of real estate in Beijing is 8% up on a year ago; in Shanghai, prices are up by more than 6%. In both cities, house price inflation is accelerating. Exhibit number two is debt. Last week, the ratings agency Fitch downgraded China&apos;s sovereign rating amid concerns about the debt amassed by local government to fund an expansion in infrastructure spending in 2011. The new government in Beijing sees tackling the local government debt timebomb as a priority, but some officials say privately it is already too late. Exhibit number three is that growth is both unbalanced and slowing. China&apos;s expansion, despite moves towards stronger consumer demand in the past four years, is still reliant on investment and exports. Much of the capital spending has been on inefficient enterprises that are now struggling due to rising wages and competition from other developing nations. So while China&apos;s growth rate at 7.7% in the year to March was still strong, it was weaker than the 8% expected. Nor is business in the high-end shopping malls as brisk as it was. The businesswomen barking into their mobile phones while fingering coats have helped push up retail spending by 12.2% for the year ending in the first quarter of 2013. But that was down from 15.2% three months earlier. According to one salesman, his big sellers are scarves \u2013 wool for winter and silk for spring and summer. With prices of around 4,000 yuan (\u00a3423), these provide the most accessible means to buy into the Burberry check. &quot;The iconic pieces such as trench coats and jackets are also very popular,&quot; he adds, admitting that the high-fashion, high-price Prorsum range is not flying off the shelves. Analyst Albert Edwards of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said a recent trip to Asia had left him concerned about the vulnerability of the Chinese growth engine, particularly in the light of the fall in the value of the Japanese currency. &quot;A sliding yen comes at a time when China&apos;s balance of payments situation has deteriorated and a pronounced real exchange-rate appreciation has triggered a reversal in investment flows. To me, this closely echoes the situation in the runup to the 1997 Asian currency crisis,&quot; Edwards said. These problems should be put into perspective. China&apos;s recovery from the slump of 2008-09 has been impressive. While industrial production in Europe and the US is still below its pre-crash levels, in China it is 76% higher. Germany, France, the UK or the US can only dream of the 7.7% growth seen in China over the past year. Nor is it rare for emerging countries to suffer often painful boom-busts during a period of rapid expansion. The US had regular financial crises in the second half of the 19th century, during a period of industrial take-off. But after three decades of spectacular growth, China is now pivotal to the global economy. A crash, even a relatively brief one, would send the crisis of the past five years into a dangerous phase.", "tags": ["Global economy", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Business", "Economics", "Banking"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-20T23:03:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/22/michael-gove-school-holidays-error", "sentences": ["In China, holidays seem to start in early July and end in late August, while in high-performing Shanghai last year they seemed to run from 28 June to 23\u00a0August: eight weeks."], "title": "Education in brief: Is Michael Gove right about shorter holidays?", "article": "Holiday facts England&apos;s schools should think about lengthening the working day and cutting the holidays, as this seems to work in the Far East, Michael Gove told reporters last week. This won coverage for different practices in some academy schools. But is his claim about what goes on in the far east true? It seems not, at least in respect of summer holidays. He was reported as saying we should emulate Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Vietnam. But in Singapore there is a long school break this year, from 16 November to 31 December, which is six weeks. In Hong Kong , the government specifies an annual minimum of 190 teaching days, the same as here. In China, holidays seem to start in early July and end in late August, while in high-performing Shanghai last year they seemed to run from 28 June to 23\u00a0August: eight weeks. Most European countries have summer holidays of at least nine weeks. We recently fact-checked a claim from Gove about &quot;easy&quot; science GCSE questions. We&apos;re beginning to wonder if this column needs to fact-check every time the education secretary speaks. It&apos;s a bad, bad world It&apos;s fair to say that England&apos;s new &quot;national&quot; curriculum \u2013 &quot;national&quot; is in quotes as it won&apos;t apply to academies \u2013 is not proving universally popular. Last month, Gove went on the offensive  against 100 academics who wrote a letter to complain that the proposed 2014 curriculum &quot;promotes rote learning without understanding&quot;. There has been a petition signed by 2,500 people, led by teacher Debra Kidd, and a letter endorsed by broadcaster David Attenborough and prominent environmentalists criticising the apparent downgrading of discussions on climate change in geography. But this only scratches the surface of complaints. Other recent developments include a Historical Association survey of 1,600 teachers, which found only 4% saying the proposed history curriculum was a positive development and 96% saying it was too prescriptive. Another petition organised by schoolgirl Esha Marwaha about the climate change move now has nearly 30,000 signatures. A survey by the charity Hamilton Maths Projects has seen more than 11,000 teachers saying that some topics \u2013 such as long multiplication and division \u2013 should not be taught too early in pupils&apos; lives. There are 102 signatories, including some leading subject associations, to a union-led petition saying the new curriculum will not raise standards, while a protest on the 38 Degrees website has nearly 2,000 signatures. The business lobby group the CBI said the curriculum &quot;doesn&apos;t pass the test&quot; while Score, representing five science organisations, said the science curriculum &quot;will not achieve its aims&quot; and &quot;lacks coherence&quot;. Robin Alexander, who led an exhaustive review of primary education from 2006 to 2010, wrote of concerns the curriculum was &quot;educationally unsound and evidentially questionable&quot; while Mary James, Cambridge University professor and a member of Gove&apos;s expert group on the curriculum, has written that the proposals &quot;seem a massive and rushed experiment&quot;. There is the odd voice in support, including the Royal Geographical Society and the English Association. But perhaps it is understandable if Gove wants to talk about other things, like holidays. Restricted mobility Why is the new board of the Sutton Trust, the charity that promotes social mobility, dominated by white males from banking and finance? Of the 18 members, 14 have investment backgrounds, while four are directors or former directors of the banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. There are only three women, only one member is from an ethnic minority and none seems to have teaching experience. Asked to comment, the trust, which has backed at least one policy with a corporate ring to it \u2013 performance pay for teachers \u2013 said the board was &quot;composed of people who are making substantial financial contributions to the work of the trust, either individually or through their foundations&quot;. It added: &quot;The trust works closely with thousands of teachers each year.&quot; Going for Roke Parents at a school facing &quot;forced academy&quot; status are livid after the Harris chain advertised for a new headteacher before a consultation exercise on the proposal had finished. The advert for a new head of Roke primary school, in Kenley, Surrey, appeared on Friday, the final day of a consultation \u2013 also carried out by Harris \u2013 on whether or not the school should re-open in September under the Harris Federation. Parent Joanna Hearn said: &quot;How can they advertise the job when there is a consultation still taking place?&quot; Harris says it has advertised now because &quot;headteachers need to give notice by 31 May if they wish to take up the post in September \u2026 and we needed to allow time for a fair and thorough selection process&quot;.", "tags": ["School holidays", "Academies", "National curriculum", "Schools", "Education", "Social mobility", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-22T18:45:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/23/nepal-china-tibet-india-araniko-highway", "sentences": ["Chhetri has never been any further along Highway 318, which leads to Lhassa and ultimately to Shanghai, more than 5,000km further east."], "title": "China's Nepalese friendship road leads to the heart of India's market", "article": "The Araniko highway, which connects Kathmandu to Nepal&apos;s border with China, is more a narrow strip of tarmac or beaten earth snaking its way for 115km between ravines and peaks. It would be deadly were it not for the extraordinary dexterity of the bus and lorry drivers who negotiate its bends, working some sort of permanent miracle. The view is breathtaking, if you dare take your eyes off the road. But in Khadichaur no one complains about the highway traffic thundering past. A few years ago this small town, on the banks of the Sun Koshi river, became known as Chinatown. Here you can find all the goods its powerful neighbour manufactures so cheaply: phones, clothes, shoes, televisions, soft toys and such. Bhairav Chhetri runs a shop selling blankets, all &quot;Made in China&quot;. &quot;Business is OK but the competition is increasingly stiff,&quot; he says. &quot;Five years ago there were only about 20 shops here. Now there are nearly 100.&quot; Other shopping towns are appearing along the highway. Chhetri makes regular trips across the border to stock up. He travels the 35km as far as Kodari, on the border, by coach or lorry, then walks several kilometres through no man&apos;s land, and crosses the narrow Friendship bridge to enter Zhangmu in Tibet. He buys from wholesalers, all of them Han Chinese. &quot;All the dealing is done in Nepalese,&quot; the shopkeeper explains. &quot;They&apos;ve learned the language. They&apos;re smart.&quot; He hires Nepalese porters to carry his goods back to Kodari, where he pays about 15% of the purchase value in duty. Chhetri has never been any further along Highway 318, which leads to Lhassa and ultimately to Shanghai, more than 5,000km further east. This road has become the main route for the spread of Chinese influence into Tibet and beyond. Chinese goods are on sale in Kathmandu and other places in Nepal. But not all the lorries are destined for Nepal: some carry their wares on into India. The Araniko highway, regularly blocked by monsoon landslides, has thus become an improbable vector for globalisation, bearing almost $200m worth of goods a year. The highway is also testimony to Beijing&apos;s methodical conquest of new territory. The road was built in the 1960s, thanks to Chinese funds, replacing a track barely wide enough for two yaks to pass. Now China is planning to widen the road. At the end of 2012 the former Chinese ambassador in Nepal, Yang Houlan, officially opened a huge container depot outside Kodari. A larger bridge will be built alongside the existing one, to allow lorries to cross. Kodari is still the only legal point of entry between China and Nepal, two countries with a common border stretching for 1,400km. But other routes will be cut through the Himalayas. A 17km stretch of mule track between Gyirong in Tibet and Syapru Besi, across the border, is being turned into a proper road, at a cost of $20m. China also plans to extend the railway line from Lhassa to Shigatse, Tibet&apos;s second-largest city, as far as Kathmandu, and to build a new airport at Pokhara, Nepal, opening the way for visitors and goods. China is investing billions in Nepal, one of the world&apos;s poorest countries and traditionally part of India&apos;s sphere of influence. It is building infrastructure for transport, telecommunications and hydroelectric power. Yang set out Beijing&apos;s intentions in an interview published by the Nepalese daily Republica last December, explaining that in economic terms Nepal was a corridor connecting China to south Asia. Or in other words a way into India and its huge market. The two giants are on chilly terms and their long common border, a subject of constant dispute, is closed and militarised. Yet the volume of trade is soaring, reaching $60bn in 2010, with the balance largely in China&apos;s favour. Beijing has invested in the port at Kolkata, and now it is buying overland access through the Himalayas. &quot;Nepal will be a friendship bridge between China and India,&quot; said the Maoist prime minister of Nepal, Baburam Bhattarai, who was ousted in March. Delhi is afraid it will be more of a Trojan horse, concerned at the prospect of a massive influx of Chinese goods, served by the free-trade agreement linking the two countries. In exchange for its largesse, Beijing has demanded that Nepal recognise the annexation of Tibet and repression of political opposition there. The joint statement issued during a brief visit to Kathmandu in January 2012 by the then prime minister Wen Jiabao, the first in 10 years, was perfectly clear on this point: &quot;Both Taiwan and Tibet are integral parts of the Chinese territory. The Nepalese side firmly supports the efforts made by the Chinese side to uphold state sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity, and does not allow any forces to use Nepalese territory for any anti-China or separatist activities.&quot; Restrictions have since been placed on campaigning by the 20,000 Tibetans exiled in Nepal. On 10 March a demonstration to mark the anniversary of the 1959 uprising was banned. Any &quot;anti-Chinese activity&quot; is punished, despite the lack of any firm legal basis. Unfortunately Tibetan monks burning themselves to death will make little difference to the balance of power. \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "tags": ["Nepal", "World news", "China", "India", "Asia Pacific", "Tibet", "Economics", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-04-23T13:01:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/apr/23/iron-man-3-chinese-puzzle", "sentences": ["With an eye, like everyone else, on a fistful of yuan, Iron Man franchise-holders Disney and Marvel partnered with Shanghai-based media agency DMG, who also helped produce Looper last year, for the third film.", "It&apos;s essentially the same piece of blockbuster chinoiserie that we&apos;re seeing more and more these days as the studios make eyes at China: like The Karate Kid remake&apos;s relocation to Beijing (still with an American protagonist), the Asian-scented water approach of GI Joe: Retaliation, or James Bond&apos;s luminescent Shanghai skyscraper fight in Skyfall."], "title": "Iron Man 3 illustrates a Chinese puzzle Hollywood is hoping to solve", "article": "     There&apos;s all sorts of meta-cinematic devilry going on in one of the strangest blockbusters of the decade \u2013 Iron Man 3.

With an eye, like everyone else, on a fistful of yuan, Iron Man franchise-holders Disney and Marvel partnered with Shanghai-based media agency DMG, who also helped produce Looper last year, for the third film. But the suggestion last summer that Tony Stark might be making a radical turn towards China never quite transpired. The Mandarin was tactfully steered away from the yellow-peril caricature of the comics, becoming a prototypical icon of terrorism instead. Some scenes were filmed in Beijing in December; Fifth Generation veteran Wang Xueqi appears in an early party scene, and more of this material \u2013 including a cameo for starlet Fan Bingbing \u2013 will appear in a special Chinese cut. And that&apos;s it. Another cheap American knockoff. It&apos;s essentially the same piece of blockbuster chinoiserie that we&apos;re seeing more and more these days as the studios make eyes at China: like The Karate Kid remake&apos;s relocation to Beijing (still with an American protagonist), the Asian-scented water approach of GI Joe: Retaliation, or James Bond&apos;s luminescent Shanghai skyscraper fight in Skyfall. Iron Man 3&apos;s tweaks are enough to secure it a host of preferential perks in terms of media access \u2013 Robert Downey Jr&apos;s charm offensive (&quot;I live a very Chinese life in America&quot;) at the Forbidden City at the beginning of the month wouldn&apos;t have been possible otherwise. But a full-blooded commitment to Chinese elements that would have secured it full co-production status (meaning, among other things, the highest box-office share possible) would have endangered Iron Man 3&apos;s universal global appeal too much. Unfortunately, Hollywood&apos;s ersatz &quot;fortune cookie&quot; approach to its Chinese product probably won&apos;t work for much longer. Increasingly discriminating Chinese filmgoers are seeking entertainment that unabashedly speaks for them, and the local industry is increasingly able to provide it. Since the turn of the year, Hollywood has slipped behind not because of the Chinese government&apos;s anti-competitive practices, but because of a stream of hits from Chinese film-makers. Low-budget comedy Lost in Thailand was a surprise hit in December, followed by Jackie Chan&apos;s Chinese Zodiac and more martial arts from Wong Kar-wai&apos;s The Grandmaster. Stephen Chow&apos;s comeback film Journey to the West was another predictable rainmaker, but there was also a pair of breakout performers in cable TV spin-off Bring Happiness Home and romcom Finding Mr Right. And more are on their way. A formidable showing, then, for homegrown Chinese films in 2013&apos;s first quarter. Lost in Thailand, Chinese Zodiac and Journey to the West all grossed $100m+ at home \u2013 and it&apos;s been a year since a Hollywood import (Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol) managed that. Despite the oriental mood music, Skyfall disappointed in China compared to Daniel Craig&apos;s first two outings \u2013 taking just under $60m. Could this be the start of a divergence of tastes that will make US films try a lot harder to woo Chinese audiences? Buying preferential treatment and milking the PR works for single, high-impact projects such as Iron Man 3, but it&apos;s hardly the kind of comprehensive rethinking needed by the studios to be seriously in the running against local competitors operating with Hollywood savvy. There will come a point when the Chinese, quite understandably, want a Chinese Iron Man.     More martial arts ... Zhang Ziyi in Wong Kar-wai's The Grandmaster. Photograph: AP    Hollywood, therefore, seems likely to fall between two stools for the next few years. It&apos;s the first time a single foreign territory has become so important to it so quickly \u2013 Japan is a similar size, but it&apos;s not promising 30% growth over the coming years \u2013 yet the demands of the global market still need to considered. No one has worked out how to consistently find a crossover sweet spot, where global and Chinese audiences overlap. Looper seems to have been the closest so far, with its healthy grosses in the US, China, the UK and Australia. But it was still a bit of a gauche compromise, the Chinese dimension added midway through production by DMG: potential remained to aggressively play off the film&apos;s retro midwest Americana against the idea of a future, dominant China and really exploit the geopolitics to enhance the storyline. It&apos;s not clear whether it&apos;s a question of story values, and the kind of struggles over narrative perspective that Iron Man 3 opted to duck out of, or of the much-publicised politics of making cinema in China, that is hindering the search for a crossover point. The two big private-equity-backed, east-west partnerships announced at the end of 2011 \u2013 between Huaxia and Relativity, and Huayi Brothers and Legendary \u2013 have so far produced zilch: the latter&apos;s first project, 15th-century epic The Great Wall, has suffered a serious of delays. There is no obvious solution in sight yet \u2013 so it may be time to crack open the fortune cookie after all. \u2022 Iron Man 3 is out on 25 April. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood will look at a Mexican class comedy.

In a blow to Cameron, who had hoped to hold an annual summit with the Chinese leadership, the French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was on Friday feted in Shanghai on a full state visit a few weeks after the prime minister was due to visit China. Cameron is understood to have abandoned the planned trip after Beijing indicated that he was unlikely to be granted meetings with senior figures. He is now expected to visit in the autumn, two years after his first and only visit as prime minister. Britain accepts that Beijing is exacting punishment after Cameron met the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, at St Paul&apos;s Cathedral last May. The meeting, which was similar to Gordon Brown&apos;s discussions with the Dalai Lama at Lambeth Palace in 2008, was designed to minimise offence in China by showing that Britain regards him as a spiritual leader. Downing Street has made clear to Beijing that it accepts Tibet is part of the People&apos;s Republic of China. Government sources said that tentative plans for the prime minister to visit China this month were put on hold before his visit to India in February for the simple reason that the new Chinese leadership only took over in March. Cameron spoke to Li Keqiang, his new Chinese counterpart, after his appointment. But the Guardian understands from diplomatic sources that a visit was firmly placed in the prime minister&apos;s diary for earlier this month. This was abandoned when it became clear that the prime minister would be denied the access usually granted to a G8 leader. Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary who has just returned from China, told the Guardian: &quot;David Cameron came to office claiming he would prioritise the UK&apos;s diplomatic and trade relationship with China, and yet the real difficulties in relations have now been laid bare. I was in China this week and it is clear that the new Chinese leadership are focused on the French president&apos;s visit, along with a large number of French companies looking for business. &quot;In the past, UK prime ministers have met with the Dalai Lama without the deterioration in relations with China that we are now seeing. For all of their initial boasts and bluster, the UK government has lacked a strategic or a joined-up approach to China since it came to office, and that&apos;s now showing.&quot; A No 10 source said: &quot;Of course, as any good diary planner would, we pencil in early on dates when the prime minister could potentially travel overseas without going firm on destinations. We decided several weeks ago that we wanted to visit some European capitals in the time we had earlier this month. When the prime minister and Premier Li Keqiang spoke in March they looked forward to meeting in due course.&quot; Officials said trade with China is still rising and the two countries are on course to achieve \u00a31bn in bilateral trade by 2015. Exports to China grew 13.4% last year. But the decision to abandon the visit is a personal setback for Cameron, who said after coming to office that he would place trade at the heart of foreign policy, with a particular emphasis on the so-called Bric countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. A visit to India in February fell flat after private complaints that the prime minister appeared to regard the country as a trading opportunity rather than an emerging world power. Hollande was greeted by Xi Jinping, the new Chinese president, when he arrived in Beijing with his partner Valerie Trierweiler on Thursday. They agreed to hold an annual summit \u2013 Cameron&apos;s original aspiration when he first visited China in November 2010 \u2013 after Hollande said he hoped to build a &quot;multipolar&quot; world. This is the classic French ambition to ensure the US cannot dominate the world in a &quot;unipolar&quot; world. Cui Hongjian, director of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, a foreign ministry thinktank, told the South China Morning Post that this message was well received in Beijing. &quot;France sometimes has different ideas from the US.

First it granted the 36-year-old Kenyan agricultural official a full scholarship for a three-year master&apos;s degree in Beijing. Then came the comfortable dorm room, the snazzy banquets and the complimentary Peking opera tickets. &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s a bit too much,&quot; Ocholla said, smiling and slowly shaking his head. Last summer, the then Chinese president Hu Jintao announced an expansive aid programme that will offer 18,000 government scholarships and train 30,000 Africans &quot;in various sectors&quot; by 2015. Ocholla is one of 63 government officials from Kenya to benefit directly from these promises. Chinese training programmes vary in type and duration, from three-week political tours for ministerial officials to advanced degree programmes for university administrators. China advertises these programmes as a kind-hearted diplomatic gesture \u2013 the terms &quot;equality&quot;, &quot;all-round co-operation&quot; and &quot;mutual gain&quot; pepper its state media reports and programme descriptions. Experts say they&apos;re a calculated, long-term investment to win the hearts and minds of Africa&apos;s future leaders, many of whom fear China&apos;s investment in the continent may come with invisible strings attached. &quot;Don&apos;t forget that people who are coming on these courses have only seen a tiny part of what China does,&quot; said Kenneth King, a professor emeritus at the University of Edinburgh and the author of a forthcoming book about China&apos;s soft power in Africa. &quot;They&apos;ve seen China building roads in Ethiopia, or building dams in many other countries. But they haven&apos;t seen a Chinese university, for example. They haven&apos;t seen a Chinese vocational school. They haven&apos;t seen a hospital.&quot; Ocholla is adjusting quickly to life in China. His programme at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences is taught in English. He spends most days studying Chinese language, economics and maize-growing. Though he&apos;s awed by the gleaming skyscrapers and well-organised institutions, its dismal environmental record and tight political control give him pause. &quot;If they were to go for a less restrictive, more open system, I think the benefits would be much, much better,&quot; he said. Many African officials see China&apos;s developing status as part of its appeal \u2013 something they can relate to, said Meng Bo, an assistant dean at the prestigious Tsinghua University school of public policy and management in Beijing. Tsinghua has offered a one-year, English-language master&apos;s programme for officials from developing countries since 2008, and until this year, about 80% of its students have been from Africa. &quot;To compare with other programmes like KDI [Korean Development Institute] in Korea, Grips [National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies] in Japan and the Harvard Kennedy school, I think our experience might be more relevant to them, as we are facing similar challenges,&quot; she said. Master&apos;s candidates must take Chinese language classes and choose from electives such as politics and government in China, China&apos;s social policy and China&apos;s foreign strategy and policy. They take regular field trips to destinations ranging from glitzy Shanghai to deeply impoverished villages in Hebei province, a short drive from Beijing. Students&apos; postgraduate careers are difficult to assess, she said. Many alumni fall out of touch and the university has few people in Africa. &quot;We haven&apos;t seen many concrete links promoted by our alumni back home, but we believe in the long run they will all contribute to different academic and professional relations between the two countries,&quot; she said. Meng added that the programme probably has the deepest impact on students from volatile countries such as Somalia. &quot;What they treasure most from China is this political stability,&quot; she said. &quot;What they think about most is how to achieve this stability in their own countries. It&apos;s a challenge for them.&quot; Mahamat Adam, a Cameroonian business consultant and former member of the China-Africa Business Council, said a significant chunk of China&apos;s training budget for African officials goes to programmes that only last a few weeks. Their graduates, many of them quite high-ranking, may emerge with a more positive view of China. &quot;But have they learned anything in the way of improving their knowledge, their capacity, their own knowhow?&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m very, very sceptical about the impact. &quot;It must be understood by the Africans, they are not there to do philanthropy or help, they are there to do business.

Which TV executive thought there would be genuine jeopardy in watching a top-flight chef supersize a bloody bag of Hula Hoops, as Blumenthal did for Heston&apos;s Fantastical Food? But none of that should detract from the reason he became TV fodder in the first place: The Fat Duck in Bray. Other big name chefs may have abandoned the restaurants where they made their name for the glitter of media whoredom. Blumenthal, however, has kept the faith. The Fat Duck remains the most influential restaurant of ambition in Britain of the last 10 years. The problem is that all the ancillary trading can obscure the point of what he does. In the restaurant itself, where an absurd 70 or so chefs minister to just 40 diners, it&apos;s all very serious indeed, in the best way. Yes, there&apos;s lots of whizz-bangery. Yes, you listen to sounds of the seashore while eating edible sand. Yes, there&apos;s a gold watch that dissolves in hot water to make a consomm\u00e9 for his take on the Mad Hatter&apos;s Tea Party. But what matters is that the food is truly delicious, the experience of eating there joyful, funny, diverting. (Just as it is at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, which he opened in 2011.) I hate being asked to name my favourite restaurant experience, but if forced to it will always be the tasting menu here. Sure, it seriously bloody costs. There will be some who will question the morality of such a price. But the Fat Duck has to be understood in global terms. It isn&apos;t just the most important restaurant in Britain; it&apos;s one of the most important in the world. So save up. Remortgage the house. Send the kids out to work. It is, quite simply, a unique and class act. The Fat Duck, Bray, Berkshire. 01628 580 333; thefatduck.co.uk. Meal for two \u00a3500 9: The Kitchin, Leith     Tom Kitchin. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer    In a city with new-found culinary heft \u2013 there&apos;s a lot in Edinburgh for greedy people to love \u2013 The Kitchin manages to stand out. This has little to do with the space. The restaurant, while very comfortably fitted out, sits in a hard-surfaced retail development down by the water in Leith, which could quite as easily be a sports shop or pizza joint. Instead, it has everything to do with the sensibility of the man whose name is above the door. Thirtysomething Tom Kitchin is one of a crew of young cooks who learned their craft in London under the uncompromising stare of the great Gascon chef Pierre Koffmann; a man who was always less interested in prissy towers of ingredients and garnishes placed just so, than in the imperatives of flavour and of avoiding waste. Ditto Kitchin, who throws immense reserves of French technique \u2013 he also trained under Guy Savoy and Alain Ducasse \u2013 into the service of glorious regional produce. A lot of Edinburgh restaurants bang on about the joys of Scotland&apos;s larder. At many of these it can feel like a put on job, a shallow piece of marketing. Kitchin means it. Each 12 August, for example, he is up early enough to get the first grouse from a shoot out in the hills south of Edinburgh, and be back in his kitchen in time to have it on the menu that night, alongside bread sauce and duck-fat fried game chips. Equally, he secures the very finest local seafood. Come here for boned, rolled and stickily caramelised pig&apos;s head with roasted langoustine the size of your fattest finger; for razor clams from Arisaig, Invernesshire with chorizo and lemon confit, or a tartare of roe deer with celeriac, orange and redcurrant jelly. A restaurant of ambition it may be, but Kitchin does not run scared of the cheaper cuts; offal features as regularly as its more high-born cousins. Kitchin&apos;s food is both literally and figuratively gutsy. It has a Michelin star. It has other awards, including one for best restaurant, from the Observer&apos;s readers, who know a thing or two about good food. But it wears it lightly. This is the restaurant of a man with an instinct to feed. The Kitchin, 78 Commercial Quay, Leith, Edinburgh. 0131 555 1755; thekitchin.com. Meal for two \u00a3140 8: Barshu, London  For decades we made a category error. We called Cantonese food Chinese food as if we had somehow defined the appetites of a land mass that is home to more than 20%of the world. A throng of humanity that huge could never have such limited tastes. The last 10 years has been the decade of Chinese ascendancy. It makes absolute sense that this has also been when we in Britain should finally see the fracturing of our notions of Chinese food. Today, there are places serving the dishes of Shanghai, Hunan, Xiandong, Beijing and more. But the most popular after Cantonese is Sichuan, a style that makes a virtue of the fiery red chilli, the lip-numbing peppercorn and the inner bits of animals that others throw away. There were a few obscure places serving a version of it before, but it was the arrival of the glossy Barshu in London&apos;s Soho that really gave these fabulous dishes the prominence they needed. Its picture-led menu, full of saturated colours, including the most dazzling reds, is a place of mellifluous offerings: of fragrant and hot pig&apos;s trotters, of dry braised ox tendons, of Gong Bao chicken with peanuts, dry wok pig&apos;s intestines and so on. Some people find all this terrifying. And yes, it can be a full-on experience. The chillies don&apos;t always deliver a whack of heat. Often they are just there for flavour and to be picked aside. However this food can still have curious physiological effects. It can bring on an unexpected sweat; the peppercorns really do numb the lips and tongue. But it can also be thrilling, and working with the great food writer Fuchsia Dunlop, who trained in Sichuan cookery in Chengdu, Barshu finally made it accessible to a novice market. Sichuan food is widely available now across Britain. But Barshu can reasonably claim to be the one that put it on the map. Barshu, 28 Frith Street, London W1. 020 7287 8822; bar-shu.co.uk. Meal for two \u00a380 7: Le Champignon Sauvage, Cheltenham      Tartare of dexter beef, home-made corned beef, wasabi mayonnaise.    Chefs are restless souls, especially at the start of their careers. They don&apos;t tend to hang around anywhere very long. They pick up skills. They learn recipes. They move on again, trading what they&apos;ve already acquired for what else they can get. It is out of this muddle of short-lived stints that a cook&apos;s individual style is formed. Not so with David Everitt-Matthias of Le Champignon Sauvage in Cheltenham. He has made a career out of going nowhere; from staying exactly where he is. He opened the restaurant in 1987 while still in his 20s, and he is still there. He runs the kitchen with a small brigade; his wife Helen runs the softly appointed dining room. And that&apos;s that. In 1996 they won their first Michelin star. In 2000 they won their second, when the number of such restaurants in the UK was barely in double figures. He doesn&apos;t want to be well known in your house. He just wants to be in his kitchen. If he can&apos;t be there he closes. What&apos;s most impressive about Everitt-Matthias is that, while physically staying in one place his food has always had forward motion. I first experienced his cooking in my early 20s, completely by accident. I just happened to be staying nearby on holiday. Back then it was heads down classicism: sea food lasagnes, roast loins of pork, chocolate mint souffl\u00e9s. But a recession which pushed him back towards cheaper ingredients, alongside a discovery of the possibilities of foraging, shaped his cooking. It turned his food into something deeper, more sensual, much more robust. Le Champignon Sauvage is indeed the place for wild mushrooms; Everitt-Matthias has rarely met a fungus he didn&apos;t like. But there&apos;s so much more. There are seared scallops with a carpaccio of pig&apos;s head, butter-poached dabs with ground elder and new season peas, a salted chicory root iced mousse with vanilla rice pudding. He has braised cockscombs until gelatinous and wobbly to go with pigeon, paired zander fillets with dense duck hearts \u2013 &quot;fish with offal is a big thing with me&quot;, he once told me \u2013 and made panna cottas from acorns. He is a big fan of the mustier, denser flavours, of lovage and jack by the hedge, of bay leaves and wild garlic and shaggy parasol mushrooms. A lot of his technique is grand and French; a lot of his ingredients are deep West Country. It&apos;s unique. And boy, does it work.

Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer    Ferran Adri\u00e0 of the late El Bulli once said that a great meal should begin with a great journey, though he may just have been excusing the terrifying hairpins that had to be navigated to get to his gaff. Either way, there&apos;s no denying the beauty of the trip to the Yorke Arms in Ramsgill, through the glorious Yorkshire hills. At the end you find a handsome old building, with the smell of wood smoke as you push through the door, and the promise of somewhere soft to lay your head. Some of this is pure misdirection, not least the dining room which has much of the pub classic about it. It is dominated by a lot of heavy, brooding furniture. The surroundings may have a hefty traditionalism; chef Frances Atkins&apos;s food doesn&apos;t. It is light and bright and modern, considered and thoughtful. Atkins has been tucked away here for years, doing her own thing, in a way which for the past decade has earned her a Michelin star. So expect a bit of the dibs and dabs of sauces which tend to come with the tyre company&apos;s approval. At the heart of this food, though, will lie big flavours, which recognise location. Witness it in the titles of dishes listed as Yorke Arms &quot;classics&quot;: Yorkshire potted beef and ham hock terrine with pickled vegetables; Whitby crab with a potage of shellfish; slow-cooked shoulder of lamb, loin and sweetbread with wild herb stuffing. After all that, what you really need is a proper fire to fall asleep in front of. On that score, as on all others, the Yorke Arms does not disappoint.

He sits in his Shanghai lab beneath shelves of liquor and cigars, wears designer clothes, and drives a shiny American SUV. You can email him the chemical formula for a new drug, and his assistants will synthesise it and post it to you. And then you can get completely off your face. As Mike Powers&apos;s fascinating and vividly written book shows, new drugs are invented every year to circumvent current bans, and freely sold on the internet. It doesn&apos;t take much extrapolation from current tech trends to see where this will eventually end up. Once we all get atomic-level 3D printers, we can just build our own pills at home. Then &quot;controlled substance&quot; will finally be completely uncontrollable. You could try, instead, to control information. The organic chemistry is bona fide scientific research, but even so, many of the current drug wars are information wars. Power documents the rise of websites on which communities of psychonauts report on their experiences with certain compounds, or rate the reliability of internet sellers. (Such sites indubitably save lives.) Drug users know that official drug advice \u2013 for example, the UK government&apos;s Talk to Frank helpline \u2013 is condescending and unreliable. In any case, Power points out, &quot;people are taking more drugs than the authorities even know exist, in ways they would not believe&quot;. Meanwhile, an American law that bans not only current compounds but their possible chemical cousins criminalises not the possession or sale of a\u00a0new compound, but the supply of information along with it \u2013 information about the drug&apos;s effects and safe dosage. This makes drug-taking more dangerous. Power concludes that the greatest threat to users is that of mislabelling. If\u00a0we were sad to discover that our horsemeat had been labelled &quot;beef&quot;, spare a thought for the person ordering a trippy powder that is mistakenly described as 10 times less potent. He will take 10 times as much as is safe, and overdose, possibly fatally. The new designer drugs \u2013 or, as the wryly exploratory users&apos; lingo has it, &quot;research chemicals&quot; \u2013 are invented by slightly altering the formula for known molecules such as MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine, LSD and so on. A\u00a0famous recent example was mephedrone, or &quot;meow meow&quot;, cooked up in response to &quot;a global MDMA shortage&quot; after a large quantity of safrole oil (a\u00a0precursor chemical used to make ecstasy) was seized by the UN in Cambodia in 2008. Mephedrone became hugely popular during its window of legality, before the usual fear-mongering denunciations by politicians and the media, and the usual ban. And what does a ban do? As\u00a0Power argues, it drives users to experiment with another new chemical that is not yet illegal, whose effects might be less well understood. The book ends with a description of\u00a0the modern internet drug scene, conducted on encrypted network Tor and using Bitcoin as its currency, along\u00a0with a survey of anti-prohibition developments around the world. (The presidents of Guatemala and Colombia have talked about legalisation; Portugal decriminalised all drugs including heroin in 2001 and now has half as many &quot;problem drug users&quot; and half as many people injecting smack.) Power is clear that current policy massively amplifies the harm suffered by users and others. His is an informed and thoroughly hip intervention into a\u00a0public debate that is too often evidence-hostile and tabloid-panderingly disingenuous. But it&apos;s not just techy and wonkish; Power&apos;s book is funny as well. As with any realm of intellectual creativity, the world of &quot;research chemicals&quot; has its revered geniuses. Alexander Shulgin, &quot;the world&apos;s most prolific and genius-tinged psychedelic chemist&quot;, is one. Shulgin created ecstasy, and &quot;pioneered the concept of the &apos;museum dose&apos; \u2013 a\u00a0quantity of a drug that he deemed appropriate for trips to interesting exhibitions&quot;. Another is a retired professor of organic chemistry, John William Huffman: &quot;This elderly gentleman,&quot; Power writes, &quot;with his tidy beard, plain spectacles and owlish manner, is responsible for getting thousands of people incapably stoned.&quot; Huffman conducted research on synthetic cannabinoids, for the sake of &quot;pure science&quot;; now they are being made in significant quantities. &quot;The synthetics are much more dangerous,&quot; Huffman tells Power. &quot;No one has ever died of an overdose of marijuana. You&apos;d probably forget where you put the stuff.&quot; Like any field of commerce, legal or otherwise, &quot;research chemicals&quot; depend on clever marketing. &quot;Legal highs&quot; have often been sold under the deadpan rubric of &quot;bath salts&quot; or &quot;plant food&quot;; and it&apos;s important to give a new chemical a pronounceable brand name. &quot;In the same way that 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine only really took off when it became known as ecstasy,&quot; Power explains, &quot;and just as 4-methyl methcathinone became much more popular once it was called &apos;meow&apos;, so too did 6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran, AKA 6-APB, gain many more fans when it became branded as Benzo Fury.&quot; Power quotes liberally from users&apos; forthright field reports. One person writes approvingly of a new chemical that is like &quot;cocktail-party MDMA&quot;; another describes an experience on a slightly altered version of a\u00a0popular animal tranquilliser: &quot;It felt like a really pointless version of ketamine: no psychedelic effects, no pleasant slide into rubbery nonsense, just a sudden drop off the cliff of wrongness.&quot; If the government helplines spoke like that, perhaps more people would listen. \u2022 Steven Poole&apos;s You Aren&apos;t What You Eat is published by Union Books.", "tags": ["Health, mind and body", "Drugs", "Books", "Society", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-02T07:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice/2013/may/02/china-climate-change-leader", "sentences": ["And just last month water pollution took an unusual form in Shanghai after thousands of dead pigs were found floating in the city&apos;s main river which provides drinking water for up to 20 per cent of the city&apos;s 23 million residents."], "title": "Is China really a climate change leader? | Jennifer Duggan", "article": "China&apos;s environmental woes have attracted a lot of attention internationally since the start of the new year. Air pollution was first up in January as levels in a number of cities, including the capital Beijing, hit lung clogging off the record levels. Dubbed the &apos;air-pocalypse&apos;, hazardous smog left air pollution left cities enveloped in a thick layer of smog. And just last month water pollution took an unusual form in Shanghai after thousands of dead pigs were found floating in the city&apos;s main river which provides drinking water for up to 20 per cent of the city&apos;s 23 million residents. Concerns have also been raised about dangerous levels of soil pollution after heavy metals were found in soil samples.  China&apos;s environment has suffered to help fuel its record-breaking economic growth. Its coal-powered factories and power stations pump out thick clouds of soot making it the world&apos;s number one emittor of greenhouse gases. With its posionous air, water and soil, it is hard to see China as anything other than an environmental villian but a new report portrays it in a different light, as a leader on tackling climate change. The report &apos;The Critical Decade: Global Action Building on Climate Change&apos; was carried out by the Australian Climate Commission. It is an overview of international progress on climate change over the past nine months looking particularly at China and the United States. The report states that while China and the United States together produce &quot;appoximately 37% of world emissions&quot; that both nations are &quot;on track to meet their international commitments to tackle climate change&quot;.  In relation to China, it&apos;s key findings include:   &quot;China is reducing its emissions growth. In 2012 China reduced the carbon intensity of its economy more than expected and almost halved its growth in electricity demand. After years of strong growth in coal use, the rate of growth has declined substantially.&quot;  And:   &quot;China has emerged as the world&apos;s renewable energy powerhouse, taking ambitious strides to add renewable energy to its mix. 2012 was another year of extraordinary growth.&quot;  The report adds that in 2012, China invested  &quot;US$65.1 billion in clean energy, 20 percent more than in 2011. This was unmatched by any nation and represented 30 percent of the entire G-20 nations&apos; investment in 2012.&quot;      Workers paint and assemble parts of wind turbines in Yumen, Gansu province, China, on November 13, 2009. China is under pressure from the international community to accelerate its push toward alternative energy.  Photograph: Doug Kanter/Getty Images    The report was released the same day that the latest round of United Nations climate change negotiations got underway in Bonn in Germany. The UN talks have remained deadlocked and no global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is expected by 2015. Also this week it is likely the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time. This is a cause for concern among scientists and is proof of lack of action globally on climate change. While China is increasing the amount of renewable energy it produces, it is also increasing its emissions. The Climate Commission report portrays China in a very complimentary light but it does state that China is reducing its &quot;emissions growth&quot; \u2013 meaning China is still increasing its emissions, just not as quickly as previously.  To put these increases into context, another study published earlier this year by consultancy firm Ecofys for Greenpeace estimates that   &quot;China&apos;s five northwestern provinces plan to increase coal production by 620 million tonnes by 2015, generating an additional 1,400 million tonnes of CO2 a year, almost equal to Russia&apos;s emissions in 2010&quot;.  So which is it? Is China a leader on tackling climate change or one of the biggest contributors? The truth is both. China&apos;s breakneck speed economic growth has caused what is likely to be irreparable damage to its environment. But there is little doubt that the Chinese government is sitting up and taking notice of the need to improve the situation. Public anger is increasing as Chinese citizens are no longer willing to sacrifice clean air and drinking water for economic wealth.  China has acknowledged its position as the world&apos;s largest CO2 emitter but remains firm on its position that the country&apos;s per capital emissions along with its historical emissions are below those of developed nations. But it has set a target to reduce its carbon intensity by 17 percent by 2015. China&apos;s actions on environment and climate change may become more urgent as the very goal that caused environmental damage \u2013 its drive for GDP growth \u2013 is affected. According to some recent estimates, in 2010 environmental degradation cost about 3.5 percent of China&apos;s GDP. China&apos;s new leadership has acknowledged that environment is one of the biggest challenges it is facing and while China&apos;s emissions are unlikely to be reduced in the next few years, it is making a shift towards a more sustainable energy base. There are important choices for the government to make and these choices will have a huge impact not just domestically but globally.", "tags": ["Environment", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Water", "Soil", "World news", "China", "Renewable energy", "Wind power", "Pollution", "Coal"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-03T09:36:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/03/china-arrests-fake-meat-scandal", "sentences": ["One suspect, named Wei, earned more than \u00a31m over the past four years by purchasing fox, mink and rat meat, treating it with gelatin, carmine (a colour produced from ground beetles) and nitrate, then selling it as mutton at farmers&apos; markets in Jiangsu province and Shanghai.", "Pork sales plummeted in March after about 16,000 pig carcasses were dredged from a river in Shanghai, an incident authorities have yet to fully explain."], "title": "China arrests 900 in fake meat scandal", "article": "Police in China have arrested 904 people for &quot;meat-related offences&quot; over the past three months, including a gang that made more than \u00a31m by passing off fox, mink and rat meat as mutton, the country&apos;s public security ministry has announced.

Against the backdrop of Churchill Downs&apos; iconic twin spires, the Derby is a race that stirs America&apos;s penchant for a ripping yarn in a theater of high-stakes drama. Every year, it seems, America&apos;s most recognizable race comes attached with a story gilt-edged for the headlines, good and bad. Last year was the furore surrounding Doug O&apos;Neill, trainer of the winner, I&apos;ll Have Another. Before I&apos;ll Have Another had time even to remove his garland of roses, the attention was swiftly diverted to O&apos;Neill&apos;s litany of drug offenses that have blighted his training career. Barbaro&apos;s stunning win in 2006 was a story of brilliance marred by tragedy when he broke down in the Preakness Stakes, his next race. Stories mined from further back include Secretariat&apos;s win in 1973 that catapulted him to triple-crown immortality. The headlines surrounding this year&apos;s renewal seem sterile in comparison \u2013 to this point, at least. Much of the news generated thus far by the 2013 Kentucky Derby surrounds the new qualification system, an overhaul of the old formula that rewarded graded-stakes earnings \u2013 earnings accrued at any point in a horse&apos;s career. Without going into great detail, the old system recognized a horse&apos;s whole career over more recent efforts. To put it bluntly, your Derby contender could go from Pegasus to pit pony between two and three, and still enjoy a Derby berth at the expense of a horse who had shown the same generational transformation, only in reverse \u2013 or so the thinking went. The revamped system is an attempt to rectify that problem. Under its new guise, Derby hopefuls are given a 36-race window of opportunity to qualify. The top four finishers in those races are awarded points on a sliding scale. Special emphasis and more points are given to certain races run during a 10-week period between February 23 and April 27 in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately kind of deal. The new system, however, has its share of detractors. But one gets the impression that the machinery of the revamped formula is going to be tinkered with before the greater portion of leading racing figures are satisfied or appeased, albeit somewhat. But that&apos;s for the future. This year, the experiment is over, and the leading contenders have come to the fore. Here&apos;s a look at the horses with the likeliest chances on Saturday. Verrazano Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: John Velazquez Post position: 14 Wood Memorial win:            If this year&apos;s Kentucky Derby were the World Poker Championships, trainer Todd Pletcher would be holding a royal flush. Chief among his cabal of Churchill contenders is Verrazano, whose resum\u00e9 is an immaculate read of four wins from four starts. He&apos;s a smashing-looking colt with a pedigree smeared with Derby-winning DNA. His win last time out in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct was in a race that has supplied four of the last 20 Derby winners. What is more, jockey John Velazquez picked Verrazano over Orb \u2013 a decision more indicative, however, of the Pletcher-Velazquez connection than anything else. With so many ticks in so many boxes, one could understand if Verrazanowas being discussed in the same hallowed whispers reserved for potential mega-champs. But he&apos;s not. This is primarily due to his victory over Normandy Invasion in the Wood Memorial that was heavier on slog than superlatives. Verrazano should have dismissed the Wood field with disdain. He didn&apos;t. Afterwards, one couldn&apos;t help but feel cheated of a more authoritative display. There is also the question of experience. Throughout Verrazano&apos;s four-race career, he has avoided the hustle-and-bustle and mud splattering kick-back of a tightly packed field. He might take to it like a cat to napping \u2013 one would rather not wait until the big race to find out. Orb Trainer: Shug McGaughey Jockey: Joel Rosario PP: 16 Florida Derby:             John Velazquez&apos;s reject is Joel Rosario&apos;s gain. And Rosario is a jockey on fire right now. Trainer Shug McGaughey&apos;s colt has shown fine improvement since his maiden win at Aqueduct last November. Since then, he&apos;s added an allowance win and a rallying victory in the Grade II Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park to his gold-medal haul. Then came Orb&apos;s scene-stealing performance in the Florida Derby, a race that has proven a springboard to Derby success to no less than five horses in the last 20 years. Sitting in midfield, Orb took the lead a furlong from home before stretching clear of Itsmyluckyday, the horse who had defeated Shanghai Bobby the time prior. A horse hardened at the grindstone of tough graded stakes action, Orb possesses many of the qualities necessary to win at Churchill \u2013 tactical speed and unflinching stamina perhaps being his most valuable. If one were searching for an Achilles heel, it would be his temperament. He&apos;s a nervous, free-sweating sort. It hasn&apos;t proven a barrier to success thus far \u2013 it might do during the cauldron of the big race preliminaries. He&apos;s shown an improved disposition with each run, however. And a bullet workout Monday\u2014four furlongs in 47.89sec\u2014shows that he&apos;s in fine nick. So much so, Orb&apos;s now looks likely to go off favorite Saturday. Revolutionary Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Calvin Borel PP: 3 Louisiana Derby:            In Revolutionary, trainer Todd Pletcher has a worthy understudy to Verrazano. And like Orb, Revolutionary has been showing improved form all spring to suggest that, come Churchill Downs on Saturday, he&apos;ll be a potent force. He broke his maiden in December, after which he overcame a troubled trip in the Grade III Withers Stakes at Aqueduct in February. That day, he showed an Astaire-like fleet of foot that is satisfying to see in a potential Derby candidate. At Fair Grounds at the tail-end of March, he set out his Kentucky stall with a hard-fought win in the Grade II Louisiana Derby. The last Derby winner to hail from the Louisiana showpiece was Grindstone, who needed every inch of the trip to prevail at Churchill in 1996. Revolutionary&apos;s win at Fair Grounds in 2013 showed similar stamina-laden attributes: after being headed a furlong from home, Revolutionary clawed back to overhaul Mylute on the wire. It was a gutsy win \u2013 guts by the bucket load is what is needed come Saturday. The form of the race is suspect, however. A neck defeat of Mylute leaves one wondering as opposed to won over: will Revolutionary improve enough to follow in Grindstone&apos;s rose petal strewn hoof-prints? A few eyebrows were raised when he only jogged Tuesday morning, but he&apos;s a light framed individual who needs only to be kept ticking over. One huge plus: his post position. Three-time Derby winning Jockey Calvin Borel has got his favored spot down by the rail in three. Goldencents Trainer: Doug O&apos;Neill Jockey: Kevin Krigger PP: 8 Santa Anita Derby:            The similarities between Goldencents and last year&apos;s Derby champ, I&apos;ll Have Another, are there in stark relief: Same trainer in Doug O&apos;Neill, the same Derby prep victory in the Grade I Santa Anita Derby. Goldencent&apos;s win at Santa Anita dispelled in one minute and 48 seconds the doubts hovering over him following his defeat in the San Felipe the time prior. That day, he was snared in a speed duel up front with Flashback, only to weaken close home, a spent force. Back at the Californian track a month later and the result was vastly different. Ridden more conservatively, Goldencents prevailed in convincing fashion against his San Felipe nemesis, Flashback. But the form of the race \u2013 of the west coast form in general \u2013\u00a0leaves one questioning whether Goldencents has shown enough to gift O&apos;Neill a double-whammy of Derby victories. As is usually the case, the best three-year-old form leading into the Derby has been the preserve of the east-coasters. But Goldencents&apos; winning time at Santa Anita was good, and in a well-worn racing maxim: he can only beat what&apos;s put before him. He&apos;s settled in well at Churchill this week and the O&apos;Neill camp are bullish on his chances. Overanalyze Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Rafael Bejarano PP: 9            Arkansas Derby:  Another leading contender and another horse whose head hangs over thewebbings at the Todd Pletcher barn. Overanalyze&apos;s berth at Churchillis due largely to a fine win in the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Parklast time out. That day, he angled wide around a large field beforebeing sent to the lead a furlong from home. Once there, he wasextended to romp clear by a visually impressive four and a quarterlengths. Given the paucity of top-notch competition that day, Overanalyzeneeded to win in convincing fashion to achieve two things: to be takenseriously as a Derby contender and to dispel the specter of hislifeless performance in the Gotham Stakes the time prior. He did justthat. As an added plus, his works leading into the race have beenelectric. But compared to his stable mates who have exhibitedstronger, more consistent, form, one has to exercise just a littlemore imagination to see him claim gold on Saturday. Java&apos;s War Trainer: Kenny McPeek Jockey: Julien Leparoux PP: 19 Blue Grass Stakes:            Up until the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland earlier this month, Java&apos;sWar had shown enough to suggest that he was a capable enough sort -but a capable enough sort who lacked what was necessary to triumph atChurchill. Three stake-race defeats were capped with a second placefinish in the Tampa Bay Derby to Verrazano. Trainer Kenny McPeek then sent Java&apos;s War to Keeneland. In the Blue Grass, Java&apos;s War stumbled out of the gates, relegatinghimself to the rear of the field for much of the way. There heremained, the class dunce, until brought wide and set for home at thetop of the stretch. He soared, and nailed Palace Malice on the wire intaking fashion. He didn&apos;t beat much that day \u2013 Palace Malice wascoming off a seventh place finish in the Louisiana Derby. It was themanner of Java&apos;s War&apos;s victory, however, that suggests he&apos;s improvedconsiderably since the Tampa Bay Derby when Verrazano beat him by acomfortable three lengths. Young horses in the spring are capable ofremarkable physical and mental maturation within a brief window oftime. It&apos;s quite possible that Java&apos;s War has matured enough giveVerrazano a much sterner test on Saturday. His wide draw over in 19 is a concern \u2013 it&apos;s a problem, but not an insurmountable one. Normandy Invasion Trainer: Chad Brown Jockey: Javier Castellano PP: 5 Another of Verrazano&apos;s vanquished foes, Normandy Invasion, was the horse that gave Pletcher&apos;s star colt a tough time of it in the Wood Memorial. Prior to that race, Chad Brown&apos;s runner had shown only reasonable form in a couple of Grade Twos: the Risen Star Stakes at Fair Grounds and the Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct, neither of which suggested that Normandy Invasion was going to make Verrazano roll up his sleeves. Like Java&apos;s War, one gets the impression that Normandy Invasion is on the up. Unlike Java&apos;s War, we haven&apos;t been privy to another racecourse appearance to be able to gauge by what degree he has improved. If he wins on Saturday, he joins Giacomo and Mine That Bird as horses that succeeded at Churchill after last-time-out defeats.

But since China overtook Japan to become the world&apos;s second-largest box office last year, Hollywood&apos;s more entrepreneurial quarters have been getting busy. Last year, Lionsgate spent $1m digitally substituting Red Dawn&apos;s villainous Chinese baddies with North Korean ones; this summer&apos;s Brad Pitt-starring zombie epic World War Z has already excised a fleeting suggestion that the outbreak emanated from within the country&apos;s walls; while Django Unchained toned down the colour of its many blood splashes. As so often, James Cameron was a pioneer, crediting the Zhangjiajie National Forest Park as the inspiration for the sweeping vistas of Avatar. The film went on to become the highest grossing in Chinese history, while one of the park&apos;s peaks was swiftly renamed the Avatar Hallelujah Mountain. Similarly eager to ingratiate, last year&apos;s sci-fi hit Looper relocated an entire act from Paris to Shanghai, while 2010&apos;s candy-sweet The Karate Kid remake rendered its title meaningless with a calculating move to the land of kung fu. In spite of such blatant pandering, the latter two films failed to meet expectations at the Chinese box office; a sign, perhaps, of a growing cynicism towards such tokenistic approach to cultural inclusiveness. Just this month, Iron Man 3 flew the flag for Sino-American relations by embellishing its Chinese cut with appearances from local stars Wang Xueqi and Fan Bingbing. But it inadvertently made a mockery of their inclusion by reducing both roles to blink-and-you&apos;ll-miss-them cameos in the US version. If cinema screens continue to pop up in China at a rate of nine a day, the likes of Wang and Fan won&apos;t be waiting around for Robert Downey Jr&apos;s scraps much longer. China&apos;s flourishing box office 2008: $0.62bn 2009: $0.91bn 2010: $1.47bn 2011: $2.1bn 2012: $2.7bn China&apos;s addition to Iron Man 3 Wang Xueqi Born in 1946, Xueqi is a Hong Kong veteran with a taste for playing stirring roles in party-boosting historical dramas (2009&apos;s Bodyguards And Assassins, 2011&apos;s The Founding Of A Party).

His increasingly familiar routine at the Royal Marsden hospital in Sutton has its own quietly repetitive soundtrack. A chemotherapy pump whirrs and chatters as its deadly medication flows down from the bag above his head and into the cannula that has been fed into a vein in his right arm. The pump sounds as eerily innocuous as an old ink-jet printer. It sighs and chunters while Hutchins lies on the bed, his arm supported by a heat pad. But, rather than printing out sentence after sentence of a book about his life as a professional tennis player now locked inside his most testing battle, the pump drives a concoction that aims to destroy every remnant of the cancer that invaded his body with terrible stealth. The chemotherapy will also kill many of the white blood cells that\u00a0help him fight infection. Before Hutchins becomes healthy again, he will feel more sickness. &quot;I&apos;ll turn pale as we go through the day,&quot; he says cheerfully on a beautiful morning. The pump, his mechanical ally in the fight against Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma has already flushed his system with saline to, as he explains, &quot;make my veins more welcoming to the chemo&quot;. Hutchins, a Davis Cup regular who has played two grand slam doubles quarter-finals, studies the first of three medications seeping through his system. &quot;This is clear but the one dose of chemo is very red. The last one is a special large-volume drug. It goes into your bloodstream and reaches from the tips of your earlobes to the end of your toes. Every cell gets hit by the chemo.&quot; To many people the 28-year-old is simply Andy Murray&apos;s best friend, and the doubles specialist to whom the fiercely protective Scot dedicated his victory at the Brisbane International in January with a tearful promise that he will survive. &quot;I told Andy on 27 December,&quot; Hutchins remembers. &quot;It was tough \u2013 just like when I phoned Colin [Fleming, his doubles partner]. Andy and Colin are my closest friends. Andy will be the first person to help me and I love that about him. But I was concerned. I said: &apos;I&apos;ve got something to tell you but I don&apos;t want it to affect you.&apos; I&apos;d have been happy if he said: &apos;As long as you&apos;re OK, let&apos;s talk after Australia because this is a huge month.&apos; But he wanted to know. Afterwards he said: &apos;You&apos;re going to get through this, you&apos;re going to become a better person and a better tennis player. You&apos;re going to be far stronger, mentally.&apos; &quot;When I called Colin he said: &apos;Your first tournament back you&apos;re playing with me. You and me \u2013 we&apos;re the team.&apos; That&apos;s so uplifting because there&apos;s nothing worse in doubles than not having a partner. Of the five or six people who have helped me through this, Andy and Colin top that list. Andy is going to be best man at my wedding, with my brother, and Colin will be an usher. That was going to be the case anyway \u2013 but they shine in my head even\u00a0more.&quot; Did Hutchins know that Murray would make such a public declaration of support for him in Brisbane? &quot;No. We spoke every day but he put on a brave face. I was just glad he won the tournament. It felt good that I was not ruining his career! When he dedicated it to me it was very special. I was at home with Lindsay [his fiancee] and she choked up. I hadn&apos;t told the public yet. Andy then saying it made it the perfect time for me to confirm I had Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma.&quot; A knock on the door interrupts us. &quot;Hey, Laura,&quot; Hutchins says to the senior nurse. While she seeks a vein for the next dose, Hutchins asks the nurse about her five-year-old son. Laura tells him that her little boy has started tennis lessons. &quot;That&apos;s great,&quot; Hutchins says. He could be donating blood rather than enduring another brutal session of chemotherapy. Yet he explains how the cancer took over his body. &quot;I started getting back pain last April but it only became excruciating in October. We were playing well \u2013 because Colin was exceptional \u2013 and reached the semis in Beijing and Shanghai. The pain would only take hold around nine at night. It would last for seven hours until I was so tired I&apos;d fall asleep for just a couple of\u00a0hours.&quot; Fleming and Hutchins finished ninth in the world rankings but, in mid-December, the pain darkened. &quot;I couldn&apos;t get any sleep so I lay on a foam-roller just so I could have pain somewhere else. An LTA [Lawn Tennis Association] physio, Shane, said: &apos;I&apos;m sure it&apos;s not this, but you haven&apos;t ruled out cancer of the back.&apos; He also said I should get my kidneys checked out. I flew\u00a0home.&quot; A scan of Hutchins&apos; kidneys showed pneumonia in the bottom of his lung. A Cat scan of his upper lung then revealed an ominous shadow across his chest. &quot;It was pure luck because, otherwise, they would never have gone for a higher scan. I had a biopsy and, even though it could have been an infection, the way the doctors talked made me think: &apos;Prepare yourself. This is lymphoma.&apos; &quot;Christmas was difficult. I had the biopsy on 22 December and got the results on the 27th. When I took the call I was in a room with Lindsay and the doctor came to the point very quickly. He said: &apos;I&apos;m afraid we&apos;ve found a large amount of lymphoma.&apos; The first time I got upset was when I opened the door and my brother and sister were standing outside. I broke down for five seconds. I then saw my mum and the same thing happened. Literally a quick burst of tears and then I said: &apos;OK, guys, I&apos;ll get through this.&apos; That&apos;s the only time I&apos;ve cried.&quot; He settled quickly on the Royal Marsden. &quot;They&apos;ve become like my second family,&quot; he says. &quot;Nurses are the most underrated people and as soon as I met Professor Cunningham I got this strong feeling: &apos;This is the guy who will cure me.&apos;&quot; Hutchins falls briefly silent as he remembers the bleakest days. &quot;At the start it was all bad. The cancer&apos;s in your spleen. It&apos;s stage four, not stage two. The chemo treatment has been extended from three\u00a0to six months. The cancer&apos;s in the bone in your back and we don&apos;t know if it&apos;s gone into the bone marrow.&quot; Cancer had been in his body, secretly, for 18 months. &quot;It had been loitering in my back and then, when it started hurting so bad, it was saying, I&apos;m going to hurt you so you know I&apos;m here.&quot; He looks up. &quot;But then you get good news. The bone marrow is clear. The first scan after chemo said it had reduced a lot. You build on that hope. You feel stronger.&quot; Has he thought about death? &quot;Yes. Absolutely. But your mindset has to be about survival. As soon as it comes into my mind, I say: &apos;No Ross, you&apos;re not going down that route. You have to trust the people at this amazing hospital.&apos; &quot;I look at it as a tennis match. The cancer is my opponent and I have to beat it. I think I&apos;ve handled it well, and if I come through this it will be the thing I&apos;m most proud of \u2013 how strong I&apos;ve tried to stay.&quot; The prickly feeling that often takes hold of him every alternate Thursday is absent today. Laura has found a good vein. &quot;You feel it most with the tough one at the end, the detox, the &apos;toilet cleaner&apos; which is very strong. The last session, number eight, was probably the hardest. I was depleted for much longer and lost my [sense of] taste. I had more motion sickness and I hardly ate anything. But today is session nine of 12. &quot;The toughest thing is that 24 hours after chemo you self-inject a white-blood-cell fluid into your stomach. Within an hour your body aches like you&apos;ve got the flu \u2013 but far worse. The injection boosts your white blood cells by putting in fresh ones. It&apos;s saying: &apos;OK white blood cells, let&apos;s build, let&apos;s get healthy.&apos; Saturday will be the fifth set \u2013 that&apos;s when you&apos;re\u00a0battling.&quot; He and Murray are contesting a private duel over who will lose their hair first. &quot;Andy struggles,&quot; Hutchins laughs. &quot;He&apos;s thinner on the crown but I&apos;m low on hair now. The nurses are surprised I haven&apos;t lost all my hair but it hasn&apos;t gone completely. If I wake up and Lindsay suddenly has a face like this [Hutchins imitates The Scream] I&apos;ll know my hair has finally gone.&quot; Hutchins is due three more sessions after today \u2013 hopefully his last treatment will be on 13 June. &quot;That&apos;s three days before the Rally Against Cancer,&quot; he says, concentrating on his mission to raise money for the Marsden in a charity drive culminating in a doubles match on finals day at Queen&apos;s when Murray and Tim Henman play Ivan Lendl and Tomas Berdych. &quot;I knew Andy would do it for me but it means a lot that Tim said yes. Tim was my idol when I was a kid. To see them playing Ivan and Tomas will mean the world to me. &quot;I might be feeling a bit rough after that last big hit of chemo but I&apos;ll be uplifted by Queen&apos;s. Four weeks later I&apos;ll have a Pet\u00a0scan of the whole body and a CT scan of the chest. I like to think it&apos;ll show I&apos;m clear. Then I&apos;ll have another Pet scan three months later. So it will be October before I know for sure if I&apos;m in remission. Hopefully it will be good news and I&apos;ll be able to train in November and December \u2013 and go with Andy to Miami. I hope to play again with Colin in Australia early next year.&quot; So much hope shines out of Hutchins that, three hours into our morning, it&apos;s easy for him to smile when Laura returns for the last and hardest hit of chemo. She repeats the curious routine that precedes every dose of medication. &quot;What is your name and date of birth?&quot; she asks of a man who knows the names of all the children and the pets belonging to her and her fellow nurses. &quot;Ross Hutchins,&quot; he says. &quot;I was born on 22 February 1985.&quot; Sunlight streams into the hospital room. It feels quiet and serene before we start talking again, chattering about the steely presence of Murray on court and his contrasting warmth as a loyal friend. We talk about football managers and marriage proposals, about Hutchins&apos;s desire to eat sushi again, and most of all about him returning to real life and gruelling days on tennis courts around the world. Hutchins eventually stretches out his left hand to take my right hand. &quot;I&apos;m going to beat this,&quot; he says with the assurance and ease of a great champion as those five words rise above the hum of the pump. \u2022 Donate to the Rally Against Cancer at justgiving.com/RallyAgainstCancer2013 or text &quot;RALL60 \u00a310&quot; to 70070, to make a \u00a310 donation.

For most of the first decade of his 13-year reign as chief executive, the company was widely regarded as a lumbering giant that was failing to capitalise fully on its well-stocked cabinet of spirits brands. And leadership in Scotch whisky was seen as defining Diageo as an old-school drinks company that would be outpaced by smaller and nimbler rivals. It was only when Walsh in 2011 set out some medium-term targets for growth that investors woke up to the powerful cash machine in their midst. Diageo could increase sales at 6% a year, he said, while lifting profits margins, thus producing double-digit rises in earnings per share. As those pledges were seen as credible, so the share price took off, from \u00a312 in August 2011 to almost \u00a320 today. The late run has put the shine on the impressive statistics under Walsh: \u00a3100 invested when he became chief executive in September 2000 has become \u00a3538 today, calculates Investec. Not quite as good as Pernod, but still excellent. The part of the story that investors initially missed was the company&apos;s ability to persuade Asia&apos;s aspiring middle classes that they should be aspiring to drink whisky, and Diageo&apos;s whiskies in particular. The Johnnie Walker houses in Shanghai and Beijing seem designed to cater for ostentatious displays of wealth (the malts become expensive as one travels upwards to the bars on the buildings&apos; upper floors) but the formula seems to work in communist China. Developing markets are booming for Diageo while the US division is stronger than ever. This is a company with substantial pricing power. Walsh will say a long goodbye to Diageo. Ivan Menezes, who has been a shoo-in for the top job since becoming chief operating officer in March last year, will become chief executive in July. But Walsh will stay on for another year to concentrate on &quot;transitioning critical partner and external relationships,&quot; whatever that means. He will retain his \u00a31.2m salary while he performs this &quot;transitioning&quot;. Quite why he should be paid the same in a supporting role is not explained. But investors, happy with the performance of their shares, will probably be too polite to make a fuss.

The\u00a0setting is the world fair at Ghent. Visitors from every nation in the world throng the stands, marvelling at the ingenuity of modern man. Business cards get swapped, order books filled. The mood is open and curious, with conversations shifting easily between languages. The talk might be about British ball bearings, Flemish lace or Portuguese wine. Later, over a coffee or\u00a0beer, someone may mention the recent royal wedding attended by a full\u00a0sweep of royal cousins: George of Britain, Nicholas of Russia and Wilhelm of Germany. Here is cosmopolitanism showing its sunniest face to the world: mild, pragmatic and touchingly convinced that it is doing its best by\u00a0everyone. This is just the sort of opening scene we are used to in narratives that begin in 1913 \u2013 a more sophisticated version of the summer garden party in which girls in white frocks play croquet on a vicarage lawn. We know that in the very next beat the sky will darken, the music will go atonal, and the bright colours will drain to sepia as the guns move in. But Emmerson does not give us that next beat. For it is not his intention to describe how or why the Great War began. Instead, he wants us to continue to potter among the stalls at Ghent, experiencing what it felt like to be alive in 1913, unaware of the coming rip in history. To further decentre the war from his\u00a0narrative, he takes us on a tour that includes places apparently aloof from the approaching carnage. What, for instance, was it like to be a beef baron in Buenos Aires, a wine merchant in Algiers or a tyre manufacturer in Tokyo? Actually, it turns out, it wasn&apos;t all that different from being a clerk in London or a banker in Berlin. In the newly joined-up world of 1913, information, artefacts and people hurtled around the world at dizzying speeds. The report of a poor wheat harvest in Canada meant a fall on the stock market in London the next day. Model T Fords struck out from Detroit to do sterling service in the coffee plantations of Brazil and the sheep farms of New Zealand. Russia, far from\u00a0stewing in its own juices, was publishing books in 49 languages. Emmerson is able to make his case about globalisation by arguing that 1913 was the year the world finally turned urban. From China to Brazil, men and women were pouring into the\u00a0expanding towns to remake their lives. Citizens, fresh from the country, encounter new jobs, new drinks, new dances, even new kinds of bodies. In Peking, dawdling citizens are even told to stand up straight and walk faster if they really want to get on. Not everyone enjoyed being modern. Naysayers grumbled that the world now turned so fast that it would soon spin off its axis. In Pera, a suburb of Constantinople, you could buy &quot;Parisian&quot; scarves made in Manchester, Nestl\u00e9&apos;s condensed milk from Switzerland and Russian galoshes. Tokyo&apos;s new railway station was modelled on Amsterdam Centraal while Bombay&apos;s Victoria station showed a puzzling resemblance to London&apos;s St Pancras. Shanghai&apos;s Customs House, meanwhile, was built in a style best described as Tudorbethan. While electricity now lit up the main streets in Tehran and Algiers, it only served to make the side streets seem darker than before, and 1913 turned into a year of frightening shadows. In Vienna a Jewish clerk was arrested on a\u00a0trumped-up charge of ritual murder. In Russia, whispering the word &quot;constitution&quot; on the freezing air was still enough to bring a policeman to your door. In other parts of the world, protesters marched and waved placards. A British-trained lawyer called Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi rallied Indian miners in Natal against laws designed to squeeze them into ghettoes. Such was the speed with which news travelled that Indians on the subcontinent were soon joining in to protest this attack on their cherished right to move freely around the British Empire. In Palestine, things quickly turned nasty. Fanned by newspapers, sectarian tensions increased to the point where a banal incident involving the theft of some grapes was enough to trigger a murderous street brawl between Arabs and Jews. Particularly striking are the literary sources Emmerson uses to recreate the world of 100 years ago (and remember it&apos;s all recent: there are 13,000 people in the UK today who were alive in 1913). Rather than high literature, he mostly opts for demotic texts, journalism and hack novels, to get a feel for the splits and bumps that marked private and public thinking. So\u00a0instead of Proust, DH Lawrence and\u00a0Freud, we have the intelligent but non-canonical work of Stefan Zweig and Israel Zangwill. A chapter on Mexico City makes great use of a potboiler called Philip Dru, written by\u00a0Woodrow Wilson&apos;s Texan adviser Edward M House, in which Mexico is incorporated into the US, a move that seemed entirely likely at the time. To understand how the inhabitants of Detroit felt about their homes, Emmerson uses a Sears catalogue, while Los Angeles&apos;s fantasies about its\u00a0own past are mapped on to a Mary\u00a0Pickford movie. Throughout this ambitious, subtle account, Emmerson tries hard not to play the hindsight game. Still, he&apos;s honest enough to acknowledge the cheap pleasure that comes from knowing what happens next. For who would not be tickled to learn that in 1913 Kaiser Wilhelm was being hailed as a glorious peacemaker, with 25 conflict-free years under his considerable belt?\u00a0Or that until recently a young Mussolini had been running a socialist group in Trieste while Trotsky was busy as a journalist in the tinkling tea shops of Vienna? Then there are those startling contemporary resonances, such as the moment when Elizabeth Kendall, a global fl\u00e2neur, declares: &quot;China is waking up, the self-satisfied complacency of the white race has received a shock&quot;. Not all the prophecies made in 1913\u00a0turn out to be quite as spot-on as Kendall&apos;s, though. India, according to a\u00a0piece in the Evening Standard, would probably never wish to be independent of Britain. The Channel Tunnel was confidently declared to be only a few years away. Oddest of all, however, was the suggestion that, by the year 2013, the capital city of the British empire would have been obliged to relocate to\u00a0somewhere along the Canadian-US border. Such wild mis-hits are worth cherishing as a reminder that the future is never simply the present dressed up in a funny haircut. A hundred years from now we \u2013 or at least the very youngest among us \u2013 will be doing and\u00a0thinking things that are quite unguessable now. And, actually, the idea of that is really rather cheering. \u2022 Kathryn Hughes is writing a book about famous Victorians&apos; body parts.

Premier Li Keqiang told the Israeli leader he anticipated exchanging views on regional issues such as the peace process as well as bilateral co-operation, as they met in the Great Hall of the People. Li and Chinese president Xi Jinping met Mahmoud Abbas two days earlier, while Netanyahu was in Shanghai. The unusual overlapping visits prompted speculation about China&apos;s possible role as a mediator, particularly after the Foreign Ministry expressed willingness to arrange a meeting if the two men wished. State media also heralded Chinese president Xi Jinping&apos;s announcement of a four-point peace plan. &quot;It is not the first time China has made efforts on this issue, but it is the first time our leader clearly set out four proposals on this in public,&quot; said Li Guofu, director of the Middle East Studies Centre at the China Institutes of International Studies. But Abbas left Beijing before Netanyahu arrived in the capital. Israeli officials had already briefed that the two men would not meet, and have focused on the commercial aspect of the trip. And the contents of Xi&apos;s plan are familiar from previous Chinese statements. &quot;My impression is that this is a giant exercise in intentional ambiguity by all parties. It&apos;s very well-choreographed and quite vacuous in terms of substantial results,&quot; said Robert Bianchi, visiting research professor at the National University of Singapore and an expert on China and the Middle East. &quot;The story is bigger than the day \u2026 It&apos;s more about China and its larger diplomatic weight, particularly in the Middle East and Islamic world.&quot; Yin Gang, one of the country&apos;s best-known Middle East experts, even suggested the twin visits were a coincidence: the Israelis had called off two previous trips and this is the height of China&apos;s diplomatic season, he noted. &quot;China is not the key mediator. China plays an assisting role,&quot; he added. Beijing&apos;s trade with the Middle East \u2013 and especially its thirst for oil \u2013 has expanded substantially in recent years and increased its desire for stability there. &quot;China has for a long time firmly supported Palestine \u2026 The Palestinian people trust China. [But] China also maintains a friendly relationship with Israel,&quot; said Li Guofu. Its economic links with Israel are burgeoning; bilateral trade has grown to around $8bn annually. China has become a prime customer for Israeli technology, pointed out Bianchi, and Li and Netanyahu signed fresh deals on Wednesday. The bigger picture, Bianchi noted, is that &quot;there&apos;s a lot of horsetrading between Washington and Beijing over Middle East and Asian issues \u2026 As China sees the effectiveness of that it has a greater incentive to be more omnipresent in the Middle East \u2013 especially as the US starts to sniff around China&apos;s sphere of influence in the Western Pacific. China is starting to return the favour.&quot; Its expression of keenness to help resolve the conflict, he added, is also &quot;a very clear refutation of the notion it doesn&apos;t have diplomacy or responsibility and is a free-rider not interested in being a &apos;good world citizen&apos;.&quot; Shi Yinhong, a foreign relations scholar at Renmin University, suggested the dual visits could be the beginning of a &quot;much more prominent role&quot; for China on the issue. He said Beijing might also be looking for positive ways of working with Washington, which has been seeking to revive the peace process, at a time of strained bilateral relations. US secretary of state, John Kerry, said on Wednesday that he would be returning to the Middle East in two weeks time for further talks. Other analysts believe that Beijing will be reluctant to become too deeply embroiled in the conflict. Kerry Brown of the University of Sydney said: &quot;I guess [this week] gives them good political capital with America and it isn&apos;t a big risk for them. It&apos;s a relatively easy good news story for China \u2013 but I can&apos;t see any reason for it to get too involved.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-08T15:49:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/may/09/how-make-perfect-salt-pepper-squid", "sentences": ["His final spritz of rice wine adds a pleasant zing to the dish, cutting through the fat, but I prefer the fresher flavour of the lime used byTonks and Grainger, especially at this time of year, when you might even fancy yourself sitting outside on the waterfront in Stanley, Shanghai or Sydney as you dine in the garden."], "title": "How to make perfect salt and pepper squid", "article": "I still remember the thrill of my very first Chinese meal, in a restaurant in exotic St Albans back in the late eighties. There were banana fritters and hilarious chopstick lessons, pancakes you could eat with your hands and carrots carved to look like flowers; in short, it was an eight-year-old&apos;s dream meal ticket. My tastes have changed slightly since then \u2013 I&apos;m likely to be the one pushing for the pock-marked Mother Chen&apos;s bean curd, or the chilli tripe (while secretly hoping someone else will insist on the crispy duck), but one thing I&apos;m unable to resist, if it&apos;s on the menu, is salt and pepper squid. And it usually is, because whatever part of China they&apos;re from, restaurateurs are canny operators, and Cantonese spicy, salty fried food is always a winner. The problem is, Chinese meals are all about sharing, and even people who claim to be scared of tentacles usually end up polishing off more of the portion than I&apos;m strictly comfortable with. Time to make squid the main attraction at home, away from prying chopsticks. The cephalopod itself British squid is easy to come by in fishmongers \u2013 recipes vary as to the preparation method, with chef Ching-He Huang and Mitch Tonks recommending they are cut into rings, and most others suggesting triangles. I find these larger pieces hold the batter better, as does scoring one side in a diamond pattern, as suggested by Bill Granger and Rick Stein. (This is also supposed to stop them curling up quite so much during cooking, although it doesn&apos;t make a huge amount of difference when deep frying.) Baby squid are preferable if you like to crunch the tentacles as well (many people are squeamish; I think they&apos;re the best bit). The batter Not everyone is keen on a bit of batter: Rick Stein stir-fries his squid naked, but, pleasant as it is, it&apos;s missing the crunchy element that makes salt and pepper squid such pure joy to eat. The other recipes I try are more traditional. Sydney chef Ying Tam makes a batter from self-raising flour, vegetable oil and water, which wins the crunch competition, while Huang&apos;s egg and potato flour coating in her book China Modern is the lightest, and gives the best coverage. Of the also-rans, Bill Granger uses cornflour and soda water, which makes it crunchy, but relatively heavy, and Tonks&apos;s milk and cornflour coating, from his book Fish Easy, disappears into the fryer, never to be seen again. Potato flour and egg seems to be the wise choice here \u2013 almost tempura light, it comes closest to the real thing. The seasoning Batter&apos;s only a convenient vehicle for spice, however \u2013 and, for a dish with such a self-explanatory name, there&apos;s a remarkable diversity of opinion here. Huang and Granger are the only ones who really adhere to the description, although she uses white pepper and he goes for black. Stein and Tonks are faithful in a slightly fancier way, using a mixture of black and tingly, numbing Sichuan peppercorns, dry roasted until fragrant, which I love \u2013 the combination gives the batter a more assertive, complex peppery flavour. Tonks also chucks in some dried Sichuan chillies, but I decide to reserve this heat for the topping (of which more below). I like his idea of reserving some of the seasoning mixture to sprinkle over the cooked squid just before serving, however, so the dish packs a little extra punch. Tam, meanwhile, goes completely off piste with a homemade &quot;five-spice mix&quot; of ground ginger, celery powder, salt, five-spice and chicken stock powder, which, according to my culinarily sophisticated boyfriend &quot;makes it taste like Pot Noodle&quot;. Whether or not that&apos;s true (of course, I wouldn&apos;t know), it certainly overwhelms the flavour of the poor squid. The garnish Actually, for salt and pepper squid, this is more than a mere garnish: the little crunchy morsels of fried chilli and onion that can be chased around the plate with chopsticks long after the last tentacle has been devoured are crucial, and nice as it is to have a spritz of lime juice and a sprig of coriander for freshness, I think Tonks is missing a trick by leaving them out. Sprinkling them on fresh, as Huang does, is also unsatisfactory \u2013 they should be cooked briefly, just to slightly caramelise them. That said, I find it well-nigh impossible, not to mention hazardous, to fish tiny pieces of chilli out of a pan of sizzling oil, as Tam suggests, so I&apos;m going to cook them in a separate pan, and combine the two just before serving. He adds garlic, which I really like, but it has a tendency to burn, so keep it in slices, rather than chopping it finely. His final spritz of rice wine adds a pleasant zing to the dish, cutting through the fat, but I prefer the fresher flavour of the lime used byTonks and Grainger, especially at this time of year, when you might even fancy yourself sitting outside on the waterfront in Stanley, Shanghai or Sydney as you dine in the garden. The cooking Sadly, this is a dish whose deliciousness largely relies on deep frying. OK, Stein shallow fries his, but then, as we&apos;ve discussed, that isn&apos;t quite the real deal. You can be all authentic, and do it in a wok, as most recipes suggest, but a deep pan will do just as well \u2013 or, of course, be like a real Chinese restaurant and use a deep-fat fryer. Serve with a salad, to slightly mitigate the guilt. Perfect salt and pepper squid Serves 2 350g small squid, cleaned 1/2tsp black peppercorns 1/2tsp Sichuan peppercorns 1tsp sea salt flakes 5tbsp potato flour 1 egg, beaten Groundnut or vegetable oil, to fry 1 red chilli, deseeded and finely sliced 2 spring onions, sliced 1 garlic clove, sliced Fresh coriander and lime wedges, to serve Separate the bodies of the squid from the tentacles, and cut them into triangles. Score the inside with a diamond pattern, making sure not to cut right the way through the flesh. Add to the tentacles, pat dry and set aside. Heat a dry frying pan and add both varieties of peppercorn. Toast for a minute or so until fragrant, then tip into a pestle and mortar, along with the salt, and crush to a powder. Mix two-thirds of this with the potato flour in a shallow bowl and set the rest aside. Put the beaten egg into a second bowl. Half fill a large pan or wok with oil, or use a deep fat fryer, and heat it to 180C, or until a small piece of bread browns in 15 seconds. Meanwhile, dip the squid pieces in the egg, then in seasoned flour until well coated. Fry \u2013 in batches if necessary \u2013 until pale golden, stirring once to make sure they don&apos;t stick to the bottom. As they&apos;re cooking, heat a further tablespoon of oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Use a slotted spoon to lift the cooked squid on to kitchen towel and tip the chilli, spring onion and garlic into the frying pan. Fry very briefly until it all starts to caramelise, then add the squid to the pan and toss together. Tip on to a serving plate, sprinkle with a little more seasoning and serve with a little coriander and some wedges of lime. Is salt and pepper squid your favourite Chinese takeaway treat, or would you make a case for prawn toast, wontons, or some more exotic fare? And, while we&apos;re talking squid, what else do you like to do with them and their tentacled relatives, the cuttlefish and the octopus?", "tags": ["Chinese food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-09T08:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/may/09/chinese-factory-trade-legal-high", "sentences": ["The factory was on an industrial estate near the airport in Shanghai, surrounded by plants churning out legitimate chemicals for the agricultural, perfumery and pharmaceutical trades."], "title": "From Chinese factory to UK households \u2013 realities of the trade in legal highs", "article": "The factory was on an industrial estate near the airport in Shanghai, surrounded by plants churning out legitimate chemicals for the agricultural, perfumery and pharmaceutical trades. This one also made synthetic recreational drugs on an industrial scale. The scene was grim: filthy chemical reaction vessels, dirty-coated workers scurrying about with solvents. Like the protagonist in the film Scarface, the owner sat surrounded by shipping barrels and kilo parcels of drugs ready for export. However, his product is legal. I&apos;d been chatting with the owner, one of China&apos;s biggest mephedrone vendors, for a few months, setting up a deal \u2013 or more accurately, an expos\u00e9. I wanted to see inside this factory where tonnes of new, legal drugs had already been manufactured and couriered to the UK and EU. This is the reality of part of the new drugs scene \u2013 chemistry firms in many Chinese provinces are churning out modified versions of illegal drugs and selling them online. Everything from amphetamine-like stimulants to ecstasy-like substances as well as thousands of synthetic cannabinoids is available. The drugs \u2013 which have no history of human use \u2013 skirt the law by subtle molecular manipulation. Safety isn&apos;t a priority \u2013 profit is. There are hundreds of small labs in China, and many of them are manufacturing thousands of chemicals that users and dealers in the west have identified from scientific research papers as having some potential as unscheduled recreational drugs. But it&apos;s not an exclusively Chinese problem; since mephedrone was banned in 2010 following diplomatic pressure and a domestic problem with the drug, the problem was squeezed out of China, only to emerge in India, where many factories are today pumping out tonnes of the drug every year, supplying a hungry \u2013 but now illegal \u2013 market in the UK. Eastern Europe, too, has a crumbling, post-Soviet chemical industry that props itself up with backroom syntheses by graduate students, the web now globalising criminality and delivering not only drugs, but an almighty headache to drug agencies worldwide. Attempts to control this trade today resemble the futile efforts made by record labels to control digital piracy a decade ago. Then, the music industry was powerless as the web helped people defy the law in ways label bosses could not control. Their impotence was compounded by ignorance and a refusal to innovate. Historically, four or five new drugs appeared in Europe each year. In 2011 that grew to one a week. Last year 73 new drugs were found on 690 websites. The tipping point has passed: it was in 2009-2010. The UK and the EU witnessed the &quot;plant food&quot; craze when mephedrone was imported from China and sold online legally, while the US was equally surprised by a sudden upswing in the sales of &quot;bath salts&quot; \u2013 a catch-all term for synthetic cathinones, stimulants seldom seen on international markets. The substituted cathinones were banned in the UK in 2010; to little avail: the genie was out of the test tube, and the world was wired. The American Association of Poison Control Centres said the number of calls related to &quot;bath salt&quot; exposure increased twentyfold in 2011, up from 304 in 2010 to 6,138. Many were sold in packets carrying names like Charlie Sheen, sold as neo-legal cocaine substitutes. They, and a wave of synthetic cannabinoids were even sold in gas stations and skater stores. It was as if a nationwide drug legalisation policy had been written by a teenager, a gangster, a redneck trucker and a Chinese chemist. So in the US in December 2011, the Synthetic Drug Control Act outlawed hundreds of new hallucinogens, stimulants and cannabinoids. Dozens of synthetic cannabinoids were also banned in 2011, but a two-minute search will today find dozens of replacements. It is unlikely, though, that much internet search traffic will be emerging from those states in the US where recreational marijuana use has been decriminalised.

Johnson is expected to take a large group of business people on his trip in October, overtaking plans by No 10 to mend ties broken when David Cameron met the Dalai Lama. The trip will aim to cement already strong links between the capital and Beijing. It will be seen as a coup for Johnson and could help build his standing in preparation for a Tory leadership bid. The London mayor said he was keen to take a substantial group of business people to China to help British companies broaden their reach. He said the city was proud that it was a hub for international business and would remain a key player in the financial sector. &quot;It is the only place in the world where you can call S\u00e3o Paulo and Shanghai on the same day,&quot; he said. Asked whether David Cameron would accompany the delegation, he said: &quot;Only if he is travelling in the hold&quot;. French president Francois Hollande and German premier Angela Merkel&apos;s have both enjoyed state visits to China, making it clear to London that France and Germany are now favoured above the UK in diplomatic relations. Eager to protect London&apos; status as one of the world&apos;s three most important financial centres alongside Tokyo and New York, Johnson has lobbied for access to the Chinese markets. Last year Beijing chose London as the first place to trade the remnimbi outside China. Johnson said at the Global Investment conference in London, organised by Vincent Cable&apos;s Business department, that Britain needed to play to its strengths as a global financial centre. Cameron has struggled to re-establish diplomatic ties with Beijing after a meeting with the Dalai Lama that was also attended by the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. China demanded No10 apologise for attending the official meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader at st Paul&apos;s cathedral in May last year, warning of &quot;serious consequences&quot;, but Cameron refused. A trip to China was cancelled last summer and a visit by the new Chinese leader Li Keqiang has yet to be arranged this year. No10 denied that the Dalai Lama link damaged relations, saying the election of the new Chinese leadership last autumn forced scheduled visits to be scrapped. A spokesman said six ministers had visited China since May last year and the prime minister had enjoyed warm relations during phone calls with Li in recent months. He said he was not appropriate to discuss whether there were plans for No10 to embark on a trade mission. Investment in the UK by Chinese investors has increased sharply in recent years, but there have been fears that the frosty diplomatic relations could put at risk proposals for major Chinese investments in a wide range of large infrastructure projects. The government is hopeful that the High Speed 2 rail network and the Government&apos;s nuclear investment programme will benefit from billions of pounds of investment from China&apos;s sovereign wealth fund. George Osborne, speaking at the conference, said the UK was unapologetic about encouraging overseas investors with the lowest corporation tax in the G20. He said the cut in the headline rate of corporation tax to 20% by next year would support Britain&apos;s recovery. Speaking ahead of the G7 summit of finance ministers this weekend, which he is chairing, the chancellor said his priority was to support the global recovery. &quot;The situation has stabilised, but that does not mean we should let up in our efforts to promote growth and build on the stability we have seen recently,&quot; he said.

The 32-year-old is entering the final year of his \u00a3160,000-a-week contract with no talks having taken place, as yet, over a 12-month extension. The former England captain expressed a desire to remain at the club last month and indicated there could be discussions over his future in the summer, when Chelsea are likely to be back under the stewardship of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. The Portuguese may seek to prolong Terry&apos;s stay, not least for stability&apos;s sake, having worked with him during his first spell at the club and the player&apos;s instinct has always been to stay.

The country&apos;s new leader, Xi Jinping, has been talking of pursuing a &quot;China dream&quot;, but cruder everyday realities keep intruding, posing what may be the central challenge for his administration. While China&apos;s future is usually assessed in economic or political terms, it is social issues that most concern most people. These are proving particularly tricky to deal with, nowhere more so that in the crucial matter of food safety. On their own, each of the recent scandals might be dismissed as the kind of accidents that occur in any country. However, taken together, the food problems, environmental threats and negligence pose a broad challenge to the credibility of a regime that claims to have its people&apos;s interests at heart but has done such a poor job of protecting their welfare. The lack of legal recourse and accountability spur people to take to the streets \u2013 it is estimated there are more than 150,000 protests each year. Official media report on such matters far more frankly than in the past. Social media spread word of the latest scandal. The difficulty for the leadership is that many of these problems stem from the system that has seen China grow into the world&apos;s second largest economy with its weak regulation, corruption and entrenched business interests protected by officials. The past fortnight alone has brought news of the arrest of a gang that added gelatine to flesh from rats, foxes and minks, and sold it as lamb without any testing for quality or safety. In Shandong province, farmers were found to have used a highly toxic pesticide on ginger plants, while in central China, 3m school dictionaries were discovered to be rip-offs full of errors. There have been recurrent cases of milk being treated with harmful chemicals to raise its protein count, not to mention buns recycled being after passing their sell-by date, plus the thousands of diseased pig carcasses that floated down the river through Shanghai in March. This is all on top of an environmental crisis \u2013 not only the heavy smog in Beijing and other cities but also poisoned rivers and heavy metal deposits from smelters together with fears of toxic discharges from petrochemical plants. The cumulative effect of all this is to undermine trust in a regime that, despite the lack of democracy, requires popular support as a rapidly evolving society gives people much greater individual liberty than in the days of Mao Zedong \u2013 and they show a growing readiness to make their complaints heard. While aware of the discontent, the government is running well behind the curve. Regulation remains weak and safety guidelines issued by the supreme people&apos;s court this month are minimal. The number of cases brought for selling unsafe food in 2010-12 \u2013 1,533 \u2013 looks small given the scale of the problem. Reducing the smog pall in the capital, cleaning up China&apos;s rivers or taking on the local authorities that should be enforcing environmental protection is a long-term job. But the food safety issue has struck an immediate chord, especially with the middle class, whose co-operation Xi and his colleagues need. The annual survey of popular attitudes carried out by the Pew Institute last year showed 41% of those questioned as concerned about food safety compared with only 12% in 2008. That was before the current scandals. Addressing these kinds of social, human problems will be key for the new leadership, alongside its more lofty goals of rejuvenating and strengthening the nation \u2013 and just as tricky.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "Food safety", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-12T17:30:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/14/overseas-study-offers-broad-educational-experience", "sentences": ["He spent the second year of his degree course at Ningbo near Shanghai and really enjoyed the opportunity of seeing things from a Chinese perspective: &quot;I studied Chinese business law, saw a fast-moving economy at first hand and discovered that the Chinese are not as quiet and as reserved as you think."], "title": "Students go abroad to immerse themselves in a new culture", "article": "Studying management with Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham&apos;s campus in China was an eye-opener for Adrian Fu, 21.

Overseas branch campuses are part of the growing internationalisation of higher education. Besides fulfilling a growing international demand for degrees validated by UK universities, UK students benefit from the experience of learning in a foreign country, being exposed to a different culture, moving outside their comfort zone and mixing with international students. The rationale for each branch campus is different. But what all do is provide a niche education whether it is University College London&apos;s (UCL) master&apos;s in Arab and Islamic archaeology in Qatar, London Business School&apos;s MBA taught in Dubai or the suite of accounting and business degrees offered by the University of Central Lancashire&apos;s campus in Cyprus. Study abroad is often seen as a career enhancer and the experience of meeting and working with overseas students can lay the foundations for future business networks. Most UK universities with overseas campuses offer students a year abroad as an opportunity to specialise in a geographical area or region. The advantage is that being part of the same institution, students are able to seamlessly combine modules studied overseas with those studied in the UK. The 2012 report from The Observatory on Borderless Higher Education lists 200 degree-awarding international branch campuses. Of these, 25 UK universities have branches overseas, putting the UK in third place behind France and the US. A further 10 UK universities are set to open overseas branch campuses over the next two years. UK branch campuses often fulfil a major role in the countries where they are based. UCL&apos;s postgraduate branch campus in Education City, Qatar provides a suite of cultural heritage degrees few international universities can match. Established two years ago on the back of huge financial support from the Qatar Foundation, UCL in Qatar functions both as a department of UCL and as a partner to Qatar&apos;s Hamad bin Khalifa University (HBKU).  Specialist master&apos;s programmes in Arab and Islamic archaeology, conservation and museum and gallery practice attract an international student body. &quot;UK students gain a high-quality degree in a subject specific topic that they cannot get anywhere else in the world,&quot; says Prof Thilo Rehren, director of UCL in Qatar. The University of Nottingham launched its Malaysia campus in 2000. &quot;In Malaysia there are a lot of research opportunities and funding streams that are unavailable in the UK,&quot; says Prof Hai-Sui Yu pro vice chancellor (international). For example, the foreign campus conducts research on crops which in the UK could only be done in the lab, but in Malaysia &quot;you can work in the field&quot;, says Yu. Last year 120 students went out to Nottingham&apos;s Malaysia campus at Semenyih studying a range of degrees from international business and economics to psychology and international relations. One of the newest and most enthusiastic entrants to the overseas branch campus movement is the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan). Based in Preston, UCLan aims to open a campus in Sri Lanka in 2014 with more campuses in Thailand and Bangladesh also planned. &quot;We&apos;re seeing a definite trend in trans-national education,&quot; says Lee Chatfield, rector of UCLan Cyprus, the university&apos;s first venture. The \u20ac53m (\u00a344.8m) state-of the-art campus, which opened its doors to Cyprus students in October 2012, aims to attract UK students wanting to spend a year overseas with accommodation and a return flight to Britain included within the \u00a39,000 tuition fee. Chatfield explains that despite the banking crisis earlier in the year, Cyprus is strategically placed to service eastern European and the Middle East as well as a burgeoning domestic market. First-year accountancy degree student Henry Boocock returned from a taster session in Cyprus earlier this year. &quot;The Cypriot students really made us feel welcome and the climate is a break from England&apos;s rain and snow,&quot; Boocock says. &quot;Spending part of the academic year abroad is a useful life experience \u2013 and it gets you thinking about career opportunities in Europe.&quot;", "tags": ["Students", "Studying abroad", "University of Nottingham", "University of Central Lancashire", "UCL (University College London)", "London Business School"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-14T16:25:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/16/china-protest-chemical-plant-kunming-px", "sentences": ["A Shanghai battery manufacturer announced on Wednesday that it would cancel plans for a new plant after hundreds of people staged three protests to voice concerns about its possible environmental impact."], "title": "Chinese protest at planned chemical plant over pollution fears", "article": "Thousands of protesters have gathered in the southern Chinese city of Kunming for the second time this month to voice concerns over the environmental impact of a planned chemical plant, according to uncorroborated posts on Twitter and Chinese social networking sites.

Yet experts say that if protesters refrain from challenging the Communist party&apos;s grip on power \u2013 and if the potential costs of cracking down outstrip those of ceding to public demand \u2013 authorities may tread with caution. Chinese people have a &quot;much higher sense of environmental rights&quot; than they have in the past, said Ma Jun, the CEO of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing. Ma added that Sichuan authorities may have clamped down because the PX plant near Chengdu was already nearing completion. &quot;To my knowledge [the Kunming project] is in an earlier phase, and I think there are still opportunities there for reconsideration,&quot; he said. Furthermore, the province is still reeling from a devastating earthquake last month, raising the risk that a mass demonstration could spin out of control. Thursday&apos;s demonstrators donned face masks displaying &quot;anti-PX&quot; messages, shouted: &quot;Roll out, protest!&quot; and sang the national anthem in unison, according to firsthand reports on Twitter. Photos posted online show a thick line of police pressed tightly against rows of protesters, many of them documenting the standoff with smartphones and digital cameras. &quot;We cherish blue skies and white clouds, as well as good air. If you want to build a refinery with 10m tonnes of capacity here in the place where we live, we resolutely oppose it,&quot; said a Kunming resident who identified herself only by her surname, Liu. &quot;We want a good life. We women want to be beautiful,&quot; she told the Associated Press. At about 4pm, Kunming&apos;s mayor, Li Wenrong, addressed the crowd in a seemingly impromptu press conference. Li promised &quot;equal dialogue&quot;, public hearings about the refinery&apos;s future, and increased investment in pollution control, the Hong-Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper reported, adding that some onlookers dismissed his vows as lip service. Li parried censorship-related queries by saying: &quot;All levels of government have good intentions \u2026 but their methods may not always be right,&quot; the newspaper reported. &quot;Protest activities only happen on the precondition that the government doesn&apos;t offer opportunities for information transparency, dialogue and negotiation,&quot; said an influential Kunming-based blogger who uses the name Bianmin, or &quot;frontier person&quot;, in an email interview. &quot;If the government clings to its position, the public&apos;s resistance will only increase.&quot; Concessions to such protests by local governments and state-owned companies are not without precedent. A Shanghai battery manufacturer announced on Wednesday that it would cancel plans for a new plant after hundreds of locals staged three successive protests about its potential environmental impact. In August 2011, a massive protest in the north-eastern city of Dalian led local authorities to announce that they would relocate a polluting PX plant. Last autumn, authorities in Ningbo City, in coastal Zhejiang province, scrapped plans to expand a similar state-owned plant after a week-long demonstration by thousands of aggrieved residents. Li Bo, head of the Beijing-based NGO Friends of Nature, said the recurrence of &quot;anti-PX&quot; demonstrations showed that China&apos;s environmental authorities had been slow to learn from past mistakes. &quot;There were various attempts to find out more about this project by citizens in Kunming, but they have had a lot of difficulty getting satisfactory information,&quot; Li said. &quot;A lot of worries and doubts have accumulated, which is more or less what happened with the previous PX projects in Dalian and Ningbo.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Pollution", "Environment", "Protest", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-16T13:59:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice/2013/may/16/kunming-pollution-protest-chinese-environmental-activism", "sentences": ["Earlier this week up to a thousand people took to the streets in the Songjiang district of Shanghai against plans for a lithium battery factory amid concerns about water and air pollution.", "The survey, carried out by the Public Opinion Research Centre in collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, measured the public&apos;s attitudes towards environmental protection and how they rate the government&apos;s performance.", "Such protests appear to be often tolerated by the authorities and, like the Shanghai protests, are sometimes successful in their goals."], "title": "Kunming pollution protest is tip of rising Chinese environmental activism | Jennifer Duggan", "article": "Environmental protests are becoming one of the biggest forms of social unrest in China. The latest protests took place on Thursday in the city of Kunming in Yunnan province over plans to build a petrochemical plant in the nearby city of Anning. It is the second protest over the refinery to be built by China National Petroleum Corp.  The refinery, if it goes ahead, will process more than 10 million tonnes of crude oil a year and 500,000 tons of the industrial chemical paraxylene (PX). China is the world&apos;s largest producer of PX which is used in the process of manufacturing plastic bottles and other products and is carcinogenic. According to some media reports, up to 2,500 people took to the streets today and the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported that arrests had been made. The newspaper quoted a 24-year-old protester saying &quot;I hope this can be a good beginning for a dialogue between citizens and the government on major decisions&quot;. The protest was one of the top trending topics on Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo and photos were posted of protesters wearing masks and waving banners.  This latest protest in Kunming is the second large protest in a week over environmental concerns about industrial manufacturing. Earlier this week up to a thousand people took to the streets in the Songjiang district of Shanghai against plans for a lithium battery factory amid concerns about water and air pollution. According to media reports, residents of the area marched peacefully chanting and holding signs saying &quot;no factory here&quot;. Yesterday, state media reported that the plant, which was to built by Hefei Guoxuan High-tech Power Energy Co Ltd, would not go ahead due to the public pressure.  &quot;Everybody is texting the news, and there are plans for a celebration,&quot; a resident named Zhu was quoted by the China Daily newspaper and said that local people had viewed the plant as a safety hazard. &quot;We are delighted with the company&apos;s decision because we love Songjiang and we want a safe and clean environment,&quot; she said.

The survey, carried out by the Public Opinion Research Centre in collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, measured the public&apos;s attitudes towards environmental protection and how they rate the government&apos;s performance. Such protests appear to be often tolerated by the authorities and, like the Shanghai protests, are sometimes successful in their goals. Last October, a week-long series of protests in Ningbo in eastern China by thousands of residents was sucessful in stopping work on an oil and petrochemical complex. The frequency of protests is rising as China&apos;s increasingly affluent and middle-class society becomes more aware of environmental issues. The number of environmental protests rose by 120% from 2010 to 2011, according to Yang Chaofei, the vice-chairman of the Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences. Yang a told a lecture organised by the Standing Committee of the National&apos;s People&apos;s Congress on the social impact of environmental problems that the number of environmental &apos;mass incidents&apos; has grown an average of 29% annually from 1996 to 2011. He said that the number of incidents which involve concerns about dangerous chemicals and heavy metal pollution have risen since 2010. The results of the new survey indicate that the number of such incidents is not likely to decrease any time soon. Nearly half of those surveyed said the government should spend more on environmental protection and over 60% of residents said government information about environmental protection is not transparent. And in a strong sign that the Chinese public are not going to let their voices go unheard, 78% of those surveyed said that they will participate in protests if pollution facilities are to built near their homes.", "tags": ["Environment", "Pollution", "Activism", "China", "World news", "Protest"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-16T15:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/17/is-tropical-in-mongolia", "sentences": ["The band met Offenther in Shanghai and told him they were looking for somewhere more unusual to perform."], "title": "No sleep till Ulan Bator!", "article": "It looked exactly like a Caramac.&quot; Is Tropical&apos;s Gary Barber is recalling, with creeping terror, his visit to Mongolian capital Ulan Bator&apos;s Black Market, where he encountered a local delicacy: a solid bar of fermented horse milk. &quot;I was tricked into having a bit, and in the middle of the market. I just went phuuut and spat it all over the place. It&apos;s probably quite disrespectful.&quot; It&apos;s fair to say that Is Tropical aren&apos;t terribly enamoured with Mongolian cuisine. But it&apos;s probably the only aspect of the culture that the three-piece haven&apos;t hurled themselves at with gleeful abandon. Wrestling, horse-riding, sleeping in a yurt next to a mewling newborn calf: they&apos;ve tried the lot. Is Tropical, like so many of their peers, are out to make a name for themselves but they&apos;ve chosen an unusual route to indie stardom. Rather than the continual trudge around mid-level UK venues, the band have blown their money on playing in the furthest reaches of the planet. Since forming in east London in 2009, they&apos;ve performed at Venezuelan rock festivals, Russian house parties, and toured Brazil, south-east Asia and much of mainland Europe. It&apos;s a mindset consistent with the iridescent, synth-flecked dance-rock of their 2011 debut Native To, recent South American-themed EP Flags, and new album I&apos;m Leaving, which feels as likely to get feet moving in Caracas as it would in Coventry. This latest expedition is their boldest, or perhaps stupidest, to date. The band \u2013 Gary (guitars/vocals), Dominic Apa (drums) and Simon Milner (also guitars/vocals) \u2013 are sitting cross-legged and bleary-eyed in a downtown Ulan Bator car park with the Guardian, recalling a week in which, as well as outdoorsy activities and unpalatable scran, they&apos;ve joined the very small list of western acts who have performed in Mongolia. It&apos;s a list that doesn&apos;t extend far beyond forgotten Yorkshire dinosaurs Smokie, Dutch easy-listening group Michael Learns To Rock and Boney M. &apos;Watching your reflection in the eyes of the sheep that&apos;s been ritually slaughtered in your honour, it&apos;s hard to think about the publicity&apos;      It might sound like something dreamed up at last orders, but Is Tropical&apos;s Mongolian jaunt was inspired by a conversation with US expat journo, event organiser and self-proclaimed &quot;first DJ in North Korea&quot; Brian Offenther. The band met Offenther in Shanghai and told him they were looking for somewhere more unusual to perform. Offenther, familiar with the country from his time in the UN peace corps, suggested Mongolia. Despite knowing little about the place \u2013 Gary&apos;s education consisted of an episode of Ewan McGregor travelogue Long Way Round and &quot;a little bit on An Idiot Abroad&quot; \u2013 the wheels were immediately set in motion. Aside from providing the answer to a handful of pub quiz questions \u2013 it&apos;s the most sparsely populated country in the world and the second-largest landlocked one \u2013 Mongolia is largely ignored by the west. There&apos;s Genghis Khan, of course (&quot;One hard dude,&quot; notes Simon) but modern Mongolia remains, even in the age of TripAdvisor, a bit of a mystery. A satellite state of the Soviet Union until 1990, the country has recently undergone a period of rapid industrialisation, catalysed by the discovery of huge mineral reserves. In Ulan Bator, referred to locally as UB, brutalist Soviet architecture sits next to soon-to-be-completed skyscrapers, faux-Irish pubs and shopfronts adorned with cartoon versions of South Korean pop star Psy. Not everyone has been invited along for the ride, though; in UB&apos;s vast, impoverished shanty towns, over half the city&apos;s population make do without running water and basic sanitation. Away from the hum of the city, however, an entirely different lifestyle persists. Mongolia still contains significant nomadic populations, who regularly shuffle around to escape the region&apos;s bitter shifts in climate. After a jetlag-ridden first day in UB spent speaking to the local and national press, plus a visit to an orphanage, Is Tropical venture off into the wilderness to enjoy the hospitality of a yurt community. There, they don skimpy ceremonial costumes, have a bash at wrestling and horse-riding, learn some basic Mongol, and witness the killing and dismembering of a sheep, which is then cooked and served to them in a sort of Mongolian version of a hotpot. Apparently, it&apos;s easily the best thing they&apos;ve eaten so far. &quot;I&apos;d make it at home,&quot; says Dom, &quot;but I don&apos;t have a sheep to slaughter.&quot; There&apos;s a danger that such antics might come off as somewhat &quot;gap yah&quot;, a bit of fun before the real work of promoting I&apos;m Leaving begins. Yet, however naive it might seem, the band genuinely believe they can find an audience here, and are hopeful of amassing what Dom refers to as &quot;little gangs in different parts of the world&quot;. While the band are willing to concede there&apos;s an element of publicity stunt to this endeavour, they&apos;re equally adamant that the experience has been completely authentic. &quot;Watching your reflection in the eyes of the sheep that&apos;s been ritually slaughtered in your honour, it&apos;s hard to think about the publicity,&quot; suggests Dom.     Simon meeting the locals in Mongolia    Neither is the trip without its risks. Funding it has been a challenge: as well as dipping into their own finances, the band have had to find sponsorship. This includes a Mongolian beer company, who get the band to pose with pint glasses in their factory. All this effort for a gig that, as the band concede, might yet be in front of next to no one. Fortunately, Mongolian gig-goers are an enthusiastic bunch. Since the end of Soviet occupation, the UB music scene has taken off, with homegrown trance, death metal, hip-hop and garage rock scenes springing up. Even so, gigs are still scarce; few venues can accommodate live performance, and those that do often consider the process to be a lot of bother for little reward. Offenther tells us of a recurring problem, whereby high-profile western acts such as Pitbull and Nicole Scherzinger announce dates in Mongolia, only to cancel at short notice after realising that the venues can&apos;t accommodate their equipment. All of which means that an actual appearance by a western band, particularly one that appeals to a younger demographic than Boney M, is a big deal. So there&apos;s a healthy crowd present at UB&apos;s trendy iLoft venue as Is Tropical take to the stage. More surprising is just how many in attendance are familiar with Is Tropical&apos;s tunes. Put it down to the proliferation of music in the age of social media, or simply the enthusiasm of a Mongolian crowd towards a band who&apos;ve actually followed through on their promise to turn up, but a scarily significant number of the assembled throng are belting out the words to tracks from IT&apos;s debut album, as well as new single Dancing Anymore. For Is Tropical, it&apos;s vindication of their &quot;go anywhere, do anything&quot; ethos. The gig ends with Simon shouting, &quot;This is the best night of my life!&quot; and hurling himself into the crowd. It feels like the start of something. Is Tropical must now return home to promote and tour their record in the UK. Already, though, they&apos;re plotting a second sojourn to Mongolia, a charity single for a local orphanage, even a full-scale British invasion. &quot;Instead of coming to a country to observe it, you come to be part of it,&quot; says Simon. &quot;We could bring bands over to Mongolia.

Merritt&apos;s pet chihuahuas, Prince and Knight, are nuzzling his toes, craving attention at his home in Bryan, Texas; but the Olympic champion is in full flow. &quot;So you see,&quot; he says, finishing his hurdles-for-dummies tutorial with a flourish, &quot;even though my rhythm was really good there were two major points where I messed up. The 12.80 could have been a 12.70.&quot; He sounds wistful: like someone who has landed on the moon but believes he could have reached Mars. Yet his run in Brussels last September, in the dank dregs of the athletics season, after the energy of the Olympics had bubbled and popped, was one of the performances of 2012. In the space of 30 years the 110m hurdles world record had budged rarely and reluctantly \u2013 from 12.93sec in August 1981 to 12.87 in 2008. Then Merritt lopped 0.07 off it in one meaty swipe. &quot;My overriding emotion was: &apos;What?!&apos; I just started screaming,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought: &apos;Oh my god, that can&apos;t be right.&apos; So I waited for the time adjustment, thinking it would be rounded up. Instead it went down from 12.81 to 12.80 so I started screaming again.&quot; Heading into Saturday&apos;s Diamond League meeting in Shanghai, his first major race of the season, Merritt insists medals and records have not sated his hunger. &quot;I have a target on my back but I don&apos;t want to give people the opportunity to get close,&quot; he insists. &quot;I don&apos;t want to give them a shred of confidence.&quot; He spells out his goals. To win the world championships in Moscow. To break the record for most 110m hurdles races under 13 seconds \u2013 he did it eight times legally in 2012 and needs five more. To move the world record deeper into uncharted territory. To take it to Mars. This time last year Merritt was just another contender: the potential he had showed in winning the world junior championships in 2004 had been steadily undone by injuries \u2013 hamstrings, stress fractures, bones, always something \u2013 every year for six years. But, after finishing fifth behind his compatriot Jason Richardson at the world championships in Daegu in 2011, there was an epiphany. &quot;The hardest thing to deal with as an athlete is watching people you used to beat do phenomenal things,&quot; he admits. &quot;In college I murdered Jason.When he had his breakout year in 2011 I said to myself: &apos;Am I eating right? Am I supplementing right? Am I doing the work off the track to help prevent injury?&apos; A lot of times the answer was no. Talent isn&apos;t enough to get to the top, not when you keep getting injured. It took me 6\u00bd years to work that out. &quot;I decided I didn&apos;t want to be a shoulda-woulda-coulda \u2013 I wanted to be something. It was a wake-up call.&quot; Merritt cut out cheese, which &quot;leaned him out&quot;, and swapped cow&apos;s milk for almond milk. He had never been near a protein shake but started devouring them. In came massages, ice-baths and physio. He was able to recover from training faster, and stopped getting injured. &quot;It&apos;s like a car,&quot; he says. &quot;You need to get it serviced. You need to get the oil changed and the tyres rotated. And I wasn&apos;t doing that until last year.&quot; His shelves contain huge tubs of Champion Nutrition \u2013 with the for-once-appropriate tagline \u2013 &quot;Train like a Champion!&quot;, and Metabolol II high energy meal supplement. His answer to anyone who suspects anything more chemical is displayed on the logo of his wristband: &quot;Test Me I&apos;m Clean&quot;, which he wears in support of the anti-drugs-in-sport charity set up by his friend DeeDee Trotter, who won 400m bronze in London. &quot;It means what it says on the label,&quot; says Merritt. &quot;You can test me any time \u2013 morning, noon, night \u2013 and you won&apos;t find anything. I&apos;m clean.&quot; The other significant change Merritt made was technical: instead of running eight steps to the first hurdle he does it in seven. It took him months to crack. As his coach Andreas Behm explains: &quot;Switching to seven steps was mind-altering for Aries. He was afraid he would injure himself. It didn&apos;t work at first; he just wasn&apos;t getting it. In December 2011 we had a sit-down meeting where we decided to give it one more month. Then it clicked \u2013 and so did everything else.&quot; By the time of the Olympics, Merritt was &quot;so confident and so ready&quot; he knew that, barring accidents, he would win gold. &quot;There was a bit of disappointment that I didn&apos;t go under 12.9 in the final but then I thought: &apos;Come on, you&apos;ve just won a gold medal.&apos;&quot; He was so relaxed in London he played League of Legends, a sprawling, multiplayer fantasy game, on his PC during his down time. &quot;My guild is ranked eighth in the US right now,&quot; he says. &quot;I get online with them and play for hours. We are in the world&apos;s top 30.&quot; When he is training on the Texas A&amp;M track in College Station, however, he has only the eyes of Behm and the Super Duty 4x4s tooting down George Bush Drive for company. He starts with high-knee drills, his back prep-school straight, keeping his Dr\u00a0Dre headphones locked in place. &quot;Every time I hurdle I have to listen to something fast,&quot; Merritt explains. &quot;It makes my brain run fast.&quot; But it is not just about running \u2013 it&apos;s about also squatting 400lb in the weight room, the drills, the endless days; staying motivated. You get a glimpse of how Merritt and Behm work together during a session that involves standing long jumps off one leg and two, wearing a weighted vest. &quot;Notice I&apos;m only raking this area because that&apos;s where I expect you to land,&quot; Behm tells him. &quot;That&apos;s pretty far,&quot; responds Merritt. &quot;You should be able to jump further than that.&quot; &quot;With my weaker leg? Really?&quot; Merritt makes the jump and smiles in triumph, unaware of the impending counterattack. &quot;You&apos;re watching him,&quot; jokes Behm. &quot;That&apos;s why he is showing\u00a0off.&quot; Later, after he has flung 16lb shots over his head to improve his explosiveness and leapt from sitting on to a box that is 1.50m high, Merritt explains his strengths. &quot;I&apos;m a mix of power, finesse and quickness,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m not just good at one thing, I&apos;m good at everything. I did gymnastics for three years which helps too. A lot of sprinters have no flexibility at all. They are just too tight. They can barely touch their toes.&quot; His criticisms of sprinters do not end there: he also thinks Usain Bolt, Tyson Gay and Yohan Blake avoid each other too much. &quot;The 100m is the marquee event but you don&apos;t get to see the marquee names run every week,&quot; he says, sighing. &quot;In the 100m they duck and dodge. But in the 110m hurdles we always race against each other. Why can&apos;t they do that?&quot; He also admits to being &quot;a little jealous&quot; of the popularity of American Football and NBA stars, pointing out: &quot;In the US, track athletes are only alive in the eyes every four years.&quot; But while his idol, Renaldo Nehemiah \u2013 the first man to run under 13 seconds in 1981 \u2013 switched briefly to American football with the San Francisco 49ers, Merritt has no plans to do likewise. &quot;To take a hit might be detrimental to my life,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s one of those dangerous, dangerous sports; a lot of athletes have sustained brain damage.&quot; Another option he has discounted is to move up in distance. &quot;At the Olympics Edwin Moses said to me you should do a 400m hurdles, your technique is so good you could run a 47 seconds,&quot; he confides. &quot;I looked at him and said: &apos;Man, you are joking. It would be a four-year project to gain enough stamina.&apos; But in a 200m hurdle race I would be a monster.&quot; So what is next? &quot;I&apos;ve spoken to Colin Jackson about how to raise my profile and get exposure like Bolt,&quot; he says, half-smiling, half-serious. &quot;I want to be remembered, I want to get to be a household name. Colin still hasn&apos;t gotten back to me but I&apos;m sure he&apos;s thinking about some ideas.&quot; On his fireplace there is a quote from Henry David Thoreau which reads &quot;Live the Life You&apos;ve Imagined&quot;. The photograph of Merritt at the White House, beaming away next to Barack and Michelle Obama and the rest of the US Olympic Team, suggests he hasn&apos;t done too badly. Seven steps Merritt took to success 1 &quot;Diet. I&apos;ve pretty much eliminated diary. I used to eat cheese every day but now it&apos;s once a week because it is so fattening. I now eat far more vegetables and drink almond milk.&quot; 2 &quot;Supplementation. Until last year I never took protein supplements. Now I take one scoop 45 minutes before training and two scoops afterwards.&quot; 3 &quot;A lot of rest and recovery. Being sensible. The protein helps me recover quicker from hard training too.&quot; 4 Consistency in training. Not being injured all the time. 5 &quot;Getting the physio I need. Regular massage has really helped.&quot; 6 &quot;Being more focused mentally. I&apos;m focused on what I want to do - and what I need to achieve it.&quot; 7 &quot;The change I made in the winter of 2011 to bring my number of steps to the first hurdle down from eight steps to seven.&quot;", "tags": ["Athletics", "World records", "Sport", "US sports"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-17T14:22:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/18/pga-championship-european-tour", "sentences": ["&quot;We work with them not only at Wentworth but with tournaments in Germany and Shanghai."], "title": "Ryder Cup stars boost European Tour's flagship PGA Championship event", "article": "A nod towards the not-so distant past is not only inevitable but a tangible boost as the European Tour prepares to host its flagship tournament. The BMW PGA Championship starts at Wentworth on Thursday with 12 key competitors in the field \u2013 the members of last year&apos;s successful European Ryder Cup team. The circumstances of their glorious victory over the United States in Medinah adds to the sense of anticipation as top-level golf returns to England. &quot;It is an enormous boost, to have all 12 playing,&quot; says George O&apos;Grady, the European Tour&apos;s chief executive. &quot;Sergio Garc\u00eda, for example, hasn&apos;t played at Wentworth for a couple of years and is coming back. Ian Poulter has attracted a new following on account of what he did at the Ryder Cup and with Rory McIlroy there is the youth factor, the way he plays, how much he has done when so young, which always boosts the galleries around him. But rather than focus on individuals, it is great to have all 12 together. We shouldn&apos;t underestimate that. &quot;What the Ryder Cup created was a massive public interest, where people with even a vague understanding of, or interest in, golf watched the Ryder Cup and were gripped by it. It was the greatest comeback of all time. In a golf setting, people are still talking about it.&quot; Yet in a purely individual sense, there is Wentworth intrigue. McIlroy&apos;s attempts to rediscover his best form, with the US Open looming, is merely one of them. Poulter&apos;s surprise and premature exit from the World Match Play Championship means he too could do with a good Wentworth display. The PGA aside, next week kicks off a spell in which the European Tour hosts prime events in Ireland, Germany, France and Scotland. O&apos;Grady is no stranger to the harsh economic circumstances that have proved problematic way beyond the sport. The European Tour has lost events and so added fresh ones in places not previously associated with competitive golf. Some are sceptical about the lack of a traditionally European focus as a result of that; O&apos;Grady can rightly point to financial necessity and the raft of newly built courses in countries such as Turkey and Bulgaria as the spur behind the Tour&apos;s approach. He admits part of the Tour&apos;s motivation is &quot;unashamedly to make money to top up some of our other events&quot;, but he denies the game is always a hard sell. O&apos;Grady also places heavy value in the European Tour&apos;s prime competitions. &quot;Golf offers visibility and credibility for investors and sponsors,&quot; he says. &quot;But beyond that, there is the unique mix of a pro-am and hospitality as well. When Barclays sponsored the Scottish Open, they took control of the entire pro-am and found that it made business for them. &quot;This year, the Scottish Open will be covered in the United States by both the Golf Channel and NBC for the first time. That is good news for the sponsors, Aberdeen Asset Management, who want to sell funds in that part of the world, and also for the Scottish government, in a tourism sense.&quot; The Wentworth numbers are impressive. Advance tickets sales for the PGA Championship are up by 60% on 12 months ago. Over the past five years, crowds have always improved, with 95,000 in total in 2012. It is perfectly possible that the figure will stretch to six figures this time around. &quot;Our deal with BMW has another year to run and we have already started speaking about extending that,&quot; O&apos;Grady says. &quot;We work with them not only at Wentworth but with tournaments in Germany and Shanghai.

The following morning, the 17-year-old girl&apos;s naked corpse was pulled from a drainage ditch. The two were hastily convicted of rape and murder, and spent 10 years in jail. The case was closed, but far from over. The Zhangs were released in late March owing to new evidence showing the possibility of another suspect, state media reported. Zhejiang province&apos;s top court reversed the ruling. DNA samples, it said, had implicated another man, and police may have used illegal methods to extract the Zhangs&apos; confessions. On Monday it was reported that the court has awarded the Zhanges \u00a3120,000 each to &quot;compensate them for the deprivation of their personal freedom, as well as mental damage&quot; \u2013 slightly less than they had requested, but more than courts have granted in similar high-profile cases. Chinese media have revealed a handful of cases like the Zhangs&apos; recently, shedding light on the prevalence of wrongful convictions in China and the systemic shortcomings in the judicial system that allow them to occur. Zhang Gaoping, 47, told state media that he and his nephew were subject to seven days of brutal interrogation before trial \u2013 sleep deprivation, starvation, cigarette burns. Other detainees pressured them into signing confessions, which, it was revealed, were drafted by police. Other cases have been equally shocking. Zhao Yanjin, of Hebei province, was released in February after nearly 10 years behind bars \u2013 she had been charged with orchestrating the murder of a neighbour&apos;s six-year-old son in 2005. Zhao said police beat her so badly during her interrogation that she suffered permanent hearing loss. In Xiaoshan, Zhejiang province, five people were released this year after spending 17 years in jail, wrongfully convicted of robbing and murdering two taxi drivers in March 1995. While investigating an unrelated case last winter, police discovered that a suspect&apos;s fingerprints matched those found at the murder scene 17 years earlier. After a string of cases involving wrongful convictions, the executive vice-president of China&apos;s highest court has denounced such miscarriages of justice. &quot;It is even preferable to spare guilty people than to hand down wrongful punishment to the innocent,&quot; Shen Deyong wrote in the supreme people&apos;s court-owned newspaper People&apos;s Court Daily. Wrongful convictions, he said, often arise from &quot;corruption, negligence and irresponsible attitudes in judicial agencies&quot;. Last year, courts in Henan province introduced a pilot programme to hold judges responsible for wrongful convictions, even after they switch posts or retire. Yet critics say the problem lies with the country&apos;s judicial system as a whole, in which judges are appointed by Communist party officials and often show stronger allegiance to their superiors than objective standards of justice. Lan Rongjie, a law professor at Zhejiang University, said judges were often close to police and prosecutors, who placed them under enormous pressure to find suspects guilty. Because suspects often spend months, even years, in detention centres before trial, an innocent verdict could subject the police and prosecutors to legal scrutiny. &quot;Sometimes they will be found guilty of torture,&quot; Lan said. &quot;Torture is a very serious charge.&quot; According to the China Law Yearbook, 99.9% of China&apos;s criminal cases in 2009 ended in convictions. Lan said that regular criminal trials in China&apos;s cities normally last less than two hours. Summary trials can be less than 30 minutes long.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Law", "Human rights"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-20T12:05:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/crowdsourcing-cars-redesigning-business", "sentences": ["Last year I spoke at Shanghai&apos;s Radical Design Week about the transformational design of business."], "title": "How crowd-sourcing can redesign the car business", "article": "Last year I spoke at Shanghai&apos;s Radical Design Week about the transformational design of business. I talked about car manufacturing and how, with state of the art 3D fabrication tools, a networked participatory culture and rapid innovation, the car company Local Motors claims to build cars five times faster at one hundred times less the capital cost of conventional manufacturers. Local Motors is perhaps one of the most comprehensive examples of a revolutionary approach to the design, engineering, manufacturing, sales and marketing of cars. But don&apos;t worry if you are not in the automotive industry, the Local Motors story is one about the firms of the future. Designing high performance organisations Companies today can change their shape, capability and performance by rethinking and redesigning core processes. In the case of Local Motors, its factories (the Local Motors micro-factory was rated by Jalopnik as one of the world&apos;s top ten most impressive car factories), R&amp;D, sales, marketing and production represents a design system that is an industrial ecology, rather than a series of boxes and silos. Moreover it is much less costly to set up, run and maintain, which enables the company to invest its energies into high quality design and production. An open networked innovation platform Local Motors runs competitions to find innovations. For its first vehicle competition, 44,000 designs were submitted and 3,600 innovators shared their knowledge and insights. No one company can hire that many people and there was no cash prize. So, what inspired so many people to participate? Through its open participatory platform called The Forge, Local Motors has collaborated in automotive innovation with DARPA, the US military research agency, co-designing and building a fully functional prototype of a combat support vehicle in three and a half months. Even large car manufacturers have turned to Local Motors, such as BMW, which is currently running an urban driving experience challenge. So Local Motors becomes more than just a car manufacturing company \u2013 it&apos;s an automotive innovation platform and a true community. Local Motors attracts innovators because it is creating and releasing social and intellectual capital into a common pool. This open innovation platform is counter intuitive to many assumptions about how businesses are run, and how intellectual products are created and protected. The economics of sharing: open legal frameworks Normally all this innovation would be locked down with copyright law that seeks to limit the dissemination of intellectual property, whereas all of the Local Motors designs created within the common pool are freely available to access and download. It might seem a radical step for an automotive company to operate this way, but what is becoming clear is that operating under Creative Commons legal frameworks has exponential benefits that can radically accelerate the innovation process, whilst dramatically reducing the costs of innovation. Creative Commons is based on the economics of sharing. It is a set of permissions allowing creative work or intellectual knowledge to be shared and used in a number of different ways. It enables the sharing and dissemination of knowledge, encourages diversity and learning while stimulating commercial activity. It was specifically created as a response to a broken copyright model. The framework emphasises the benefits of sharing and mutuality as key to establishing a richer more vibrant world economically, socially and culturally. Manufacturing innovation The online communities of innovation are part of an industrial ecology that is designed to be lightweight, adaptive, and highly efficient. Local Motors builds micro factories where one vehicle design is built, it works with the Penske Group for automotive parts supply, pre-fabricates frames, chassis, bodies, and uses 3D printing in its manufacturing process. And when you buy your Rally Fighter you go to the micro factory, and spend six days with a mechanic building your car. Building your own car means you bond with it, and may be less likely to default on repayments. The cost of the build process is transformed into a memorable experience for each and every customer. The company is fascinating because it fundamentally changes the relationship with supply and demand by rethinking and redesigning the process from conception to production. It harnesses a distributed knowledge network which is both hyperlocal and superglobal, and makes a clear point of being green and sustainable. It innovates through engaging enthusiasts who are passionate about car design and engineering, and uses competition as both risk mitigator and innovation accelerator. The company also fosters regional development. Rather than building another car plant, Local Motors is building micro-factories, so that money flows into local communities, and creates local jobs. Finally, learning is seen as a constant daily process to enable the company to evolve and to grow, and understand what work and what doesn&apos;t. Local Motors is an example of a lightweight, flexible and adaptive business that can work at unprecedented velocities, and where sociability is embedded into the very fabric of the process.

The fashion house, known for its camel, red and black check-lined raincoats, reported an adjusted pretax profit of \u00a3428m for the year to 31 March, exceeding analysts&apos; expectations of \u00a3415m. Revenue in Asia Pacific, its largest region with 35% of sales, rose 13%, led by demand for its more expensive products in China and Hong Kong. Sales were up 20% in China, which accounts for 14% of Burberry&apos;s retail and wholesale revenue after it opened 11 stores in the country. The group has bounced back from a profit warning last September after sales in China slowed. Burberry said profit for the first half of its new fiscal year would be below last year&apos;s as its focus shifts from wholesale markets \u2013 sales through non-Burberry stores \u2013 to high-growth Latin American and Asian retail sales from Burberry-branded stores. Retail sales now account for 71% of Burberry revenue. First-half profit for the six months to the end of September last year was \u00a3173m. The group said it was aiming for a modest increase on the 17.1% adjusted operating margin achieved in the full year, which it expected to come in the second half of the year when it should generate more revenues than in the first. The firm repeated that it expected first-half wholesale underlying revenue to decrease by about 10% as it reduces accounts in Europe and North America. The firm is focused instead on tapping the appetite for western luxury in faster growing, higher-end Asian and Latin American retail markets. The group will open a net 10 Burberry stores in its new fiscal year, with three larger format stores in Shanghai to serve local customers and domestic tourists. In Latin America, Burberry opened four stores in Brazil and signed franchise agreements in Colombia, Chile and Barbados.

Choe Ryong-hae, a senior Workers&apos; party official and a vice-chairman of the top military body, arrived in Beijing with a political and military delegation. A close aide of the youthful leader, he is the first senior North Korean to visit China since last summer and the first special envoy since Kim took power in 2011. China provides North Korea with the vast majority of its fuel and trade \u2013 reportedly accounting for almost nine-tenths of its imports and exports in 2011 \u2013 and its support has become even more important as Pyongyang&apos;s relations with Seoul have deteriorated. But it has shown increasing signs of frustration with the regime over its weapons programmes and angry rhetoric. &quot;Since North Korea had the third nuclear test [in February], the relationship between China and North Korea has been pretty tense. To ease the relationship, the visit is very normal and necessary. It helps to stop the bilateral relationship deteriorating,&quot; said Cai Jian of the Centre for Korean Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. &quot;This visit shows China is also willing to improve the relationship with North Korea.&quot; China&apos;s state news agency, Xinhua, said Choe, 63, met Wang Jiarui, head of the international department of the Communist party. It gave no further details. Analysts say Beijing rebuffed earlier proposals of high-level exchanges because it wanted to demonstrate its displeasure and was not guaranteed a meeting with Kim if it sent an envoy to Pyongyang. Major Chinese banks recently suspended financial dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea \u2013 Pyongyang&apos;s main conduit for international transactions. Kim Jong-un has not visited Beijing since he took power following his father&apos;s death in late 2011, though his uncle Jang Song-thaek visited in August last year. Chinese politburo member Li Jianguo went to Pyongyang with a letter from Xi Jinping, who had just become the Communist party leader, in November. John Delury of Yonsei University suggested that Chinese leaders might also be looking ahead to South Korean president Park Geun-hye&apos;s visit next month. &quot;China wants to have good relations with both Koreas \u2026 They don&apos;t want to go too far with a great splashy meeting [with the South] while things are still off-kilter in the North Korean relationship. For its part, North Korea may want to recalibrate; they wanted a bit of distance from Beijing, but they don&apos;t want to push it too far,&quot; he said. The North Korean news agency story on Choe&apos;s trip also revealed that General Kim Kyok-sik has become military chief again \u2013 a post he held before 2009 \u2013 replacing Hyon Yong-chul. General Kim was recently replaced as defence minister \u2013 a lower ranking position \u2013 by Jang Jong-nam. North Korea tested short range missiles over the weekend, but tensions have ebbed on the peninsula and there are signs of diplomatic engagement again. Last week the Japanese prime minister sent a close aide to Pyongyang to hold talks over abducted Japanese citizens \u2013 a move greeted with dismay by South Korea, which described the trip as unhelpful.

Her husband, an engineer, had found a job there, and she decided to tag along. Her friends laughed when she told them about her plans. Fourteen years later, Makuena runs the only African hair salon in Beijing \u2013 perhaps the only one in China \u2013 and her Congolese friends are no longer laughing. Clients come from across the country for her braids. One regularly flies in from the Philippines. Makuena has three children attending international schools and manages four stylists from the DRC&apos;s capital Kinshasa. She plans to open a Shanghai outlet within a month. &quot;Now everybody wants to come,&quot; she said with a warm laugh. &quot;They all ask me to send them an invitation.&quot; Paulma Afro Hair Care is in one room on the bottom floor of a postmodern skyscraper complex near Beijing&apos;s diplomatic quarter. In the centre of the room, African hair lotions, relaxers and shampoos sit in a display case. A flat-screen TV hangs from the ceiling and business licences adorn the walls. Makuena explained that most Chinese stylists don&apos;t know how to braid, and Chinese hair products don&apos;t work on African hair. Communication failures between Chinese stylists and African clients can have disastrous consequences. She described one woman who visited a Chinese barber for a quick trim soon after her arrival and lost most of her mane. &quot;She said, &apos;Oh, I cried, I cried the entire day, and the entire night, and the following day,&apos;&quot; Makuena said. The rapidly growing Sino-African relationship has had an extraordinary impact on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a nation of 75 million bordering nine countries at the geographic heart of the continent. China owns most of the processing plants in the country&apos;s resource-rich southeast. Last year, the Shenzhen-based telecommunications giant Huawei opened an 8,000 square-metre training centre in Kinshasa. Makuena has returned to Kinshasa three times since 1999, and every time China loomed larger in its residents&apos; lives. Most of the city&apos;s Chinese immigrants are construction workers, she said, but some run restaurants, supermarkets and small shops. &quot;I was seeing them everywhere,&quot; Makuena said.Many speak Lingala, the local language, and don&apos;t plan to return home. Around 500,000 African immigrants live in China \u2013 Nigerian students, Angolan traders, Tanzanian restaurateurs \u2013 creating endless opportunities for cultural exchange and more than a few misunderstandings. &quot;You meet somebody here and they say, &apos;Oh you&apos;re from Africa. That is hell, that is jungle,&apos;&quot; Makuena said. &quot;Someone once asked, &apos;Do you have rice in Africa?&apos; Stupid question.&quot; Makuena found her first home in China, the inland metropolis Wuhan, a bit of a shock. She spoke no Chinese and there were no other foreigners in her community. When the couple moved to Beijing in 2003, Makuena enrolled in Chinese classes and joined an international congregation. She sent her children to kindergarten and spent her afternoons trawling expat websites. She noticed that some African women were afraid of moving to China because they feared a lack of appropriate hair care. Makuena began treating women in her apartment \u2013 friends would deny pro bono hair care by hiding wads of cash in her shoes \u2013 but the lack of space put strains on her family life. &quot;Sometimes someone would want to wash their hair, so I&apos;d say &apos;crawl in the bathtub&apos;, but that&apos;s not a very comfortable position,&quot; she said. Last spring, after eight months of wrangling with China&apos;s ministry of commerce, the salon opened its doors. On Wednesday afternoon, Makuena&apos;s only customer was a Chinese man wearing camouflage pants. She translated his Chinese into Lingala for the clipper-wielding Congolese stylist standing behind his chair. &quot;What does he want?&quot; asked the stylist. &quot;What do you think would work?&quot; said the man.

What should investors do? Pick up some bargains marked down in the sell-off? Or junk their investments ahead of a major crash? We show you how to be a DIY investor in five easy steps: Step 1 Get informed Despite the falls in Tokyo and smaller falls in London and New York, it is remarkable how much some shares have risen over the past year. EasyJet is up 165% and Lloyds 131%, although the worst-performing companies in the index, Eurasian Natural Resources and Evraz, are down 43% and 53%. Of the 2,000 unit trusts available to small investors, Japanese ones, even after Thurday&apos;s falls, have performed best, followed by formerly bombed-out funds in Europe. For example, Artemis&apos;s European Growth fund is up 54% over the past year, while Legg Mason&apos;s Japan fund has risen by 110%. Among investment trusts it is a similar story, and not just in Europe and Japan. For example, Henderson&apos;s UK Smaller Companies investment trust has jumped 66% over the past year. Even the average fund invested in UK shares is ahead 34% over the year. Scores of websites will help you make decisions about investments. The Financial Conduct Authority, which replaced the Financial Services Authority, has a vast array of consumer\u00a0information on investments, how to shop around, and your rights, although it won&apos;t give advice on where to invest. To research shares, one of the easiest sites to use is Yahoo Finance at uk.finance.yahoo.com. Stockbrokers also have sites promising to hold your hand through the share-buying process, such as Hargreaves Lansdown (hl.co.uk), the Barclays Investor Zone (barclays.co.uk) and Halifax Share Dealing (halifax.co.uk). Or click on Guardian.co.uk/money where you can find factsheets on investing, live share prices and regularly updated news, plus the best free news archive online. To find out about funds, take a look at trustnet.com, which hosts free data on the performance of thousands of unit trusts and investment trusts. More experienced investors may want to try citywire.co.uk, a good\u2011quality, well-resourced news site for the more professional investor, providing updates on share prices, fund performance, top fund managers, directors&apos; dealings, news archives and so forth. Or you can talk to like-minded people keen to start investing. As book clubs do for literature, investment clubs bring together people with an interest in investing. Try proshareclubs.co.uk for information on clubs in your area. But don&apos;t be tempted by &quot;free&quot; investment seminars promising easy money from stock markets. You&apos;ll be pushed into paying thousands of pounds for information you can find free elsewhere on the web. Step 2 Choosing an investment  Investing is about taking risk, but reducing that risk by spreading your money around and allocating your cash sensibly. So where do you start?  \u2022 How much can you afford to invest? Be realistic \u2013 it&apos;s better to pay down debts first, or perhaps pay into your company&apos;s pension scheme if the company also contributes. Do you have a lump sum to invest, or are you going to invest every month? Many experts say it is better to drip-feed your money into shares and funds over the long term, to help iron out the rough and smooth periods. \u2022 What&apos;s your timeframe? If you&apos;re under 50 and saving for a pension, then it&apos;s sensible to take higher risks and invest knowing you won&apos;t need the money for 10 years. If you&apos;re saving for a mortgage deposit in a couple of years, then don&apos;t put your cash in just a few shares that might be plummeting when you need to cash in. \u2022 Diversify your investments. Mix and match some blue-chip shares in big, safer companies with smaller investments in riskier, but potentially higher growth, smaller ones. Put money into emerging markets \u2013 but not everything. Japan was the laggard of the last two decades but even after the falls late this week has been the strongest market of the last 12 months. If you had a small allocation in Japan, at least you&apos;d be enjoying some of that gain. Meanwhile the Shanghai market is below where it was a year ago - so may be a better bet for the year ahead. \u2022 Consider ethical funds. Of the big ones, Standard Life Investments&apos; European Ethical fund has notched up a gain of 44.3% over the last 12 months, while over three years its UK Ethical fund has returned 75%. Step 3 How to buy and sell To buy or sell shares, there are dozens of online &quot;execution only&quot; brokers with relatively low charges. Expect to pay commission and a possible annual fee for holding the shares for you (called custody), with charges dependent on how frequently you trade. Halifax Share Dealing, Saga (provided by Barclays) and Hargreaves Lansdown all charge \u00a311.95 per trade. They claim you can open an account and start trading within minutes, once you&apos;ve made a minimum initial deposit. To buy or sell funds, your best bet is the investment &quot;platforms&quot; that allow you to buy, sell and manage all your investments \u2013 including Isas and self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) \u2013 in one place online. The biggies here are Alliance Trust&apos;s i.nvest platform, Hargreaves&apos; Vantage and Fidelity&apos;s fund supermarket (which sells a wide range of funds, not just Fidelity&apos;s). These are not just platforms for buying \u2013 for example, Fidelity offers lots of guided portfolios and &quot;expert picks&quot; for the novice investor. Step 4 Keep the charges low It&apos;s easy to waste money on unnecessary charges. The number one rule is: avoid the daft &quot;initial fee&quot;, which can be up to 5.5% of the sum you are investing. If you put \u00a35,000 in, say, the UK&apos;s biggest fund, Invesco Perpetual High Income, then \u00a3250 will go out the door in initial charges, plus another 1.5% of the value of the fund every year in annual management charges. The fund platforms named above will discount most initial fees to zero and there are discount broker sites such as chelseafs.co.uk and bestinvest.co.uk that offer funds cheaply. Cavendish Online is probably the cheapest place to buy, as it gives a rebate of not just the initial charge but also part of the annual charge as well. Generally, buying direct from a fund management company is a bad idea, as you will have to pay the hefty initial charges, but some are offering DIY investors better deals. Fundsmith.co.uk, sells its top-performing global equity fund to small investors for a 1% charge. Step 5 Monitor and move You should think of investments in shares and funds as long-term and avoid trading regularly, as your returns will be eaten up with charges. But use the huge variety of online tools to keep\u00a0an eye on your portfolio. Many will allow you to switch from one fund to another for a\u00a0charge of around\u00a00.25%.

Amid a PR frenzy that drew the likes of supermodel Kate Moss and Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, it seemed that even the torrential rain and 18,000 lightning strikes across the territory hours before the VIP preview on Wednesday were just part of the city-wide spectacle. There is much familiar about Art Basel in Hong Kong, which runs alongside the original fair in its namesake home city in Switzerland and a sister event in Miami Beach \u2013 not least the sponsors. Trolleys of Ruinart champagne stalk the aisles at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. A BMW &quot;art car&quot; brightly painted by Spanish artist C\u00e9sar Manrique is displayed outside one entrance. Absolut ArtBureau, an offshoot of the vodka drink company, has commissioned an &quot;art bar&quot; by Adrian Wong, in which a Cantonese lounge singer performs with an animatronic band of multi-limbed manga-like creatures, evoking a mix of colonial kitsch and Blade Runner.      Art Basel&apos;s purchase of the previous Art HK fair two years ago led some locals to question whether Hong Kong&apos;s art scene was becoming a post-colonial venture for importing western art into Asia. With China now the world&apos;s second-largest art market after the US, and Asia home to more billionaires than North America, the attraction seems obvious. In recent years, several top commercial western galleries have set up outposts amid the Louis Vuitton and Prada stores in the city&apos;s central business district, including American Larry Gagosian, the world&apos;s richest art dealer, in 2008 and London gallerist Jay Jopling&apos;s White Cube in March 2012. At packed-out private views, both galleries brought out their big guns. White Cube showed the Chapman Brothers&apos; macabre new installation, The Sum of All Evil, vitrines packed with thousands of miniature figures in violent torment; and Gagosian presented paintings by the late New York graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. But the wooing of the Chinese collectors and their vast wealth is a long, slow process. Most western galleries have yet to convince the big buyers of mainland China, whose taste for contemporary art remains patriotic, according to market analysts. Graham Steele, director of White Cube Hong Kong, said: &quot;The barriers are coming down, but not as fast as western dealers would like them to. There isn&apos;t the cultural momentum yet. The major Chinese collectors come to Hong Kong for Christie&apos;s or Sotheby&apos;s auctions of Chinese art.&quot; US gallery Pace&apos;s Beijing branch, which explicitly declares itself an Asian gallery and runs a different programme from the US and UK branches, has found success by becoming a major dealer for Chinese contemporary artists. Its stand at the fair included work by Zhang Xiaogang, whose paintings have fetched multimillion-pound prices at auction. Several British dealers said that Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines, which are more familiar with western culture, were their most important markets in Asia. Australians are also major collectors. Ellie Harrison-Read, sales associate at Lisson Gallery, said: &quot;Big names such as Anish Kapoor and Marina Abramovic, people who are familiar, sell well. Brand is very important here.&quot; This seemed to be apparent in big sales of the fair&apos;s first day. London&apos;s Victoria Miro gallery sold a wall-sized painting by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama for \u00a31.32m and White Cube sold a Gary Hume sculpture for \u00a366,243, while 15 sculptures by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, depicting a cartoon version of the artist and his dog, sold for \u00a389,428 each. The local art scene, which has long felt overshadowed by the Chinese contemporary art boom, has mixed feelings about the influx of international dealers. Pui Pui To, director of 2P gallery, one of Hong Kong&apos;s few art spaces to represent local artists, said: &quot;Now that the blue chip galleries have arrived, it&apos;s become much tougher for us to survive.&quot; Spiralling rents have pushed younger galleries further from the city centre. Pui Pui To&apos;s gallery, which is showing in Art Basel, is on a backstreet in Sai Ying Pun in the city&apos;s western district. &quot;The only brand names round here are McDonald&apos;s and KFC,&quot; she said. However, she praised Art Basel in Hong Kong&apos;s director, Magnus Renfrew, who founded Art HK for supporting the local art scene through educational programmes and collaboration with non-profit, artist-run projects. Renfrew said that when he first arrived in Hong Kong it was referred to as a &quot;cultural desert&quot; with little audience for contemporary art: &quot;Since the fair opened, the number of visitors has grown from just 19,000 in 2008 to 67,000 last year and the gallery scene is more sophisticated.&quot; He believes that the current imbalance between the art market, which has long had a big presence in the territory with Christie&apos;s and Sotheby&apos;s auction houses, will change with the construction of the West Kowloon cultural district, which will include the M+ museum of visual culture, twice the size of Tate Modern, and 16 performing art museums. An outdoor exhibition of inflatable sculptures on the site, M+ mobile, which includes a giant upturned cockroach, a suckling pig you can walk into and British artist Jeremy Deller&apos;s bouncy castle version of Stonehenge, has drawn 130,000 visitors in just three weeks. Lars Nittve, executive director of M+ and the founding director of Tate Modern, compared the exhibition to the sensation caused by Carl Andre&apos;s bricks when they first were shown at the Tate. &quot;Really for the first time in Hong Kong it has provoked public debate about whether something that looks ugly can be art. Can you jump on art? Can art be fun?&quot; Harriet Onslow of Pearl Lam Galleries, based in Hong Kong and Shanghai, thinks there will be room for a wider range of galleries as the art scene diversifies. &quot;Collectors are not going to decide against buying one of [the smaller galleries&apos;] artists for HK$5,000 just because I&apos;ve sold them something for HK$200,000,&quot; she said. However the work of one of the local artists in the Pearl Lam booth suggests that Pui Pui To is not alone in her ambivalance towards the internationalisation of Hong Kong&apos;s art scene. Tsang Kin-wah offers a tongue-in-cheek critique of the art fair system in a text installation in which scathing comments in vinyl lettering spread across the floor like the tentacles of an octopus: &quot;ANYONECANBEANARTISTTHEREFOREANYA$$HOLECANBEANARTIST ANYONECANBEACOLLECTORTHEREFOREANYA$$HOLECANBEACOLLECTOR CREATE$LUXURYARTCREATE$BIGMONEYCREATE$POWERCREATE$BIGMONEY CREATE$BIGNAMECREATE$FAMECREATE$POWER.&quot; Onslow said: &quot;It&apos;s about how fucking awful art fairs are and how it&apos;s no longer about the art but the fair. The text is etched on glass because that signifies how the art and the artist is disappearing.&quot; Yet in the Deutsche Bank&apos;s exclusive VIP room another work by the artist, best known for painting words in English and Chinese in seemingly floral patterns, offers a more positive if rather cynical take, with the phrase &quot;Making Art, Making Money&quot; discernible in the grey text.

If anything, there&apos;s a chance it could be better than Olympic night because we&apos;ll just have track and field fans going wild. That&apos;s something I can&apos;t wait for. &quot;It&apos;s going to be emotional more than anything because it&apos;s something that has completely changed my life. That night, August 4th, was a life-changer for me and I get to go back out there to perform again. It&apos;s a fantastic opportunity and I can&apos;t wait. &quot;I remember that moment when I walked out for the Olympics, it was very emotional and I got that rush of adrenalin.

On his performance in Manchester, he said: &quot;The crowd were absolutely fantastic, they really got behind us. It was a bit like going into a home stadium, everyone went absolutely wild and it gets you going a bit more. &quot;It [his performance] wasn&apos;t too bad. The hard thing is when you go through the rounds so quickly your energy levels drop, so I had to muster up quite a lot by the end of it, because I&apos;d just done four rounds and it knackers you out really quickly \u2013 7.99m is OK, I&apos;m happy with it. Hopefully I can maintain this run of decent performances. With that, confidence and big distances will come. &quot;Something like this [event] is great because it&apos;s free, people can come and go, nip off to the shops or for something to eat, and then come back again.

The analysis of the course of the H7N9 bird flu virus and use of antivirals in 14\u00a0patients, reported in the Lancet medical journal, found that three severely ill people did not respond to the group of medicines that are the standard weapon against threatened flu pandemics. Two died and the third still needed specialist equipment to oxygenate their blood at the time the research paper was submitted.

The ordeal of Baby 59 \u2013 known only by the number of his hospital incubator \u2013 made headlines around the world after extraordinary footage was shown of firefighters and medics freeing him from the narrow pipe. Police in Jinhua, Zhejiang province, initially thought the baby had been abandoned and said they were treating the case as one of attempted homicide. But they subsequently realised that the resident who had raised the alarm, and who remained present throughout the two-hour rescue on Saturday, was his mother. Local media said she told police she wanted to raise the child but had no idea how to do it.           The 22-year-old said she went to the shared bathroom when she felt abdominal cramps, state media reported. When the baby slipped into the sewer pipe she was unable to free him. Shanghai Daily said police identified the woman as the likely mother on Monday and were still determining whether her story was true or she had intentionally dumped him. She reportedly confessed after they found blood-stained tissues and toys in her room and asked her to undergo a medical check. Police in Pujiang initially declined to comment on whether the mother would face charges, saying the case was under investigation. But an employee at Punan police station, which previously handled the case, told the Guardian it was &quot;an accident&quot;. On Thursday, an official at the Pujiang propaganda office told the Associated Press there would be no charges as police had concluded the unwed woman did not initially step forward out of fright.  The baby had been released from a hospital into the care of the mother and a man claiming to be his father, the official said. Images of the baby&apos;s rescue sparked horror and sympathy across China, with wellwishers deluging the hospital where he was treated with gifts and offers of adoption. He had suffered some scratches and bruises but is understood to be otherwise healthy. According to Jinhua-based Zhezhong News, the woman works at a restaurant in the city and became pregnant after a one-night stand. But the man denied any responsibility and she could not afford an abortion. She had not revealed her pregnancy to her parents, hiding it by wearing loose clothes and wrapping cloth tightly around her abdomen. One microblog user said the woman did not deserve to be a mother and should not be allowed to keep the baby because she would not be a responsible parent. But as fresh details emerged, the initial wave of anger towards the baby&apos;s parents was tempered by sympathy for the mother. One Sina Weibo user wrote: &quot;I am the father of two children. I know a little about how much children need their parents, and I think this mother needs help too.&quot; Another said that rather than blaming the mother or expressing sympathy for the little boy, people should seek to help other children, urging: &quot;We should think about how to build a charity home for abandoned babies and give them assistance with their lives and psychologically.&quot; Premarital sex is now widespread in China but experts say that many young adults lack the knowledge they need to protect themselves. The sociologist Li Yinhe said more than 70% of China&apos;s young adults had had sex before marriage, but Chinese schools typically shied away from sex education and teaching about contraception for fear of appearing to condone premarital sex. \u2022 Additional research by Cecily Huang ", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-30T04:42:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/30/hollywood-china-film-industry", "sentences": ["&quot;Every time a movie shows skyscrapers in Shanghai instead of secret police arresting people, China has scored another propaganda victory.&quot; Kate Saunders, of the International Campaign for Tibet, said many celebrities remained committed, notably Richard Gere, who wore a Tibet tie-pin at the Oscars."], "title": "Be nice to China: Hollywood risks 'artistic surrender' in effort to please", "article": "In Hollywood, the screenwriter William Goldman once observed, &quot;nobody knows anything&quot;. Now, however, everybody knows at least one thing: whatever you do, be nice to China. If your movie features a Chinese villain, change his nationality. If your plot omits a scene in China, insert one \u2013 preferably with gleaming skyscrapers. If your production deal lacks a Chinese partner, find one. If Beijing&apos;s censors dislike certain scenes, cut them. Kow-towing to China has become a reflex for actors, writers, producers, directors and studio executives in pursuit of the world&apos;s second-biggest box office, a trend set to intensify as China overtakes the US as the No 1 film market. Recent blockbusters such as Iron Man 3 and Django Unchained, and others in the pipeline such as Transformers 4 and Brad Pitt&apos;s World War Z, have been modified to please Chinese authorities and audiences, prompting accusations of artistic surrender. &quot;It&apos;s got to the point where everyone is thinking: how are we going to make a movie that, at the very least, is not offensive to the Chinese public?&quot; said Peter Shiao, chair of the US-China Film Summit and founder and CEO of the Los Angeles-based Orb Media Group. Screenplays look beyond China for baddies, he said. &quot;People from the Middle East seem to be taking the brunt, and will probably continue to do so until it has its own rising film market. Sad but true.&quot; Where Asians villains do appear they tend to be North Korean, as in the recent action films Olympus Has Fallen and Red Dawn. China&apos;s market is booming. Box office revenues rose 30% last year to $2.7bn, overtaking Japan. With about 10 new cinema screens opening daily, China is expected to overtake the US within a decade. The other reason is Chinese government control. To nurture domestic film, it allows only 34 foreign films to be shown annually, an increase from the previous cap of 20 but still a tiny number. To stand a chance of inclusion in the quota, a film must please, or at least not offend, the authorities. The only way to circumvent the quota is to turn a film into a Chinese co-production, meaning Chinese elements in the story, production and funding. Such ventures give Hollywood 43% of the profits versus the usual 25% \u2013 a big added incentive. &quot;I&apos;m working on the script right now, and if someone came to me and said: &apos;We&apos;re looking into doing a chunk of this in China&apos;, well, I&apos;d have to think about it,&quot; Joss Whedon, who is working on Avengers 2, told Entertainment Weekly. &quot;China is on my radar. It can&apos;t not be at this point.&quot; James Cameron said he was considering inserting Chinese elements into two sequels to Avatar, saying it would be &quot;logical&quot; to have Chinese characters on the planet Pandora. The upcoming World War Z deleted dialogue sourcing a zombie virus outbreak to China. Transformers 4 will recruit Chinese actors through a television contest expected to attract thousands of hopefuls. Jurassic Park IV will reportedly feature dinosaurs found in China. The Dark Knight Rises and Skyfall found reasons for Batman and James Bond to visit China. Cloud Atlas cut 40 minutes. Quentin Tarantino approved multiple changes to Django Unchained. Iron Man 3 went further than most, adding scenes for the Chinese version that showed a Chinese surgeon saving Tony Stark and lines for the leading female actor Fan Bingbing. Chinese links were expunged from the &quot;Mandarin&quot;, a comic villain played by Ben Kingsley. Robert Downey Jr, who plays the lead, told a press conference in Beijing: &quot;I&apos;m interested in all things Chinese, and I live a very Chinese life in America.&quot; Dreamworks has thrived in China with family films devoid of taboo sex and violence, but many studios stumble with the censor or putative Chinese partners, resulting in delays, frustration and cancelled co-productions. &quot;Filming in China was a great experience, but it was beyond my skillset to understand or fathom the inner workings of the Chinese government,&quot; the producer Marc Abraham told the Hollywood Reporter. Shiao said studios often blundered by thinking they could turn any film into a coveted co-production with a few cosmetic tweaks. &quot;You have to have the right project.&quot; China, he said, wanted Hollywood to help showcase its culture and build a homegrown film industry with global appeal. &quot;It seems pretty far down that track.&quot; Hollywood&apos;s traditional support for the Dalai Lama has not slowed its scramble for the yen, said Alistair Currie, a UK-based activist with Free Tibet. &quot;Every time a movie shows skyscrapers in Shanghai instead of secret police arresting people, China has scored another propaganda victory.&quot; Kate Saunders, of the International Campaign for Tibet, said many celebrities remained committed, notably Richard Gere, who wore a Tibet tie-pin at the Oscars. &quot;Even small, symbolic gestures of support by Hollywood stars can say a lot in today&apos;s world of instant communications.&quot; Critics have accused film-makers of letting communist censors butcher their work, prompting defensive responses. A Sony spokesman for Tarantino said the &quot;adjustments&quot; to Django Unchained were &quot;progress rather than a compromise&quot;. The satirical site Hollywood &amp; Swine has mocked the kowtowing. &quot;Film schools to begin teaching students how to pander to China,&quot; said a recent headline.

Experts lined up to attack food safety standards in China, lambasting the country&apos;s record and warning of the increasing dangers to US consumers. &quot;Inserting the words &apos;China food safety&apos; into the internet leads to over 155m hits \u2013 none of them laudatory so far as a brief examination can tell,&quot; William Triplett, author and consultant and former chief Republican counsel on the Senate committee on foreign relations warned. The timing could hardly have been more awkward. On Wednesday, just a few weeks after the hearing, Chinese meat giant Shuanghui agreed a huge takeover deal for Smithfield, America&apos;s largest pork producer. The deal, which if approved by Congress would be the biggest Chinese buyout of a US company to date, has raised serious questions about the implications for the US food supply. Triplett&apos;s testimony, and that of other experts, will be closely examined in Washington over the coming weeks as politicians decide whether or not to weigh in on the bid. Other takeovers have been blocked on security grounds, but so far food does not seem to constitute a national security issue as far as Washington is concerned. That may be about to change, according to another critic at the hearing: lobby group Food &amp; Water Watch. As the group pointed out earlier this month the US is increasingly reliant on imported food, and, increasingly, that food comes from China. According to the government accountability office (GAO), the percentage of imported food consumed in the US almost doubled from 9% to 16% between 2000 and 2011. China is the world&apos;s leading supplier of many of the staple elements of the US diet including apples, pears, potatoes and peas. Food &amp; Water Watch has started an online campaign to block the Smithfield deal and is calling for congressional hearings. Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food &amp; Water Watch, told the Guardian the deal was worrying in itself, but warned that it could be the thin end of the wedge and could lead to Chinese firms taking over large parts of the US food industry. &quot;Smithfield itself does not have a good record in the US. It has been associated with some of the largest fines under the Clean Water Act,&quot; she said. &quot;And we know there have been major problems with Shuanghui in China. It doesn&apos;t seem to me like a great combination for US consumers.&quot; China itself is subject to a seemingly endless series of food horror stories. Recently Chinese authorities found enterprising meat traders had been creating &quot;mutton&quot; out of rat, fox and mink flesh doused in gelatin and red colouring. Earlier this year, 16,000 dead pigs were found floating in tributaries of the Shanghai&apos;s Huangpu river, a source of tap water. Before the 2008 Olympics China was rocked by a scandal when hundreds of thousands of babies took ill, and six reportedly died, after drinking contaminated infant formula. The US has already suffered a widespread, fatal food poisoning that can be clearly traced back to China \u2013 only the victims were pets. In 2007 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received reports that several thousand cats and dogs had died and thousands more became ill after eating contaminated cat food. The outbreak was traced to wheat gluten imported from China that had been mixed with melamine, a chemical compound. Melamine is one of the principal ingredients in Formica, it is also a food adulterers favored additive when they want to bulk up an item&apos;s apparent protein content. The pet deaths caused widespread outrage and triggered a congressional hearing, but the problem did not stop there. Some of the contaminated pet food ended up in hog and chicken farms and hence on supermarket shelves. In April the FDA asked for $10bn to increase the number of inspections it makes of Chinese food imports. But after years of savage cuts the FDA seems overwhelmed. Given the budget fight now raging on in Washington, that situation is unlikely to improve any time soon.  Triplett told Congress last month that the regulator inspects just 1%-2% of China&apos;s imports. &quot;I don&apos;t think there is anywhere near enough taxpayer&apos;s money to play whack-a-mole with the Chinese toxic exporters around the Pacific that would make any real difference,&quot; he warned and called for the Chinese to clean up their own act.     China is the world's leading supplier of many of the staple elements of the US diet, including apples, pears, potatoes and peas. Photograph: AP    Ironically, the Smithfield deal may have been encouraged by its decision to deal with an additive issue that had Chinese consumers worried. For more than a decade US hog farmers have been putting an additive called ractopamine into pig feed to produce lean meat. Concern has been mounting about the effect of ractopamine on humans. In March China began requiring third-party verification that US pork products were ractopamine-free. Russia too, the sixth-largest buyer of US pork, has blocked imports of meat using ractopamine. Smithfield intends to make half its enormous swine herd ractopamine-free even though the FDA still stands by its decision that the chemical is safe. A made-in-the-USA stamp has value in China where consumers are demanding safer food. That cache is worth protecting. For critics this too is proof of China&apos;s influence on US food production. Future developments may not be as benign. Pressure to cuts prices has already made hog production an even dirtier business, said Hauter. It is difficult for farmers to make a profit these days unless they have at least 2,000 pigs, she said. &quot;There are counties in North Carolina that produce more waste than New York City,&quot; she said. That pressure on prices is likely to grow alongside rising demand in China. China is already the world&apos;s largest consumer of pork. Per-capita pork consumption last year was 86lbs, up from 70lbs in 2002, according to Northstar Commodity Investment. In the US pork consumption was 58lbs last year, down from 66lbs in 2002. &quot;When you have increasing pressure to bring down prices, a lot of shortcuts are taken,&quot; said Hauter. &quot;They are denying this now but ultimately I think production will move to China.&quot; China is currently banned from exporting poultry to the US but is pressing for that to be reversed.  The Smithfield deals comes at a sensitive tome for Chinese-American relations. President Obama meets Chinese leader Xi Jinping in California next week. The two countries have clashed over alleges cyber-attacks and trade spats. It remains to be seen whether Obama wants to put food on the table, so to speak. But if the backlash against the Smithfield deals grows, he may have no choice. &quot;A few years from now you could see an enormous increase in the amount of food we take from China,&quot; said Hauter. &quot;I think if you ask them, the average American will be very concerned about that.&quot;", "tags": ["Food & drink industry", "China", "US news", "US Congress", "American food and drink", "Business", "Life and style", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-31T16:46:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/hollande-france-president-wine-cellar-auction", "sentences": ["Among the buyers was a Shanghai-based Chinese importer of French wines who bought half the Cognac on sale and the most expensive Petrus."], "title": "Vintage Hollande: France's president puts Elys\u00e9e wine cellar under hammer", "article": "He styled himself &quot;Mr Normal&quot;, gave himself a pay cut and prefers to live in his own modest flat than the presidential palace, so it made sense when Fran\u00e7ois Hollande decided to secure one more publicity coup for national belt-tightening by selling off part of the Elys\u00e9e wine cellar.

Exports around the world have increased by 50% over the last decade, as the market for high-class titanium products booms. Revenue is up. Apprentices are being taken on. A new plant for small aluminium castings has just been opened in the Chinese town of Nantong, near Shanghai. Times may be hard, but the company is thriving at the top end of Schack&apos;s triangle of prosperity. What goes for Tital goes for Germany. As the rest of the eurozone \u2013 along with Britain \u2013 labours under the yoke of austerity, Germany has been basking in the glow of international success. A week ago, Bayern Munich, a supporter-owned football giant, deservedly won the biggest prize in club football, the Uefa Champions League, beating national rivals Borussia Dortmund in the final. England&apos;s debt-laden heavyweights and their foreign owners were placed firmly in the shade. Then there is Volkswagen, which reported a $15bn (\u00a39.8bn) profit for 2012, making it the most profitable car manufacturer in the world, ahead of Toyota and General Motors. The new VW Golf also won &quot;world car of the year&quot; at the New York motor show in March \u2013 not a bad way to celebrate the company&apos;s 75th anniversary. The list of reasons for Germans to be cheerful goes on: wages are rising while those in the rest of Europe and America stagnate; economic growth, though affected by the crisis, continues; and unemployment is half that in neighbouring France. In a depressed, recession-haunted eurozone, Germany is the last economy left standing, following the hurricane of the debt crisis. And in flatlining Britain, where the search for sustainable economic growth has become the question of the age, the alluring calls of the German model have become deafening. Even George Osborne, who tends to look to America for economic inspiration, told a group of Manchester businessman that companies such as Tital &quot;are the envy of the world&quot;. For a country described as &quot;the new sick man of Europe&quot; in the late 1990s, Germany appears to have made a superhuman recovery. Where did it all go right? According to Wolfgang Streeck, the director of Cologne&apos;s Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Germany&apos;s golden moment is the vindication of a different way of doing things, one that has as much to do with history and culture as economic theory. &quot;In the 1980s and 1990s,&quot; said Streeck, &quot;when America took off in the direction of the dotcom boom, Germany remained a manufacturing economy, true to its artisanal roots. That was strongly criticised at the time. There were lots of commentators \u2013 the Economist, for instance \u2013 who said that the country had been left behind, that it had become old-fashioned. Worse, Germany&apos;s economy was highly regulated. Power was locally held. Employers had obligations to their workforce and the local community. Wages were high and workers had the right to influence decisions and sit on boards. In countries like Britain and America, that way of organising things was seen as a kind of death sentence for the economy.&quot; Instead, Streeck says, this much mocked business environment proved a blessing in disguise, as Germany&apos;s firms proved more supple and cunning than critics had imagined. &quot;The constraints eventually proved beneficial,&quot; Streeck continues. &quot;Firms accepted the challenge and got ahead by improving and innovating, particularly in the global market, focusing on quality not price. Managers managed better. VW, in relative terms, was low-tech in the 1970s. Now its Wolfsburg plant is one of the most sophisticated in the world.&quot; In the early 2000s, the Wolfsburg workforce also played its part, as Germany struggled with the legacy of reunification. When VW threatened to transfer the production of new cars to cheaper locations such as Portugal, new flexible hours and pay were negotiated with the IG Metall union, along with performance targets and training schemes. The then chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, praised the 2001 deal as &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, urging other industries &quot;to follow the example of VW and IG Metall to create new jobs in Germany&quot;. Labour market reforms, negotiated between employers and unions, followed across German industries. They have been enthusiastically embraced by Schr\u00f6der&apos;s centre-right successor, Angela Merkel. Meanwhile, in hundreds of small towns like Bestwig, a remarkable success story with global implications was taking place. Germany has long treasured what it calls its &quot;Mittelstand&quot; businesses, the small- to medium-sized enterprises that are often family-owned, typically have up to 500 employees and specialise in high-quality niche products. When the film-maker Edgar Reitz made Heimat, his acclaimed epic of German life in the 20th century, the postwar economic recovery was symbolised by a fictional family optics firm, set up in the heart of the Rhineland. Over the last 10 years, as competition from cheap labour abroad has placed a premium on innovation, skill and high quality, the real-life Mittelstand has never had it so good. Tital, founded by two local families in 1974, has made itself indispensable to its clients through a patented casting process that uses a unique cooling liquid. &quot;It&apos;s our Coca-Cola,&quot; jokes Schack. In total, Germany&apos;s Mittelstand companies own an astonishing 499,525 such patents. These innovators also employ more than 70% of the country&apos;s workforce, provide 83% of Germany&apos;s apprenticeships and have links to communities that go back generations. Sennheiser, an audio equipment manufacturer that provided the sound for last month&apos;s Eurovision Song Contest, is still located a stone&apos;s throw from the house of Fritz Sennheiser, who founded the company 65 years ago. It is the stability of those links \u2013 with schools, banks, businesses and the wider community \u2013 that gives companies such as Tital and Sennheiser a competitive edge. Tital gets its finance from the investment arm of the local co-operative bank, which is prepared to give its strategies time and space. From the schools in Bestwig and the surrounding area, the company takes 18 apprentices each year. It pays a grant to allow the more able to go to university, on condition they come back to work at the company. For the less academic, an in-house supplementary education is provided. Schack himself teaches the new recruits a voluntary politics and economics course. &quot;Each year we take two apprentices who have not really got the qualifications needed,&quot; he said. &quot;We give them a broad training and they work really hard because they are happy to be given the chance. And they stay loyal to the company, as do the graduates who come back after we&apos;ve helped with their higher education. So what&apos;s good for the community and good for our reputation is also good for the firm.&quot; Compared to Britain&apos;s Work Programme, it&apos;s a different world. Tital also has a works council with power and influence over company strategy, including one full-time paid organiser. The system works because the cultivation of an engaged and committed workforce, says Schack, is fundamental to the company&apos;s future. &quot;We depend on innovation coming through from production level. We need continuous improvement and collective ideas; employees who think as they work. The system functions because we need to be up there at the quality end of the market. So we pay top dollar because we need to compete at that level, and that gives us the luxury of having this consensual way of acting.&quot; Companies such as Tital, Sennheiser and Lunor \u2013 a six-person manufacturer of high-end spectacles now sold in unfeasible quantities to South Korea \u2013 resemble Britain&apos;s indie bands in their 1980s pomp. They are distinctive, niche and promoted by small-scale but sympathetic financial backers. And life at the industrial &quot;supergroups&quot; is just as harmonious. Last week, as wage freezes and reductions continued across the rest of Europe, a substantial pay increase was agreed on behalf of 97,000 Volkswagen workers by IG Metall. Public sector workers are also set to receive a big increase. Even for the most seasoned of economic observers, it is a reversal of fortunes that takes the breath away. In the last years of the 1990s, all the buzzing talk was of Silicon Valley and America&apos;s technology boom. In Britain, light-touch financial regulation under New Labour created superbanks capable of generating wealth on an industrial scale, but industry itself received little attention at Westminster. Germany struggled. Then came Northern Rock, a near financial meltdown and the fallout from a City-inspired long boom that had been sustained by debt. &quot;The crisis changed everything in Europe and America,&quot; says Streeck. &quot;The credit-based pseudo-prosperity had come to an end. And at that moment, it was the Germans who had things to sell that the others didn&apos;t.&quot; So what can Britain learn from this sobering turning of the tables? At a London School of Economics debate last month, the Labour peer Maurice Glasman debated with the Conservative education minister, Michael Gove, on the subject of &quot;One Nation Britain&quot;, Ed Miliband&apos;s big idea. Glasman believes that if it is to become a reality, places such as Birmingham must look a lot more like Braunschweig. Labour needs definitively to move on from the starry-eyed embrace of financial markets that characterised the Blair years, and focus on the unglamorous, steady localism of capitalism, German-style. &quot;Germany won,&quot; said Glasman at the debate. &quot;We have a Champions League final between two supporter-owned and democratically governed football clubs. Tradition and the preservation of institutional virtue are a source of energy and modernisation precisely because change and continuity work together; a balance of power is the best system; a negotiated settlement is better than one that is imposed, the domination of any interest violates the demand of what is good; the discovery of the common good between forces that are estranged is the best good of all. It takes longer to get there but the benefits are more enduring.&quot; Lord Sainsbury, a former Labour minister and author of a just-published book entitled Progressive Capitalism, is less sure. &quot;I don&apos;t think you should try to copy countries that have a different kind of capitalism,&quot; he told the Observer. &quot;In terms of industrial democracy, for example, the role of trade associations and trade unions in Germany cannot be replicated in the UK. In German business negotiations, if employers or employees are being unreasonable, then their own umbrella body intervenes and makes sure a consensus is reached. Trade unions and trade associations can deliver for their members, which they can&apos;t in Britain. America is the more relevant comparison for Britain.&quot; The view from Streeck&apos;s office in Cologne is similarly pessimistic, on cultural as well as economic grounds. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult to reproduce Germany in England,&quot; he said. &quot;Here there is still a considerable respect for the engineer, the maker of things. There is still a cultural link back to the old artisanal pride in Handwerk, or craftsmanship. In England, early unlimited competition wiped so many of those firms out. Britain needs to look at the spirit of German institutions maybe, but then work out how that spirit can be translated into a different world.&quot; The German love of engineering was vividly on display last Thursday afternoon, as hundreds of visitors spent a bank holiday at Wolfsburg&apos;s Auto City, a lavish monument to the native car industry. Willy Schl\u00fcter, from Bielefeld, was there with his family. As his children tried out a Beetle cabriolet for size, he explained: &quot;We had an Opel for a while. But now we&apos;ve got a VW Touran.&quot; The cabriolet would be nice, but it wasn&apos;t a family vehicle. Would he ever consider buying a foreign car? Too polite to say no, Schl\u00fcter gave a slightly apologetic smile. After decades of industrial neglect and regional decline, Britain, whatever the aspirations of Ed Miliband, has a long way to go before such popular pride in homegrown products goes without saying. For the time being, incontrovertibly, Germany rules.

The meetings, which will begin in July, are the first formal attempt to break the growing threat to cybersecurity posed by military-backed hacking operations. In recent weeks the US government has complained in increasingly shrill terms about breaches into some of the country&apos;s most sensitive infrastructure \u2013 including core military systems and new product development by many leading US businesses \u2013 by hackers thought to be based in Beijing and Shanghai. Cyberespionage is likely to be a prominent item on the agenda when President Obama hosts the new Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for a special summit in Rancho Mirage, California on Friday. The meeting, which is being billed as a getting-to-know-you exercise for the two presidents, is a reflection on the part of US officials that they see in Xi a politician who might have greater success than predecessors in reining in hackers attached to the Chinese military. Cries of foul-play have been dramatically stepped up in recent weeks by the US administration. Last week the Washington Post obtained confidential portions of a report for the Pentagon by the Defense Science Board that warned that Chinese hackers had cracked into the programs for many of the US military&apos;s most sensitive advanced weapons systems. Compromised designs included the advanced Patriot missile system, an Army system for intercepting ballistic missiles and the Navy Aegis ballistic-missile defence system. In addition, the security firm Mandiant has identified a unit of the People&apos;s Liberation based outside Shanghai as the source of more than 140 attacks on many of America&apos;s top institutions, including newspapers such as the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, political think tanks and major firms. China has repeatedly denied the allegations and countered that it sees US military build up in the Asia region \u2013 presented by the US as its &quot;new pivot to the Pacific&quot; \u2013 as a direct threat to its interests. Chinese commentators have also frequently pointed to Stuxnet, the computer worm that attacked Iran&apos;s nuclear programme in 2010 and is believed to have originated with the US working in tandem with Israel, as evidence that the US government is also capable of cyber aggression. Though Obama is expected to raise the issue directly with Xi on Friday at the 200-acre Sunnylands estate, the discussion is likely to tiptoe around the subject. Officials have told the New York Times that the most highly charged aspect of the allegations \u2013 that US military secrets are being stolen on a huge scale \u2013 will not be broached as military espionage is considered too hot to handle at this stage by both sides.

When doctors diagnosed three-month-old Xie Yuling with a rare auto-immune disease in 2011, the baby&apos;s father was out sea crab fishing, so Xie was sent to the Shanghai hospital where his nephew was undergoing treatment. Three times a week he cycled alone past his fishing village&apos;s tucked-away tangle of concrete-hulled houseboats, past the miles of adjacent chemical, pharmaceutical and power plants, anddown along the burbling Yangtze river, where his family collects drinking water. Then one day, he got the call. &quot;The doctor tried everything to make him better, but he didn&apos;t get better, and he died,&quot; said Xie, 24, gazing up at the paper mill which towers above his home. &quot;It was definitely the pollution. What else could it have been?&quot; Yanglingang residents count their home as one of China&apos;s &quot;cancer villages&quot; \u2013 small communities near polluting factories where cancer rates have soared far above the national average. Chinese media, academics and NGOs estimate that the country is home to 459 of them, spread across every province except far-western Qinghai and Tibet. New cases seem to emerge monthly, each a painful reminder that China&apos;s past three decades of breakneck economic growth have carried a tremendous human cost. Yanglingang is home to only a few hundred people and at least 11 have died of cancer since 2003. Xie&apos;s neighbour, Liu Shudong, is dying of oesophageal cancer. Another neighbour, Wang Jinlan, died of breast cancer in 2010. Last year, stomach cancer claimed his friend&apos;s 30-year-old wife. In February, the ministry of environmental protection mentioned cancer villages in its latest five-year plan \u2013 the only ministry-level acknowledgement of the issue since it was first reported in 1998. Chinese NGOs and activists hailed the report as a much-needed step towards environmental transparency. Yet interviews in three cancer villages across two provinces revealed that many central and local authorities continue to treat the issue as they long have: with denial, intimidation and silence. Even the environmental ministry&apos;s acknowledgement was a mistake, said Chen Wanqing, deputy head of China&apos;s national cancer registry. The ministry has been reprimanded. Health and environmental officials organised a joint meeting during the National People&apos;s Congress, a political gathering in March to renounce the report&apos;s wording.They sent missives to provincial officials urging them to restrict usage of the term in local media. &quot;This is a medical issue \u2013 it can&apos;t be acknowledged from outside the ministry of health,&quot; Chen said. &quot;The statement was not correct, or not appropriate.&quot; However, the link between pollution and poor health is well established. Cancer mortality rates in China have risen 80% over the past 30 years, making it the country&apos;s leading cause of death. In cities, toxic air is a primary suspect; in the countryside, it&apos;s the water. More than 70% of the country&apos;s rivers and lakes are polluted, according to government reports; almost half may contain water that is unfit for human contact. &quot;Fundamentally, the situation isn&apos;t getting any better,&quot; said Liu Lican, a Guangzhou-based journalist who has published a book about cancer villages. Pollution-related cancer, he said, can elude detection for years. &quot;So even if the cancer was caused by pollution that&apos;s already gone, maybe gradually more and more of these villages will emerge.&quot;     In 2011, the three-month nephew of Xie Zhengqing, pictured collecting fishing nets with Xie Zhengwei, 28, died of a rare autoimmune disease. Photograph: Jonathan Kaiman for the Guardian    Yanglingang lacks a public water supply, and before the government built the industrial zone in the early 2000s, the villagers didn&apos;t mind; the river was clean, its fish abundant. But for eight years, Yanglingang has been sandwiched between the Nine Dragons paper mill and a power plant that billows white smoke from four tall stacks, covering the houseboats in a thin layer of ash. The mill discharges its waste water directly into the Yangtze, leaving a maroon residue on the rocks along its shoreline. Villagers purify the water with alum powder before drinking it, but even well-treated batches carry a faint industrial aftertaste. &quot;Everybody here has some form of illness,&quot; Xie said. His mother is bedridden with bronchitis. His infant nephew died of Evans syndrome, which has no known cause but is not usually fatal. The family took out \u00a37,000 in loans to pay for the baby&apos;s medical expenses, and Xie doubts that they will ever be repaid. Despite abundant anecdotal evidence for China&apos;s profusion of cancer villages, scientific proof has been elusive. When Wu Yixiu, toxics campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia, first visited Yanglingang in 2010, she assumed that establishing a causal connection between its pollution and cancer problems would be fairly straightforward \u2013 its population is so tiny, the disease so widespread, the pollution so caustic. &quot;It&apos;s unimaginable that their health will not be affected by the quality of this water,&quot; she said. Yet there are too many specific chemicals involved and too many types of cancer; diagnoses are spread over too many years. &quot;You need to establish the fact that it&apos;s a certain chemical that&apos;s causing certain cancers, and this chemical is being discharged from this very factory,&quot; she said. &quot;This would require years of observation and tracing disease records.&quot; About 140 miles south of Yanglingang, in a far-flung suburb of Hangzhou City, 45-year-old Wei Dongying has spent almost two decades trying to build a similar case. Pollution has haunted Wuli village, population 2,000, since the nearby Nanyang chemical industry zone opened its doors in 1992, gradually covering its waterways with black streaks and soapy-white froth. &quot;So many people here have gotten cancer, they want answers, but they&apos;ve been given nothing,&quot; said Wei.     Xu Changlian and his wife, Wang Jinnan, pictured in 2010, have cancer, the exact causes of which are unknown.  Photograph: Lu Guang/Greenpeace    Between 1992 and 2004, 60 villagers died of cancer, Wei said. Last year, it killed another six. Wei keeps samples of tainted village water in a corner of her three-storey tiled house and stacks of fraying documents \u2013 petitions, official letters, test results \u2013 in thick manila envelopes on her shelves. When she complained to national environmental authorities in 2004 \u2013 she had already tried local petitioning \u2013 the municipal government promised to shut down Nanyang&apos;s polluting factories within three years. Yet the industrial zone continues to operate unimpeded. Wuli&apos;s water still frequently runs black; on some days the air smells like burning refuse. Last summer, signs for a new chemical plant, Hangzhou Cairui, began appearing at a nearby intersection. &quot;They never asked for the villagers&apos; approval,&quot; Wei said. Government-approved researchers have visited Wuli, but most seem keen to debunk Wei&apos;s claims. &quot;They say the number of deaths isn&apos;t too high,&quot; she said. &quot;I say, wait until someone in your family gets cancer, then tell me it&apos;s not too high.&quot; They have tested the water, but refuse to publicise their results. After Wuli received a flurry of media attention in early April, local authorities threatened residents with unspecified consequences for their outspokenness. Experts say that, as China&apos;s affluent provinces become more environmentally progressive, officials often shunt polluting factories to poorer western regions where their environmental impact may go unchecked. &quot;Polluting industries will keep moving inland as inland regions continue to follow the &apos;grow first&apos; approach to development,&quot; wrote University of Central Missouri professor Lee Liu in a 2010 report. Villages such as Dongxing, in Jiangsu province \u2013 a four-hour drive north from Yanglingang \u2013 are often left to fend for themselves. The Julong chemical plant, which villagers, academic studies and media reports suspect gave more than 100 residents cancer between 2000 and 2005, sits abandoned on the village&apos;s southern limits, but its impact may linger for decades. Northern winds sometimes carry a vague chemical scent which villagers say emanates toxic waste buried near the factory ruins. Streams that once coursed through the village have long run dry.Chinese media and academics have discussed Dongxing&apos;s cancer rate since 2006, when a reporter for the China Economic Times investigated the plant, which produced 2,000 tonnes a year of the carcinogenic chemical chlorophenol a year. After Julong opened in 2000, the village&apos;s ducks, chickens and geese began dying en masse. Villagers slept with wet towels over their mouths and noses, terrified of inhaling toxic fumes. Air around the elementary school, 300 metres from the factory, smelled so noxious that villagers moved their children to one in a neighbouring township.

Photograph: Jonathan Kaiman for the Guardian    Four villagers \u2013 Zhu Yuehua, Duan Degui, Bian Junren and Shu Qichang \u2013eventually decided to sue the plant. Zhu has since moved to the nearby metropolis Wuxi, where he works in construction. Duan and Bian died last year in a car crash. Shu Qichang sits in a white-brick farmhouse flanked by verdant rice paddies, fanning himself in the April heat, weary from heart disease. His eyes are shockred, his cheeks sallow. Petitioning was useless, he said. The county environmental bureau denied the cancer rate was a problem, and the town courthouse would not hear their case. Thugs detained the farmers near a higher court in Funing County and followed them to the highest provincial court in Nanjing \u2013 where the lawsuit was ultimately discarded. Then in 2010, without giving a reason, the factory closed. Wheat and rice harvests, which markets once refused to buy, are sellable again. Villagers have accepted the status quo; in any case, they&apos;ve run out of alternatives. &quot;No matter how much we talk about this, they won&apos;t compensate us,&quot; Shu said. &quot;So we don&apos;t talk about it any more.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Cancer", "Pollution", "Health", "Activism", "World news", "Environment", "Greenpeace", "Society", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-04T14:08:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/06/china-war-japan-rana-mitter-review", "sentences": ["Wang Jingwei also had his security thugs, including Li Shiqun, a Shanghai gangster, whose Gestapo-like headquarters at &quot;Number 76&quot; in Shanghai proved too much even for the Japanese supervisors."], "title": "China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival by Rana Mitter \u2013 review", "article": "Where does the modern Chinese superpower come from? Only 75 years ago, China was divided, impoverished, economically exploited and at war with ambitiously imperialist Japan. The notional rulers of China, Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist Kuomintang party, controlled a shrinking area of central and south-west China, fighting the Japanese with a poorly armed and trained army, and sometimes fighting the Chinese communists ensconced in China&apos;s north-west. In 1940, the Chinese nationalists seemed close to defeat and Japan&apos;s vision of a &quot;Great East Asia Co\u2011Prosperity Sphere&quot; (a Japanese-dominated Asian new order) looked closer than ever to achievement. Somehow, the rump independent China survived and, against considerable odds, became one of the\u00a0victorious allies in 1945. But how? The answer to this question has never much bothered western historians, who, for better or worse, have focused on what they see as the\u00a0real war in Europe and the Pacific, where easily identifiable victories can be found and the explanation is clear. It is that neglect which has prompted Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history at Oxford, to write the first full account of China&apos;s wartime resistance against Japan, restoring a vital part of the wartime narrative to its rightful place. Now, for the first time, it is possible to assess the impact of the war\u00a0on Chinese society and the many factors that explain the Japanese failure in China and the eventual triumph of Mao Zedong&apos;s communists in 1949, from which the superpower has grown. It is a remarkable story, told\u00a0with humanity and intelligence; all historians of the second world war will be in Mitter&apos;s debt. The sheer scale and complexity of the Sino-Japanese war is daunting enough and Mitter, perhaps wisely, does not get bogged down in the technical and tactical details of how the war was fought. There were armies numbering millions on both sides, a fact that explains why the Japanese expansion in the Pacific theatre ran out\u00a0of steam in 1942. The Chinese war effort could not hope to match that of\u00a0the more developed states, but it dominated the administrative and economic spheres in China, while condemning tens of millions of Chinese to high levels of deprivation and hunger throughout the conflict. Mitter does not add to the debate about deaths, occasioned by the obvious absence of reliable statistics, but suggests the current estimates of between 15 and 20 million dead may not be wide of the mark; at the least, more than 90 million Chinese became refugees in their own country. Moreover, the war encouraged the\u00a0political fragmentation of Chinese territory as Japanese encroachments grew. In the north and east, the Japanese conquered large areas, where\u00a0they installed and collaborated with puppet regimes, including Puyi (the\u00a0last emperor) in Manchuria. Mongolia\u00a0was more or less under Soviet domination. In the south and east, rival warlords maintained an uneasy relationship with Chiang&apos;s nationalists. In Nanjing, Chiang&apos;s former colleague Wang Jingwei set\u00a0up\u00a0a\u00a0rival nationalist government under Japanese supervision in 1940. In the north-west, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai created a communist-dominated territory in Yan&apos;an. Making sense of the different polities is a challenge in its own right, but the many divisions also explain not only the difficulty Chiang had in ever establishing an integrated, sovereign Chinese state, but the problems faced by the Japanese as they\u00a0confronted the vast land area and\u00a0the mosaic of local rulers. Mitter explores this complex politics\u00a0with remarkable clarity and economy. At the heart of the story is Chiang Kai\u2011shek, the one leader the West or Stalin ever took seriously. The war he fought was long and bloody, starting in 1931 with the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, and escalating into full-scale conflict in July\u00a01937, when both sides on the pretext of an incident at an\u00a0ornate bridge at Lugouqiao (the so-called Marco Polo Bridge) near Beijing embarked on open war. The Japanese disregard for the Chinese as racial inferiors is well-known. Less familiar is\u00a0Chiang&apos;s dismissal of the Japanese as\u00a0&quot;dwarf bandits&quot; and his misplaced confidence that his large but ill\u2011equipped armies could match Japanese\u00a0military skills. Chiang never\u00a0seems seriously to have considered an armistice, but instead called for a &quot;war of resistance to the end&quot; (Kangzhan daodi), which condemned many Chinese to years of\u00a0harsh Japanese control, near famine conditions, and an\u00a0increasingly brutal and terroristic Kuomintang regime. The early years of war are in many ways the most arresting historically, partly because Chiang and Mao were largely on their own. Neither the Soviet Union nor the western powers wanted to be involved in war in China, and none of them was much interested in supplying money or goods. It is worth reflecting that for all\u00a0the contemporary and subsequent criticism levelled at Chiang&apos;s war effort, the Chinese did not collapse entirely, unlike the European forces in\u00a0Burma, Malaya and the East Indies, or\u00a0the Americans in the Philippines. Mitter describes horrors on both sides. The Japanese &quot;rape of Nanjing&quot; \u2013 the one event of the war that is familiar worldwide \u2013 did happen, and Mitter will have no truck with Japanese attempts to explain it away. But he also\u00a0explores the background that led\u00a0Chiang ruthlessly to order the destruction of the dykes on the Yellow River to stop the Japanese advance, which left more than half a million Chinese dead and 4.8 million as refugees. This story in itself says much about what was different in the Chinese war from war elsewhere. Reading Mitter, it\u00a0is clear that for western readers understanding how Chinese society coped with total war requires a profound adjustment. Chinese fought Chinese, as well as Japanese. While the\u00a0war with Japan was fought with terrible levels of atrocity, Chiang&apos;s security chief Dai Li (the &quot;Chinese Himmler&quot;, apparently) ran a terror organisation that killed and tortured thousands of Chinese suspected of treason or of being communist. Wang Jingwei also had his security thugs, including Li Shiqun, a Shanghai gangster, whose Gestapo-like headquarters at &quot;Number 76&quot; in Shanghai proved too much even for the Japanese supervisors. Li was invited to dine at a hotel with Japanese secret policemen and died a day later from poison in his fish course. Chiang&apos;s resistance to the Japanese during the Pacific war (1941-45) forced the west to\u00a0turn a blind eye to the campaign of\u00a0terror that went with it. One of the threads running through Mitter&apos;s account is Chiang&apos;s difficult relationship with the west, which treated him with a patronising disdain born of years of pseudo-imperialism. Mitter quotes a complaint from a British diplomat at Chiang&apos;s wartime capital at Chongqing about the &quot;pitch\u00a0of arrogance&quot; in Chinese attitudes following humiliating defeat for British Empire troops in 1942 \u2013 a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black. Chiang in the end had something to record. China did not surrender, nor\u00a0were Chinese forces completely defeated. In 1945, the allies hardly bothered to acknowledge what China had done, but for eight years Japan had been bogged down in Asia, unable to focus on the expensive war against the\u00a0west and exposed for all to see as an atrocious and self-interested imperial power. The fact of Chinese victory, Mitter argues, opened the way for the Chinese people to begin the search for a new identity that went beyond the fractured allegiances of the wartime experience. Mao defeated Chiang four years later and the long story of the rise of modern China could begin. No one could ask for a better guide than Mitter to how that story began in the cauldron of the Chinese war.", "tags": ["History", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-06T11:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/china-police-arrest-toy-bombs-gifts", "sentences": ["Chinese police have arrested the head of a creative design firm in Shanghai for posting toy explosives to his clients as Children&apos;s Day gifts that resulted in bomb-squad deployments and evacuations.", "The suspect, a 32-year-old man named Liu, bought 60 toy bombs on the internet and sent most of them on 2 June, posting 51 to Shanghai, one to Nanjing and seven to Beijing, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported on Thursday.", "He was arrested in Shanghai on Monday night and will be charged with spreading false and dangerous substances, an officer told the newspaper.", "&quot;We were trying to make contact with Shanghai and Beijing to inform the local police when Sanlian Life Weekly found the bomb,&quot; a Nanjing police officer told the Global Times, adding that the force was making every effort to trace the person who sold the devices."], "title": "Police in China arrest man for sending toy bombs as gifts", "article": "Chinese police have arrested the head of a creative design firm in Shanghai for posting toy explosives to his clients as Children&apos;s Day gifts that resulted in bomb-squad deployments and evacuations.

The practice makes it far less likely that China \u2013 the world&apos;s biggest emitter \u2013 will reach its climate goals, the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. &quot;Recent studies have shown that the high standard of living enjoyed by people in the richest countries often come at the expense of CO2 emissions produced with technologies of low-efficiency in less affluent, developing countries,&quot; the study said. &quot;Less apparent is that this relationship between developed and developing can exist within a single country&apos;s borders.&quot;     A graphic showing how coastal provinces of China are outsourcing their greenhouse gas emissions by importing goods from less developed provinces, 2013. Photograph: University of Maryland    China and America agreed on Saturday to work with other countries to reduce hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) . HFCs, which are used for air conditioning and refrigeration, are an extremely potent greenhouse gas on a 10 or 20-year timeframe, and contribute significantly to climate change. But the two biggest emitters have yet to show such leadership in cutting carbon dioxide. And as the study suggests, China&apos;s efforts to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions without damaging its rapid economic growth were being undermined by carbon outsourcing. The authorities set a number of target for carbon intensity \u2013 the emissions produced per unit of economic productivity \u2013 with less stringent targets for less developed regions. But it turns out those less developed regions, with far more carbon-intensive production units, were producing a large share of the goods for affluent areas of the country. The richer areas have tighter carbon intensity targets. The richest cities such as Beijing and Shanghai and provinces such as Guangdong were outsourcing more than 50% of the emissions related to the products they consumed, the researchers said. In some instances up to 80% of emissions related to goods consumed in the richer coastal provinces were imported from less developed provinces in central and western China, the study said. The result of the outsourcing was that China was losing out on a chance to achieve swift and relatively painless reductions in emissions by modernising those highly polluting coal-burning industrial units, said Steven Davis, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who led the study. &quot;The tragedy of this is that the easiest and cheapest cuts in emissions are in these provinces in the interior where the technologies are antiquated and with even slight improvements could be much, much cleaner,&quot; Davis said. The net effect of the outsourcing is to make it far less likely China would reach its climate targets. &quot;I think the carbon leakage problem is likely to make it more challenging for China to meet its climate goals,&quot; said Ailun Yang, a climate analyst for China, India and other emerging economies at the World Resources Institute. The Chinese authorities are already acutely conscious of the costs to public health and environment of relying on those old coal-burning plants. The annual report from China&apos;s Environment ministry, released last week, catalogued deteriorating air, land and water quality, describing the situation as &quot;grim&quot;. Davis said outsourcing would reinforce that situation: &quot;The result is it&apos;s going to cost them more and perpetuate inequality within that country. They are going to be paying more for every ton of CO2 reduced than they need to be.&quot; The study tracked the emissions produced in the manufacture of goods traded across 26 provinces and four cities. It said: &quot;Without policy attention to this sort of interprovincial carbon leakage, the less developed provinces will struggle to meet their emissions intensity targets, whereas the more developed provinces might achieve their own targets by further outsourcing.&quot;", "tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T19:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jun/11/gcse-pupils-compete-asia-gove", "sentences": ["&quot;In maths and science, questions and content will be more demanding, so that state school students can compete with their contemporaries in Singapore and Shanghai, acquiring the skills that the rich pay handsomely to pass on to their children and that are the guarantee of future opportunity,&quot; Gove wrote."], "title": "GCSEs will allow pupils to compete with contemporaries in Asia, says Gove", "article": "Michael Gove&apos;s shakeup of GCSEs will mix 19th-century traditionalism and a modern concern to match Britain&apos;s economic rivals, with an end to modular coursework, an emphasis on final exams and a new grading system. Details of the redesigned exam \u2013 tentatively to be called &quot;GCSE (England)&quot;, a sign of the England versus Wales and Northern Ireland education policy rift \u2013 will be unveiled by the Department for Education and exam regulator Ofqual, with the education secretary making a statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday. The content of the proposals has been published by the DfE in a series of subject consultation papers, with input from experts and a call for public response, while Ofqual is to publish a separate consultation paper outlining major changes to the structure of GCSEs, many of which have already been made public. The 600,000 pupils a year who take GCSEs in England will from 2015 face what the DfE describes as more challenging course content, with the first of the revised exams being sat in 2017. The department highlights changes to mathematics that will involve a greater amount of advanced algebra and statistics. The DfE&apos;s consultation paper on the content of GCSE history says a minimum 40% of content will be British history, and include at least one study &quot;from the medieval (500-1500), early modern (1450-1750) or modern (1700-present day) periods&quot;, and a minimum of 25% will be on world history. DfE officials likened the new examination structure to the O-level format, which was replaced by GCSEs in the late 1980s but a version of which is still used in Singapore, and which had a heavier emphasis on essay-based exam questions. The revised English literature GCSE will require study of at least one Shakespeare play, a selection of Romantic poetry, a 19th-century novel, a selection of poetry since 1850, and British fiction and drama written since the first world war. &quot;GCSEs will again be exams at the end of two years instead of being broken up into low-quality modules. Coursework, corrupted by cheating, will be limited,&quot; a Whitehall source said. &quot;Exams will test higher-level skills, such as more essay writing, problem solving and mathematical modelling, that universities and businesses desperately need.&quot; One climbdown by the DfE at the urging of Ofqual has been the retention of so-called tiered papers in maths and science, after earlier reports that they would be abolished in all subjects. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and College Leaders, said the changes were &quot;harking back to a bygone era&quot; of O-levels. &quot;Creating one untiered examination for all students, from those with learning difficulties to potential Oxbridge candidates, is an immense challenge with no guarantee of success,&quot; he said. &quot;Simply making exams harder does not guarantee higher standards nor mean that students will be prepared for a job.&quot; The reforms will first be applied to the eight core subjects of English language and literature, maths, combined science, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and history. Other subjects will be added in subsequent years. The biggest change is the end of modular course structures and an end to the use of classroom assessment in pupils&apos; final grades. Of the first batch of subjects only science will retain a coursework element, but it is possible that other subjects such as foreign languages will retain some assessed component. In an opinion piece published in the Times, Gove said that under the new regime pupils would have to study complete Shakespeare plays as well as &quot;display a command of proper spelling, punctuation and grammar&quot; to aid their future employers. &quot;In maths and science, questions and content will be more demanding, so that state school students can compete with their contemporaries in Singapore and Shanghai, acquiring the skills that the rich pay handsomely to pass on to their children and that are the guarantee of future opportunity,&quot; Gove wrote. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers union, said the proposals would do little for the 40% of young people who failed to achieve five A*-Cs under the current system. &quot;We have serious concerns that the new-style GCSE will not give all children the chance to demonstrate what they have learned and will particularly disadvantage children with difficult home lives. End-of-course exams on a single day test recall and memory rather than the range of skills that young people need in the 21st century,&quot; Bousted said. An early suggestion that the exams could be renamed I-levels has proved to be false, but the unorthodox new grading system, ranging from eight as the highest mark to one as the worst, is set to replace the more conventional A* to G marks currently in use.", "tags": ["GCSEs", "Exams", "Education", "Michael Gove", "Education policy", "Politics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-11T10:00:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jun/11/brazil-counting-cost-world-cup-olympics", "sentences": ["They create jobs, which our young people need, and reach all the working population.&quot; Liu Kang, of Shanghai Jiaotong University, said the Beijing Games was an important step in China&apos;s efforts to gain greater acceptance in the international community."], "title": "Will Brazil be left counting the cost of hosting the World Cup and Olympics?", "article": "The growing influence of the Brics nations in world affairs was symbolised by the staging of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the World Cup in South Africa 2010, and will be further underlined by Brazil&apos;s forthcoming hosting of both events. Leaving aside the public relations value of putting these host countries in the global spotlight, they have tried to use these mega-events to boost development by accelerating investments in infrastructure and lifting services, governance and local business to international standards. However, the cost to the public purse and the communities affected can be enormous, prompting criticism that the money would be better spent at grassroots level, on improving health and education, rather than on awarding prestige projects to construction companies. South Africa and Beijing have been left with expensive white elephants, because the huge stadiums they constructed are now rarely used. Many believe Brazil might suffer the same drain on resources. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) now includes legacy issues in its regulations for the assessment of hosting bids, but Fifa makes no such formal consideration in deciding which nations should stage the World Cup. N\u00e1dia Campe\u00e3o, the deputy mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, which will host several matches next year, said Fifa should do more to take the legacy issue into account. &quot;But even if it is not worried, the host city should be,&quot; she said. &quot;There has to be more assessment of their demands.

Rather than help poor communities, she said the Olympic development was focused on boosting real-estate prices in upmarket Barra, where the infrastructure improvements are largely focused. The city, said Os\u00f3rio, also suffered a wasteful drain on public funds in hosting the Pan American Games in 2007. Many of the facilities built for that event, at great cost, subsequently proved inadequate for the Olympics and had to be demolished or rebuilt. A key problem, according to Os\u00f3rio, was that the IOC, Fifa and the local organisers failed to consult adequately with local communities. &quot;They need to get civil society involved in discussions,&quot; she said. &quot;That&apos;s true for the government, but Fifa and the IOC also have to change the way they assess bids to include human rights and better values.&quot;", "tags": ["Global development", "Cities and development", "Brazil", "Americas", "World news", "Sport", "World Cup 2014"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-11T10:11:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/12/dodgers-diamonbacks-sydney-cricket-ground", "sentences": ["The 2012 NBA pre-season schedule included games in Istanbul, Berlin, Barcelona, Beijing, Shanghai and Mexico City."], "title": "Dodgers and Diamondbacks to play MLB games at Sydney Cricket Ground", "article": "The Sydney Cricket Ground is set to host the opening series of next year&apos;s Major League Baseball season, two matches between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Not Flash Gordon&apos;s arch-nemesis Ming the Merciless, but Ming the first baby panda to set foot on British soil. She might not have had the flamboyant collar, forked beard or exaggerated eyebrows of the evil emperor, but she still managed to cause a massive sensation. Ming&apos;s story begins in the wild, bamboo-clad mountains of China&apos;s central Sichuan Province, where she was born in 1937. Within a year, hunters had captured her and delivered her into the acquisitive hands of one Floyd Tangier-Smith (let&apos;s call him Tangier), a Japanese-born American who had given up banking for a life of adventure. Tangier&apos;s desire to export pandas from Chengdu would have been adventure enough in peacetime. With the second Sino-Japanese War in full, murderous swing, it is remarkable that he succeeded at all. Floating down the Yangtze to Shanghai was unthinkable, so Tangier arranged a gruelling road trip for the pandas: &quot;We had to put all our cages and equipment on lorries and do a journey of 35 days to Hong Kong on roads that were often nearly impassable through bandit-infested country,&quot; he wrote. En route, one of the trucks rolled down an embankment and a couple of the pandas escaped from their cages. &quot;Happily they were quite willing to be caught again, and the incident led to the loss of nothing more than a day.&quot; By the time Tangier had secured a passage from Hong Kong to London on board a cargo vessel, one of the six pandas was dead. Of those that remained there was a senior animal he nicknamed Grandma, three other adults he called Happy, Dopey and Grumpy in a nod to the 1937 blockbuster Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and the baby that would become known as Ming. The pandas spent the voyage to Britain chained to their open cages on deck, steaming into the London docks in a raging blizzard on Christmas Eve 1938. The stress of it all seems to have been too much for Grandma, who died of pneumonia a couple of weeks later. Tangier flogged another of the pandas to a German dealer, who took him on a whirlwind tour of the major zoos in Nazi Germany. Tragicomically, this was the animal known as Happy. And then there were three. Tangier sold Grumpy, Dopey and the cub to the Zoological Society of London, which plucked three of China&apos;s imperial dynasties out of the bag to rechristen them Tang, Sung and Ming. So popular was the baby panda that she found her image reproduced on posters on the London Underground, in cartoons, in a series of &quot;panda postcards&quot;, in the form of soft toys, less-than flattering hats, a travesty of a bathing suit and in dozens of television broadcasts. Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen, was among the thousands who turned out to see Ming. Also present was Chiang Yee, a Chinese poet, author, artist and emigree, who remarked on the extraordinary numbers of people drawn to his youthful and fluffy compatriot. &quot;There were always rows and rows of them, especially children, round her house, waiting to shake hands with her and to cuddle her,&quot; he wrote in The Story of Ming, a beautifully illustrated children&apos;s book that dramatised the panda&apos;s journey to London. &quot;She heard that the zoo was making a big sum of money out of her popularity.&quot; Plus \u00e7a change. At the outbreak of war in September 1939, Ming was evacuated from London to Whipsnade Zoo but returned repeatedly to the capital throughout hostilities, a much-welcomed boost to morale. Sung died in late 1939. Tang lasted until the spring of 1940. Ming lived on through most of the war, but as the bombs began to fall, so too did Ming&apos;s hair. This was particularly evident around her eyes, where the exposed skin had become dry and scaly. In 1943, she started walking backwards. Then, after months of slow decline, she had a sudden fit on Boxing Day 1944, banging herself against the walls and railings of her den and cutting the skin of her muzzle and face. Ming did not recover. The cause of death, according to a cursory postmortem, could not be determined. The Times ran an obituary: &quot;She could die happy in the knowledge that she gladdened the universal heart and, even in the stress of war, her death should not go unnoticed.&quot; It certainly didn&apos;t for London taxidermist Edward Gerrard, who got hold of her pelt, stuffed it and took it on a lucrative tour round the country. &quot;Ming, dead, is priceless,&quot; ran the caption to a photograph of her stuffed corpse that appeared in Illustrated magazine. The whereabouts of her skin remains a mystery, if indeed it survives at all. Her skull, however, passed into the collection of the Royal College of Surgeons. As of next month, Ming&apos;s skull will be on display in London at the Hunterian Museum in Lincoln&apos;s Inn Field.", "tags": ["Zoology", "Science", "Endangered species", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Environment", "China", "Museums"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-13T11:32:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/14/rupert-murdoch-summer-contest-football", "sentences": ["Rupert Murdoch&apos;s global broadcasting company is exploring an ambitious plan to create a summer football competition featuring Europe&apos;s top clubs, including English Premier League sides, with matches to be played in cities from Los Angeles to Shanghai."], "title": "Rupert Murdoch plans summer contest for football's top clubs", "article": "Rupert Murdoch&apos;s global broadcasting company is exploring an ambitious plan to create a summer football competition featuring Europe&apos;s top clubs, including English Premier League sides, with matches to be played in cities from Los Angeles to Shanghai. Leading clubs such as Manchester United and Chelsea would be invited to participate, should the tournament come to fruition, competing with the biggest clubs from Europe&apos;s other top leagues \u2013 the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The idea would see a 16-team competition run for 10 years with a potential start date of 2015 in the close season when clubs traditionally play exhibition matches. Matches would be aired on Sky and by Murdoch&apos;s other broadcasters worldwide. The mogul&apos;s 21st Century Fox company \u2013 being separated from publishing business News Corporation later this month \u2013 also owns broadcasters in Italy, Germany, Asia and the United States. One source described the plan as akin to the &quot;Formula One-isation of football&quot;, with cities from Europe, Asia and the Americas bidding to host tournament matches. The Guardian understands that approaches have been made to a number of cities by executives from Murdoch subsidiary Fox International to explore partnerships to host the exhibition-style tournament matches. But the proposal is at its early stages. &quot;One of the major issues is if it gets to the stage of trying to pull the empire together and paying what they think is a fair share,&quot; said a second source. With more than half of the clubs in the Premier League in the hands of overseas owners, and five of those now owned by Americans including Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, the desire to go global has increased. Manchester United, third behind Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid in terms of overall revenues, have shown the way in commercialising their overseas fanbase, vastly increasing their income by tapping into international sponsorship markets. As such, plans for overseas tours in the close season have also become increasingly ambitious. Chelsea, for example, headed to the US to play Manchester City as soon as their marathon season finished and will head to Thailand, Malaysia, India and back to America before the start of the 2013-14 season. Manchester United will go to Thailand, Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong. It is in that context that Fox International executives have drawn up their plan, but they will have to convince club owners it represents a better bet than forging their own path. The Guinness International Cup, featuring eight clubs including Milan, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Juventus and LA Galaxy would appear to be a dry run for the more ambitious scheme. Games will be played mostly in the US, with the finals in Miami in August. The thinking may also be influenced by the fact that Fox has lost the rights to live Premier League football in the US to NBC for the next three seasons. In what is expected to be a watershed moment for the appeal of football in the US, NBC will show every match live including 20 on its main network. Murdoch has made several attempts to shake up sports \u2013 in the 1990s News Corp set up its own rugby Super League in Australia, forcing the sport&apos;s national governing body to partner to create the National Rugby League competition. Earlier this year it emerged that BSkyB and News Corp were interested in creating a new world series of cycling \u2013 while in 2011 Murdoch&apos;s media group made an unsuccessful attempt to take control of Formula One. Plans for a European Super League have been proposed with various degrees of seriousness several times in the past decade. There was a detailed plan doing the rounds in 2009 and again in 2011, but the Uefa president, Michel Platini, has been alive to the threat and sealed a deal in 2012 with the European Clubs Association, representing 137 of the biggest clubs, that will hold until 2018 and should keep them within the Uefa fold. With the idea of playing regular season games abroad torpedoed in the short term by the negative reaction to the Premier League&apos;s unusually half-baked &quot;39th game&quot; plan in 2008, attention has turned to the close season. News Corp and BSkyB declined to comment. Drawing up ambitious plans for a close season tournament would allow the clubs involved to avoid clashing with their domestic leagues and the existing European club competitions, although Fifa and Uefa may have concerns over what is becoming an increasingly cluttered summer football calendar. The fixture list has become a battleground for the ongoing political battles between the clubs, leagues and governing bodies jostling for control of the calendar. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2013.

One such moment is at the luggage information desk at Dubai&apos;s colossal, soul-sucking airport where, after the third overnight flight, the inevitable has happened and our bags have finally gone astray. Atherton has just done a full cooking shift at 22 Ships, his inspired tapas bar in the heart of Hong Kong&apos;s old red light district, while simultaneously checking in with staff about the lunch service at his Michelin-starred London home, Pollen Street Social, and fielding emails about his new ventures in Sydney and Shanghai. He&apos;s due at a meeting with a developer working with the InterContinental hotel group in Dubai at 9am to sign off on a deal to open a new waterfront property worth several million dollars. He is in the jeans and T-shirt he has tried to sleep in on the plane, and unshowered. At 7am the glum manager of the luggage information desk, at which we are the sole customers, is showing little interest in our missing bags. After extensive walkie-talkie conversations and a languid, fruitless search for a pen with which to take our details, a long hour or so has passed before he relays the information that &quot;I think your bags are somewhere in the system&quot;. At which point you might imagine Gordon or Marco, testosterone pumping, jetlag jagging, would have taken some selfish relief in reducing the manager, his system and the entire luggage information operation at Dubai International to a lightly astringent jus. Atherton, who worked for Ramsay for 10 years, creating the highly successful Maze, and who has, as I have witnessed in various time zones, an obsessive interest in the efficiencies of service, remains courteous. &quot;I tell you what,&quot; he says, &quot;I wanted to have a look at the fish market this morning before the meeting, so we&apos;ll head out there, and perhaps if our bags turn up we can pay for them to be sent on to the hotel?&quot;     Jason Atherton at Deira Fish Market in Dubai. Photograph: Richard Saker    We head to the fish market, a dockside hangar in which an extraordinary variety of sea creatures have been dredged from the Gulf to be vigorously descaled, chopped and then examined by some of the desert city&apos;s army of chefs. Atherton is in his element, enthused by the idea that &quot;there are probably 30 species here I&apos;ve never cooked&quot; and therefore further excited by the prospect of his Dubai kitchen, which might be open by the autumn, if he makes his InterContinental meeting. We head to the hotel to find the bags have been delivered, testament to Atherton&apos;s patience and local knowledge (&quot;I worked here for Gordon for four years and I know if you start shouting the odds to locals you are screwed&quot;). The chef makes his meeting, signs his deal, does a walking tour of the first-floor shell of a skyscraper fronting the marina in which his restaurant will take shape, and is still smiling at lunchtime when he sits down at the waterside opposite the building site, and celebrates the contract with a carrot juice. &quot;The thing is,&quot; he says of our morning, &quot;if I start to get annoyed about a lost bag or whatever, I just make sure I immediately give myself a kick up the butt. You know, I&apos;ve had more difficult days than these\u2026&quot; Atherton&apos;s journey to this particular waterfront began at a seaside about as far from the glass-fronted fantasy of Dubai&apos;s marina as you can imagine. Born in Sheffield, he moved with his mother to Skegness after his parents separated when he was three. He lived with his mum and his sister in a caravan, &quot;quite cosy but frigging cold in the winter&quot;, and got his first taste of kitchens and hotels at a guesthouse, the Maryland, that his mother set up on Skegness&apos;s North Sea coast. &quot;Even in the holidays we always had to work,&quot; Atherton, now 41, recalls. &quot;I would get up early to help do the breakfasts, then go out and be a donkey boy, doing rides for kids on the beach all day, then come back, help with the evening meal. My stepdad Dave was a joiner. He would be out first thing on building sites, then come back and put a dickie bow and a white shirt on and work the bar until midnight. On a Friday, the treat for my sister and me was to watch the telly, plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car, with pop and crisps, for an hour before the battery ran down.&quot;     Jason Atherton's quote which is on the wall of his 22 Ships restaurant in Hong Kong. Photograph: Richard Saker    This work ethic has clearly never left Atherton. After &quot;24 years busting my nuts in other people&apos;s kitchens&quot;, he invested every last penny of his savings into Pollen Street Social in Mayfair only two years ago; with the help of partners he now has eight restaurants and counting across the world (two others opened earlier this year in London, Little Social, over the road from the original, and the Social Eating House, in Soho). All have quickly won praise and awards and, more to the point, customers. &quot;We have two kinds of restaurants, extremely successful ones and successful ones, but they all make money,&quot; he says and shows me the daily incoming texts of takings to prove it. Esquina, for example, has paid back its investment in just 10 months. Atherton, who is married to Ihra, a Filipina who worked with him in Dubai, and has two daughters, aged seven and two, is about to start filming a TV series for Sky, My Kitchen Rules, in which couples compete to create pop-up restaurants in their front rooms; he has three cookbooks in the works. It is, you might say, his moment; but having seen casualties of previous such moments up close, he is anxious, desperate, not to let it go to his head. One of the fascinations of Atherton&apos;s rise \u2013 White singled him out recently as one of only three or four &quot;proper&quot; British cooks \u2013 is that he is very much a second-generation figure; he has learned from the excesses of the celebrity fathers. He won&apos;t say a bad word about Ramsay but they don&apos;t see each other now \u2013 &quot;his choice not mine&quot;; the Scot was characteristically annoyed that his protege eventually left Maze, but still Atherton has learned, he says, from his old boss, &quot;both what to do and what not to do&quot;. Much of this is detail. In his autobiography, Ramsay reveals that when he started out he was in the habit of chucking any complaints from customers in the bin. The chef was always right. In the course of our travels, Atherton has any complaints made in any of his outposts immediately texted over to him. In Hong Kong he discovers that a lunch party in Singapore had to wait 20 minutes for dessert, while one of 100 diners in Soho at lunchtime thought his steak a little fatty. Atherton immediately responds with questions to sous chefs and maitre d&apos;s, and apologies to customers. He talks in passing, &quot;don&apos;t quote me&quot;, of memorably truculent guests over the years but prides himself on never losing his rag. &quot;I&apos;ve never chucked anyone out,&quot; he says, &quot;and I don&apos;t imagine I ever will. I have had people in Pollen Street say &apos;there is not a single thing on this menu I like&apos;. But I kill them with kindness. I go out and say, tell me what you want and I will happily cook it for you. I&apos;m not interested in &apos;chef knows best&apos; bullshit.&quot; When Atherton worked for Nico Ladenis in London in the early 90s they weren&apos;t allowed to put salt and pepper on the table. &quot;If people asked for pepper, Nico would likely ask them to leave. To me, if someone likes a lot of pepper, it&apos;s not a problem. He has paid for it, he can do what he likes.&quot; It&apos;s tempting to think that some of this spirit is a legacy from Skegness. He agrees that there was probably no tougher crowd to please. &quot;We had busloads every week from Doncaster, Barnsley, Rotherham, Nottingham,&quot; Atherton recalls. &quot;We would have Leicester week, in which the only question you ever heard was &apos;Ow much is it, duck?&apos; I&apos;d have to check with my mum but I think to start with it was about \u00a33.50 for the weekend, bed and board, so it wasn&apos;t bad value.&quot; Atherton brought a good deal of that can-do possibility down to London with him. At 16, he wrote to the top 20 chefs in the country, from Raymond Blanc down, and asked if they might find a space for him. He received a positive reply from one, Boyd Gilmour, who had left the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to set up Boyd&apos;s in Covent Garden. Atherton came down with his knives and his whites, said he could start tomorrow and that was that. He lived in the youth hostel in Earl&apos;s Court for two years with about a tenner a week to spend and &quot;loved every second of it&quot;. He didn&apos;t travel abroad until he was 22, working a season at the three-star Auberge de L&apos;Ill in Alsace. Five years after that he became the first non-Spanish speaker to work with Ferran Adri\u00e0 at El Bulli having turned up with a backpack and refused to leave until he got a trial in the world&apos;s best kitchen. In between times he cooked with White in his heyday at Harvey&apos;s and then at the Hyde Park hotel. His time in Spain perhaps gives most clues to the kind of cooking Ahterton aspires to now \u2013 smart, witty plates, with intense flavours, made with sharing in mind. &quot;You stepped into that kitchen and it was like you were in a different world,&quot; he says of El Bulli. From White, the original el bully, he learned something about man management. &quot;You&apos;d try not to catch Marco&apos;s eye at midnight when he was off hunting with his mates, otherwise you would be up making bacon sandwiches for them when they got back at five in the morning and then straight on to prepping,&quot; he says. He put up with that, and even, he hesitates to suggest, the occasional physical confrontation, because &quot;Marco was the best chef working in Britain. He was so fast and so perfect, all out of this complete chaos.&quot;     Jason Atherton and staff outside his Pollen restaurant at Gardens by the Bay in downtown Singapore. Photograph: Richard Saker    As I witness a few times, watching him at work, at the futuristic Pollen in Singapore, which is housed in a glass-domed botanical gardens on the bay, or at Esquina, his tapas bar in that heart of that city, Atherton is hardly reticent when imposing his standards on his chefs. He is only here for a day or two, so each observation has to count. &quot;When I do give someone a hard time it&apos;s usually if they disrespect ingredients, or if the veg is not packed away properly in the morning. I know it sounds OCD but my organic carrots, I don&apos;t want them tossed in a scruffy container: they are laid down nicely all facing the right way and treated with respect. I get angry if stuff like that is not done, but not madman angry.&quot; A running theme of our travels is the fact that Atherton only ever gets asked two questions by journalists: &quot;How did you survive working with Gordon?&quot; and &quot;Aren&apos;t you in danger of spreading yourself too thin?&quot; In a sense one of the questions answers the other. Atherton eventually left Maze not because of Ramsay, &quot;but because I couldn&apos;t work with his father-in-law [Chris Hutcheson, Ramsay&apos;s then business partner]. I tried for years. But it was time to move on.&quot; Atherton has so far been luckier with his own business partners. His principal backer is Mrs Mavis Oei, owner of the Goodwood Park group of hotels and daughter of the late Khoo Teck Puat, once Singapore&apos;s richest man. Oei was seduced by Atherton&apos;s food \u2013 he cooked for her first at Maze and then at her homes in Bray and in the Far East. Having invited him over to discuss a business proposition in 2011, she refused to let him return to the UK until he had signed a deal by which she offered an initial \u00a33m as finance for a 25% stake in what became Pollen Street Social. The rest of the opportunities have flowed from there.     In a meeting with business partner Peng Loh.

Their plans for the former Foster&apos;s brewery building in Sydney are laid out on the table. &quot;What do the Australians eat for breakfast?&quot; Peng wonders. &quot;Well, I do this great kind of mini-English breakfast on a proper pizza,&quot; Atherton suggests, which sounds about right. In Hong Kong he meets Yenn Wong, perhaps the most immaculately groomed woman I have ever encountered, with whom he is renovating PMQ, the former colonial police barracks in the middle of town, with a casual &quot;bread oven-type place&quot; downstairs and a &quot;farm-to-table eating&quot; restaurant upstairs. There is talk of tracking down &quot;the only properly organic farmer in China&quot; for the veg. Yenn takes a precise note. She helped to design 22 Ships and they have plans for a speakeasy across the street. All of which begs an answer to the second of the two questions Atherton is perennially asked: is he in danger of spreading himself too thin? Inevitably, I guess, but the trick is to find chefs who instinctively know what he wants, for each of his satellites, and to keep them happy. He has a scheme for Andy Walsh, a young Irish chef doing precise wonders at Esquina, which gives him a 10% profit share. His chefs in Hong Kong and London are on the same incentive once the restaurants have earned back their investment. &quot;I feel like the bloke who did Dolly the Sheep,&quot; he says at one point. &quot;We clone them and we put them in a box and we ship them out. It&apos;s like Madagascar 3, crates of chefs marked fragile.&quot;            Atherton will have to find a few more crates yet. Three other London properties are planned for this year or next. A collaboration with the ultimate concept man Ian Schrager in the now defunct Berners Hotel; a City Social satellite of his deconstructed Pollen Street concept in Tower 42; and perhaps something in the old Bow Street Magistrates building in Covent Garden. Only a few places are beyond the pale. He was recently approached to do something in Moscow. (&quot;I have no desire even to visit.&quot;) Likewise Tokyo: too many great restaurants already. Otherwise, the world still seems a newly shucked oyster. Looking at that world through the eyes of a chef like Atherton is a curious thing. Cities become not so much multi-faceted metropolises as the home to places you can buy food. &quot;When we are not working in restaurants we are eating in restaurants,&quot; Atherton says, and in my time with him this seems literally true. In Singapore he takes his chefs for spicy crab at the beach on their Sunday lunch off; in Hong Kong we visit the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant in the world, the dim sum canteen Tim Ho Wan. In Dubai he checks out, and loves, La Petite Maison, and puts his head round the door of the outpost of Wheelers, to which Marco Pierre White has given his name, which is all but empty. And all the time he seems to be thinking, sniffing, tasting opportunities. In his efforts to coolly colonise the world, one site-sensitive neighbourhood tapas bar at a time \u2013 &quot;we are not into concepts, we are not fucking TGI Friday&apos;s&quot; \u2013 it seems he is not alone. One night, on our way between Esquina in Singapore and his bar over the road (which requires a password to enter, and in which a Buddhist cocktail impresario serves drinks in miniature wooden dhows), Atherton meets Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, another graduate of El Bulli. Andr\u00e9s is puffing on a big cigar, and also covertly looking for new opportunities. Outside 22 Ships in Hong Kong, Atherton runs into Alvin Leung, the so-called Demon Chef, who has just exported his &quot;extreme fusion&quot; cooking to London. They talk of cities not yet on the international restaurant radar, Rangoon, Bangkok, Manila. There is, Atherton suggests later as we wait for a plane, hardly a departure lounge in which he does not meet one Michelin star or another, all scenting possibilities in the global foodie air. A few days after we return, I look in on Atherton in Pollen Street Social. After the spin of the previous week he seems relieved to be grounded. Before an impeccable lunch he shows me around with pride and joy. The kitchen in which all the carrots, and everything else, are facing the right way, the dessert bar, and the Buccleuch beef ageing behind glass. Downstairs is his office, in a corner of the prepping kitchen, no bigger than a Skegness caravan bedroom. He doesn&apos;t have a PA, so he runs his mini-empire from here by email. What you&apos;ve got to remember, he says, not for the first time, is that, &quot;we are just a bunch of guys cooking food and having fun&quot;; and the thing is, he still just about believes it.

The university, which has hosted the blind, self-taught lawyer on a fellowship since May last year, has denied the allegations, saying his tenure was intended to last only a year. The New York Post, which reported the allegations on Thursday, linked Chen&apos;s impending departure to NYU&apos;s efforts to open a campus in Shanghai. Chen, 41, spent 18 months confined to his home in rural Shandong province by local authorities for his advocacy work against forced sterilisations and abortions. He escaped last spring and sought refuge in the US embassy in Beijing, triggering a high-profile diplomatic incident. Chen has been told he has until the end of June to vacate the Greenwich Village apartment where he has been living with his family since he arrived in the US. The terms of his departure are still unclear. On Sunday, Chen said in a statement that he was &quot;grateful to NYU&quot; for its help in transitioning to the US. But he also implied that the university terminated his fellowship under pressure from Chinese authorities, who &quot;want to make me so busy trying to earn a living that I don&apos;t have time for human rights advocacy&quot;. &quot;As early as last August and September, the Chinese communists had already begun to apply great, unrelenting pressure on New York University, so much so that after we had been in the United States just three to four months, NYU was already starting to discuss our departure with us,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The work of the Chinese communists within academic circles in the United States is far greater than what people imagine, and some scholars have no option but to hold themselves back. Academic independence and academic freedom in the United States are being greatly threatened by a totalitarian regime.&quot; A university spokesman, John Beckman, denied the allegations in a statement on Sunday, emphasising that Chen&apos;s fellowship was intended to last only a year. He said the university never would have sheltered Chen if it was susceptible to Chinese government pressure. Chinese authorities had approved the Shanghai campus after the blind lawyer&apos;s arrival, he said. &quot;We are very discouraged to learn of Mr Chen&apos;s statement, which contains a number of speculations about the role of the Chinese government in NYU&apos;s decision-making that are both false and contradicted by the well-established facts,&quot; Reuters reported his statement as saying. &quot;Mr Chen&apos;s fellowship at NYU and its conclusion have had nothing to do with the Chinese government. All fellowships come to an end,&quot; he said. Chen is said to be in discussions with two other institutions to continue his advocacy and research. One is Fordham Law School, the other has not yet been disclosed. Jerome Cohen, a leading expert on Chinese law at NYU who helped Chen negotiate the terms of his fellowship, said in an email last week he had never heard from anyone, &quot;including Chinese diplomats&quot;, that NYU was under Chinese government pressure to terminate Chen&apos;s fellowship. &quot;No political refugee, even Albert Einstein, has received better treatment by an American academic institution than that received by Chen from NYU,&quot; he said, according to the Washington Post.", "tags": ["China", "Chen Guangcheng", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-17T08:03:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/17/borisstan-independent-state-formerly-london", "sentences": ["Boris himself had long left the political stage, contenting himself as a non-exec for the world&apos;s biggest, Shanghai-based, bank."], "title": "Borisstan: the independent city state and docking station for global wealth formerly known as London | Aditya Chakrabortty", "article": "&quot;For too long London has been an economic giant, a political giant but a fiscal infant \u2026 It&apos;s high time London was treated in a more grownup, a more mature way, as a great city in the way other great cities are&quot; \u2013 Boris Johnson, May 2013 By the summer of 2030, David Cameron wasn&apos;t a name that meant much to most Britons. Ed Miliband? He barely rated a mention from the Will Straws and Euan Blairs now running the Labour dynasty. Yet there was one early-21st-century politician who could claim a permanent legacy. Little urchins would break off from intense communion with their iJobs\u2122 to pull off a passable impersonation. &quot;Cripes!&quot; They&apos;d say, while ruffling their hair. &quot;Crikey!&quot; Boris Johnson, who else? He was the godfather and loudhailer of the campaign to make London independent from the rest of Britain. The fight had taken decades, but at last it had triumphed: even while Scotland remained part of the UK, the erstwhile capital had broken away and was now its own city-state. This latest signatory to the UN charter was officially dubbed Great London, but most people used an informal name that honoured its inspiration. They called it Borisstan. It all began as mere mayoral whimsy. There had long been gripes that London was &quot;a first-class city attached to a second-class country&quot;. Then there was the famous suggestion in the Telegraph\u00a0at the end of 2012 that &quot;the overtaxed south needs its own party&quot;. All right, so that was Kelvin MacKenzie, the outrider&apos;s outrider. And it was only the Telegraph, now just a series of hyper-local\u00a0websites for Sue Ryder shops in each of the Home Counties. But what the former Sun man&apos;s famous editorial antennae had picked up on was a prejudice that Londoners and their neighbours across the south-east were simply subsidising the rest of the country. They&apos;d done it during the boom, when the City apparently chipped in so much to the Treasury coffers. And they did it again during the lesser depression of 2008-2020 as the capital motored ahead, even while the rest of Britain spun its wheels in perma-austerity. Couple that popular reading of the economic dynamics with the changing social relations between London and the rest of the country. Where previous regional success, such as that of the Midlands in the 1930s, had drawn in and employed people from elsewhere in Britain, this wasn&apos;t the case during the capital&apos;s great boom. As the LSE&apos;s Ian Gordon and others had shown, fewer Britons settled in London between 1997 and 2006 than left it. No, the big influx into the capital was from those born outside the UK, whether they came to work in its private-equity shops or its coffee bars. One of the ways London grew to be a world city during the bubble was by sweating migrant labour, sometimes for a lot of money, but usually for a pittance. Put that explosion in diversity next to the capital&apos;s economic and social liberalism, and you had a city that was very different from the rest of the country. And as Borisstan&apos;s historians would always remind readers: don&apos;t forget the footling details. The way that the capital established its own web domain in 2013: .london. The setting up of a new thinktank devoted to research on the capital. The lobbying done by bankers to preserve their freedom from regulations and extra tax and, well, any bothersome social obligations. And the reports commissioned by Mayor Johnson on how London should claw back more of the taxes it paid to the national government. Thus what began as a call for Holyrood-style devolution got louder and more ambitious, until in 2029 Londoners found themselves voting in a referendum on whether to go independent. Boris himself had long left the political stage, contenting himself as a non-exec for the world&apos;s biggest, Shanghai-based, bank. But from the bikes, to the buses to the museums; Londoners knew they were Boris&apos;s people. There were anxieties of course. What currency would the new city-state have? Borisstan would eventually enter a currency union with the Chinese renminbi. Where would the energy supplies come from? How would Londoners get rid of their landfill? As soon became apparent: &quot;London&quot; had always meant two different things. There was the small central area, where new properties were sold off-plan to foreign tycoons and where Londoners were nothing more than glorified butlers to the global plutocracy. This was the city as a docking station for international capital. Then there was the London that had once been a hive of light industry but was now nothing more than retail parks and old council housing. Out here in 2013, the gross value added (a kind of local GDP) was just \u00a313,000 a head; while in inner London it was \u00a360,000 per person. Outer Londoners (&quot;aborigines&quot;, as they were called in some of the plush hotels) simply got bussed in and out of the high-security centre for work. Guardianistas down the ages from JA Hobson to Will Hutton had warned of this split between the capital and the country. Who would pay for Borisstan&apos;s equivalent of Crossrail now? Londoners had pulled in greater public spending, and claimed more infrastructure cash than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland together. Who would foot the bill for the next banking crisis? But these were all questions for the future. Right now, quite far down the Thames estuary, work was beginning on a small airport.

In the next 20 years, the country will add 350 million residents to its cities and 200 Chinese cities will be home to more than 1 million people (the US currently counts nine). This massive urbanisation presents both sustainability risks and opportunities, in particular in the areas of urban planning, mobility and energy efficiency. Against this background, Yixing, a city of 1.25 million in the centre of the dynamic Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou delta area, engaged with leading global companies to identify solutions that will help it meet its vision to become China&apos;s &quot;scientific and sustainable development demonstration city.&quot; For more than 7,000 years, Yixing has been renowned as the capital of Chinese pottery. Between April 2012 and February 2013, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development&apos;s (WBCSD) Urban Infrastructure Initiative (UII) brought together the Yixing municipal government, a multi-disciplinary team from the private sector and the China Business Council for Sustainable Development to identify solutions in three areas: urban planning; transport and mobility; and energy efficiency. The result is A solutions landscape for Yixing, a report released in June with recommendations ranging from short-term immediate actions to longer term investments that can be adapted to a variety of urban contexts. Time is of essence The new Chinese central government has made the environment a core element of its agenda, as exemplified by the Low carbon China campaign launched this month. It is thus particularly timely for Yixing to pursue its low-carbon development and urban sustainability journey. In microcosm, Yixing&apos;s challenge represents China&apos;s overall sustainable development challenge. It is also the same one faced by increasingly urbanised societies worldwide. However, the city is already considered a sustainability leader and has been recognised by the country&apos;s Ministry of Science and Technology as the national sustainable development pilot district. &quot;Yixing is the first city in China to work with the WBCSD&apos;s UII project. Truly innovative city planning should involve business from the beginning. This collaboration provides a blueprint on ways to harness the full capability of business to deliver sustainable solutions earlier in the life cycle of urban planning,&quot; says Peter Bakker, president at WBCSD Three key areas for action The WBCSD report identifies two issues for immediate action on sustainable urban planning. First, the city should favour a rational land use and appropriate urban structure. Using a scientific approach to optimise land use, based on preserving and protecting ecosystems, could help to prevent urban sprawl and reduce the city&apos;s ecological footprint. Second, Yixing should valorise its ecological and cultural assets through compact urban design and green infrastructure for all new development zones \u2013 favouring non-motorised mobility and public transport, and establishing a continuous band of protected green space, parks and gardens, wetlands and waterways. In addition, the report recommends supplementing Yixing&apos;s inner-city &quot;slow transport&quot; (e.g. walking and cycling) master plan with additional options, including combining slow transport and public transport services, orienting urban structure toward public transport, and maximising the use of the existing infrastructure and facilities. Citizen engagement plan needed To a large extent, the success of Yixing in realising its vision depends on its ability to engage people to actively participate. This requires a consistent effort to inform the public about actions and results, expand the dialogue, include more actors, and monitor progress over time. At the same time, the city should engage in continuous learning from experience and in sharing lessons learned. A key recommendation is thus to test the master plan and its implementation at critical intervals. This could be done in the form of workshops or seminars where local, national and international experts assess progress and make further recommendations. Yixing is one of ten cities \u2013 but the only one in China \u2013 to engage with the UII to advance its sustainability agenda.

Dalian Wanda Group, which is controlled by Wang Jianlin, is adding to a diverse list of Chinese interests in Britain that includes Heathrow airport, MG Cars, Thames Water and Weetabix. The corporation confirmed on Wednesday that it would acquire a 92% stake in Dorset-based Sunseeker for \u00a3320m and had finalised a \u00a3720m deal to build a five-star hotel in Wandsworth, billed as the &quot;first Chinese luxury hotel overseas&quot;. The announcements underscore the growing international ambitions of Chinese companies, coming a month after the meat producer Shuanghui International launched a $4.7bn (\u00a33bn) bid to purchase the US-based Smithfield, the world&apos;s largest pork business. Last year, Wanda also acquired the US cinema chain AMC for $2.6bn. The emphasis on luxury in the latest announcements also underlines the role of high-end consumption in the world&apos;s second largest economy, with the country&apos;s burgeoning middle class playing a vital role in boosting sales of upmarket British brands such as Jaguar Land Rover and Burberry. The Beijing press conference for the Sunseeker announcement did not stint on showmanship. The event was interspersed with musical interludes featuring lasers, smoke machines and sequin-clad dancers on a set resembling a yacht. It included speeches by Wang, the managing director of Sunseeker, Stewart McIntyre, and - in a nod to the importance of China to the UK economy - the British ambassador to China, Sebastian Wood. Wang, a property tycoon, lauded the UK investment plan as a major step in Wanda&apos;s international expansion. Asked why Wanda would purchase a yacht company, he said his conglomerate planned to build marinas in three north-eastern Chinese cities, and that each would require the purchase of at least 10 yachts. &quot;We figured it&apos;s more worthwhile to buy a yacht company rather than buy 30 yachts,&quot; he said. &quot;Private yachts are a booming market in China.&quot; Wang docks his own $33m Sunseeker in Shanghai and claims that he is the first Chinese citizen to own a private jet. A native of the south-western province Sichuan, he spent his early years in the military combatting hunger during Mao&apos;s Cultural Revolution. &quot;In the early days we really had to scramble to eat,&quot; he told the Financial Times in a rare interview last year. &quot;The hardship then was unimaginable.&quot; Sunseeker, which has been operating since the 1970s and whose yachts regularly appear in James Bond films, will maintain its UK production base. The company employs 2,000 people and generates revenues of around \u00a3300m a year. &quot;Under no circumstances will we compromise the Sunseeker brand,&quot; McIntyre told reporters, adding that the company exported its products to 67 countries. &quot;We&apos;re proud to fly the flag that we&apos;re made in Britain.&quot; He said the company was drawn towards &quot;inherent opportunities in China and the Asian market&quot;, adding that the Wanda group had similar attributes to Sunseeker. &quot;It has a strong commitment to entrepreneurship,&quot; he said. Wanda&apos;s luxury hotel will be built in London&apos;s Nine Elms regeneration site, which will also be home to a new US embassy, shops, offices and flats. A video played at the press conference advertised the 160-room hotel&apos;s art deco style and rooftop swimming pool. Wood said he hoped the hotel would &quot;bring a touch of Chinese style to the centre of London&quot;. &quot;We already have 500 companies that come from mainland China now operating in the UK,&quot; he said. &quot;Wanda is not the only group who benefits from the most open market in the world, but with their investment scale and future plans, Wanda Group is absolutely standing at the top.&quot; Chinse tourists spent $102bn on foreign travel last year, a 40% rise on 2011, and London receives around 180,000 a year. Boris Johnson called the Wanda development a &quot;cracking deal&quot;. Wang said his company planned to build similar hotel developments in eight or 10 cities around the world over the next decade. &quot;Why do I say 10 years? We don&apos;t want to do this in one night,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve opened 16 hotels in China in one year. Internationally, it&apos;s different.&quot; International ambitions \u2022 SAIC Motor Corp, China&apos;s biggest car maker, bought MG Cars in 2007. Other major European car brands under Chinese ownership include Saab and Volvo. China is now the world&apos;s largest car market ahead of the US, and domestic manufacturers have been keen to acquire production expertise. \u2022 China Investment Corporation, the country&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, bought a stake in the UK&apos;s largest water utility in 2012. George Osborne described it as a vote of confidence in Britain. Thames Water&apos;s tax arrangements came under attack this month when it was revealed it paid no corporation tax on profits of \u00a3550m. \u2022 State-owned Bright Foods bought a majority stake in Weetabix for \u00a3720m in May last year, after failing in a \u00a31.2bn bid for United Biscuits, the maker of Jaffa Cakes and Twiglets. Bright Foods has been tipped to make further acquisitions of western food brands. \u2022 China Investment Corporation added Heathrow to its list of assets last year when it bought a 10% stake in the UK&apos;s largest airport.

At one point, rice pudding was believed to lead to &quot;venerie&quot; \u2013 sex\u00a0\u2013 and blindness. But when British traders and soldiers ventured east, they found an eye-opening cuisine based on plentiful rice. Savoury rice dishes have been on menus ever since the first &quot;pillaw&quot; recipes came from India in the 18th century. But most of us know little more than long grain, short grain and something for risotto. Surrey-based Shahid Mehdi recently co-founded a company that aims to widen British rice horizons. A visit to Pakistan reminded him that long-grain basmati rice (as used in any curry house) was still being farmed, winnowed and dried by hand \u2013 and it was far better than what he got in England. The Real Basmati Rice Company (therealbasmatirice.com \u2013 please note, not therealbasmatiriceco.com) now sells a tonne of &quot;single-estate&quot; Punjabi rice a month through specialist shops and online. I&apos;ve been buying it since my first taste. It&apos;s a revelation; pleasingly grainy, with complex flavours and no stickiness. A\u00a0world away from Uncle Ben&apos;s \u2013 and less than half the price of the &quot;vintage&quot; Basmati that Britain&apos;s most popular brand Tilda recently launched. &quot;With a packet of mass-produced basmati you don&apos;t get anything like the earthiness you should,&quot; says Mehdi. &quot;Machine harvesting and machine drying have removed it. And in cooking \u2013 where&apos;s the aroma? The problem is that the big companies blend cheap and good rice then sell it quickly. Rice is like wine: it improves with age and reacts to the atmosphere.&quot; This imported single-estate rice, in contrast, is dried in the sun on the family farms (named on the packet) where it grew, irrigated by meltwater from the Himalayas. &quot;It then ages another year or more in jute sacks.&quot; I learned there was more to rice than arborio and long-grain in south-east Asia, where it is a staple of life. Many cultures in the region use &quot;gin khao&quot; (eat rice) as the verb to eat \u2013 and in poorer countries such as Cambodia 70% of calories come from the grain. Rice in south-east Asia comes in many forms: fresh and fragrant, or sticky and congealed like dough for a sort of sandwich, red and fruity and turned into flour for sweets. More than one Thai friend confessed that, when travelling abroad, they had to take rice \u2013 they couldn&apos;t stand the &quot;bad&quot; rice others ate. But in China, where rice cultivation began and half the world&apos;s crop is eaten, there is now little variety and that is causing health problems, according to the chef and author Fuchsia Dunlop. &quot;At some of the bourgeois Shanghai restaurants that make a point of serving what they call &apos;green&apos;, or organic, food, you can eat brown [unpolished, whole rice]&quot;. But it&apos;s very rare.&quot; Most Chinese eat their native short grained rice, milled and polished to a white gloss, even though it loses all its fibre and some of its nutrients. Better-off Chinese prize the Thai Jasmine variety of aromatic rice \u2013 and that&apos;s what Dunlop buys in the UK, from a Chinese supermarket. In Asia the key thing I learned about cooking rice was not to boil and drain it. Steam to retain taste and nutrients, by carefully adding just enough water. Electric rice steamers are ubiquitous now in Asian kitchens, after being invented by the Japanese Imperial Army. Just about fool-proof, they make a great fluffy clump-free rice from most of the short-grain aromatic varieties like Thai jasmine. Expanding your rice repertoire is easy. Chinese and Thai supermarkets sell the Asian varieties, delis and health food shops often stock a wide variety. My local in Edinburgh has about 20 different rices ranging from Italian brown and Pakistani basmati sold from the sack at \u00a31.70 a kilo to a wild rice from the US that costs an amazing \u00a323 for the kilo. Brown rice Any rice can be sold as &quot;brown&quot;, unmilled with the bran coating still on. It&apos;s a health food favourite because more nutrients and all the fibre are retained, and it has a pleasant nutty taste. It takes much longer to cook, and mixes well with white (if you get your times right: start the brown cooking first). Try brown basmati or brown Thai jasmine. Keep in the fridge, because it stales quicker than polished rice. Sticky rice Buy &quot;glutinous rice&quot;, or khao niaow, from a Thai or Chinese supermarket. Despite the name, it has no gluten \u2013 the stickiness comes from a type of enzyme in the starch. It&apos;s simple to cook - soak for 2-4 hours then steam in a covered basket or sieve for 20 minutes. Child-pleasing and chewy, it doesn&apos;t taste of much, but goes well with a nice, wet stir-fry or a spiced Thai meat salad. It&apos;s commonly sweetened and eaten with mango and ice cream and other sweet things. New risotto rices Vialone nano is for a robust dish, it absorbs more liquid than starchy classic arborio, which can become sticky or puddingy. Carnaroli is thin and long. &quot;Use it in more simple and elegant risottos, such as saffron and seafood,&quot; says chef Giorgio Locatelli. If you&apos;re put off by the long labour of stirring a risotto, try doing it with a pressure cooker, which takes a third of the time and none of the elbow-ache. Aromatic rice This is a specific type of rice that has, as the name suggests, more smell. It\u00a0includes Thai jasmine, basmati \u2013 which means &quot;fragrant&quot; in Urdu \u2013 and the US variety Della. I like the organic Black Venus rice from the Piedmont (sold by Biona and other brands). It&apos;s a glorious plum-purple when served, nutty and tasty.

Credit default swaps (CDS) on five-year bonds rose by 33 basis points to 133bps, according to financial data firm Markit, as Chinese officials signalled a determination to rein in risky lending practices. The People&apos;s Bank of China increased the pressure on lenders this week by removing Rmb2bn (\u00a3211m) from the market amid mounting concerns over the sustainability of a credit boom driven by the Chinese shadow banking system. The announcement had an immediate impact: short-term interest rates spiked and the sale of 10-year government bonds hit its lowest level since last year. Interbank borrowing costs hit their highest level in six years, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong and the Shanghai SE Composite Index both dropped by nearly 3%. Markit&apos;s director of credit research, Gavan Nolan, said the CDS widening was a &quot;huge move&quot;. He said: &quot;Only at the peak of the financial crisis have we seen moves of this size.&quot; The CDS jump means that the cost of insuring against a default on $10m of Chinese sovereign debt has climbed overnight from $100,000 to $133,000. The news came amid further bleak economic indicators for the world&apos;s second largest economy. The country&apos;s manufacturing activity hit a nine-month low in June, down from 49.2 to 48.3, according to HSBC&apos;s flash purchasing managers&apos; index, with a reading below 50 indicating contraction. Last year, China&apos;s economy slowed to its lowest rate in 13 years, mainly due to a drop in demand for exports from the US and Europe. Analysts say that China may narrowly miss its projected GDP growth target of 7.5% this year, as the country continues its transition from an export-led economy to one based on consumption. &quot;Nobody is entirely clear why the People&apos;s Bank of China is not coming in with liquidity,&quot; said Fraser Howie, the Singapore-based managing director of CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. &quot;I see that it&apos;s a warning to the banks and the financial sector as a whole that they&apos;re trying to clamp down on misuse of capital.&quot; On Wednesday, China&apos;s central government urged banks to contain financial risks and do more to support economic reforms.

Add to that the wonderful countryside, sailing \u2013 enviable.&quot; This\u00a0was a\u00a0response to the offer by Einstein&apos;s friend, the inventor and businessman Hermann Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe, of work\u00a0and a home in Kiel, away from pressures that plagued him in Berlin after the first world war. The joy of the Collected Papers, which has now reached the 13th volume and the year 1922, is that it reveals these lesser known facets of this extraordinary man, allowing us to go beyond the famous mask. &quot;Mild, intoxicating air. Steel-colored sea. Italian suggestion of solid ground diffusely cloudy. Japanese woman crawling about with children. They look rosy and bedazzled, almost as if (schematic) stylised. Black-eyed, black-haired, large-headed, pattering.&quot; This is from the lengthy travel diary of 1922/3, and presents an unfamiliar figure, to say the least: an Einstein who sounds more like a painter taking notes for a composition. As Kevin Jackson has pointed out in\u00a0Constellation of Genius, 1922 was Modernism Year One; both The Waste Land and Ulysses were published that year. Scientific and artistic modernism were more or less contemporaneous, although on the Jackson principle, Modernist Science Year One would have to be 1905, Einstein&apos;s annus mirabilis when, in the space of three and a half months, he wrote three epochal papers, one of which won him the Nobel prize, one confirmed beyond all doubt the existence and size of atoms, and the other introduced the mind, space and time-bending concept of special relativity. The label Modernism Year One sits uneasily on Germany in 1922, where the reaction against all things modern, Jewish and left-wing was beginning to\u00a0congeal into the horror that would emerge as Nazism. Einstein, the man who, just as much as Picasso or Stravinsky, ushered in modernism, knew this only too well. The German republic, formed after Germany&apos;s defeat and the Kaiser&apos;s abdication in 1918, faced enormous economic and political problems, as the war&apos;s victors sought unfeasibly large reparations. Hitler had already been installed as leader of the Nazi party in Munich in the summer of 1921. On 24 June 1922, in a portent of what was to come, the foreign minister Walter Rathenau was assassinated by\u00a0right-wing extremists. Rathenau was Jewish and had just signed the Rapallo\u00a0treaty with communist Russia. Einstein was friendly with Rathenau and was deeply affected by the killing. As a lifelong pacifist and self-proclaimed &quot;international person&quot;, he had been horrified at the extreme nationalistic mania engendered by the war even among scientific colleagues. In October 1914, 93 leading German intellectuals, including some of Einstein&apos;s closest colleagues such as\u00a0Max Planck, signed a declaration, &quot;Call\u00a0to the Civilised World&quot;, popularly known as the &quot;Manifesto of the 93&quot;, which denied all allegations of German atrocities in the invasion of Belgium in\u00a01914. Einstein was involved in a counter manifesto, approaching various Prussian Academy luminaries for support, and was completely unsuccessful, lamenting: &quot;Only men of\u00a0extraordinary independence of character seem able to resist the pressure of prevailing opinion. There does not seem one single man of that calibre in the Academy.&quot; After the experimental vindication of Relativity in 1919, science itself had become a battleground, with some German physicists, led by Philipp Lenard, rejecting Relativity in favour of &quot;sound German spirit&quot;. In 1921 Lenard had written a book, Ether and Unether, expressing these views, and Hitler had written an article stating: &quot;Science, once our greatest pride, is\u00a0today being taught by Hebrews, for\u00a0whom \u2026 science is only a means towards a deliberate, systematic poisoning of our nation&apos;s soul.&quot; Lenard was to become Hitler&apos;s &quot;Chief of Aryan\u00a0Science&quot;. For a supposed ivory-tower scientist, Einstein had an impressive record of social and political engagement. Later, in 1933, soon after arriving in America as an exile from Nazism, he instigated the foundation of the International Rescue Committee, still flourishing and soon to be headed by David Miliband. He also worked hard to help establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In\u00a01921 he toured America with Chaim Weizmann (later to be Israel&apos;s first president), drumming up support for such Zionist causes. But he had reservations, writing to his great friend the Dutch physicist Paul Ehrenfest: &quot;The Zionists are shameless and importunate; I have a hard time adopting the appropriate position in each instance, considering that I am, of\u00a0course, well-disposed to the cause.&quot; Einstein could not escape being regarded as a figurehead for world Jewry, but he did reject the post of President of Israel when it was offered in 1952. In 1922, Einstein&apos;s peace activism took the form of joining the League of\u00a0Nations committee on intellectual cooperation, but he knew he did not possess the negotiation skills essential to political life, and all his attempts at such intervention led to frustration. He resigned from the committee in July, only to rejoin and then leave for good in March 1923. Of this first resignation he wrote to Marie Curie: &quot;I perceived that very strong anti-Semitism prevails among those I to some extent have to represent at the League of Nations; and\u00a0generally there is a mentality that makes me unsuited to be the representing and intermediary person.&quot; When he was warned, following Rathenau&apos;s murder, that his own life might be in danger, he decided that, whatever his long-term plans, he would spend some time away from Germany. From October 1922 to March 1923 he toured, principally in Japan at\u00a0the invitation of his Japanese publisher. Japan might seem an unlikely home-from-home for a German Jew, but Einstein was entranced by the delicacy of Japanese art and architecture, the grace of the people, the social cohesion. He believed in a\u00a0culture of aesthetic and moral harmony that clearly did not exist in Germany. He found Japanese music somewhat wanting, because the element of harmony that coursed through and gave impetus to western music was missing, but the people, the architecture and the social climate he found enchanting, declaring: &quot;For the first time I have seen a healthy human society whose members are absorbed in it.&quot; All of this would, within a decade, curdle, and a brutalised Japan would become an ally of Nazi Germany. But this does not invalidate Einstein&apos;s verdict on the culture he observed. The journey also took in brief visits to\u00a0Barcelona, Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong, ending in Palestine. He found the voyage, during which he was free of\u00a0the many pressures of Germany, stimulating for his science, and the procession of scenes from so many un-Germanic places brought out the aesthete in him. So absorbing was the experience that the award of the Nobel prize, the ceremony for which he missed because of the trip, went unmentioned in his diary. Einstein was a man of broad culture: music was always vital to him, and even in the hurly-burly of his early fame, when, as he said, &quot;the great crowd seized possession of me&quot;, he managed to arrange to play his violin in\u00a0string quartets with musical friends. Fame meant that he could try to advance causes he believed in, such as international scholarly and scientific collaboration. But left to himself, he valued above all his circle of friends, mostly from his days in Switzerland. He was a theorist, who did his greatest work while a patent clerk with no access to a laboratory. He is famous for his thought experiments, not hard, bench-top, real-time experiments. So\u00a0he has become the epitome of the unpractical thinker. His pacifism and physical appearance reinforced the image of an idealist dreamer. But Einstein was deeply interested in machines. In the 1950s he wrote: &quot;I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0never ceased to concern myself with technical matters. This was of benefit also to my scientific research.&quot; Einstein worked with Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe on improved designs for ships&apos; gyrocompasses as a co-patentee. He also took out other patents, notably for a design of refrigerator (co-patentee Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, later to be the key founder of the Manhattan project to produce the atom bomb). The invention of fluorocarbons in 1928 meant that the Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd fridge never caught on, but it is curious to contemplate that the theorist of relativity might well also have had an appliance in every kitchen. In the 1922 papers we see the practical Einstein at work with Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe in a patent dispute with the American Elmer Sperry concerning the gyroscope; Einstein gives expert witness in the patent hearings. Given his background in patents this is not so surprising, but it gives a frisson to hear him switch from debating space-time to urging Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe to &quot;plate the aluminium sphere with a more precious metal&quot; or to find a means of &quot;applying a layer of graphite&quot;. This is trial-and-error work, as far removed as possible from contemplating whether or not &quot;God plays dice&quot;. Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe wrote to Einstein&apos;s colleague Arnold Sommerfeld, stating that &quot;weary of Berlin and everything connected with it&quot;, Einstein &quot;wants to\u00a0go into technology&quot;. One technology he never went into,\u00a0although popular myth suggests otherwise, is nuclear fission. The equation E=mc2 proposes the enormous energetic potential of matter, but only in the most general way. Einstein&apos;s scientific biographer wrote that &quot;to say that this made possible the construction of nuclear weapons is like saying that the invention of the alphabet caused the Bible to be written&quot;. What Einstein did\u00a0do was use his influence to alert President Roosevelt to the danger that Germany would acquire an atom bomb. Einstein&apos;s genius didn&apos;t lie in one over-developed faculty \u2013 as the crass researchers who stole his brain for analysis believed \u2013 but in a broader-than-usual range of competencies. He\u00a0was mathematician, physicist, engineer, philosopher, musician and social and political activist, and he had\u00a0a highly developed visual artistic sense. He attributed his findings to his\u00a0intense &quot;curiosity, obsession, and\u00a0sheer perseverance&quot;, claiming: &quot;I\u00a0myself have no special talents&quot;. And\u00a0he attributed his elucidation of relativity to his slow development, asking questions as an adult that children might toy with only to abandon as they grow up (he was 16 when he had the first intuition of the\u00a0relativity paradoxes). Einstein is the classic example of a man who &quot;hears\u00a0a\u00a0different drummer&quot;. And he remained true to this: he stepped to\u00a0the music he\u00a0heard &quot;however measured or far away&quot;. And far away for him included the deepest recesses of space-time, a place no one before even knew existed. \u2022 Nanoscience: Giants of the Infinitesimal by Peter Forbes and Tom Grimsey will be published in October. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2013.

Then she bit her lip and smiled. The Chinese visitors counting out wads of euros and engaged in what the Paris authorities call &quot;fervent shopping&quot; neither noticed nor seemed to care. They had cash, lots of it, burning holes in their pockets and, with visits to the Louvre and Versailles beckoning, not much time to spend it on the luxury goods and logos they were seeking. The excited chatter was not so much about which monogrammed watch or leather handbag to buy, but how many. As London frets over the bureaucratic obstacles placed in the way of high-spending visitors from Beijing or Shanghai, Paris is reaping the reward of an official drive to make the city the destination of choice for hundreds of thousands of increasingly affluent Chinese tourists. &quot;Let&apos;s be perfectly clear, this is a competition with London, this is a battle between cities. Our goal is that Chinese visitors come to Paris, stay for longer and spend more money,&quot; Fran\u00e7ois Navarro, spokesperson for the Ile-de-France regional tourist authority, told the Observer. &quot;Of course, we prefer that Chinese tourists come to spend their money in Galeries Lafayette and not in Harrods.&quot; It helps that France is part of the Schengen area, the bloc of 26 European countries that requires only a single visa \u2013 a group that Britain has refused to join. The French authorities have gone further, establishing a joint visa office in Beijing with the Germans last October to help Chinese visitors obtain travel documents quickly and easily. &quot;Our figures show a rise of about 20% in the number of visas given since then, but it&apos;s still not enough. We have fewer visa problems than London because of Schengen but we have asked the French government to make it even easier for the Chinese to obtain visas,&quot; Navarro added. &quot;And our goal is to give them the best welcome possible.&quot; To this end, Paris has gone on another of its periodic charm offensives, sending hotels, cafes, shops and even taxi firms copies of a new booklet called Do You Speak Tourist?, encouraging them to be &quot;even more welcoming&quot; to foreigners. The Paris area draws 33 million tourists a year, creating around 600,000 direct and indirect jobs. It also claims to attract more international visitors \u2013 around 17 million \u2013 than any other city in the world, including one million Chinese tourists annually, compared with an estimated 110,000 Chinese visitors to London. Britain&apos;s tourist and retail authorities have long warned that the government&apos;s tough visa restrictions, aimed at keeping out illegal immigrants, mean the UK is losing out on a growing appetite for international travel among increasingly affluent Chinese, to the tune of \u00a31.2bn a year. The World Tourism Organisation says the number of Chinese tourists travelling abroad increased from 10 million in 2000 to 83 million in 2012. About half of them spend more than \u00a33,000 a trip and account for 25% of sales of luxury goods around the world, giving them considerable economic clout. In 2012, Shanghai-based Hurun Report reported that France had become the preferred destination for increasing numbers of China&apos;s estimated 2.8 million dollar millionaires. The Do You Speak Tourist? report claims that Chinese visitors spend 40% of their holiday budget shopping, mostly for luxury goods. Britons, who make up the biggest number of Parisian tourists, spend 7%, and Americans 25.7%. It says the Chinese, whom Navarro describes as &quot;the kings of shopping&quot;, want &quot;luxury shopping above all&quot; and &quot;have an idealised and romantic vision of Paris&quot;. It advises: &quot;A simple smile and good day in their own language will keep them more than satisfied.&quot; France&apos;s attempts to present a welcoming face to the new tourists from China have suffered a series of setbacks in recent weeks after a spate of muggings, including the beating up of a group of Asian wine students in Bordeaux earlier this month. The incident was condemned in China and by France&apos;s interior minister, Manuel Valls, aware of potential economic repercussions, as a &quot;xenophobic attack&quot;. In May, the Colbert committee, made up of 75 of France&apos;s most prestigious luxury goods companies, including Louis Vuitton, Saint Laurent, Chanel, Dior and Herm\u00e8s, warned that foreign tourists, particularly Chinese visitors carrying lots of cash, were being deterred from visiting Paris because the city had become &quot;synonymous with insecurity&quot;. However, Edouard Lefebvre of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es committee, which represents 182 outlets on the celebrated boulevard, said shops were making special efforts to cater for Chinese shoppers, including having &quot;someone who speaks Mandarin, Cantonese and other Chinese languages&quot;. &quot;We&apos;ve developed a service adapted to their needs, which includes delivering the items they buy to their hotels,&quot; Lefebvre said. And such is their spending power that sales staff, taxi drivers and even the stereotypical epitome of Gallic grumpiness, the Parisian waiter, are being encouraged to proffer a &quot;huang ying guang&quot; (welcome) or &quot;ni hao&quot; (good day), in an effort to encourage the Chinese to part with their money.

Bizarre claims then emerged that supposed supporters of Chen had given him a phone and iPad loaded with spyware and tracking capabilities when he started at NYU.  The heads of NYU strenuously denied they were bowing to pressure because they want to open a campus in Shanghai and said the deal for the university to host Chen had simply come to an end.

China claims Taiwan as its territory and resents any Taiwanese activity that embarrasses Beijing. The island is a democracy but Ma is also trying to improve relations with the Communist party government on the mainland. In May, the Chinese government in effect warned Chen to mind his language when he visits Taiwan. &quot;As a Chinese citizen, on his activities overseas he should know how to protect the country&apos;s dignity and fulfil his responsibilities as a citizen,&quot; said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei.

The slight, unassuming 43-year-old said he drew inspiration from morally inflected westerns and martial arts movies. His four tales, which draw on real events, include that of a spa receptionist fighting off a lecherous customer and a miner armed with a gun and intent on revenge against corrupt officials. &quot;I don&apos;t admire or worship violence,&quot; Jia said. &quot;To fight violence with violence is a tragedy. This film seeks the roots of violence.&quot; In the past, he said, social changes had led to personal crises, but the problems had been partially hidden. &quot;Partly it&apos;s that social problems have been more intense than before \u2026 In the past, the corruption was not beyond imagination, but now, the reality is surreal to us \u2026 The [former] minister for railways went on trial and it was said he had more than 300 properties. &quot;The gap between rich and poor is also increasing,&quot; Jia said. &quot;The bigger the difference is, the more [these] hidden, disturbed emotions grow.&quot; But ordinary people were also increasingly aware of the injustices, he said, and their tolerance was shrinking. &quot;In recent years people have chosen to solve [their personal crises] in a violent way,&quot; the film-maker added. This month, 47 people died in a bus fire that police say was started by a suicidal man after a long dispute with local officials over welfare payments. &quot;In China there is more and more [violence]. You just saw the bus case. Last year in Guangdong a man didn&apos;t get his salary from the boss and set fire to an underwear factory [killing 14 young female workers],&quot; he noted. Jia sees silence in the face of wrongs as a sin, but not everyone agrees, he said: &quot;Chinese society is strange: people feel if you talk about sad or tragic things it will have even more of a negative impact on society. It&apos;s really strange logic. If you can&apos;t even face it in a film, how can you face it in reality? If even films cannot refer to [violence], it will always be unfamiliar to us and violent incidents will increase.&quot; A Touch of Sin scooped the best screenplay award at Cannes last month. Jia has long received international acclaim for films such as Still Life, which won the Golden Lion at Venice, and 24 City. But the reaction of authorities at home is perhaps more remarkable. His producer urged him not to make the movie because it would be banned, like his early works. Instead, it has been approved for release later this year with only minor changes.     Jia Zhangke and the actor Zhao Tao arrive at the Shanghai international film festival this month. Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters    &quot;Chinese censorship means a policeman has to be a good man; you can&apos;t change that,&quot; he said. &quot;But more important is self-censorship.&quot; Jia has been a vocal critic of controls, but said these days he could talk to censors and explain why he wanted to include particular aspects. Not everyone approves of his decision to work within the existing system. In 2009 he withdrew from a film festival where the exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer was speaking, though he said it was his own choice. But he has also tested its boundaries and continues to press for more space. Real cultural reforms are urgently needed, including &quot;media freedom, freedom for writers \u2026 how we face history \u2026 The cultural system is the basis for reforms to the political system&quot;, he said. The director, who grew up in the countryside and was rejected twice by the Beijing Film Academy before his acceptance, has always been drawn to those on the margins. His first film, Xiao Wu, was about a pickpocket. He has described his home province of Shanxi as &quot;my true China&quot;, pointing out that only a minority of the population live in Beijing and Shanghai. Studying at university in the 1990s also exposed his generation to new ways of thinking, teaching them to be alert to power and to respect justice, he said. Though perhaps better appreciated abroad than at home, he does appear to have one unexpected admirer domestically. China&apos;s new leader, Xi Jinping, reportedly noted one of his films approvingly at a private dinner with the then US ambassador some years ago. &quot;Whether it&apos;s a Chinese citizen or the Chinese leader, we all live in the same country and face the same life. I&apos;m happy it aroused the same feelings,&quot; Jia said.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "Film", "Cannes 2013", "Cannes film festival", "Festivals", "World news", "Culture", "Xi Jinping"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-24T20:35:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/26/emap-parent-top-right", "sentences": ["During the year Top Right opened offices in Shanghai and Sao Paolo."], "title": "Emap parent company Top Right: no breakup before 2017", "article": "The chief executive of business-to-business publisher Top Right has said there will be no breakup of the company until at least 2017. Duncan Painter said Top Right, formerly Emap, which owns assets including the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, fashion data firm WGSN and magazines including Retail Week and Drapers, would not be looking to sell off more parts of its business in order to reduce debt. Painter was speaking on Wednesday as Top Right revealed a 7% year-on-year rise in like-for-like revenues and an 18% decline in profit for 2012, which he ascribed to extra investment made in the business last year. &quot;It doesn&apos;t take long to figure out that it doesn&apos;t serve us to sell any of our businesses for the next few years,&quot; he said. &quot;What serves us best is to make them grow, to drive value for shareholders. [They] are very committed to the plan and clear and understanding of the timelines that it is going to require to maximise the value for them and they are confident and committed to that timeline. &quot;Realistically, based on the investments that went in, if you want to get a return on your money, you would look at 2017 to 2018 before you&apos;d even consider trying to get value out of the business. No one is rushing.&quot; Top Right, jointly owned by Guardian Media Group and private equity firm Apax, reported a 7.4% rise in adjusted revenue for 2012 to \u00a3244m. However, profits, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 18.2% from \u00a386m to \u00a370.2m. The company said that the fall was planned with its businesses benefiting from a \u00a336m investment programme, the largest in six years, to help drive top-line revenue growth. Painter hailed the rejuvenation of Top Right&apos;s B2B publishing business, which retains the Emap brand, as the &quot;success story of 2012&quot; for the group. Emap, which earlier this year hived off titles including Broadcast in preparation for a management-led buyout, increased its revenues slightly in 2012 to \u00a371.3m. However, Painter said that on an underlying level revenues grew by 4.2%, returning a declining business to solid growth. The division boosted its pre-tax profits from \u00a313.4m to \u00a315.7m. &quot;Emap is the success story of 2012 for us, it absolutely bucked market trends,&quot; said Painter, who was paid \u00a3700,000 last year according to the company&apos;s annual report made available on Wednesday. &quot;We grew revenues and customer numbers across the business, subscriptions now account for a reasonable proportion of the business. To turn it around in a year and get growth is beyond expectations.&quot; He said that print trade magazines will remain a core part of the Emap offering, after launching various mixed subscription packages customers had shown that there was still a strong demand for print. He added: &quot;You can&apos;t get an instant fix in subscriptions. It requires discipline and belief.&quot; Top Right&apos;s statutory results were heavily affected by the sale of automotive information business CAP, for which it received \u00a3170m in cash. Statutory pre-tax profits rose from \u00a352.4m to \u00a3186m and including CAP in revenue \u2013 Top Right prefers to strip it out to give a true like-for-like picture of its ongoing businesses \u2013 revenue rose slightly to \u00a3251.7m. The sale of CAP allowed the heavily debt-laden Top Right to slash its borrowings by almost \u00a3150m. The 29% reduction in net debt, from \u00a3508.6m to \u00a3359m, leaves the company at a net debt to ebitda ratio of just over five. While this is still considered high, the Top Right chief financial officer, Mandy Gradden, said the business was operating well within its covenants with banks and that it had much more financial flexibility following a renegotiation of terms earlier this year. She said that the focus was on increasing top line revenue at Top Right, with GMG and Apax not seeking profit growth, and that the business is on track for double-digit revenue growth this year. The growth of the Cannes Lions advertising festival helped fuel a 9% revenue rise last year at events division i2i, the best performing operation. i2i, home to more than 30 trade shows, boosted its revenues more than 9% year on year to \u00a3101.7m as pre-tax profits rose from \u00a334.3m to \u00a337.2m. It is understood that Top Right examined the lucrative Cannes festival around the beginning of the year to assess its sale potential, but decided not to proceed with a formal selloff. &quot;We saw exceptional growth rates in our Lions festivals business,&quot; said Tom Hall, partner at Apax and chairman of Top Right. Business information division 4C Group, which includes WGSN and Planet Retail, increased its revenues by 7.4% to \u00a371m, excluding CAP. Pre-tax profits soared from \u00a330.2m to \u00a3177.4m thanks to the CAP sale. Without CAP the business saw a significant profit drop, which the company was said was in part due to its investment programme. Top Right&apos;s total staff numbers rose from 1,461 to 1,517, with staff costs climbing from \u00a366.3m to \u00a379.6m. During the year Top Right opened offices in Shanghai and Sao Paolo. &quot;Top Right Group delivered year-on-year growth in every month of 2012,&quot; said the GMG chief executive, Andrew Miller. &quot;This strong performance was enabled by the \u00a336m investment programme in the growth strategies of the businesses and key brands.&quot; \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

WINNERS Intelligence agencies and armed forces The security and intelligence agencies - MI5, MI6, and GCHQ - will benefit from a 3.4% increase in their combined annual budget of nearly \u00a32bn under the government\u2019s spending plans, in a move likely to mark the start of a significant long-term trend. The overall defence budget will continue to fall but the chancellor announced a sweetener - fines on banks for fixing Libor inter-bank lending rates will fund the military covenant. How this will in practice benefit members of the armed forces, their families, and veterans, was not immediately clear. There will be no further cuts in the numbers of armed forces personnel - 4,480 soldiers have been handed redundancy notices as the force aims to reduce personnel numbers to 82,000 by 2018 from more than 100,000 three years ago. However, the number of civilians working for the Ministry of Defence will be cut further. The government has already announced cuts in defence civilian staff from 75,000 to 40,000 over nine years. The defence resource budget will be maintained in cash terms at \u00a324bn, a cut in real terms, though, as already announced, the defence equipment budget, now totalling \u00a314bn will grow by 1% in real terms in the year 2015/16. Both the armed forces and the intelligence agencies will be spending more money on cyber-warfare. MoD contracts with private contractors will be further scrutinised for savings. Rises in the MI5, MI6, and GCHQ budgets reverse this year\u2019s budgetary cuts and was widely expected after the heads of the agencies lobbied for them even before the Woolwich attack on a soldier last month. The security and intelligence budgets are likely to rise for the foreseeable future as the amount of money spent on the armed forces falls. This is likely to be a long term trend. Richard Norton-Taylor Arts \u201cIt is a relief,\u201d said Mark Skipper, chief executive of Leeds-based Northern Ballet, as Osborne announced a 5% cut for arts organisations. \u201cEspecially given that we were looking at modellings of 15% and the devastation that would cause. I think 5% is a good outcome.\u201d That response will be echoed across the arts and museum sector. The DCMS has agreed a budget reduction of 7%, from which cuts to Arts Council England and national museums will be limited to 5%. The Treasury, it seems, listened to arguments that any more would spell disaster for a sector that is buoyant artistically but also a significant cash generator for the UK. Osborne said that national museums would have greater freedoms to use their budgets as they saw fit. But the DCMS cut is not the whole story. Also worrying are the 10% cuts to local government on which many arts groups rely on for funding. Some had feared a repeat of 2010 when the Arts Council was given a 30% cut (including an order to cut its administration costs by half) from which arts organisations were cut 15%. That led to an enormous shake up, agonising for some \u2013 206 organisations lost their regular funding \u2013 but good for others with 110 brought in to the portfolio for the first time. What happens now? If you&apos;re the National Gallery, say, then it is straightforward: you make provision for a 5% cut. If you&apos;re funded by ACE and/or local authorities then you make your application for funding and you wait. Arts organisations will have to submit applications and decisions will be made strategically \u2013 some may get cut, some may get an increase. Mark Brown     The Great Gatsby at the Northern Ballet. Photograph: Donald Cooper for the Guardian    Sport Almost one year on from a hugely successful Olympic Games, the extent of the promised legacy for sport on which it was secured is under the microscope. Recent figures from Sport England show that fewer people are playing sport regularly than they were before the Olympics and the 5% cut for community sport, part of an overall 7% cut to the DCMS announced today threatens to damage the government in perception terms. But, in practice, the cut to the exchequer-funded portion of Sport England&apos;s grassroots sport budget \u2013 which applies only to resource funding and not capital projects - will amount only to a few million pounds. The majority of its \u00a3300m annual budget now comes from the lottery following changes to the way that money is distributed. The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, is believed to be satisfied with the result of the spending negotiations after making the argument that deeper cuts would undermine the Olympic legacy case. The budget for elite Olympic and Paralympic sport, which will see \u00a3355m invested by UK Sport over the four years to 2016, was ringfenced as part of a deal unveiled during the Olympics when the medals were raining in. The more profound questions for the Olympic legacy, aside from whether Sport England can effect a genuine shift in the nation&apos;s sport habits with its comparatively meagre budget, come as a result of the further cuts to local authority budgets that will inevitably lead to pressure on faciltiies and community sport programmes. Owen Gibson Science Osborne declared the settlement for science a \u201chuge investment\u201d for the area and spoke of hopes to make Britain once again a country where the future is invented. In practice, that means continuing the freeze on the science research budget, which has been held at \u00a34.6bn since the spending review in 2010. The flat cash settlement back then equates to a cut in real terms over the period, as inflation takes its toll. But the chancellor pledged a major increase in capital spending, up by 9% at the Department of Business. That will include a raise for science spending from \u00a3600m to \u00a31.1bn a year until the 2021, a move that will help the long term planning and expansion of scientific projects. In 2010, the government pulled capital spending out of the science budget, and slashed it by half. The deficit has since been made up, with new money announced over 2011-12 for high performance computing, the UK space agency and an institute dedicated to the wonder material, graphene. During his speech, Osborne urged scientists in Britain to \u201ckeep inventing, keep delivering\u201d and promised that the country would \u201cback you all the way.\u201d Projects the government has pledged to back include the synergistic air-breathing rocket engine (Sabre) and a new supercomputer for the Met Office. To the relief of many scientists, the Medical Research Council will not move the the Department of Health, a move that was being considered by Vince Cable to save costs.

According to Treasury documents released with the spending review, total UK aid will rise to \u00a311.7bn in 2014-15 and \u00a312.2bn in the following year. Last year the UK spent \u00a38.5bn on on official development assistance (ODA), roughly \u00a3137 per head. Osborne acknowledged opposition in Tory ranks to the government\u2019s decision to protect the UK\u2019s aid budget but said he refused to balance the books on the backs of the poor. The chancellor said he was proud to support a government that is the first to meet the 0.7% target. Osborne had announced in his March budget that the coalition would meet the target this year. Foreign aid - along with health and schools in England - has been \u201cringfenced\u201d, which has not gone down well with many Tory backbenchers who think the aid budget should not escape the axe. Foreign aid, health and schools spending were also protected in the 2010 spending review. This means that the reductions in spending since 2010 have fallen more heavily on other departments. The same applies to cuts for 2015-16. Mark Tran Scotland Alex Salmond&apos;s government has emerged as one of the main beneficiaries of Osborne&apos;s spending review, as the Treasury moved to quell support for Scottish independence. The Scottish government will have the fourth largest budget of any Treasury funded area or department by 2015, with a total spend of \u00a328.6bn, after the chancellor increased its capital spending by \u00a3400m to \u00a33.3bn, and held its day-to-day spending at near level terms. Scotland&apos;s spending will be the next largest after the NHS and education funding in England and Wales, and defence spending, in a move designed to repel Salmond&apos;s attacks over his government&apos;s reduced spending power. The timing is significant as 4 million Scots prepare to vote in the independence referendum in September 2014; the independence movement plans to capitalise on discontent with Osborne&apos;s heavy cuts in government spending, particularly on welfare. Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, whose small department will see a 10% budget cut by 2015, said the UK government was responding to Salmond&apos;s demands for extra spending by increasing his capital budgets by 12.9% in real terms. This was a \u201chuge spending boost\u201d, he said, before acknowledging that part of the \u00a3400m would come from a new borrowing limit of \u00a3293m for the Scottish government. The Scottish government&apos;s day-to-day revenue spending would fall by 1.9% in real terms by 2015. Moore said that was far lower than the 10% average cuts in Whitehall spending. Under the Treasury&apos;s funding formula for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, grants are closely tied to health and education spending in England and Wales, which Osborne has again protected. Severin Carrell     Alex Salmond: happy. Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA    NHS As expected, the NHS is one of the few winners from Osborne\u2019s wide-ranging statement. The Department of Health\u2019s headline resource budget will rise from \u00a3108.34bn in 2014-15 to to \u00a3110.37bn, up \u00a32.1bn - though a real-terms increase of just 0.1% - in line with the pledge in both the 2010 Conservative manifesto and post-election coalition agreement to give the NHS real-terms year on year increases.\u00a0 The Department of Health\u2019s (DH) capital budget, which is spent on health infrastructure, will also rise from \u00a34.65bn to \u00a34.74bn. Details of exactly what that will be spent on will come tomorrow when Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, explains where \u00a3100bn of infrastructure spending will be going.\u00a0 The most significant move, though, is the creation of what the DH calls \u201ca \u00a33.8bn pooled health and social care budget\u201d. Its purpose: \u201cto make sure everyone gets a properly joined up service so they get the care they need from whoever is best placed to deliver, whether that\u2019s the NHS or the local authority\u201d.\u00a0 The result should be to drive forward the integration of health and social care in England, a move its many champions sometimes call \u201cthe Holy Grail\u201d of health policy. Health ministers Norman Lamb (Liberal Democrat) and Dr Dan Poulter (Conservative) are both keen advocates of what is a significant shift -- Osborne called it \u201chistoric\u201d -- which should reduce pressure on the NHS by ensuring that those needing help from either service seamlessly receive either kind of support, at or near their homes, to keep them healthier. That should reduce A&amp;E attendances, admissions to hospital and length of stay, especially among the growing frail, elderly population. Unsustainable rising demand on the NHS means the move is long overdue. Significantly, \u00a33bn of the \u00a33.8bn will come from the DH - \u00a32bn extra from them - and the other \u00a3800m from Eric Pickles\u2019s Department of Communities and Local Government. Health and wellbeing boards, new bodies created in April by the NHS shake-up will decide who gets how much and for what purpose. Recipients -\u00a0clinical commissioning groups or local councils - will only get money if they meet certain conditions.\u00a0 But \u00a32bn more of DH funding for social care is also \u00a32bn less for the NHS. Denis Campbell The site of the Battle of Waterloo The site of the Battle of Waterloo, south of Brussels, will be restored in time for the 200th anniversary on 18 June, 2015, the chancellor announced, in a move reflecting government plans to commemorate British military engagements beyond those of the 1914-18 world war. The government also wants to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt, where Henry V beat the French, on 25 October 1415. For years the site at Waterloo has been neglected from the victor\u2019s point of with cafes and souvenir shops dominated by Napoleon. The biggest monument is the Lion\u2019s Mound commemorating the spot where the Prince of Orange, Britain\u2019s ally, was wounded. The Wellington Museum is situated in a modest building in the village of Waterloo hidden from the battlefield. Funds for the site of the battle, fought in 1815, will be provided by the Department of Culture, Media, &amp; Sport. Richard Norton-Taylor  LOSERS Environment Flood defences, protecting nature and fighting pollution appear to be the casualties after Osborne inflicted the highest level of budget cuts \u2013 almost 10% - on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), alongside a few other unfortunates \u2013 just as he did in the 2010 spending review. Spending on flood defences \u201cwill remain at current levels in cash terms\u201d in 2015-16, say Treasury documents. That&apos;s a real term cut to follow earlier cuts of more than 25% compared to 2010, at a time when the need protect against catastrophic flooding is rising due to climate change. Osborne did, however, promise to \u201cset out plans for a major commitment to new flood defences for the rest of this decade\u201d on Thursday. With Defra&apos;s budgets already heavily cut, environment secretary Owen Paterson attempted to fight off further reductions but failed. Because flood defence spending is being kept level and farming payments are fixed by the Europe Union, the new cuts will inevitably fall on those services protecting wildlife and nature and preventing water and air pollution. The Environment Agency and Natural England have already lost many thousands of staff. The Treasury said Defra \u201cwould be prioritising spending on economically high-value areas\u201d, but did not specify any. Previously, Paterson has highlighted boosting the rural economy and food production by \u201cgetting out of people&apos;s hair\u201d. Damian Carrington Public sector workers Millions of public sector workers will lose automatic annual pay increases as part of Osborne&apos;s \u00a311.5bn cuts package. The chancellor said the current system was \u201cdeeply unfair\u201d to public servants who did not receive the increase and the private sector. The announcement has provoked a furious response from unions.\u00a0 Osborne claimed that reforms such as ending \u201cprogression pay\u201d in favour of performance-related increases would ease the pain. \u201cProgression pay can at best be described as antiquated; at worst, it\u2019s deeply unfair to other parts of the public sector who don\u2019t get it and to the private sector who have to pay for it. So we will end automatic progression pay in the civil service by 2015-16,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are working to remove automatic pay rises simply for time served in our schools, NHS, prisons and police. The armed forces will be excluded from these reforms,\u201d he added. Osborne said public sector pay rises will be limited to an average of up to 1% for 2015-16.\u00a0 \u201cKeeping pay awards down and ending automatic progression pay means that, for every pound we have to save in central administration, we can better limit job losses,\u201d he said. He also warned of further job cuts in the public sector, as he unveiled a 10% budget cut for the Department for Communities and Local Government.\u00a0 The Public and Commercial Services union said it was \u201cdeeply unfair\u201d to stop pay progression in the civil service. Ministers have already announced plans for a major overhaul of teachers\u2019 pay.\u00a0Rajeev Syal Wales Ahead of the spending review the Welsh government called for more money to be ploughed into infrastructure schemes to get the country&apos;s economy moving. But the people of south Wales are still waiting to find out whether one of the key projects \u2013 much-needed improvements to the M4 \u2013 will get the go-ahead. Osborne called the plans for the motorway scheme around Newport \u201cimpressive\u201d but would not say more until the government gives its response to an ongoing commission&apos;s conclusions that more powers to raise tax and borrow money should be given to Wales. The M4 project is seen as crucial to prosperity in south Wales. There is a growing feeling that businesses are being put off investing in the region because of the frequent jams and accidents on the motorway. That response to the Silk Commission on devolution is due any week now but Osborne said the British government accepted that Cardiff&apos;s financial accountability and autonomy would be \u201cenhanced\u201d if it was partly self-financed. There will be no huge surprise that the Labour-led Welsh government&apos;s budget will be cut by 2% - the day to day revenue will be set at \u00a313.6bn - nor that the Wales Office will reduce its running costs by 10%. What may disturb the country more is Osborne&apos;s concession that many more job losses in the public sector are inevitable and his announcement that automatic pay increases for teachers, hospital workers and so on will end. More than a quarter of those in employment in Wales \u2013 over 330,000 people \u2013 work in the public sector so any changes tend to hit Wales harder than other areas. Good news for Welsh speakers, though \u2013 the British government confirmed it will not reduce its funding for Welsh-language television channel S4C. Steven Morris     The Welsh assembly building on Cardiff Bay. Photograph: David Jones/PA    Ministry of Justice In percentage terms, the Ministry of Justice will suffer one of the highest levels of cuts. The justice secretary, Chris Grayling, has agreed to reduce his department\u2019s funding by a further 10%. The MoJ\u2019s budget of \u00a36.8bn in 2014-15 will fall to \u00a36.2bn the following year. Only the local government department, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury have to endure similar levels of financial pain, with Defra coming close at 9.6%. Most of the savings appear to come from the courts. The news will dismay lawyers already fighting the latest round of legal aid cuts. That \u00a3220m saving in criminal legal aid is included in the chancellor\u2019s figures. But a proposed saving of \u00a3200m in the costs of running the courts - through partial privatisation, efficiency savings or rises in legal fees - emerges for the first time.\u00a0 Reform of public sector prisons, also an MoJ responsibility, is, by contrast, expected to lead to a \u00a3180m saving. A Criminal Justice System action plan is due to be announced shortly detailing how the Ministry of Justice, Home Office, police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will work more closely together. Among reforms envisaged are the introduction of special traffic courts to deal with \u201chigh volume, low level motoring offences\u201d. The police and the crown prosecution service will be asked to identify cases where a guilty plea is anticipated and deal with those cases early. Owen Bowcott Work and pensions Osborne moved to place a cap on the \u00a3157bn UK welfare budget by introducing controls on spending on housing benefit, disability allowances, tax credits and some pensioner benefits. But the cap, designed to limit expenditure on so-called annually managed expenditure, and dubbed \u201ca limit on the nation\u2019s credit card\u201d by the chancellor, will not affect the state pension, which accounts for over half of social security spending. Campaigners are concerned that the move failed to address the underlying causes of rising welfare spending, such as low wages, lack of jobs and rising rents. They say the move represented a huge change in the way welfare is managed, by breaking the link between the provision of social security from the need for it. Osborne also signalled a range of measures to tighten up eligibility for social security benefits, including a seven-day wait before people can sign on after losing their job. Claimants who do not speak English will be required to agree to learn as a condition of receiving benefits, and if they refused their benefits will be cut. Lone parents with children aged as young as three will be forced to regularly attend jobcentres in order to claim benefits, while all jobseekers will be asked to sign on weekly instead of fortnightly. A new \u201cupfront work search\u201d scheme will be launched, under which jobseekers will have to turn up with a CV and \u201cstart looking for work&quot;. Although the chancellor made it clear he would protect pensioner benefits he announced an annual \u201ctemperature test\u201d which will restrict winter fuel payments to pensioners who live abroad in warmer climates. The welfare cap will be set as a cash limit each year at the time of the budget statement, starting in April 2015. Osborne said: \u201cIn future, when a government looks set to breach the cap because it is failing to control welfare, the OBR will issue a public warning. The government will then be forced to take action to cut welfare costs or publicly breach the cap.\u201d Disability charity Scope said it would mean more pressure on the incomes of disabled people, who were already facing \u00a328bn of cuts across a range of benefits. Osborne said he had rejected calls to include the state pension in the overall cap because it would penalise people \u201cwho had worked hard all their lives&quot;. He added: \u201cCutting pensions to pay for working age benefits is a choice this government is certainly not prepared to make. Patrick Butler Local government Local authorities warned that essential services would be stretched to \u201cbreaking point\u201d after Osborne announced a 10% cut in funding for councils. Council leaders said the reduction for 2015-16, coming on the back of a 33% reduction in councils&apos; budgets for the 2011-15 period, meant libraries, leisure centres and school support services would bear the brunt of the cuts. A further 144,000 local government jobs would disappear by 2015-16, the chancellor predicted, a figure which comes on top of the 312,000 already cut in the first two years of the coalition. The chancellor said local government\u2019s 10% budget cut amounted to a 2% cut once other sources of income were taken into account. \u201cWe have to ask local government for the kind of sacrifice central government is making.&quot; He announced \u00a32bn of new investment for councils to set up integrated health and social care services, \u00a33bn of capital investment in affordable housing and an additional \u00a3200m for the troubled families initiative, which would be extended to 400,000 \u201chigh risk\u201d households. Councils would be funded to enable them to freeze council tax bills for 2014-15 and 2015-16. This would save \u00a3100 a year off the average council tax bill, Osborne said. Community budget pilots, in which public services in each locality work together to find efficiency savings, will be extended, alongside a \u00a330m fund to encourage fire, and ambulance services to merge. Details of a \u00a32bn a year investment in local economic growth funds would be published on Thursday. Communities secretary Eric Pickles, who the chancellor called in his speech \u201cthe model of lean government\u201d, said that the settlement for his department represented \u201ca fair deal for councils and a fair deal for council tax payers&quot;. Sir Merrick Cockell, the chairman of the Local Government Association said: \u201cThis cut will stretch essential services to breaking point in many areas. While positive steps have been taken to target NHS funding at social care, the fact remains that some councils will simply not have enough money to meet all their statutory responsibilities. Services such as culture and leisure facilities, school support, road maintenance and growth related programmes will bear the brunt of these cuts.\u201d Patrick Butler     Eric Pickles: 'model of lean government'. Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA    MIXED PICTURE Transport On transport, the chancellor has taken with one hand but given with the other. The Department for Transport\u2019s day-to-day budget has been cut by 9%, but Osborne said the capital budget for long-term schemes would rise to \u00a39.5bn - an extra \u00a3600m in 2014-15. He indicated that Transport for London\u2019s grant would take a major hit, and the government would also \u201cbear down on the running costs\u201d of rail administration. However, he also vowed to preserve mayor Boris Johnson\u2019s annual capital budget of \u00a31.8bn until 2020 - allowing London to continue to invest in tube upgrades and projects such as the Northern Line extension. That means fares may well rise again and some bus services are likely to suffer - news that comes on a day that TfL announced \u00a32.5m in bonuses to executives. Network Rail\u2019s long-term budget is effectively ringfenced for now and Osborne pledged to continue \u201crecord\u201d investment, but will be looking for more savings.\u00a0 Cuts in the budget may also affect road maintenance, even as Osborne promised to build more new ones than for 50 years. The chancellor referenced projects mainly already announced: road spending, Crossrail and HS2 - whose budget is likely to get cross-party approval in a paving bill this afternoon. But he also endorsed looking at Crossrail 2, a new north-south rail line in London.\u00a0 Transport will though be the beneficiary of much of the \u00a3100bn in infrastructure projects that Danny Alexander will detail tomorrow (\u00a3300bn in total pledged until the end of the decade). Transport projects may also pick up some crumbs in a Local Growth fund the chancellor announced - but of just \u00a32bn, lower than expected. Gwyn Topham     The Northern Line on the London Underground. Photograph: Graham Turner    Foreign Office Foreign and Commonwealth Office spending is to be be cut by 8% in 2015 but plans are proceeding to open more embassies in what the chancellor called the \u201cemerging world\u201d and focus British diplomacy on commercial opportunities in \u201cgrowing markets\u201d from Shanghai to Abuja. The FCO is expected to make \u00a370m worth of savings by \u201cco-locating\u201d UK missions with Commonwealth and EU countries and continuing an existing programme to reduce UK-based-staff by 10% by 2015. Other savings are like to be found from programmes dealing with counter-terrorism, human rights and Arab partnerships. Another tried efficiency is the creation of regional \u201chubs\u201d providing corporate services to a number of British missions in the same region. One bright spot is the announcement of \u00a370m to be shared with UKTI to support global economic growth. \u201cThe extra money...recognises the FCO\u2019s strong track record in this field,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cBy supporting countries in making political and economic reforms we in turn support the UK\u2019s prosperity.\u201d William Hague was praised by Osborne as \u201cthe best foreign secretary in a generation\u201d who had already demonstrated how to make pounds \u201cgo further.\u201d It had been anticpated that the FCO might get off lighter than other departments due to claims around around conflict and peacekeeping. FCO spending is largely on salaries and buildings rather than programmes. Grand premises like the elegant British embassy in Paris give an impression of diplomats living lavishly at taxpayer\u2019s expense \u2014 an image dismissed as a misleading carictaure by the FCO. Its budget was already tight after the last spending review in October 2010. It was cut then from \u00a31.6bn in 2011-12 to \u00a31.36bn in 2014/15. Ian Black and Neil Johnston Home Office Sharp increases of up to 10% each year in visa fees for those coming to work or study in Britain over the next two years are to be introduced to cushion the impact of a further 6% cut in the Home Office budget. This increase in visa fees, some of which are already more than \u00a3800, will be the second substantial rise in the three years. The Home Office said that visitor visa fees will also be increased by up to 6% over the next two years. The cost of a basic tier two visa for a sponsored skilled migrant in Britain is already \u00a3578 and contrasts with only \u00a395 charged for a work permit back in 2003. The Treasury said the increases in visa fees would be accompanied by improvements in the way visa applications were dealt with. The split-up of the UK Border Agency would also generate savings. The policing budget, which has already suffered a 20% cut in Whitehall grants, now faces the prospect of a further in 2015/2016 - general election year, but the chancellor declined to spell out exactly how much but said it would be less than the overall 6% figure. Home Office officials have made clear that while the police budget has been \u201crelatively protected\u201d immigration will have to take a greater share of the savings. While the budget for counter-terrorism policing has been entirely protected, not all counter-terrorism work has been shielded in the same way, raising the prospect that the Prevent programme, which involves local authorities, may face cutbacks. A \u00a350m innovation fund is to be set up to encourage police forces to collaborate and \u201cshare services\u201d with each other and local authorities. The Police Federation said forces had already been subjected to 20% cuts in the last spending review and lost 12,000 officers. They predicted that officer numbers will drop faster than the fall in crime: \u201cWe would be very interested to hear how the government proposes forces should function with even more scant resources,\u201d said Steve Williams, Federation chair. Alan Travis Northern Ireland Thirty-one million pounds that could have been spent on projects such as improving Northern Ireland&apos;s infrastructure or upgrading its school buildings have been diverted into counter-terrorism. George Osborne allocated the extra cash for the province to the Police Service of Northern Ireland to aid their ongoing fight against the new IRA, Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann. Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers confirmed that the additional \u00a331m was being directed towards coping with the dissident republican terror threat. She said: &quot;At a time when the government is taking the necessary measures to tackle the record deficit we inherited, today&apos;s spending review represents a fair settlement for Northern Ireland. &quot;The ongoing provision of \u00a331m for the PSNI is clear evidence of this government&apos;s commitment to maintain pressure on the terrorists to make NI a safer place for everyone.&quot; North Belfast Democratic Unionist MP Nigel Dodds welcomed the funding for the police. &quot;It is clear that there remains within our community, a tiny and fanatical element that is determined to drag us backwards into the dark days of the past,&quot; the DUP MP said. He added: &quot;The additional resources announced in the spending review will provide a much-needed boost to the PSNI as they go about the job of keeping the people of Northern Ireland safe.&quot; Overall Northern Ireland&apos;s regional budget has emerged relatively unaffected by the cuts as health and education form a large part of public spending in the province. However, its proposed resource budget for 2015-16 will be cut by 2%. Henry McDonald  Education While there were few obvious winners from today\u2019s announcement, there were some clear losers. The clearest losers were the disadvantaged recipients of the national scholarship programme, a fund to improve access to university after the imposition of \u00a39,000 undergraduate tuition fees, only for Osborne prune it back at the first opportunity. The programme is to rise to \u00a3300m. But Osborne announced the scheme will no longer be open to undergraduates from 2015-16. Other losers include teachers at state-funded schools, who had been warned that automatic pay progression would end, with Osborne reinforcing the message along with another pay freeze. Other losers in the longer term include local authorities, which saw their education role trimmed again, through a review of school spending efficiency and a proposal for a national school funding formula designed to end the regional patchwork that sees funding vary by thousands of pounds per pupil. For universities, the capital budget for science will increase to \u00a31.1bn in 2015-16 and ringfenced. But the \u00a34.6bn research funding budget was frozen. Overall, the department for education\u2019s budget survived the CSR largely intact, with a cut of only around 1% in real terms from its \u00a357.7bn settlement.

This increase in visa fees, some of which already cost above \u00a3800, will be the second substantial rise in three years. The Home Office said visitor visa fees will also be increased by up to 6% over the next two years. The Treasury said the rise would be accompanied by improvements in the way visa applications are dealt with. The splitting of the UK Border Agency would also bring savings. The policing budget, which has already suffered a 20% cut in Whitehall grants, now faces the prospect of a further cut in 2015/2016 of 4.9% or \u00a3269m. The Association of Chief Police Officers said this was equivalent to losing another 9,000 police jobs but the police would try to find the savings in other ways. Home Office officials have made clear that while the police budget has been &quot;relatively protected&quot;, immigration will have to take a greater share of the savings. While the budget for counter-terrorism policing has been entirely protected, not all counter-terrorism work has been shielded in the same way, raising the prospect that the Prevent programme, which involves local authorities, may face cutbacks. A \u00a350m innovation fund is to be set up to encourage police forces to collaborate and share services with each other and local authorities. The Police Federation said forces had already lost 12,000 officers and it predicted officer numbers would drop faster than the fall in crime. Alan Travis The Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills - 6% cut Universities saw their high-level research funding protected, but important funding for disadvantaged students taken away. In monetary terms the two are miles apart, with the Russell Group of research-orientated universities welcoming the maintenance of the \u00a34.6bn research budget, while the national scholarship programme \u2013 championed by the Liberal Democrats \u2013 is being cut back from \u00a3150m to \u00a350m and restricted to disadvantaged postgraduates. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Bis) defended the change, saying that admissions figures showed disadvantaged students had not been deterred by the \u00a39,000 tuition fees. The CSR also froze student maintenance grants for those from low income households, saving \u00a360m. Osborne declared the settlement for science a &quot;huge investment&quot; for the area and spoke of hopes to make Britain once again a country where the future is invented. In practice, that means continuing the freeze on the science research budget, which has been held at \u00a34.6bn since the spending review in 2010. The flat cash settlement back then equates to a cut in real terms over the period, as inflation takes its toll. But the chancellor pledged a major increase in capital spending, up by 9% at the Department of Business. That will include a raise for science spending from \u00a3600m to \u00a31.1bn a year until the 2021, a move that will help the long term planning and expansion of scientific projects. Projects the government has pledged to back include the synergistic air-breathing rocket engine (Sabre) and a new supercomputer for the Met Office. To the relief of many scientists, the Medical Research Council will not move the the Department of Health, a move that was being considered by Vince Cable to save costs.  Richard Adams and Ian Sample Arts organisations \u2013 5% cut The DCMS has agreed a budget reduction of 7%, from which cuts to Arts Council England and national museums will be limited to 5%. The Treasury, it seems, listened to arguments that any more would spell disaster for a sector that is buoyant artistically but also a significant cash generator for the UK. Osborne said national museums would have greater freedoms to use their budgets as they saw fit. But the DCMS cut is not the whole story. Also worrying are the 10% cuts to local government on which many arts groups rely. In sport, post Olympics, the 5% cut for community sport threatens to damage the government in perception terms. In practice though, the cut to the exchequer-funded portion of Sport England&apos;s grassroots sport budget \u2013 which applies only to resource funding and not capital projects \u2013 will amount only to \u00a32m. The majority of its \u00a3300m annual budget now comes from the lottery after changes to the way that money is distributed. The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, is believed to be satisfied with the result of the spending negotiations after making the argument that deeper cuts would undermine the Olympic legacy case. The budget for elite Olympic and Paralympic sport, which will see \u00a3355m invested by UK Sport over the four years to 2016, was ringfenced as part of a deal unveiled during the Olympics when medals were pouring in. Mark Brown and Owen Gibson Department of Defence \u2013 3.4% increase MI5, MI6, and GCHQ will benefit from a 3.4% increase in their combined annual budget of nearly \u00a32bn under the spending plans, in a move likely to mark the start of a significant long-term trend. The overall defence budget will continue to fall but the chancellor announced a sweetener \u2013 fines on banks for fixing Libor interbank lending rates will fund the military covenant. How this will in practice benefit members of the armed forces, their families, and veterans, was not immediately clear. There will be no further cuts in the numbers of armed forces personnel \u2013 4,480 soldiers have been handed redundancy notices as the force aims to reduce personnel numbers to 82,000 by 2018 from more than 100,000 three years ago. However, the number of civilians working for the Ministry of Defence will be cut further. The government has already announced cuts in defence civilian staff from 75,000 to 40,000 over nine years. The defence resource budget will be maintained in cash terms at \u00a324bn, a cut in real terms, though, as already announced, the defence equipment budget, now at \u00a314bn, will grow by 1% in real terms in 2015/16. Both the armed forces and the intelligence agencies will be spending more money on cyber-warfare. MoD contracts with private contractors will be further scrutinised for savings. Rises in the MI5, MI6, and GCHQ budgets reverse this year&apos;s budgetary cuts and was widely expected after the agencies lobbied for them even before the Woolwich\u00a0attack on a soldier last month. Richard Norton-Taylor Department of Health \u2013 0.1% increase As expected, the NHS is one of the few winners from Osborne&apos;s wide-ranging statement. The Department of Health&apos;s headline resource budget will rise from \u00a3108.34bn in 2014-15 to \u00a3110.37bn, up \u00a32.1bn \u2013 a real-terms increase of just 0.1% \u2013 in line with the pledge in the 2010 Conservative manifesto and post-election coalition agreement to give the NHS real-terms year on year increases. The Department of Health&apos;s (DH) capital budget for health infrastructure will also rise from \u00a34.65bn to \u00a34.74bn. Details of what that will be spent on will come onThursday when Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, explains where \u00a3100bn of infrastructure spending will be going. The most significant move, though, is the creation of what the DH calls &quot;a \u00a33.8bn pooled health and social care budget... to make sure everyone gets a properly joined up service so they get the care they need from whoever is best placed to deliver, whether that&apos;s the NHS or the local authority&quot;. The result should be to drive forward the integration of health and social care in England, a move its many champions sometimes call &quot;the Holy Grail&quot; of health policy; Osborne called it &quot;historic&quot;. It should reduce pressure on the NHS by ensuring that those needing help from either service seamlessly receive either kind of support, at or near their homes, to keep them healthier. That should reduce A&amp;E attendances, admissions to hospital and length of stay, especially among the growing frail, elderly population. Unsustainable rising demand on the NHS means the move is long overdue. Significantly, \u00a33bn of the \u00a33.8bn will come from the DH \u2013 \u00a32bn extra \u2013 and \u00a3800m from theDepartment of Communities and Local Government. But \u00a32bn more of DH funding for social care is also \u00a32bn less for the NHS. Denis Campbell  Department for Education \u2013 1% cut Michael Gove&apos;s Department for Education budget survived largely intact, with the department taking a cut of around 1% in real terms from its combined \u00a357.7bn settlement for 2015-16. George Osborne and the education secretary had pledged that ring-fencing would maintain spending on schools \u2013 the department&apos;s biggest area of expenditure \u2013 with Osborne on Wednesday telling parliament that school spending had been &quot;protected in real terms&quot;. The DfE settlement maintains 15\u00a0hours a week of nursery schooling for all three-year-olds, as well as what the Treasury calls &quot;real-terms protection&quot; of the pupil premium, the lump sum of \u00a3900 paid directly to schools for each pupil qualifying for free school meals. But the details included proposals to adopt a national schools funding formula, the third time in recent years that such a move has been offered. Per-pupil funding currently varies by thousands of pounds as each local authority uses its own formula. It is likely that local authorities will lose discretion over schools funding, and would be restricted to applying a national formula. Alongside the CSR came a new review into school spending efficiency published by the DfE, which it was claimed &quot;shows there is significant scope for many schools to make their money go further&quot;. It also suggested changes to school staffing structures, which followed proposals to end automatic pay progression for teachers and include more flexibility. The CSR also offered funding for 180 new free schools in 2015-16, which would require a sharp increase from the 100-odd free schools approved in each of the last two years. It also said there would be funds for 20 new studio schools and 20 new university technical\u00a0colleges. But the CSR also included ominous language for the academy schools, saying that as the programme matures, &quot;the government will work to drive down the central costs of the programme, delivering savings of around \u00a3150m&quot;. Richard Adams Environment (DEFRA) \u2013 9.6% cut Flood defences, protecting nature and fighting pollution appear to be the casualties after Osborne inflicted the highest level of budget cuts \u2013 almost 10% \u2013 on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), alongside a few other unfortunates \u2013 just as he did in the 2010 spending review. Spending on flood defences &quot;will remain at current levels in cash terms&quot; in 2015-16, say Treasury documents. That&apos;s a real term cut to follow earlier cuts of more than 25% compared to 2010, at a time when the need protect against catastrophic flooding is rising due to climate change. Osborne did, however, promise to &quot;set out plans for a major commitment to new flood defences for the rest of this decade&quot; on Thursday.  Damian Carrington Foreign Office \u2013 8% cut Despite the cuts, plans are proceeding to open more embassies in what the chancellor called the &quot;emerging world&quot; and focus British diplomacy on commercial opportunities in &quot;growing markets&quot; from Shanghai to Abuja. The FCO is expected to make \u00a370m worth of savings by &quot;co-locating&quot; UK missions with Commonwealth and EU countries and continuing an existing programme to reduce UK-based-staff by 10% by 2015. Other savings are likely to be found from programmes dealing with counter-terrorism, human rights and Arab partnerships. Another tried efficiency is the creation of regional &quot;hubs&quot; providing corporate services to a number of British missions in the same region. One bright spot is the announcement of \u00a370m to be shared with UKTI to support global economic growth. &quot;The extra money ... recognises the FCO&apos;s strong track record in this field,&quot; a spokesperson said. &quot;By supporting countries in making political and economic reforms we in turn support the UK&apos;s prosperity.&quot; William Hague was praised by Osborne as &quot;the best foreign secretary in a generation&quot; who had demonstrated how to make pounds &quot;go further.&quot; It had been anticpated that the FCO might get off lighter than other departments due to claims around conflict and peacekeeping. FCO spending is largely on salaries and buildings rather than programmes. Grand premises such as the British embassy in Paris give an impression of diplomats living lavishly at taxpayer&apos;s expense \u2013 an image dismissed as a misleading carictature by the FCO. Its budget was already tight after the last spending review in October 2010. It was cut then from \u00a31.6bn in 2011-12 to \u00a31.36bn in 2014/15.  Ian Black and Neil Johnston Ministry of Justice \u2013 10% cut In percentage terms, this one of the highest levels of cuts, with the MoJ&apos;s budget of \u00a36.8bn in 2014-15 falling to \u00a36.2bn the following year. Most of the savings appear to come from the courts, and the news will dismay lawyers already fighting the latest round of legal aid cuts. That \u00a3220m saving in criminal legal aid is included in Osborne&apos;s figures. But a proposed saving of \u00a3200m in the costs of running the courts \u2013 through partial privatisation, efficiency savings or rises in legal fees \u2013 emerges for the first time. Reform of public sector prisons, also an MoJ responsibility, is, by contrast, expected to lead to a \u00a3180m saving. A Criminal Justice System action plan is due to be announced shortly detailing how the Ministry of Justice, Home Office, police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will work more closely together. Owen Bowcott Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales \u2013 10% cut Alex Salmond&apos;s government has emerged as one of the main beneficiaries of Osborne&apos;s spending review, as the Treasury moved to quell support for Scottish independence. The Scottish government will have the fourth largest budget of any Treasury-funded area or department by 2015, with a total spend of \u00a328.6bn, after the chancellor increased its capital spending by \u00a3400m to \u00a33.3bn, and held its day-to-day spending at near level terms. Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, whose department will see a 10% budget cut by 2015, said the UK government was responding to Salmond&apos;s demands for extra spending by increasing his capital budgets by 12.9% in real terms. This was a &quot;huge spending boost&quot;, he said. In Northern Ireland, \u00a331m that could have been spent on infrastructure or upgrading school buildings has been diverted into counter-terrorism. Osborne allocated the extra cash to the Police Service of Northern Ireland to aid their ongoing fight against the new IRA, Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann. Overall Northern Ireland&apos;s regional budget has emerged relatively unaffected by the cuts as health and education form a large part of public spending in the province. However, its proposed resource budget for 2015/2016 will be cut by 2%. There will be no huge surprise that the Labour-led Welsh government&apos;s budget will be cut by 2% \u2013 the day-to-day revenue will be set at \u00a313.6bn \u2013 nor that the Wales Office will reduce its running costs by 10%. What may disturb the country is Osborne&apos;s concession that many more job losses in the public sector are inevitable and that automatic pay increases for teachers, hospital workers and other public servants will end. Severin Carrell, Henry McDonald and Steven Morris Department for International Develpment - (budget protected) Aid will rise significantly in the next few years as the coalition government meets the longstanding UN aid target of 0.7% of gross national income. According to Treasury documents released with the spending review, total UK aid will rise to \u00a311.7bn in 2014-15 and \u00a312.2bn in the following year. Osborne acknowledged opposition in Tory ranks to the government&apos;s decision to protect the UK&apos;s aid budget but said he refused to balance the books on the backs of the poor. The chancellor said he was proud to support a government that is the first to meet the 0.7% target. Mark Tran Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) \u2013 8% cut Osborne has cut the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) budget by 8% from 2015/16 but insisted the reductions can be met through efficiency savings. There were no details on where the axe would fall but already half of the annual \u00a33.3bn spent by DECC goes on decommissioning old atomic power stations. Meanwhile a series of measures to introduce new longterm &quot;strike prices&quot; for supporting renewable energy support schemes plus tax breaks and planning changes for shale drilling were all promised by the chancellor in his comprehensive spending review. Osborne has predicted his plans will support \u00a3100bn of private sector spending needed to upgrade old infrastructure and help build a lower carbon power system. Terry Macalister Department for Transport \u2013 9% cut The chancellor has taken with one hand but given with the other. The day-to-day budget has been cut by 9%, but Osborne said the capital budget for long-term schemes would rise to \u00a39.5bn - an extra \u00a3600m in 2014-15. He indicated that Transport for London&apos;s grant would take a major hit, and the government would also &quot;bear down on the running costs&quot; of rail administration. However, he also vowed to preserve mayor Boris Johnson&apos;s annual capital budget of \u00a31.8bn until 2020 \u2013 allowing London to continue to invest in tube upgrades and projects such as the Northern Line extension. Cuts in the budget may also affect road maintenance, even as Osborne promised to build more new ones than for 50 years. The chancellor referenced projects mainly already announced: road spending, Crossrail and HS2 \u2013 whose budget is likely to get cross-party approval in a paving bill this afternoon. But he also endorsed looking at Crossrail 2, a new north-south rail line in London. Gwyn Topham Treasury \u2013 10% cut Osborne&apos;s own department will suffer a 10% budget cut in 2015/16 under his latest spending review. Staff numbers at the Treasury are already due to fall from 1,350 in 2010 to 1,000 by 1014/15 by natural attrition. According to figures for April, there are still 1,168 people employed in the Treasury and it is spending \u00a3190,000 a month on consultants. Lopping a further chunk of workers in the run up to the next election could prove tricky, which is why the Treasury says the emphasis is on pay restraint, sharing overheads with other departments and the more efficient use of IT in 2015/16.

Bleak and violent atmosphere and vivid characterisation were the hallmarks of his more than 200 distinctive works over the course of\u00a0four decades. His Kennedy (1983) was\u00a0shown simultaneously on US network television, in the UK and Germany, and achieved the highest recorded viewing figures to that date for\u00a0a televised drama. Goddard&apos;s work included the 13-part drama Fox (1980), Reilly: Ace of Spies (1983) and The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (1982), the early Channel 4 version of the RSC production. The power and visual immediacy of his directorial style owed as much to arthouse film as it did to his abilities as a painter. Indeed, he never forsook painting, which he studied at the Slade in London, or his love of set design, which, after art school, he pursued briefly at the Royal Opera House, contributing to productions by Franco Zeffirelli and Luchino Visconti. He then joined the ABC TV design department and worked most notably on The Avengers (1961-63). He first achieved recognition as a director for his work on five episodes of ABC TV&apos;s Tempo (1965-67), an arts magazine show, which led to his close friendship with Trevor Preston and Mike\u00a0Hodges. Both Preston and Hodges were influential in establishing Euston Films, a company that played an important role in the support of Goddard&apos;s burgeoning career. It enabled Goddard and Preston to create Out (1978), starring Tom Bell as Frank Ross, who prowled through mean\u00a0and rotten London streets. It\u00a0was\u00a0a brilliant combination of arthouse film techniques and pulp-fiction storytelling,\u00a0somewhat reminiscent of the films of Sam Fuller. Again working with Preston, Goddard made Fox, which established him as a major British director. Its opening panoramic sequence, a sweep across London, perhaps a homage to Alfred Hitchcock, was a device Goddard deployed to stunning effect. In 1980, he directed Alan Bleasdale&apos;s The Black Stuff, the BBC Play for Today that turned\u00a0into Boys from the Blackstuff. With Kennedy, filmed entirely on location in the US, starring Martin Sheen as President John F Kennedy, Goddard&apos;s international reputation was secured. It\u00a0was nominated for three Golden Globes in 1984. It won a Bafta in the same year, and Goddard was also presented with the Desmond Davis award. But, at the height of his career, disaster struck.     Jim Goddard\u2019s TV drama Kennedy (1983), above, starred Martin Sheen and achieved record viewing figures    In 1986, he elected to direct Shanghai Surprise, starring Madonna and Sean Penn. Volcanoes of critical abuse erupted on both sides of the Atlantic: one critic dismissed it as &quot;flop suey&quot;. It is perhaps marginally notable for the egregious cameo role as an unnamed nightclub singer by one of the film&apos;s producers, George Harrison. It was nominated for six Golden Raspberry awards, winning one for Madonna as worst actress. It is still frequently held to be one of the most dreadful films ever made. Though his confidence was damaged, Goddard hid the wounds. That they healed may be seen in his direction of Steven Berkoff&apos;s adaptation of Kafka&apos;s Metamorphosis (1987). Paradoxically, Goddard&apos;s name remains unfamiliar to the viewing public and there are few, if any, serious studies of his work. He was a\u00a0remarkably\u00a0modest man, a physically large and powerful presence with the build of a bespectacled wrestler, sometimes wearing his hair in a ponytail\u00a0and with a cockney growl of\u00a0a voice. Yet he was highly sensitive, loyal and compassionate, and inspired lasting friendship among actors, artists\u00a0and\u00a0writers, particularly the composer Richard Hartley and the poet Roger McGough. Goddard was born, raised and educated in Battersea, south London. Alf, his father, was a director of John Bolding &amp; Sons and Thomas Crapper Ltd, sanitary engineers. Goddard often said that if his day job failed he knew as well as anyone how to repair a lavatory. Actors with whom he had special empathy both respected and invariably\u00a0loved him. &quot;Show me what you can do,&quot; he told them. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of their abilities, mannerisms, gifts and faces, matched by an extraordinary facility to\u00a0place regional accents, both British and American. Only once did this desert him. In New York City, in 1983, he took an hour off from filming Kennedy to visit Bloomingdale&apos;s to buy his girlfriend a handbag. Dithering at the counter, he was viewed with sympathy by an elderly\u00a0woman wearing a mackintosh, scarf and dark glasses. &quot;Who,&quot; she asked him, &quot;is the handbag for?&quot; Jim explained. &quot;My advice,&quot; the woman said with a smile, &quot;is that only the most\u00a0expensive will do.&quot; By now the assistants had fallen silent and were watching in astonishment. &quot;Here,&quot; the woman said. &quot;Buy this one.&quot; She walked away. Jim bought the handbag. &quot;Jesus,&quot; said the sales assistant. &quot;Do you know who that was?&quot; Jim blinked. &quot;I mean,&quot; said the assistant, &quot;you don&apos;t know? That was Greta Garbo.&quot; Jim shrugged his massive bulk. &quot;Strange birds,&quot; he said, &quot;often sing to me.&quot; He is survived by a son, George, by his\u00a0former partner the theatrical and film agent Maddie Burdett-Coutts; and his brother, Richard. \u2022 James Dudley Goddard, television and film director, born 2 February 1936; died 17 June 2013", "tags": ["Drama", "Film", "Drama", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-27T14:51:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/30/chinas-war-with-japan-review", "sentences": ["By the end of that month Beijing and Tianjin had fallen, and by the end of the year the Japanese had taken both Shanghai and Nanjing, then the national capital.", "The dismantling of industrial plants in the Shanghai area before the Japanese advance and their evacuation nearly 1,500km up the Yangtze to Chongqing was a triumph of human endeavour."], "title": "China's War With Japan by Rana Mitter \u2013 review", "article": "This gripping political history not only provides a detailed scholarly account of the Sino-Japanese war but also, in a prologue, offers an admirably succinct introduction to the political history of China in the first half of the 20th century. Mitter argues convincingly that the importance of the Sino-Japanese conflict in the second world war is now all too often forgotten. His book will strengthen resistance to the insular tendency to study national histories in isolation from one another. He shows that relations with the wider world were vital to China even when it stood alone against Japan, and that the east Asian conflict shaped both the outcomes of the second world war and the development of the postwar world. The establishment of the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1949 can be partially attributed to the war which fatally weakened Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s nationalists and allowed the communists to build up both military power and popular support. Understandably, western Europeans consider that the second world war started in 1939 and tend to scoff at Russians, who date it from the Nazi invasion of their country in June 1941, or the Americans for whom it began in December 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, as Mitter reminds us, for China the war started even earlier. Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s de facto acceptance of the Japanese occupation of north-east China in 1931 allowed some postponement of hostilities. But within a few years Japanese pressure had become too great. Full-scale war broke out in July 1937. By the end of that month Beijing and Tianjin had fallen, and by the end of the year the Japanese had taken both Shanghai and Nanjing, then the national capital. Having lost many of his best troops, Chiang withdrew to west China where he set up a wartime capital in Chongqing. Meanwhile, his former rival in the nationalist party, Wang Jingwei, established a puppet government in Nanjing. The coastal regions and most of the major cities of China were then held by the Japanese until 1945. The communist party controlled small base areas in mountainous north-west China. From 1937 it worked in a rather uneasy alliance with the nationalist party against the Japanese, always maintaining its own independent military power. Mitter&apos;s admirably researched account covers the complexities of China&apos;s domestic politics and international relations from 1937 to 1945. He discusses better-known horrors such as the Nanjing massacre and the terror bombing of Chongqing, but also conveys the vast scale of Chinese suffering \u2013 between 14 million and 20 million Chinese perished in the eight years of war, and 80-100\u00a0million became refugees. China&apos;s small modern sector, including railways, roads and industrial sites, was largely destroyed. There were food shortages and a terrible famine. Nor did this suffering take place only at the hands of the Japanese. Half a million Chinese peasants died in flooding in 1938, caused by Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s attempt to impede the Japanese advance by breaching the Yellow River dykes. Poorly paid and ill-disciplined conscripts in the Chinese army sometimes behaved badly towards the civilian population, as did Chinese puppet troops under Japanese\u00a0direction. But this is also a story of heroic and determined resistance. Factories, universities, schools, newspapers and refugees moved to the interior to build up &quot;Free China&quot; in conditions of extreme austerity. The dismantling of industrial plants in the Shanghai area before the Japanese advance and their evacuation nearly 1,500km up the Yangtze to Chongqing was a triumph of human endeavour. For four years before the US entered the war, with very little international assistance, Chinese armies stood alone against the might of the Japanese empire. Later, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought about the internationalisation of the conflict, Japanese troops defeated colonial armies in Singapore, Malaya, Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. Yet Chinese resistance did not collapse and the Chinese theatre of war played an important role by tying down large numbers of Japanese troops. In Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Free China and in the areas controlled by the communist party, people had to endure bombing, terrible food shortages and low standards of living, yet they rallied to the national cause. In the occupied areas there was an active underground resistance despite brutal Japanese attempts to suppress it. Mitter&apos;s book is enlivened by extracts from the writing of Chinese people who endured the war and also from many interesting foreigners who reported from wartime China. He uses a wide range of sources with meticulous accuracy. As a New Zealander, however, I have one niggle. James Bertram, one of the first foreigners to interview Mao Zedong, was not an American journalist. Chinese sources describe him as a British correspondent, a confusion that probably arose because New Zealanders at that time travelled on British passports. Bertram was in fact a distinguished New Zealander, born and brought up in Auckland, who ended his career as professor of English in Wellington.

I try hard to resist the climate of fear this government has so effectively crafted, yet I can feel it seeping into the staff room like chlorine gas. The attack on the profession is orchestrated and relentless, and headteachers are the single most important defence against the coalition&apos;s bombardment. What we have to do is relentlessly exhibit behaviours which are supportive and creative, not penal and reductive, especially during this period of industrial action. With immense irony, we need to behave like we&apos;re all in this together. You won&apos;t ever get it all right when it comes to looking after colleagues. All you can do is try your hardest and don&apos;t make the same mistake twice. It&apos;s not you, it&apos;s your designation as headteacher that sometimes makes relationships difficult. Develop your emotional intelligence to understand how you must come across to colleagues. And always think about how you would want to be treated. The best thing for students is a happy, motivated staff. By putting the staff equal first with the students, you are doing the best you can do for the students. Any headteacher who claims she or he always puts students first probably hasn&apos;t thought through in detail exactly what that means. We offer free flu jabs to colleagues. Last year nearly half the staff accepted the offer, and at \u00a310 a jab it&apos;s a bargain. Free tea and coffee facilities in the staff room aren&apos;t too much to ask either. I&apos;m also exploring free health insurance for colleagues. It would cost \u00a315,000 per year and would, I think, be another marginal step towards colleagues feeling like they work in a profession. Do we even extend that to offering newly appointed colleagues a choice of employment packages, where they can choose between different pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits? I feel very strongly that we shouldn&apos;t miss out on the rites of passage moments of our own children just because we are teachers. We have an extraordinary policy whereby colleagues can take a &quot;family day&quot; of paid leave, which allows them to attend family events or attend to family business. Those colleagues without children might have parents to support or have other important domestic issues to deal with. Our family day policy allowed me to attend my youngest son&apos;s year 6 leavers&apos; assembly, a tissue-heavy event. Employ a qualified HR manager. We employ 170 staff; I cannot imagine another organisation of that size operating without one. The countless benefits of such a post easily outweigh the salary costs. Colleagues feel looked after and have immediate expert advice available at all times. Since appointing our HR manager, the staffs&apos; short-term sickness rate has plummeted. Seek out colleagues and tell them how well they have done. We all like praise. I know I need to tell people more often how much I appreciate them, but I keep trying. Do all you can to create the sense of a single staff. Where possible, all policies and practices should apply consistently to teachers and support staff alike. The Whitehall Study in 1965 concluded that: &quot;Men in the lowest grade (messengers, doorkeepers, etc.) had a mortality rate three times higher than that of men in the highest grade (administrators) and that more attention should be paid to the social environments, job design and the consequences of income inequality.&quot; Invest in CPD. In this age of austerity, pour your funding into training your colleagues to be the best they can be. I&apos;ve made this point before. It&apos;s so obvious but it&apos;s all too easy to forget that the only sure way to raise standards is to professionally develop every single member of staff. We have a book club organised by a subject leader. Anything which helps create a sense of community is supportive. Tim Brighouse always emphasises the importance of saying thank you, something you forget at your peril. It&apos;s not until you are a headteacher that you realise the extent to which death impacts upon your colleagues. My very first act as a headteacher was to attend the funeral of a colleague&apos;s partner. No one asks to go to a funeral for fun; you have to grant permission without question. The local authority&apos;s HR manual is barbaric; it states that grandparents do not have an automatic right to attend a grandchild&apos;s funeral. Returning from maternity leave can be traumatic and you have to be prepared to support new mothers as flexibly as you can. It&apos;s difficult to manipulate timetables, but if we are about nurturing young people that should extend to the children of our staff. We have 31 of our 108 teachers on part-time contracts; it drives our timetabler crazy but we have just seen our students gain their best ever results. Set up a wellbeing committee. And don&apos;t micro-manage it. Ours wanted me to hold open door headteacher&apos;s clinics for colleagues, which have since proven popular and beneficial. And send flowers to the mothers of newborn babes and to the proper poorly; it&apos;s the thought that counts, not the cost. Berne&apos;s transactional analysis theory is good for reminding headteachers about how to interact with colleagues; work in adult to adult mode always, the tendency to slip into adult-child mode occurs all too frequently. Encourage moments when staff unite in celebration. We finish early on the final day of the autumn term and our chef James and his team cook us full Christmas dinner. The senior leadership team (SLT) serve the food to colleagues and we pay for the wine. Secret Santa tops the whole thing off; I&apos;ve still got my set of juggling boobs. If they are free on the last period of the day, let colleagues go home if they want to. Trust them to get their work done when they choose; it&apos;s about being treated like professionals. Let your colleagues pursue exciting things to nourish their lives. Our school&apos;s core purpose is to inspire confident learners who will thrive in a changing world. A colleague has written two novels about ancient China; the Shanghai Literature and Publishing Group has chosen to translate his books into Mandarin and promote them in China next year. A few days off for a book tour? Of course; if our core purpose is good enough for our students, it&apos;s good enough for our staff. John Tomsett is a headteacher in York.

It would be like calling the Place Vend\u00f4me a roundabout, or Versailles a country cottage. There is a scale of ambition when Lagerfeld creates for Chanel that is on a quite different level to that operated on by any other designer. (It is a different level, indeed, to the scale Lagerfeld operates on when he designs under his own name, or for Fendi.) And there is no doubt that it pays dividends: the Chanel atelier, where the haute couture dresses are made, has recently expanded to keep up with demand. In London, the brand recently opened a three-storey Bond Street flagship, complete with a giant art installation of dripping pearls. For his latest extravaganza, Lagerfeld recreated the shell of a burnt- or bombed-out theatre. Hidden within the Grand Palais was a full-sized theatre which guests entered to find the plush curtains drawn, the floor banked to allow all a clear view of the stage, the ceiling blasted away to allow sunlight to stream through from the domed glass roof of the Grand Palais. In between the rows of vintage wooden seats \u2013 to which the seat numbers of each guest had been screwed in tiny antiqued brass plaques \u2013 were prettily dishevelled piles of rubble. In the aisles, ushers handed out programmes from wicker ice-cream baskets. The effect of such elaborate, immersive scene-setting is that the audience experience is one of an almost dreamlike intensity. At many catwalk shows, the personality of the fashion designer is something glimpsed only briefly when he or she takes a bow; here, it was all around, heavy in the fake-brick-dust-laden air the audience breathed.     Karl Lagerfeld acknowledges applause at the Chanel show. Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images    The message of the collection, said Lagerfeld, was of the old world meeting the new. So the curtains opened to reveal a backdrop of a futuristic skyline, city landmarks from London, Dubai and Shanghai merging together. The tall, column silhouettes came in skyscraper shades of steel and iron, belts dropped to hip height to create a long straight line. The effect \u2013 especially when the sun caught the rows of tiny sequins, fracturing the light in the way that sunlight catches on glass \u2013 was that the models looked like walking versions of the buildings on the theatrical backdrop. Lagerfeld never deigns to be pinned down to just one era, or even two. The dropped waists and spaghetti straps were slightly 1920s, while the squared-off hats and striped-on makeup had something of the 1980s London Blitz club look about them. But the real point was the notion of one era imagining a future one. So there were elements of Star Trek, and visual references to Fritz Lang&apos;s 1927 silent film classic Metropolis. Lagerfeld, who has a collection of memorabilia of the film, took it as inspiration for a couture show two years ago, and there were echoes of that collection here, in the gunmetal greys, and angular hairstyles. Above all, of course, this was an event firmly rooted in 2013. Two shows were held in order to accommodate not one but two front row special guests. Rihanna held court for the paparazzi at the first show, Kristen Stewart did the honours at the second, without any need for an unseemly battle for celebrity supremacy, and with a corresponding doubling of publicity for all. Everyone&apos;s a winner \u2013 especially, of course, Karl.", "tags": ["Chanel", "Haute couture shows", "Karl Lagerfeld", "Paris fashion week", "Fashion weeks", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-02T14:52:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/04/arsenal-wigan-chelsea", "sentences": ["The 34-year-old, who was a free agent having spent the second half of last season at Juventus following his brief spell in China with Shanghai Shenhua, has signed an initial one-year contract at The Hawthorns and the head coach, Steve Clarke, said: &quot;The more quality players you can bring to the club the better \u2013 and no one can question Nicolas&apos;s quality."], "title": "Gonzalo Higua\u00edn on verge of Arsenal deal as Nicolas Anelka joins WBA", "article": "Gonzalo Higua\u00edn to Arsenal Gonzalo Higua\u00edn is on the verge of signing for Arsenal for \u00a323m.

He looked out at the admiring eyes trained on him on Sunday night (the room was considerably more rammed than it had been eight years previously) before heading to the champions&apos; dinner in a flash London hotel he would probably avoid as if it were a leper colony on any other occasion, and he said thanks. To everybody. To those who doubted him, and those who believed. Bud Collins, as venerable a figure as there is in tennis hackery, stood up to say he&apos;d known Fred Perry and that, year after year at Wimbledon, the old boy, &quot;kept hoping this day would happen \u2026 and I&apos;m glad to report that it did happen&quot;. Murray, who knows Collins but never met Perry, said a simple, &quot;Thank you&quot;. So, what to make of his achievement? Curiously, it transcended the performance. Although Djokovic was generous in defeat, there were too many mistakes, the majority from him, to say that this was a memorable final \u2013 well not for the flickering excellence of the tennis, anyway. It will always be remembered for the intensity and the drama, the oh so nervous conclusion as Murray took and threw away three championship points before forcing a final error from his weary foe. But it established Murray as Djokovic&apos;s peer, no question. He has beaten the world No1 now in two of their three consecutive grand slam finals, in New York last September and on Sunday. In between, the Serb beat him in Melbourne, and retains his ranking this morning, as does Murray, just behind him. They are the two best players in the world. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal contest third and fourth place, although the admirable David Ferrer officially separates them at No4. Those quibbles aside, there is a new age breaking, and Murray and Djokovic are its leaders. It has lately become impossible to confidently pick a winner when they meet, certainly on grass or the hard courts at Flushing Meadows and in Australia. I thought Djokovic would win on Sunday, for the record. Murray would start favourite to beat Federer on those surfaces, having done so last year at the Olympics then in the semi-finals in Melbourne, a defining moment in both their careers. He would not yet claim parity with Nadal on clay. Nobody would. But what Murray did on Sunday was open a door to the future, not just for himself but for those not that far behind him, such as the outrageously talented Pole Jerzy Janowicz, who took a set off him in the semi-finals. Grigor Dimitrov lurks dangerously too, along with those who have been pressing their case in vain for a few years: Ferrer, Tomas Berdych, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and the heroic Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, who almost beat Djokovic in the first semi-final. Murray will take none of this for granted. He will not assume that his second slam title entitles him to walk with any more of a strut. He respects his rivals too much to indulge in that folly. But neither will he deny that this is the next phase of his career, because, although winning one slam title was wonderful in itself, as was taking Olympic gold, securing his second major wipes away any suspicion that victory in New York was a one-off, when the wind blew kindly for him and every stroke clicked. No title won over seven five-set matches in a fortnight is a fluke. It is a war to be won in an era where physical sacrifice is not just likely it is compulsory. As Murray remarked before slipping way to put on his dinner jacket, the three sets he played on Sunday felt like five, because they were tough in nearly every point. The closing game of the match was also the toughest he has ever played. That is the level he has reached. This is a different game these guys play at the end of a grand slam tournament. And the decider is not that much like even the six that go before them en route, and entirely unrelated to three-setters in the relative serenity of Shanghai or Rome. Centre Court at Wimbledon, like all the others, is a testing ground, and, as much as Murray appreciated the support of everyone who was willing him to win \u2013 even the media \u2013 he knew that he was alone, really. He did it himself, with his own talent, in his own way. And let&apos;s hope he gets to do it again, because we do not want to be hanging around another 77 years for the next Andy Murray.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Wimbledon 2013", "Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-07T21:44:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/10/burberry-beats-forecasts-sales-spring-summer", "sentences": ["Fairweather said: &quot;We&apos;ve got a lot of self-help measures and quite a long way to go in China compared to some of our\u00a0peers.&quot; Two shops were opened in Shanghai during the quarter and another flagship store is planned to open in China later this year."], "title": "Burberry beats forecasts after 'standout' spring/summer season", "article": "Strong sales of men&apos;s clothing, large leather bags and coats during dismal spring weather in Europe helped British luxury brand Burberry to a better than expected performance in the first quarter of its financial year. Angela Ahrendts, the chief executive, said: &quot;Spring/summer 2013 was a standout season driven by innovative marketing, cohesive monthly fashion groups and exceptional execution.&quot; The company, which recently signed actress Sienna Miller and her fianc\u00e9 Tom Sturridge to front its advertising campaign, recorded an 18% rise in sales, at constant exchange rates, to \u00a3339m, well ahead of analysts&apos; expectations. When the impact of new store sales were stripped out, sales rose 13%, up from 8% growth in the previous three months. The number of staff making Burberry&apos;s signature raincoat at its British factory in Castleford, West Yorkshire, has been doubled since 2011 amid high demand, with sales of outerwear and large leather goods such as its Blaze and Orchard bags accounting for half the brand&apos;s sales growth. Menswear sales rose 25% over the quarter as the label brought its men&apos;s catwalk show back to London this year. One customer was tennis ace Andy Murray who wore a Burberry suit for his visit to Downing Street after his Wimbledon triumph. Menswear now accounts for nearly a quarter of the company&apos;s sales and Carol Fairweather, chief financial officer, said it was a &quot;significant growth opportunity&quot; for\u00a0the future. Growth was strongest in Asia with Burberry outperforming rivals in the all-important Chinese market by harnessing the power of social media to raise the profile of the brand and by opening more large and glamorous stores. It saw double-digit underlying sales growth in the country over the quarter. Fairweather said: &quot;We&apos;ve got a lot of self-help measures and quite a long way to go in China compared to some of our\u00a0peers.&quot; Two shops were opened in Shanghai during the quarter and another flagship store is planned to open in China later this year. The group has bounced back from a profit warning last September after sales in China had slowed. The company said &quot;soft&quot; trading at its high street stores was offset by strong growth online, partly helped by the use of iPads by shopfloor staff to help customers order goods that were not immediately available. Burberry is also experimenting with allowing shoppers to pick up goods ordered via the internet at flagship stores including outlets in London in Knightsbridge and Regent Street. But Ahrendts, who topped the UK&apos;s pay league with a total package of \u00a316.9m last year, almost \u00a35m more than the next highest paid chief executive, warned that the macroeconomic outlook remained &quot;uncertain&quot; and that first half profits would fall below those of last year, partly because of the cost of bringing Burberry&apos;s fragrance and beauty business back in-house.", "tags": ["Burberry", "Retail industry", "Business", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-10T12:05:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/11/us-markets-record-highs-fed-interest-rate", "sentences": ["The Shanghai composite index reacted to the FOMC&apos;s comments with a 3.2% rise, its strongest gain since January."], "title": "US markets hit record highs with Federal Reserve interest rate pledge", "article": "The US stock market was on course to reach a new peak on Thursday after the Federal Reserve pledged to keep interest rates low until unemployment falls nearer to levels last seen before the banking crash. On a day when more Americans than expected claimed unemployment benefits, the central bank said the economy was underperforming and still needed very low rates to stay on course for recovery. In morning trading in New York the Dow Jones climbed to 15423, above its all-time closing high of 15409, reached in May this year. The S&amp;P 500 also climbed above its closing record to reach 1,668, following in the footsteps of the FTSE 100, which finished the day 33 points higher at 6539. The Fed statement was widely interpreted as a hardening of views in its Washington headquarters against pressure from investors and many rightwing politicians in favour raising interest rates. By a majority vote, the Fed open markets committee (FOMC) said: &quot;To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase programme ends and the economic recovery strengthens.&quot; The statement ended a month of uncertainty following a June question-and-answer session when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke had appeared to indicate that monetary easing was due to be scaled back before the end of the year. Bernanke&apos;s earlier remarks sent the FTSE 100 into freefall and knocked more than 800 points off the index. Reassuring speeches by Fed staff since then stabilised the atmosphere but failed to reverse the stock market trend significantly. Several policymakers on Capitol Hill have voiced fears that the Fed&apos;s quantitative easing (QE) programme, which involves the central bank creating $1tn (\u00a3660bn) a year of new money, will encourage investments in developing nation currencies, property and other risky assets. Critics of the Fed&apos;s strategy, which has kept interest rates at 0.25% for four years and caused purchase of more than $3tn of government bonds, have also argued the economy is strong enough to withstand a return to &quot;normal&quot; interest rates. Concerns that Tokyo&apos;s commitment to pump huge amounts of yen into Japanese economy to beat deflation was unravelling also fuelled panic on the international money markets. But in an apparent co-ordinated move, the Bank of Japan declared on Thursday that its own version of quantitative easing was improving economic growth and would be expanded over the coming months. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said while overseas economies were weaker than expected that would be offset by robust domestic consumer spending and a pickup in capital expenditure. He was confident consumer and business demand will increase, pushing inflation towards its 2% target in roughly two years. The Shanghai composite index reacted to the FOMC&apos;s comments with a 3.2% rise, its strongest gain since January. The index has bounced 12% from its low on June 26, when it hit the lowest point since January 2009. Worries about China&apos;s slowing growth rate have also weighed on global sentiment. Investors in China feared a collapse in demand for Chinese exports should the Fed choke of the US recovery with higher interest rates. Last week the new governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney joined European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi in issuing statements that interest rates would remain low despite the early signs of economic recovery. Carney is due to review the BoE&apos;s strategy for communicating to the markets how and when it intends to raise rates. It is expected he will persuade the nine-member monetary policy committee to adopt a Fed-style formula for issuing forward guidance, but it is not known if the UK will mimic trying a rise in interest rates to a large fall in unemployment. The Fed said it would keep rates low until unemployment fell to 6.5% from its current 7.6% and possibly longer depending on the level of inflation and growth. But Bernanke failed to persuade all FOMC members to sign the statement. Esther George said she was concerned continued high levels of monetary easing &quot;increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations&quot;. She joined hawk James Bullard in voting against the statement.

There is no evidence any payments were made and GSK&apos;s spokesman said the company had looked thoroughly at these allegations and had found nothing.

Figures published this week show that France has retained its status as the world&apos;s top tourist destination, with 83 million foreign visitors in 2012, and Paris remains the most visited city in the world with 33 million tourists a year, half of which were foreign visitors. This, of course, means a massive influx of revenues, estimated by the French government&apos;s tourism arm, DGCIS, at \u00a331bn for 2012. As years go by, with France and its capital doggedly staying at the top of tourism charts, observers cannot refrain from expressing bewilderment. After all, Paris is no more the cultural capital that it was in the 1900s, the 1920s or even just after the war when it briefly regained its intellectual supremacy between 1944 and 1954. It is no more the beacon of civilisation. By comparison, cities like London, Berlin, Shanghai, Buenos Aires and a good other dozen feel more vibrant, modern and exciting. So why is Paris staying at the top? The idea of Paris \u2013 passion, blood, violence, moral ambiguity, heroism, cowardice, dazzling minds, mesmerising motion pictures, architectural audacity, style as ethos \u2013 is one of the most potent there has been in modern history. It is what drives throngs of people to its river banks. Thousands of authors regularly tackle this subject, and books about Paris will probably line bookshelves for decades to come. Paris is powerful, a precipitate of humanity and civilisation. It deals all at once with revolution and the birth of modern democracy. The reality may of course disappoint many elevated visitors \u2013 it&apos;s bound to \u2013 and some Japanese tourists, suffering from the &quot;Paris Syndrome&quot;, must be repatriated every year, shocked as they are at the difference between what they dreamt and what they found. However, the majority of visitors still find here and there traces of what they sought, and keep coming back. In comparison, the experience of London is starkly different. Expectations are not necessarily high, and the city&apos;s image is certainly blurred. There has been too much cacophony in its making to offer one coherent idea to the world. So the reality of London is proportionally much more alluring than the idea we might have conceived of it. Today though, the affluent Chinese bourgeoisie is in love with Paris as with no other city. Due to Britain&apos;s visa restrictions and high costs, they have simply struck off London from their European tour, and chosen Paris instead. France, belonging to the Schengen area, with another 25 European countries, offers easy and relatively cheap visa procedures to the 1.4 million Chinese visitors who flock to Paris. These new visitors have become a regular fixture on the Left Bank. Every day, Parisians crossing the river Seine near Notre Dame can see Chinese brides in full Chantilly lace gowns, being photographed for what will undoubtedly become highly coveted photo albums back home. Parisians may bemoan the never-ending onslaught of tourists with new expressions: &quot;Paris is becoming like Venice! Mass tourism is the new barbarism!&quot;, but the Paris mayor is laughing all the way to the bank.

China-based divisions of international firms have found themselves in the sights of government investigations.\u00a0Last month the National\u00a0Development and Reform Commission announced an investigation into 60 pharmaceutical companies operating in China, including six internationals, among them the US-based Merck, Japan&apos;s Astellas and Britain&apos;s GSK. The moves come as China attempts to shift economic gear from an export-focused economy to one driven by domestic consumption. GSK is alleged to have used a network of more than 700 middlemen and travel agencies in China to bribe doctors and lawyers. The Chinese investigation stretches back to 2007 and involves deals worth 3bn yuan (\u00a3320m). The European food packaging group Tetra Pak became the subject of an anti-trust investigation last Friday. Earlier this month Beijing announced a pricing inquiry into firms that make powdered infant formula. Western food conglomerates Nestl\u00e9, Abbot and Mead Johnson agreed to reduce their formula prices by up to 20% soon after the investigations were announced. Imported formulas can sell in China for up to double the price charged elsewhere, as food safety scandals have left consumers wary of domestic brands. Some analysts suspect that China has selectively targeted foreign companies as a way to benefit domestic brands. &quot;The state is paying the bills for these drugs, so it wants to know what it&apos;s paying for,&quot; an unnamed Chinese industry insider told Reuters. &quot;China wants to bring down the prices of imported medicine through these methods to protect its own companies.&quot; The case highlights the risks for multinational companies of operating in developing markets where corruption is the status quo. China&apos;s healthcare system is notoriously dogged by graft. Public hospitals frequently use drug sales to compensate for insufficient government funding, and doctors supplement their meagre salaries with kickbacks from pharmaceutical firms and patients. Regulators&apos; year-old efforts to rein in malfeasance by assembling drug price databases and checking hospital invoices have barely made a dent. Smaller bribery cases in China are handled by commerce officials, but the GSK investigation is being led by the country&apos;s security ministry, implying that potential punishments could be severe, Jerry Ling, a Shanghai-based partner for law firm Jones Day who specialises in anti-bribery law, told Reuters. China&apos;s pharmaceutical industry is expanding rapidly as rising middle-class consumers are increasingly able to afford prescription drugs. The value of pharmaceutical sales in China surpassed \u00a347bn in 2011, according to official statistics. The country&apos;s total healthcare spending is projected to nearly triple to more than \u00a3660bn by 2020. As drug sales slow in the US and Europe, international firms such as GSK are rushing to gain a foothold in emerging markets.

A throaty cackle accompanies her sunlit comparison, for Halsall senses the start of her renewed life as a competitive swimmer. She flies to Barcelona next Monday in the mood to win a world championship medal and with the knowledge that, whatever happens during her 50 metres freestyle sprint, she will move further from the darker shadows of last year&apos;s Olympic Games. The first anniversary of London 2012 is closing in on Halsall with almost suffocating intensity \u2013 and she needs a deep breath before revealing her scars. &quot;I&apos;m still dealing with it, and I will have to continue dealing with it, because it&apos;s not going to go away, is it?&quot; Halsall admits. &quot;I&apos;ll probably never get over the fact, or get it completely out of my head, that London was something I&apos;d worked hard for over so many years. I didn&apos;t get what I&apos;d been hoping for and it&apos;s taking a long time to come to terms with that.&quot; This is the stark flipside to fuzzy nostalgia for last summer&apos;s Olympic glory. Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah, Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins, are still feted for everything they achieved in London. Yet, as always in sport, the winners&apos; enduring delight is very different to the lingering hurt of those who lost. A year ago, while she secretly nursed an injured shoulder, Halsall appeared to be a realistic contender for gold in the 50m and 100m freestyle, where she was ranked world No2 and 4. She also had an outside chance of picking up a medal in each of her three other events. Halsall avoided discussing a potential five-medal haul and concentrated instead on her desire to win just one gold. The rest of us enjoyed the fact that she could talk wittily about Aristotle and kick-boxing, fashion and philosophy. Halsall seemed on the brink of stardom. The outcome was bruising. She reached four finals but two fifth places were the closest she came to a medal. Her face still clouds at the memory and it is not surprising to hear her speak of the need for help in the bluesy aftermath. &quot;My new coach, James Gibson, has put me in touch with a good psychologist. James has been through it himself because he went to the Athens Olympics in 2004 having won the world championships [in the 50m breaststroke] the year before. He was expected to do really well and it didn&apos;t happen. So he understands and he&apos;s been a godsend in helping me get mentally right. &quot;James worked with Steve Peters [renowned for his sports psychology work with Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and GB&apos;s track cyclists] and Steve came on board. Sarah, a psychologist who works for his programme, has been helping me. She&apos;s now working with the [GB] athletes over the road so I&apos;ve been very lucky that I see her once a week. It was pretty hard at first but it&apos;s given me a different outlook. Sarah asks simple questions about what I want from swimming every day. I say: &apos;I just want to enjoy it.&apos; She&apos;s like: &apos;Well, what&apos;s stopping you?&apos;&quot; Peters believes that negative emotions are represented by an inner &quot;chimp&quot; who, if not controlled, can totally undermine an athlete. How is her chimp on a sleepy afternoon in Loughborough? &quot;He&apos;s in check!&quot; Halsall exclaims. &quot;But he&apos;ll come up with something \u2013 I&apos;m pretty sure of that. It&apos;s all about accepting that it&apos;s OK sometimes to feel down as long as you put things in place to talk it round. I was always more focused on the end result and London defined that more than anything else. Now I&apos;ve realised there&apos;s got to be life after London. I&apos;m only 23 \u2013 it can&apos;t be the be-all and end-all. I never used to enjoy training so much but we&apos;ve only got four people in our group so it&apos;s a small, compact unit and really good fun. That&apos;s important because, if the outcome doesn&apos;t go your way, at least you&apos;ll have enjoyed the process.&quot; This time last year, despite Halsall injuring her shoulder in May and relying on injections to help her return to training, she attempted to remain buoyant. &quot;I thought if I&apos;m going to the Olympics I don&apos;t want any excuses. So I tried to convince myself that everything was fine. It wasn&apos;t. But I can honestly say I&apos;ve never tried as hard as I did in those Olympic races. To make the finals and get close to a medal wasn&apos;t bad. Maybe, one day, I can tell my kids and feel more proud of myself. &quot;The 50m free was my best chance and I gave it my all. But when I touched the wall [in fifth place] it was one of those moments when you just don&apos;t know how you&apos;re going to deal with it. I still had to do the relay and I tried not to get too emotional. But, afterwards, I just broke down.&quot; The dejection intensified and Halsall concedes that &quot;I found it hardest the week after swimming because I stayed to support [her boyfriend] Alastair [Wilson who played his second successive Olympics with the GB hockey team]. Everyone else was excited about the rest of the Olympics and I just felt flat and low. I didn&apos;t know if I wanted to stay but I kept telling myself that in 10 years I&apos;ll be gutted to have missed that experience. So, yeah, it wasn&apos;t fun. But the only way you can get over it is by thinking of what other people go through in real life.&quot; Halsall avoided all the celebrations as well as the parades and parties. It sounds a lonely place amid national euphoria. &quot;I felt bad that I was so low during such a great Games and when so many British athletes were doing well. So I didn&apos;t go to the parade or the garden party. I didn&apos;t think I deserved it.&quot; Even when she and Wilson escaped to California, the shadow of London still hung over her. Yet it&apos;s a sign of Halsall&apos;s contrasting good cheer today that she says: &quot;Alastair had decided to get his tattoo of the Olympic rings so everywhere we went people came up to us and said [slipping into an American accent]: &apos;Oh my God, you went to the Olympics!&apos; We couldn&apos;t get away from it. Alastair got the tattoo on his ribs so we&apos;d be sitting round the pool, chilling out, and Americans always want to chat. &quot;When he told them he played field hockey they&apos;d lose interest. But then he&apos;d point to me and say: &apos;She swam!&apos; They&apos;d get really excited and say [Halsall slips into a wild Californian voice]: &apos;Oh my God! Did you meet Michael Phelps?&apos; Agh! Thanks Alastair! It was a good holiday, being away from all the post-Olympic stuff, but I&apos;d still think about it and get sad. Alastair and the GB men came fourth and, as he is grumpier than me, I thought he&apos;d struggle. But he was more there for me than me for him.&quot; Halsall first met Wilson at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and it was then that she acquired her own tattoo. &quot;Look,&quot; she says pointing to her bare foot, &quot;it&apos;s the British lion. I always said if I won an Olympic medal I&apos;d get the rings as a tattoo. I&apos;m holding out until then!&quot; Her long-term goal has switched to the 2016 Rio Olympics, for Halsall believes she is now in a position to immerse herself in a new way of training and racing. Resurgence occurred during the world short-course championship in Istanbul last December when she won silver in the 50m freestyle behind Aliaksandra Herasimenia \u2013 who finished second in London. Halsall only entered this one event as a way of rekindling her love of swimming. &quot;Funnily enough, I never thought once of retiring. It took me a long while to swim again but when I decided to get back in the pool having the world short-course was a real help. Redemption for the Olympics is four years away so you can&apos;t stay angry all that time. So having one little goal was good and when I got silver I was so happy. Sometimes you have to give yourself a pat on the back.&quot; The world championships in Barcelona provide the next step for Halsall and, having decided to take a break from the blue riband 100m freestyle for a year, she will swim the 50m free and butterfly races. &quot;The first thing you get back is your speed and I&apos;m ranked third in the world now in the 50m free. I&apos;m spreading my workload and I&apos;m excited about the fact that I&apos;m in a position to swim fast. I had my injury problems at London and before the last worlds in Shanghai [in 2011 when she finished fourth in the 100m freestyle] I was coming back from ankle surgery. This is the first year when I&apos;m thinking: &apos;This is worrying! Nothing&apos;s wrong with me!&apos; Hopefully, I won&apos;t fall down the stairs.&quot; Halsall should have a realistic opportunity to win another world championship medal in this more important long-course event. She laughs and makes exaggerated speech marks in the air: &quot;&apos;Could&apos; is the word. In the 50m it comes down to hundredths of a second. But I feel positive and in good shape.&quot; At the UK trials Halsall swam faster than she had done at the Olympics \u2013 recording a time which would have won her silver in London. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she groans. &quot;At Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago I also swam a 50 free and I&apos;d done weights the week before and I didn&apos;t really want to be there as I was racing a bunch of 12-year-olds. But I ended up swimming faster than the Olympics again. That was the first thing I thought when I got out the pool. I need to get it out of my head.&quot; Halsall is optimistic about even competing at the 2020 Olympics. &quot;I&apos;ll only be 30,&quot; she says. &quot;Marleen Veldhuis [the Dutch swimmer who won bronze in the 50m free in London] is 34 and she&apos;s had a baby. After Rio, if I want a family my coach is saying, &apos;Brilliant. You can do a couple of thousand metres every day with your bump and then we&apos;ll guide you through to the 50m in 2020.&apos; So after Rio I might become a 50m powerhouse.&quot; As sunshine stretches across Loughborough in hazy patterns of heat, Halsall turns her Olympic introspection into a more hopeful perspective. &quot;I have changed and I&apos;ve got a better outlook now. I don&apos;t think London 2012 defines me as a person any more. I can obviously swim faster than that, and I will improve a lot. I also no longer take it for granted coming here every day. I&apos;m doing something I love and I&apos;ve embraced that. I&apos;ve also changed in the way I don&apos;t put the same pressures on myself every day. It&apos;s a shame it took something so drastic to learn these lessons. But, when it comes, success will feel all the sweeter.&quot;", "tags": ["Swimming", "Sport", "Fran Halsall"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-15T14:50:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/17/glaxosmithkline-executive-china-travel-ban", "sentences": ["Nechelput, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, lives in Shanghai with his wife and two small children."], "title": "GlaxoSmithKline executive hit by Chinese travel ban", "article": "China is preventing the British finance director of GlaxoSmithKline China from leaving the country as the police investigate claims the British drug giant bribed doctors with cash and sexual favours.

GSK said Nechelput, who has worked for the company for 23 years with stints in Mexico, Singapore and the US, has not been questioned, arrested or detained by the police and is free to continue working and travelling within China. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said diplomats were aware of an incident involving Nechelput and are providing consular assistance. Nechelput, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, lives in Shanghai with his wife and two small children. News of the travel ban comes after Chinese police raised concerns that Mark Reilly, the head of GSK&apos;s Chinese operations, left the country shortly after the bribery investigation was announced on 27 June and has not returned. Asked about Reilly&apos;s decision to leave the country, Gao Feng, the head of China&apos;s fraud unit, said: &quot;You had better ask him yourself why he has left China and is not willing to return so far.&quot; A GSK spokesman said Reilly returned to the UK for long-scheduled meetings. He declined to state if or when Reilly would return to China. Chinese police have detained four senior GSK executives, all Chinese nationals, as part of the investigation that stretches back to 2007 and involves deals worth 3bn yuan (\u00a3320m). GSK is alleged to have played a &quot;godfather&quot; role at the centre of a network of more than 700 intermediaries and travel agencies used to bribe doctors and lawyers with cash and sexual\u00a0favours. Gao claimed the Chinese authorities had evidence that &quot;bribery is a core part&quot; of GSK&apos;s business. &quot;In order to win the favour of GSK, some travel agencies don&apos;t just offer money to their executives but also sexual bribes,&quot; he added. One of the arrested GSK executives appeared to confess to the bribery allegations on Chinese state television.

The money we spent running the business accounted for about 20-30% of the drug price. To have contact with some government departments you need money that you cannot normally expense to the company.&quot; The Chinese Food and Drug Administration indicated that the probe into GSK&apos;s activities would be extended to other drug companies. &quot;We must resolutely punish illegal acts, resolutely close illegal enterprises and firmly recall problematic products,&quot; Wu Zhen, a deputy director of the agency, said.

The leading Chinese investigator has raised questions over why Mark Reilly, the UK head of GSK&apos;s Chinese operations, left China for Britain just before the charges were announced and has not returned. GSK said Reilly is not scheduled to return to China. Chinese police have also detained Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator who has worked with GSK in the past. Humphrey, founder and managing director of risk advisory and investigations firm ChinaWhys, was arrested in Shanghai on 10 July. The ChinaWhys website boasts: &quot;Combining detective skills with our understanding of business operations and financial management, we assist multinationals to prevent, detect or investigate fraud, employee corruption or other white-collar crime to protect their bottom line, reputation and regulatory integrity, as well as providing support for dispute resolution and other business crises.&quot; GSK has a long history of problems in China, and conducts up to 20 internal audits in the country every year. Last year more than a sixth of the 312 staff it sacked worldwide for breaching policy violations were in China. China accounts for just 3% of GSK&apos;s \u00a327bn annual sales. A GSK spokesman said Humphrey was &quot;never a GSK employee&quot;, but refused to say whether or not it had contracted Humphrey, who has previously worked for corporate investigations firm Kroll. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said it was aware of Humphrey&apos;s arrest and said diplomats are providing consular assistance to the family. Hussein said GSK shared the Chinese authorities&apos; desire to &quot;root out corruption wherever it exists&quot; and said the company would &quot;take all necessary actions required as this investigation progresses&quot;. GSK is also regularly briefing the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in London. GSK also promised to radically change its business model and pass on the savings to Chinese consumers by reducing drug prices. One of the arrested GSK executives, Hong Liang, told Chinese state TV last week that bribes paid to doctors and officials pushed up the prices Chinese patients pay for GSK drugs by as much as 30%.

How do smartphones reveal shoppers&apos; movements? &gt;&gt; The Economist  For several months Nordstrom tested a system that tracked the movements of people carrying Wi-Fi-enabled smartphones and other devices as they wandered through 17 of its stores or merely walked by. The firm posted a public notice of the monitoring, prompting a report by a television station in Dallas&amp;nbsp;in May, at which point the retailer pulled the plug. Then the New York Times picked up the story, igniting a privacy debate about passive monitoring via Wi-Fi and other technologies. The system used by Nordstrom and several other firms, provided by Euclid Analytics, can precisely track the movements of individual phones, even though they never actually connect to a Wi-Fi network. How does it work?  Helping robots become more touchy-feely, literally: Paper-thin e-skin responds to touch by lighting up &gt;&gt; Science Daily  A research team led by Ali Javey, UC Berkeley associate professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences, has created the first user-interactive sensor network on flexible plastic. The new electronic skin, or e-skin, responds to touch by instantly lighting up. The more intense the pressure, the brighter the light it emits. &quot;We are not just making devices; we are building systems,&quot; said Javey, who also has an appointment as a faculty scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. &quot;With the interactive e-skin, we have demonstrated an elegant system on plastic that can be wrapped around different objects to enable a new form of human-machine interfacing.&quot; \u2026In addition to giving robots a finer sense of touch, the engineers believe the new e-skin technology could also be used to create things like wallpapers that double as touchscreen displays and dashboard laminates that allow drivers to adjust electronic controls with the wave of a hand. &quot;I could also imagine an e-skin bandage applied to an arm as a health monitor that continuously checks blood pressure and pulse rates,&quot; said study co-lead author Chuan Wang, who conducted the work as a post-doctoral researcher in Javey&apos;s lab at UC Berkeley.

Foreign game console ban to be lifted &gt;&gt; China Daily  Sources from China&apos;s Ministry of Culture confirmed on Thursday that the country is about to allow foreign game console companies to sell products in China if they register in Shanghai&apos;s new free trade zone, but denied lifting a decade-long ban on the video game hardware market in the country anytime soon. Two officials from the ministry confirmed the accuracy of a South China Morning Post report. The story, which was published on Wednesday, quoted sources that if foreign companies agreed to register in the new free trade zone in Shanghai, they would be allowed to promote and sell their products on the Chinese mainland. But before they start selling, foreign gaming companies have to seek approval for specific products from related regulators because the Chinese government wants to make sure the content is not too violent or politically sensitive, the SCMP report said. \u2026Because of fears of the potential harm to the physical and mental development of the young, seven Chinese ministries collectively banned the manufacture, sale and import of game consoles in China in 2000.

The Kills, by Richard House \u2013 a writer and artist who teaches at the University of Birmingham \u2013 could be described as a political thriller but is much more than that, Macfarlane said. Strictly speaking, it is four books in one novel and comes with extra, digitally available film and audio content, although the Booker panel is judging only the words. Three first-time novelists are on this year&apos;s list. NoViolet Bulawayo, who was born in Zimbabwe a year after it became independent and moved to the US at the age of 18, is on it for We Need New Names, which has been described a &quot;visceral and bittersweet&quot; portrayal of life in a Zimbabwean shantytown called Paradise. Eve Harris, published by the small Highlands publisher Sandstone, is longlisted for her yet-to-be-released book The Marrying of Chani Kaufman, set in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community of Hendon in London. And Donal Ryan makes the longlist for The Spinning Heart, a novel told from the points of view of 21 people struggling to get by in a rural Irish village. Ryan is one of three Irish writers on the list, the others being T\u00f3ib\u00edn and Colum McCann, nominated for TransAtlantic, which spans 150 years. The other nominated novels which have yet to be released are: The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton, the youngest writer on the list at 27; The Lowland by Indian-American writer Jhumpa Lahiri; the second world war novel Unexploded by Alison MacLeod; and Almost English by Charlotte Mendelson.

Britain&apos;s biggest drug company has admitted some of its executives have broken the law, but has failed to explain who did it, what they did, when they did it or how long the company has known about it. Here are eight questions that Witty \u2013 who was paid \u00a33.9m last year \u2013 should answer when he speaks to the media on a conference call on Wednesday. What have GSK staff actually done?  The Chinese authorities have accused GSK of acting like a criminal &quot;godfather&quot;, using a network of 700 middlemen and travel agencies to bribe doctors with \u00a3320m cash and sexual favours in return for prescribing GSK drugs. Gao Feng, head of China&apos;s fraud unit, said: &quot;In order to win the favour of GSK, some travel agencies don&apos;t just offer money to their [clients], but also sexual bribes.&quot; GSK has admitted only that &quot;certain senior executives who know our systems well appear to have acted outside of our processes and controls which breaches Chinese law&quot;. But it has refused to explain exactly what they did or how the alleged bribery worked, despite one of the detained executives admitting to the charges on Chinese state television. How long have GSK China executives been allegedly breaking the law? Gao said the police have evidence that bribery has been a &quot;core part&quot; of GSK China&apos;s business model since 2007. GSK said it was &quot;deeply concerned and disappointed&quot; by the allegations, but it has refused to say how long the alleged bribery has been going on. How much did GSK pay out in bribes? Did this inflate the price of GSK&apos;s drugs to patients?  Gao claims GSK spent 3bn yuan (\u00a3320m) on bribes. GSK has refused to comment. One of the arrested executives, Liang Hong, told Chinese state TV that it raised prices Chinese consumers pay for GSK&apos;s drugs by up to 30%. Abbas Hussain, the company&apos;s head of emerging markets who was dispatched to Shanghai to oversee the crisis, has promised it will cut the price of its drugs in China. When did GSK first become aware of these allegations and why did Witty not address accusations of wrongdoing in China earlier? The Chinese authorities announced the charges and arrested the four GSK executives on 15 July \u2013 this was just a week after the company said a four-month internal investigation found &quot;no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business&quot;. That internal investigation was prompted by a whistleblower who wrote to GSK&apos;s board this year alleging that Chinese sales staff had been engaged in the &quot;widespread bribery of doctors to prescribe drugs&quot;. GSK&apos;s operations in China have long been plagued by allegations of bribery and corruption. Last year, GSK sacked 56 employees in China for violating its rules, out of a worldwide total of 312 dismissals. The New York Times claims it has seen an internal audit showing GSK was warned about serious problems in its Chinese research and development facilities as early as November 2011. The report includes a claim that GSK failed to release the results of a drug trial on mice when it was already testing the drug on humans. How far up the corporate food chain did the corruption reach? GSK has refused to say how many of its executives appear to have breached Chinese laws, or name any individuals it suspects. Sources close to the company suggest the allegations are restricted to the four Chinese executives detained by the police. However, the Chinese police are preventing GSK China&apos;s British finance director Steve Nechelput from leaving the country, and want Mark Reilly, the British boss of GSK China, to return to Shanghai. GSK has refused to comment on whether Nechelput or Reilly were involved or aware of the bribery allegations. The company has also refused to say if or when Reilly will return to China. What will Witty do to clean up GSK&apos;s Chinese operations? Hussain said GSK is taking the charges &quot;extremely seriously&quot; and will take &quot;all necessary actions to\u00a0\u2026 root out corruption wherever it exists&quot;, but the company has not so far given any details of specific measures it will take. What information has GSK passed to the Serious Fraud Office?  GSK said it is regularly briefing the SFO, but has not said what information it has passed on. Can Witty assure shareholders that staff in other countries are not bribing doctors?  Last year GSK paid a $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) fine in the US to settle claims that it tricked and bribed doctors into prescribing dangerous antidepressants to children. After the settlement Witty vowed that a company-wide overhaul would prevent a repeat of the scandal.

Witty, who was speaking publicly about the &quot;fraudulent behaviour&quot; for the first time, said: &quot;It appears that certain senior executives in the Chinese business have acted outside of our processes and our controls to both defraud the company and the Chinese healthcare system.&quot; He said the company has &quot;zero tolerance&quot; for the alleged behaviour, which is &quot;totally contrary&quot; to GSK&apos;s values. However, he repeatedly refused to say if he would hand back some of his bonus this year if the company was found to have broken the law in China. He said the level of his bonus \u2013 which totalled \u00a32.7m last year \u2013 is &quot;really a matter for the board&quot;. Witty added that he was &quot;absolutely committed to rooting out corruption and we are absolutely committed to getting to the bottom of what has happened&quot;. The GSK boss, who was paid \u00a33.9m last year, said he was &quot;absolutely willing and ready&quot; to go to China to head up the company&apos;s investigation. However, he is leaving the day-to-day handling of the crisis to Abbas Hussain, GSK&apos;s head of emerging markets, who flew out to China take control of the situation last week. He refused to provide details of how the alleged fraud operated, but said the Chinese policeinvestigation is focused on the four Chinese nationals already detained by the police. He said they appear to have been &quot;potentially defrauding GSK and also at the same time allegedly doing some things in the market which are clearly inappropriate and illegal&quot;. The Chinese investigators have &quot;no allegations&quot; against Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK China, or Steve Nechelput, its finance director in the country, Witty said. He said Reilly, who has left China for the UK, and Nechelput, who the Chinese have banned from leaving the country, have been helping GSK with its investigation. Witty said GSK&apos;s head office in London had no knowledge of the alleged fraudulent activity until the Chinese police raid its offices in Shanghai earlier this month. &quot;As far as headquarters, we had no sense of this issue.&quot; This is despite GSK declaring last month that a four-month internal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption in China found &quot;no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business&quot;. Witty said the previous allegations raised by a whistleblower were &quot;quite different&quot; to the new charges. &quot;They are two completely different sets of issues: we fully investigated the first and of course this has now surfaced in the last couple of weeks,&quot; he said. GSK has already pumped in extra cash into its investigations team in China to help them to get to the bottom of the scandal, Witty said. Despite the apparent serious breach of compliance, Witty said GSK&apos;s controls and audit systems are &quot;extremely robust&quot;, but promised the company would &quot;learn from this and make changes&quot;. It comes a year after Witty promised a company-wide overhaul to prevent a repeat of a scandal in which GSK staff tricked and bribed doctors into prescribing dangerous antidepressants to children in the US. &quot;We&apos;re determined this is never going to happen again,&quot; he said last summer after GSK paid a record $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) fine to settle the claim. GSK has &quot;reached out&quot; to regulators in the UK and the US and has &quot;consulted with the UK government&quot; about the Chinese investigation. He warned that the allegations are likely to have &quot;some impact&quot; on GSK&apos;s future performance in China, but said it was &quot;too early to quantify the extent&quot;. GSK reported a 2% rise in second-quarter sales to \u00a36.6bn. Its drug and vaccine sales in China rose 14% to \u00a3212m. China accounts for just over 3% of the company&apos;s global sales. China indicated that its investigation into the &quot;rampant&quot; bribery scandal will be extended to other foreign and local drug companies. &quot;It will not be surprising if more pharmaceutical companies and hospitals, domestic or international, are to be involved in probes in the days to come,&quot; the Chinese state news agency said yesterday. &quot;Big international firms should shoulder [their] due responsibilities to bid farewell to malpractice, setting a good example and serving as a wake-up call for domestic pharmaceutical companies.&quot;", "tags": ["GlaxoSmithKline", "Pharmaceuticals industry", "Business", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-24T17:42:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/25/glaxosmithkline-china-boss-drugs-mark-reilly", "sentences": ["GSK refused to state if Reilly, who has been head of its Chinese operations since 2009, has been replaced over fears he may be arrested if he returns to Shanghai.", "The spokesman said Reilly will &quot;remain an active member of the senior management team managing the issue [bribery scandal]&quot;, but refused to say whether or not Reilly will ever return to Shanghai.", "GSK last week dispatched Abbas Hussain, the drug maker&apos;s head of emerging markets, to Shanghai to oversee the crisis.", "He was arrested in Shanghai on 10 July."], "title": "GlaxoSmithKline replaces head of Chinese operations", "article": "GlaxoSmithKline has replaced the British head of its Chinese operations, which are at the centre of a \u00a3320m cash and sexual bribery scandal.

Nechelput will continue in his current role. Gisserot, who is leaving for China immediately, will take over the day-to-day management of GSK China while Reilly works exclusively on handling the bribery crisis. GSK last week dispatched Abbas Hussain, the drug maker&apos;s head of emerging markets, to Shanghai to oversee the crisis. Hussain, the brother of former England cricket captain Nasser Hussain, has met Chinese officials to apologise for the scandal, in which GSK executives are accused of acting as the &quot;godfathers&quot; of a criminal scam, bribing doctors with cash and sexual favours worth \u00a3320m via a network of 700 middlemen and travel agencies. Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GSK, said on Wednesday that he was &quot;absolutely willing and ready&quot; to go to China to take charge of the investigation into the &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;deeply disappointing&quot; scandal.

It was reported yesterday that a US citizen arrested in connection with the scandal is the wife and business partner of Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator, who has already been detained by the police. The Reuters news agency said it understands the American is Yu Yingzeng, general manager at ChinaWhys, the corporate intelligence and business risk advisory firm run by Humphrey. He was arrested in Shanghai on 10 July.

Now, the Crystal Palace might be rebuilt in south London as a complex of exhibition spaces, shops and cafes, if a Chinese developer gets his way. Ni Zhaoxing, billionaire owner of Shanghai-based real estate giant ZhongRong Holdings, has expressed his desire to create an exact replica of the 900,000 sq ft glass halls in Crystal Palace park. The majestic structure was originally designed by Joseph Paxton and first erected in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition of 1851, assembled by 5,000 navvies at a cost of \u00a3150,000 (equivalent to \u00a313m today). After the exhibition, it was relocated to Sydenham and redesigned in a much grander beaux arts style, complete with a barrel-vaulted roof and two new transepts \u2013 costing \u00a31.3m (around \u00a397m today) \u2013 before being destroyed by fire in 1936. An Act of Parliament in 1990 specified that any new building erected on the site must be in the spirit of Paxton&apos;s original building, a challenge taken up by a 1996 plan for a 20-screen multiplex cinema on the site by Ian Ritchie architects that was finally accepted after a high court action but ultimately never built. Another plan, a hopeless Paxton pastiche, proposed in 2008 was also unsuccessful. Now the ZhongRong group wishes to follow the Act to the letter. The company has appointed Arup engineers to work on the project, and is in early-stage talks with the Greater London Authority and Bromley Council to develop the idea, with a view to submitting a planning application later this year. The project is thought to provide the necessary financial backing to help Bromley Council revive long-stalled plans to regenerate the park. In 2008, planning permission was granted for a \u00a367m masterplan, drawn up by the now-defunct London Development Agency. The plans outlined the substantial re-landscaping of the park, a new sports centre, and 180 apartments \u2013 controversially proposed for a site of metropolitan open land, to help pay for the overhaul of the park. The scheme, developed by German landscape firm Latz and Partner, also proposed a new grove of trees on the site of the Crystal Palace terraces, laid out in a grid to mimic the former iron columns. The architects were firmly against a revival of the building itself. \u201cThe palace was much bigger in our heads than it ever has been in reality,\u201d said architect Tilman Latz. \u201cThe ghost of Crystal Palace is the strength of the site.\u201d     The new Crystal Palace park, as imagined by Latz and Partner in the 2008 plans, commissioned by the London Development Agency. Photograph: /Latz and Partner    Some locals were not so convinced. Sue Nagle, of the local Triangle Traders association, said planting a \u201ctree palace\u201d on the site was a \u201clost opportunity to capitalise on one of the most famous brand names in the world.\u201d \u201cOnce 350 trees have been planted,\u201d she told the Croydon Guardian\u00a0in 2007 when the masterplan was unveiled, \u201cthe possibility of rebuilding the Crystal Palace in the future will be gone forever.&quot; But now with Ni Zhaoxing&apos;s ambitions in the frame, that unlikely possibility may well return.\u00a0Hearing news of the latest plans, John Payne of the Crystal Palace Community Association was unimpressed. \u201cHere we go again,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt&apos;s about the fifth proposal for a commercial shed on this site. Every time, we have fiercely battled these schemes, and even taken them to the European courts to stop them from happening. We are completely opposed to commercial building on public parkland \u2013 but this time it sounds like there&apos;s some serious money behind the proposal.\u201d The ZhongRong group is no stranger to glass megastructures: the company is responsible for the bulbous 48-storey shaft of Jasper Tower in Shanghai&apos;s Pudong district, along with the neighbouring hulks of Hengrui International Plaza and the International Business City complex. So how might their ambitions translate to the verdant surrounds of Bromley? \u201cIt is a matter of public record that we are committed to improving Crystal Palace Park which remains a jewel, not just in Bromley, but in London\u2019s crown,\u201d said a council spokesperson. \u201cWe are continuing to explore all funding options, including grant funding, that might be available to help secure a long term and viable future.

But anyone predicting that British interests will emerge from the latest China crisis with comparable benefits to those of the opium wars has surely been smoking some pretty muscular gear. To recap: last week, UK pharma firm GlaxoSmithKline admitted that Chinese doctors were bribed by its execs with cash and sexual favours in return for prescribing the company&apos;s drugs. That coincided with rival AstraZeneca having its Shanghai office raided by police \u2013 all of which is jolly inconvenient, as Astra faces the City this week to unveil its interim results. Some investors ponder whether bribery is a wider problem than has yet emerged, and if Chinese authorities are deliberately targeting foreign firms. Maybe, but critics of the UK companies also point to GSK&apos;s $3bn fine last year for bribing US doctors, plus Astra&apos;s indictment in Serbia on similar charges, as well as an admission in its annual report about &quot;investigating indications of inappropriate conduct in certain countries, including China&quot;. All of which leaves one obvious question: when it comes to getting embroiled in bribery probes, is British pharma struggling to kick the habit? Ryanair favourite of business class We all know the criticisms of Ryanair. Passengers taking a flight from the UK to Sweden, for example, have a choice of two airports serving the Scandinavian country&apos;s capital \u2013 each of which is located more than 65 miles outside, er, Stockholm. But while the well-worn barbs seem to split opinion among paying punters, you&apos;ll find that in the City the company is widely loved. Ryanair usually lands far closer to its financial targets than it does to major cities, and we&apos;ll get another chance to test its flightplan when it unveils first-quarter numbers tomorrow. Headwinds do exist \u2013 some costs have soared \u2013 but the figures come on the back of the airline buttering up shareholders and analysts at investor days in London and New York. Ryanair is also offering to sell its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus, worth about \u00a3215m, and there&apos;s the added prospect of share buybacks over the next 18 months. All of which means that the shares are now at record highs. What&apos;s more, trading still seems strong, buoyed by those customers who stay loyal to the airline no matter how badly they are supposedly treated. Stockholm Syndrome, some call it. Borat jokes wear thing for Kazakh miners There was a time when you could barely read a story about Kazakhstan miners listed on the London Stock Exchange without somebody making a crack about Borat. For some reason this really used to irritate the Kazakhs, who \u2013 having seen the City ignore their pleas to drop the constant references to Sacha Baron Cohen&apos;s successor to Ali G \u2013 devised a wily plan to create a new image of their own. It worked too. Such was their success in getting embroiled in recurring rows about corporate governance, corruption and slumping share prices, that linking the firms to their fictional compatriot seemed rather churlish. Still, the best-known of these companies \u2013 Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation \u2013 gets another airing this week. You&apos;ll recall that the founding trio of oligarchs behind the company \u2013 which is simultaneously being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office and the UK Listing Authority \u2013 have been trying to take the business private again. Friday sees the key vote by ENRC&apos;s largest shareholder, its neighbour and rival Kazakhmys, and the betting seems to be that it will effectively wave the deal through \u2013 if only because shareholders nursing 80% losses just want the nightmare to end.

It was on 1 July 1963 that the British government finally admitted what it had known for some time: that Harold Adrian Russell Philby \u2013 &quot;Kim&quot; to friends and family \u2013 was not merely living in the Soviet Union as a defector and a Russian spy, but was actually the fabled &quot;third man&quot;. Later this archetype of treachery would become known, in the words of his biographer, as &quot;the spy who betrayed a generation&quot;. Philby was perhaps the most lethal double agent in the annals of British espionage. As a member of the Cambridge Five spy ring and a secret servant of the Soviet intelligence services, Philby was responsible for the betrayal of countless national secrets as well as the brutal elimination of many British agents. At the same time he was a member of the British establishment, with a distinguished literary father and friendships with prominent English literati, such as Graham Greene, as well as with high-flying US spooks such as James Angleton, later to become head of the CIA. If ever there was a member of the club \u2013 two, as it turned out \u2013 it was Kim Philby, OBE. When his fellow spies Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess fled to the USSR in 1951, Philby&apos;s position seemed badly compromised, but after repeated interrogation he was exonerated. In 1955 foreign secretary Harold Macmillan told the Commons that he had &quot;no reason to conclude that Mr Philby has betrayed the interests of his country, or to identify him with the so-called &apos;third man&apos;, if indeed there was one&quot;. That exoneration has special meaning at this newspaper. From 1955 until his abrupt defection in 1963, Philby was the Observer&apos;s Middle East correspondent, based in Beirut. His editor was also a renowned figure in the 1950s \u2013 David Astor, who commissioned work from George Orwell, Arthur Koestler and Kenneth Tynan. Their stories have become controversially braided together. Astor had fought with undercover units in France. As editor, he employed journalists with connections to British intelligence \u2013 Gavin Young and Mark Frankland \u2013 as well as wartime survivors such as Mark Arnold-Forster and Edward Crankshaw. Out of this, questions about Astor&apos;s role in Philby&apos;s career have lingered like gunsmoke after a shooting. It is sometimes alleged, most recently on Radio 4&apos;s Document series, that Astor was in the pay of the secret service. Jeremy Lewis, who is writing Astor&apos;s biography for Jonathan Cape, told the Observer that Astor&apos;s knowledge of the secret world was both less sensational and more complicated than hitherto understood. His actions reveal him as a man not afraid to take brave decisions on matters of profound democratic principle, as he was to demonstrate famously during the Suez crisis in 1956. Astor was never a spy, says Lewis, but part of a wartime generation in which demarcation lines were blurred. Astor and Philby, both born in 1912, came from established but maverick families. Astor, second son of newspaper proprietor Waldorf Astor, was of Anglo-American stock. Philby was another kind of insider-outsider, the son of St John Philby, a well-known writer, orientalist and convert to Islam. Greene, eight years older than both men, would later become Philby&apos;s friend and champion. Greene wrote of his Edwardian contemporaries: &quot;We were a generation brought up on adventure who had missed the enormous disillusion of the first world war, and so we went looking for adventure.&quot; Philby went to Cambridge and was recruited, with Burgess and Maclean, as a Soviet mole. By contrast, Astor went to Oxford and mixed with anti-Nazi intellectuals such as Adam von Trott zu Solz, who was later executed for his part in the 1944 bomb plot to kill Hitler. In 1939, now flirting with journalism, Astor found the adventure he sought. That summer his cousin, the comedienne Joyce Grenfell, reported with excitement that &quot;David is said to be doing secret service work&quot;. Who knows if that was true? Astor always maintained that he had been turned down by MI6. But then a much bigger adventure turned up, one that would engage everyone&apos;s attention: Hitler invaded Poland. Soon after Neville Chamberlain&apos;s declaration of war in September 1939, MI6 began overtures to anti-Nazis in the German army in order to destroy the Nazis from within. By November, a secret rendezvous had been arranged to put a plot into action. &quot;I have a hunch&quot;, said Chamberlain, when told of the operation, &quot;that the war will be over by the spring.&quot; Two British spies headed for Venlo on the Dutch-German border for a high-stakes meeting with the leader of the German opposition, a certain Hauptmann Schammel. But the operation was really being run by Himmler \u2013 the SS had staked out the rendezvous, and &quot;Schammel&quot; was actually a member of the Reich security service. The two hapless British agents were surrounded by SS plainclothes men and hustled off to Berlin for a Gestapo interrogation. Astor had hovered on the fringes of the Venlo debacle. As a close friend of Adam von Trott zu Solz, he was familiar with the German opposition. In the autumn of 1939, he even went to Holland, posing as a Times reporter, and met the two future Venlo agents, but was not impressed. The &quot;Venlo Incident&quot; was a humiliation for British intelligence. Churchill had followed the incident with dismay. Once Churchill assumed power in 1940, he put secret operations in occupied Europe on a war footing. The recruitment of thrill-seeking literati such as Ian Fleming, Dennis Wheatley, Malcolm Muggeridge and Greene placed covert operations at the psychological heart of the war effort, inspired by Churchill&apos;s love of adventure. This corps d&apos;elite was a group of writers and academics, notably Hugh Trevor-Roper, recruited from Oxbridge and the BBC. Some of them became intimately connected through shared girlfriends and mistresses \u2013 women such as Elizabeth Bowen and Sonia Brownell, later Orwell&apos;s second wife. Lewis says: &quot;During the war, through his friendship with Orwell and his work at the Observer, Astor was at the fulcrum of three immensely talented circles which all played a vital role in the war effort on the home front. There were social democrats like Richard Crossman and Michael Foot; refugees like Isaac Deutscher, Sebastian Haffner and EF (Fritz) Schumacher; Orwell and Arthur Koestler, both of whom were to become, in effect, keen Cold War warriors after 1945.&quot; Astor and his circle, meeting at the Shanghai club in Soho, were part of the non-communist left, progressive intellectuals (William Beveridge and Stafford Cripps) planning for a postwar New Jerusalem. The process by which the life-and-death struggle with the Third Reich became the cold war with the Soviet Union was glacially slow. While the Foreign Office played along with Stalin and the Soviet Union, Philby established himself deep in Whitehall. He worked for the Special Operations Executive, had links with Bletchley Park, the codebreaking headquarters, and ended the war as deputy head of Section V \u2013 counter-intelligence. Meanwhile, prewar habits of intelligence-gathering persisted. An extraordinary amount of British espionage business was still conducted in London&apos;s clubland. Here the spirit of John Buchan&apos;s Richard Hannay morphed into Ian Fleming&apos;s James Bond and, ultimately, John le Carr\u00e9&apos;s George Smiley. In the world of nods and winks in the clubs of Whitehall and St James&apos;s, the line between journalism and the defence of the realm was indistinct. Being familiar with members of the security services was not the same as being a spy. But it could mean some strange meetings. In 1952, after Burgess and Maclean had defected, Philby was left fighting to protect his position within the establishment. He applied to work at the Observer and met the news editor, Fred Tomlinson, Astor and the critic Philip Toynbee. Tomlinson, writing to a colleague, noted Philby&apos;s work for the Times and his engaging manner \u2013 &quot;we all liked him&quot; \u2013 but turned him down. Lewis adds: &quot;Although David Astor admitted to applying to join MI6 shortly before the outbreak of world war two, I&apos;ve come across no evidence whatsoever in his archives that he was ever a secret service operative, or that he had any kind of formal relationship with MI6/SIS. &quot;As a newspaper editor, he was familiar with that world, including Kim Philby. I&apos;ve no doubt some Observer journalists retained wartime connections with the secret services. But there&apos;s nothing to suggest Astor was a covert sympathiser, let alone an active agent.&quot; When the cold war turned arctic in the early 1960s, a top interrogator, Nicholas Elliott, was sent to Beirut to confront Philby again .

It was a good list for the big publishing houses, which have in previous years been eclipsed by smaller independent rivals. Unexploded by Alison MacLeod \u2013 published by Penguin imprint Hamish Hamilton and set in 1940s Brighton, when a German invasion appeared imminent \u2013 is an early favourite, even before its publication in September. The independents have not done badly, however, with Granta, Bloomsbury and tiny Highland publisher Sandstone Press also on the list. But this &quot;wonderfully various&quot; list comes as British publishing \u2013 all Man Booker prize entrants must be published in the UK \u2013 becomes a little less diverse, following the mega-merger, completed earlier this month, between Penguin and Random House. The giant company, known as Penguin Random House, will control 25% of the world book business. With a back catalogue ranging from 19th-century master stylist Henry James to kinky novelist EL\u00a0James, and nearly 250 separate imprints, Penguin Random House will publish 5,000 new titles a year. The group unites two of the most illustrious names in the book industry. Penguin dates from 1935, when publisher Allen Lane, after being unable to find anything to read at Exeter station, decided to start selling paperback editions of Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie for the price of a packet of cigarettes. Random House was founded by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer in New York in 1924, to bring the classics to a mass audience. Both companies won legendary victories against censorship: Penguin battled in the courts for Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover, while in the US, Random House defended James Joyce&apos;s Ulysses against charges of indecency \u2013 the American judge helpfully listed the pages containing &quot;obscene&quot; content, much to the amusement of the author. The merger of these big names into a powerhouse with \u00a32.6bn in sales a year was one of the biggest events in the publishing world since Jeff Bezos started selling books over the internet from his garage back in 1994. And it is Amazon, with its formidable pricing power, that is the gorilla in the book industry jungle. Last week the giant online retailer reported sales totalling $15.7bn in three months \u2013 of which $4.4bn came from books, music and DVDs. Its publishing division recently announced that German novelist Oliver P\u00f6tzsch had become its first million-sales author, in print and e-books, for The Hangman&apos;s Daughter and its sequels, about a 17th century Bavarian executioner-turned-detective. &quot;When mergers like this happen, it is a response to the competitive situation they find themselves in,&quot; says Richard Mollet, chief executive of the Publishers Association. The new company, led by Random House&apos;s Markus Dohle, is 53%-owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, while Penguin&apos;s owner, Pearson, takes 47%. Its headquarters will be in New York, and key British staff have been moved out of the frontline. John Makinson, head of Penguin Group since 2002, has moved upstairs to be chairman of the new group. Dame Gail Rebuck, one of the most respected figures in UK publishing, is stepping back from the day-to-day running of Random House UK to another chairmanship job. As the Booker longlist titles get piled up in shop windows and on special-offer tables, these changes are unlikely to catch most readers&apos; attention. But insiders worry the tie-up will be bad for authors, depressing their advances and reducing the care and attention they get from their publisher. &quot;It is bad news for writers,&quot; says Andrew Franklin, founder and managing director of independent British publisher Profile Books. &quot;How do you publish 15,000 books well every year? How do you make each distinctive and important each year and make the author feel their book really matters? I have no idea and I think they have no idea either.&quot; The Society of Authors is worried writers with modest sales will fall down the priority list. &quot;As publishers get bigger, it may not be economical for them to support authors [selling] 2,000 or 3,000 books, or promote the back catalogue,&quot; says Nicola Solomon, the society&apos;s chief executive. &quot;My guess is they are much more likely to put that money into something that might make a super-profit for them, something new or sexy that might be a runaway success.&quot; And although Penguin Random House insists it will continue to compete in auctions for authors&apos; work, not everyone is convinced. For serious non-fiction works, when Penguin and Random House&apos;s Bodley Head are often the only two in the auction, competition will cease, says literary agent Clare Alexander. &quot;They will continue to compete with each other unless they are the only two in the auction, but often for serious non-fiction, they are the only two in the auction. It will definitely diminish advances in the UK.&quot; Penguin Random House dismissed these concerns: &quot;In the UK and worldwide, Penguin Random House will encourage healthy competition between its imprints.&quot; The merger has also heightened concerns about an exodus of talented women at the top of publishing. Rebuck&apos;s move away from control of Random House comes after the shock departure of Victoria Barnsley, chief executive of Rupert Murdoch&apos;s HarperCollins for 13 years. &quot;There is a default to the male mode,&quot; says Alexander. &quot;Publishing is full of women, and it will continue to be full of women, but not at the executive level, and that worries me considerably. It is not a personal thing about who is coming in; it is a general thing about an industry that has managed very well under these women, and now they are gone.&quot; Amazon&apos;s influence may be unsettling the traditional players, but not everyone thinks that is an insurmountable problem. One industry insider points out that Amazon is only the latest bogeyman, following worries about supermarkets \u2013 and, in an earlier age, WH Smith \u2013 driving down prices. &quot;No one is really in publishing to make big margins,&quot; the insider says, &quot;which is why you don&apos;t have too many venture capitalists. But it is a business that is stable and growing very nicely.&quot; Unlike CDs and printed newspapers, the public&apos;s appetite for fiction shows no sign of waning. Paperback fiction sales rose 3% in 2012, reaching \u00a3502m, while digital sales have skyrocketed, up 66% in 2012 on the previous year, to \u00a3411m. &quot;It is a great time to be a very small and dynamic independent publisher,&quot; says Jamie Byng, managing director of Canongate, which had a Booker prize- winning hit with Life of Pi. He thinks the indies have nothing to fear from the Penguin Random House merger, arguing that it will expand the market for books and help the industry emulate the success of Facebook and Apple in reaching consumers: &quot;[Penguin Random House] are going to combine a lot of their thinking and clout to bring about innovations \u2013 new ways of reaching people, more use of digital communications to connect authors with their readers. The industry is in an incredible state of flux. No one has a clue what it will look like in 10 years&apos; time.&quot; Predicting the shape of the industry is almost as tricky as calling who will walk away with this year&apos;s Man Booker Prize \u2013 winning a \u00a350,000 prize and an assured sales bonanza. Jim Crace is the bookies&apos; early favourite for Harvest (Picador), a tale of peasants forced off the land in the late-medieval enclosures; while Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn&apos;s The Testament of Mary (Viking) is also a frontrunner. Any book on the longlist can expect a lift in sales of at least 10,000, according to Byng, although the real boom in sales does not kick in until later on. &quot;It doesn&apos;t really get interesting until the shortlist.&quot;", "tags": ["Publishing", "Penguin", "Random House", "Pearson", "Pearson", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-27T23:05:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/29/crystal-palace-replica-jingoistic-gove-london", "sentences": ["There&apos;s a certain historical symmetry that the proposal to build a replica of the palace comes from the Shanghai-based developer ZhongRong Holdings; and not only as a form of lucrative post-imperial revenge, in an era when Chinese buy-to-let investors are directly appealed to by the likes of Newham council.", "The likely outcome will be a Virgin Trains ashlar arch, a futurist tower in front of Costa and Wagamama, an iron and glass palace owned by a Shanghai billionaire."], "title": "Plans to recreate the Crystal Palace are as jingoistic as a Gove history lesson | Owen Hatherley", "article": "In Crystal Palace park grandiose steps and monuments currently lead to an empty space. This patch of grass was the second location of the palace, re-erected in suburban Sydenham in 1854, its prefabricated iron and glass modules rearranged from the original in Hyde Park. The Crystal Palace, designed by Joseph Paxton in 1851, was intended as an immense symbol of the modernity and technological scope of the British empire, its glazed transepts filled with a Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, where the products of advanced technology \u2013 daguerreotypes, displays of steel-making \u2013 sat alongside displays of imperial plunder. There&apos;s a certain historical symmetry that the proposal to build a replica of the palace comes from the Shanghai-based developer ZhongRong Holdings; and not only as a form of lucrative post-imperial revenge, in an era when Chinese buy-to-let investors are directly appealed to by the likes of Newham council. Chinese cities have recently become notorious for their sheer degree of copying and reproduction, with hundreds of replicas of famous historic buildings and even of recent ones \u2013 such as the copy of Zaha Hadid&apos;s Guangzhou Opera House, under construction almost immediately after the original was completed. But in London, the Crystal Palace replica is only the most vast \u2013 and probably the least likely \u2013 of a smaller but still significant series of proposed reconstructions. This says something increasingly unnerving about the city. The founders of architectural preservation loathed the palace \u2013 the combination of skill-free mechanical labour in erecting its prefabricated parts and the machine-made ornamental tapestries and knick-knacks on display so alarmed architectural opinion that it probably helped spark the Arts and Crafts movement, with its often socialistic, workerist conception of expressive craftsmanship. Early preservationists such as John Ruskin and William Morris also hated reconstruction, which they considered fakery, but that won&apos;t stop their successors from supporting a replica palace. It may share a future tourist itinerary with the Euston Arch, where the perfectly decent 1960s terminus building will be replaced with a retail hangar fronted by a reconstructed Doric propylaeum. The campaign to rebuild the arch, demolished in 1962 \u2013 needlessly and callously \u2013 has even managed to fish out of the River Lea a few fragments of the original ashlar. Then, perhaps, the tourist will be able to travel south of the river to a reconstructed Skylon, the steel tower erected as part of the 1851 Great Exhibition&apos;s self-conscious successor, the 1951 Festival of Britain and demolished as &quot;three-dimensional socialist propaganda&quot; by Sir Winston Churchill less than a year later. What do the Crystal Palace, the Euston Arch and the Skylon have in common? They all share a certain combination of modernity and imperialism \u2013 the longing for a &quot;workshop of the world&quot; in a country dominated by a wilfully unproductive rentier capitalism. The spirit of empire on the right; the spirit of 1945 on the left, both hark back towards a previous era of optimism, production and nationalism, something that, in the case of the right, by no means precludes selling off any given public space or public utility to any given investor. It&apos;s the urban equivalent of the freakish Keep Calm and Carry On cult, that never actually produced wartime poster that has become probably the best emblem for the dissembling pageantry and PR of 21st century austerity; a fitting stage for the currently incessant royal pageantry and empty-headed commemoration and an appropriate faux-historic series of locations for Michael Gove&apos;s jingo history classes. All three reconstructions involve willing a return of an urban, industrial era of great entrepreneurs and industrialists, in a country dominated by rent-seeking and suburbanism, as if they can rebuild it back into existence. The likely outcome will be a Virgin Trains ashlar arch, a futurist tower in front of Costa and Wagamama, an iron and glass palace owned by a Shanghai billionaire. What will it have to do with the actual empty public space in south London that it will be filling? It will, chances are, enclose a chunk of park and turn it into a private, paying attraction. It will represent an era that preferred post-imperial melancholia to the much greater challenge of imagining what building for today&apos;s London, and today&apos;s Londoners, might look like.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "London", "UK news", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2013-07-29T05:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-cities-urban-environment-future", "sentences": ["Autonomy Every city is different, with its own history, culture and skill bases; take Shanghai, Manila, and London for example."], "title": "Sustainable cities: creating urban environments of the future", "article": "Cities are the future \u2013 a statement that is difficult to argue with if predictions that 7 out of 10 people will be living in urban areas by 2050 comes true. What changes are needed in the organisation and management of resource use to make cities better places to live and what role does business have in this? Autonomy Every city is different, with its own history, culture and skill bases; take Shanghai, Manila, and London for example. To respond to those differences, cities need significant levels of autonomy to allow them to build on their uniqueness, play to their strengths and respond to the challenges ahead (extreme weather, growing and ageing populations and resource crunches to name a few). In the UK this power has been gradually stripped away from city authorities through the decades as the state has become more centralised. Having a mayor in London has arguably strengthened the city&apos;s voice and allowed an urban vision to develop, but even London has limited autonomy and other cities have even less. Michael Heseltine, the former UK Conservative deputy prime minister, sees more autonomous cities as leading to economic growth. But as the EU has highlighted, there are currently vast differences in the control that European cities have over revenue raising and spending. Granting cities more autonomy isn&apos;t controversial, however the question of who holds the levers of power and how this is used is. Should city authorities be able to introduce rent controls and land taxes? Should they be able to make procurement decisions, not hampered by national, EU or global rules? Should they be able to introduce minimum wages for their area? For big business, a more complex regulatory environment may reduce efficiency but it could also allow smaller local companies to flourish. Some firms have developed good relationships with their local cities and recognise the need to adapt to their local environment. Will that become the norm? Participation The question of who holds power at the city level is crucial. Heseltine suggests businesses need to be in the driving seat, setting the rules. But if we want to improve the wellbeing of our cities, autonomy cannot just exist for the benefit of the powerful few. One good solution is participatory decision-making and participatory budgeting \u2013 involving affected communities in making the decisions themselves, and giving a voice to the poorest and most marginalised in society, not just the well-educated and articulate middle classes. In Porto Alegre, Brazil, involving residents in determining local budgets has resulted in increased primary health care in poor areas, more schools and nursery schools and provision of water and waste-water systems to most households. For participation to work, we need an education system that not only produces students with good qualifications in maths, English and science, but that more importantly develops the power of critical thought. As the educational philosopher Paolo\u00a0Freire said, education should become &quot;the practice of freedom, the means by which men and women deal critically and creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world&quot; rather than a tool for conformity. Sharing  Is our vision of the future really one where every household has cupboards full of stuff that is barely used, where people hide in gated communities, and move around in private metal boxes? This is a future of estrangement, resource waste and dysfunction. Innovative businesses are already tapping into this idea, with some examples showcased on www.shareable.net. We need business models that help build communities, allow local people to manage assets from energy to parks to bikes and that utilise the digital revolution to bring people together, not to segment them. And more traditional businesses can get in on the act as well. Water is a basic necessity. Beer isn&apos;t (arguably) so the brewer, SAB Miller, has rightfully recognised the need to work with communities to ensure that there is enough water for basic needs, as well as enough for beer production. This sharing approach is critical to future development, and obviously for SAB Miller critical to its future licence to operate. This approach needs to be the norm for businesses, not just a best case example at sustainable development conferences. Transformation These three ideas alone could be transformational for the future of our cities. They certainly envision a very different role for business. But does any business really think a tweaked version of the status quo is tenable? As cities get bigger, it is inevitable that they demand more power. The digitally-enabled public will demand their voice is heard \u2013 witness Turkey and Brazil. Sustainable businesses will embrace this change \u2013 some are already doing so.

Fashionable is just another word for modern, really. Fashion deliberately makes modernity tricky to decipher by including a few random elements \u2013 leather fringing, or 1930s Shanghai, or ankle-strap shoes \u2013 that are there to make the whole process more exclusive. A bit like modern passwords making you include a\u00a0numeral and a capital letter. It\u00a0keeps out the hoi polloi. One of the key fashion passwords, if you will, of the past few years has been to mix up the formality levels of the top and bottom of your outfit. So instead of wearing a tailored jacket with matching trousers, you wear a blazer with jeans, which signals smart without looking square. I mean, duh. But\u00a0in 2013 there&apos;s a new twist on this smart-with-casual equation: it has been turned upside down. Whereas previously the formula centred around a fancy top half and a\u00a0dressed-down bottom half ( for\u00a0a\u00a0festival look, that might be a\u00a0pretty Isabel Marant-esque top with cut-off shorts), the newest take on this is a dressed-down top half with a\u00a0sharper bottom half. The trend started earlier this year, with the emergence of the sweatshirt-plus-pencil-skirt as A Look. This is the 2013 version of the silk blouse with jeans: a\u00a0classic smart-casual combination, with the ingredients upended. As the year has gone on, other trends have fallen by the wayside after their six-week stint in high street windows, but this one has gathered strength. A statement skirt with a casual top is a simple, modern look. For summer, it can be a Dior-esque full skirt with a good-quality cotton T-shirt; for autumn, it might well be a simple polo-neck sweater with, say, a kilt. (Yes, a kilt. More on this another day.) To keep up, we need to rethink the quick-hit shopping trip. Most of us, when looking for a fast fashion update, instinctively look for a dress, or a top we can wear with jeans or a\u00a0jacket. But this is a route to looking old-fashioned, not fashionable. Instead, zero in on a statement skirt. The world keeps turning, and right now it&apos;s upside down. \u2022 Jess wears prom skirt, \u00a348, topshop.com. T-shirt, \u00a316, americanapparel.net. Shoes, \u00a365, office.co.uk.

That seemed to be the case made by Japan&apos;s finance minister, Taro Aso, earlier this week, when he suggested that his country might learn from the Nazis&apos; technique of undermining the Weimar constitution by stealth, if it wants to change the American-designed postwar constitution that prevents it rearming. On Thursday, Aso withdrew his remarks. But they were not an isolated incident. Japan and China have been in a war of words for over a year, punctuated by alarming sorties by warships and fighter jets, over the question of sovereignty over the barren islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo calls Senkaku and Beijing the Diaoyu. Both countries are in the latest stage of a crisis that began in 1937 and has never truly been resolved: Japan&apos;s invasion of China, and the unfinished business of a peace settlement in 1945 that failed to create a lasting framework for stability. The facts of that war bear remembering. On 7 July, 1937, fighting broke out between local Chinese troops and a Japanese garrison near the Marco Polo bridge, on the outskirts of Beijing. Within weeks, the fighting had expanded across China&apos;s territory. The Japanese captured China&apos;s major cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and notoriously Nanjing, where a massacre of thousands of Chinese civilians took place. Some 14 million or more Chinese were killed during the war, and some 80 million became refugees. Yet, despite the huge toll that the conflict cost the country, China refused to surrender, resisting until the defeat of Japan in 1945. Nearly 70 years later, neither country has fully come to terms with the war and what it means for its own politics both domestic and international. In China, the war still sits centrally in the national culture. In Nanjing, a sombre museum-cum-shrine recalls the horror of the massacre that devastated the captured capital city in December 1937. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands of videogamers, in multiplayer online games, compete to defeat Japanese armies recreated in pixels. But the view of the war in China is still heavily distorted. During the cold war, under Mao Zedong&apos;s rule, it was officially &quot;forgotten&quot; that much of the resistance, including the bulk of the fighting, was carried out by the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek, rather than by the Communists. For example, in the desperate battle for Shanghai in autumn 1937, some 187,000 troops were killed \u2013 all serving in the Nationalist armies. Yet after Mao&apos;s victory in 1949, Chiang and his rump regime fled to Taiwan, and it became impossible on the mainland to suggest that they had any role in winning the war. This situation began to change as the cold war thawed. Reunification with Taiwan was on the agenda, and it became a little easier to speak positively of some of the wartime efforts of the former regime. But the limits remain strict to this day. Official institutions in China still speak of the leading role of the Chinese Communist party in fighting the invaders. Wartime collaboration with the Japanese, which was widespread, is rarely discussed. In Chinese public culture, the war against Japan has become a melodrama, in which good and bad are defined in stark and often cartoon-like terms. This has encouraged a zero-sum view of Sino-Japanese relations that has raised tensions in the region. Yet the Japanese political sphere has to take its share of responsibility. In recent years, a particular strain of thought has gradually received greater respectability in some quarters: the idea that Japan&apos;s war in Asia was not an invasion but a &quot;liberation&quot; from the yoke of white imperialism. This view has become embedded in Japanese popular culture through the enormously popular graphic novels of Yoshinori Kobayashi. His 1998 novel Senso-ron (On War) portrayed the Japanese army as liberators of their Asian brethren; it sold some 650,000 copies. Of course, Japan is a democracy with a lively public sphere, and there are many who condemn the view that Japan&apos;s wartime behaviour can be whitewashed, from leftist teachers&apos; unions to members of the governing LDP party, who see the new nationalism as an embarrassing nostalgia for a dark part of Japan&apos;s history that hurts the country&apos;s international image. But the growth of Japanese revisionism on the wartime experience, if not checked, could inflame tensions further between China and Japan. Having spent a decade researching the origins and effects of that earlier war between China and Japan, I&apos;m certain that the confrontation between the two countries today is not yet as dangerous as that of 1937. But the similarities are real and too close for comfort. There is no effective multilateral organisation in Asia able to resolve disputes such as those over the islands in the East China Sea. And the crisis of 1937 was triggered by two countries with strong and contrasting ideological visions that exploded into war as the result of a small, almost trivial incident. Today&apos;s politicians need to be extremely careful not to make the same mistakes. Comments like those of foreign minister, Taro Aso, are profoundly unhelpful in the creation of a more stable Asia-Pacific.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "Second world war"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-02T15:59:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/05/fonterra-botulism-import-ban", "sentences": ["Other affected companies in China are Shanghai Tangjiu and Dumex Baby Food."], "title": "Fonterra botulism scare leads to import ban in China, Vietnam and Russia", "article": "     China, Vietnam and Russia have banned the import of milk powder and whey protein from the New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra after a botulism scare. The company warned on Saturday that a batch of whey protein produced last year contained bacteria that could lead to the illness. The ingredient was exported to factories in China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia. Chinese shops cleared hundreds of tonnes of food products from their shelves and officials in Wellington said Beijing had banned imports of all Fonterra milk powder and whey protein. They added that Moscow had banned all New Zealand dairy goods despite not receiving any of the affected products. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said botulism was a rare but serious paralytic illness which could be fatal. Symptoms included double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth and muscle weakness. The case is a blow to New Zealand, which has thrived on a reputation for high-quality food products. Dairy products account for about a quarter of its exports and the industry is worth \u00a36.1bn. Fonterra is the world&apos;s fourth-largest dairy company and this year announced plans to build a new plant in China. The scare is likely to cause particular concern in China, where consumers have increasingly turned to foreign products after numerous food scandals involving domestic goods. Imported dairy goods are particularly popular because of the 2008 milk powder case, in which at least six infants died and 300,000 were made ill by melamine-tainted formula made by Sanlu. Chinese customs data cited by state media said milk powder imports from New Zealand jumped 34.3% in the first half of this year, compared with the same period of 2012, to reach 371,000 tonnes. The country is New Zealand&apos;s biggest trading partner. Fonterra&apos;s chief executive, Theo Spierings, told a press conference in Beijing on Monday that products containing the whey protein sold by Coca-Cola and the Chinese firm Wahaha \u2013 one of the country&apos;s biggest food producers \u2013 were safe. &quot;We regret the distress and anxiety which this issue could have caused,&quot; Spierings said. &quot;Parents have the right to know that infant nutrition and other products are safe.&quot; Fonterra said it had received no reports of any ill health linked to consumption of the affected products. Coca-Cola said it had used 25kg (55lb) of the tainted protein in one batch of a Minute Maid drink that was shipped to three Chinese provinces, but that its own experts and external authorities had confirmed the products were safe. &quot;This is due to the ultra-high-temperature manufacturing process we use, and also the low acidity, which sanitises the final product,&quot; it said. Wahaha was recalling affected products despite finding no signs of contamination in them, said the group&apos;s chairman, Zong Qinghou. Other affected companies in China are Shanghai Tangjiu and Dumex Baby Food. Dumex had already sold more than 400 tonnes of milk powder products made with the affected whey protein, according to state media, citing Chinese safety authorities. The New Zealand company Nutricia and Malaysia&apos;s Danone Dumex had also recalled some batches of baby milk. Australian officials said they had quarantined potentially affected baby milk but did not believe it had gone on sale, while Thai officials were expected to make an announcement on Monday. John Key, the New Zealand prime minister, questioned why the company waited until Friday to alert authorities to the risk. Tests highlighted a potential problem in March. Fonterra said a product had tested positive in spring for Clostridium \u2013 the genus of bacteria which includes Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism \u2013 but because most Clostridium strains are harmless it had had to carry out further tests to assess whether there was a risk. In the 2008 melamine scandal, Fonterra blew the whistle on Sanlu, its Chinese business partner, after local officials failed to alert the central government to the contamination. That case prompted many Chinese families to turn to imported milk powder despite the higher cost. Supermarkets in countries from Australia to the UK now limit how many cans of baby formula people can buy because Chinese visitors have been purchasing so many. Visitors to Hong Kong are greeted by announcements at the airport reminding them that they may not carry more than two cans to the mainland. Yang Jing, a father from Zhengzhou in Henan province, said that he and his wife fed their child with imported Dutch milk powder and that the scare would not deter them from buying foreign formula. He pointed out that unlike in the Sanlu scandal \u2013 where milk producers deliberately added melamine because it boosted their results in nutritional tests \u2013 the problems appeared to have occurred by accident. &quot;The problem was discovered by New Zealand, not China. I think the quality checking system in western countries is better than ours,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Food safety", "Food & drink industry", "New Zealand", "Food & drink", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "Vietnam", "Russia", "Europe", "Life and style", "Coca-Cola", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-05T08:09:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/09/tesco-china-merger-talks-brand", "sentences": ["Tesco is present in nine provinces, focusing on the fast-growing Shanghai, Tianjin and Liaoning provinces."], "title": "Tesco's China merger talks leave question mark over future of brand", "article": "Tesco is in talks with China&apos;s largest retailer to merge their operations in the country in a move marking a major shift in strategy over one of its key growth markets. The move comes months after Tesco took a hit of \u00a31.2bn on the decision to exit its US venture Fresh &amp; Easy, alongside a more than 50% fall in its annual profits amid a faltering performance in its domestic stronghold. Tesco said the merger with CR Vanguard \u2013 owned by state-run China Resources Enterprise (CRE) \u2013 would create a business with more than 3,000 stores and combined sales of around \u00a310bn. But the deal leaves a question mark over the future of the Tesco brand in China and would bring an end to the group&apos;s independent business in one of the world&apos;s fastest growing retail markets. Tesco would own a stake of 20% in the joint venture after bringing its 131 stores in the country together with Vanguard&apos;s 2,986 shops across China and Hong Kong. Tesco, which has agreed a memorandum of understanding with CRE, said on Friday morning that the proposed tie-up was consistent with its &quot;strategy of focusing on profitable routes to growth in fast-growing but less mature markets, with a disciplined approach to the allocation of capital&quot;. Market observers, however, said Tesco had been struggling in China. &quot;Tesco \u2026 finally finds a big giant to salvage them,&quot; said Kenny Wu, an analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Ji-Asia in Hong Kong, adding that the deal also worked for CRE, which was keen to expand its market share and had the cash to do so. One Hong-Kong-based M&amp;A banker told Reuters that Tesco, like France&apos;s Carrefour, was keen to address problems in its home market. &quot;Tesco has been struggling in China and has been losing money. Similar to Carrefour, they had issues in their home market which they had to resolve. This may look win-win, but in reality, Tesco is saying: &apos;I can&apos;t figure out China,&apos;&quot; he said. Tesco said the merger talks followed a series of joint ventures struck between CRE and other multinational companies. But a deal to end its go-it-alone strategy in China may be seen as a further retrenchment after it decided in December last year to pull the plug on Fresh &amp; Easy, which is struggling to find a buyer and could be shut down by the retailer. Tesco&apos;s recent first-quarter trading update also revealed tougher trading in China as like-for-like sales dropped 4.9% in the country, following a 2% decline the previous three months. Tesco is focusing its efforts on turning around its domestic operations after falling market share and intense competition prompted the chain&apos;s first profit warning in 20 years in January 2012. Tesco&apos;s chief executive, Philip Clarke, unveiled a \u00a31bn overhaul in April last year and recently revealed a shift in strategy away from increasing store space to modernising its existing shops, while also focusing more on convenience outlets and online sales. The group&apos;s Chinese operation has grown from 56 stores to more than 130 in five years. Tesco is present in nine provinces, focusing on the fast-growing Shanghai, Tianjin and Liaoning provinces. Tesco China also includes the six-strong Lifespace shopping mall business. Vanguard was set up in 1999 and is owned by CRE, a Hong-Kong-listed company, whose majority shareholder is held by the state-owned group China Resources Holdings. It is thought a deal with CRE will take several months to finalise.

But he cut his teeth as a journalist at the Financial Times in the 1990s, during a period when the paper nurtured a host of rising stars that also included Robert Peston and Will Lewis. Harding joined the FT during a mini golden age just before the internet disrupted the old certainties of the print news business. In 1997, the paper launched its US edition, printed in New York and seven cities including Washington, and the following year became the first UK title to sell more copies abroad than in its domestic market. This international expansion provided opportunities for career advancement and contact-building at the highest levels of business and politics. First-class start Harding, 24 when he joined the paper in 1994, educated at St Paul&apos;s school and Trinity College, Cambridge, perfectly suited the FT&apos;s hiring policy, overseen by public school Oxbridge men. His first-class history degree was followed by a City University journalism course, a scholarship to learn Japanese at Soas, work at the Japan unit at the European Commission, and a spell as speech writer for Kiochi Kato, then Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary. The job arose from running into Sir David Bell, then FT chief executive, &quot;on a pavement during the Notting Hill Carnival, through family friends&quot;, the latter recalled. Bell, who went on to become chairman of FT owner Pearson and now chairs the Media Standards Trust, was impressed and passed Harding&apos;s name on to Richard Lambert, the paper&apos;s personable editor. Lambert spearheaded its global expansion and is recognised for hiring an impressive clutch of high fliers \u2013 before moving on to join the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee and running the CBI. &quot;I remember recruiting him, he was supposed to come at 11am, but he was very, very late. I thought, &apos;Great, I don&apos;t have to bother, he&apos;s not a runner&apos;,&quot; says Lambert. Harding had gone to the Daily Express, then in a nearby building in Southwark, by mistake. &quot;He had a fantastic CV, very impressive. I had to hire him.&quot; Bell adds: &quot;The FT hired people for their potential, we were keen to develop people. It is a matter of great pride that people go on to do different jobs. &quot;If you have two people in front of you of roughly the same ability and one of them has walked across the Andes, you chose the one who crossed the Andes. We never hired on great financial ability. It was the ability to get it. Nor did we put people on probation.&quot; Future high-fliers Others who passed through the FT newsroom during the 1990s included: \u2022 Robert Peston \u2013 joined FT 1991, political editor 1994-2000, now BBC business editor; \u2022 Will Lewis \u2013 joined 1994, broke Exxon/Mobil merger story in 1999 while working in New York, returned to London as news editor. Then edited the Daily Telegraph, now back in New York as News Corp&apos;s chief creative officer after a stint on company&apos;s management and standards committee dealing with phone-hacking fallout; \u2022 Stephanie Flanders \u2013 1993-97: leader writer and columnist, left to work for US treasury secretary Larry Summers. Now BBC economics editor; \u2022 Ed Balls \u2013 1990-94: leader writer. Now Labour shadow chancellor.     Robert Peston: 'James was clearly super-bright.' Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    Peston encountered Harding early in his FT career. &quot;As a trainee, Harding was briefly placed with me in the FT lobby in Westminster, as the junior,&quot; he says. &quot;James was clearly super-bright, a young thing and the editor wanted him to learn about things.&quot; George Parker, the FT&apos;s political editor at the time, said he was &quot;very clubbable, would have made a great lobby journo ... the lobby team at that time was stellar \u2013 Rob Peston, David Wighton, John Kampfner, Robert Shrimsley, Liam Halligan and James Blitz.&quot; Harding had arrived after the FT broke with the past and backed Labour under Neil Kinnock in the 1992 election. That caused consternation at the time, but by 1997 looked like a smart move with Tony Blair&apos;s Labour landslide. An article of faith at the FT and owner Pearson was that the editorial policy was absolutely a matter for the paper. The liberal economic line and pinkish Labour tone gave the FT instant access to the Blair government. Andrew Adonis, another FT policy writer of the 1990s, moved into the No 10 policy unit in 1998, was later made a peer and became transport secretary. Lambert oversaw this self-confident, expansive newspaper, riding the rollercoaster of a 1990s stock-market boom in the UK and US. &quot;[The journalists] were all ambitious people. It didn&apos;t strike me that we were the sort of place where people were aggressively pushing people out of stories, the opposite, they all had their beats and got on with it,&quot; he recalls. &quot;It was lovely, a bit like good football teams.&quot; International expansion Future Times editor and News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson was already established at the FT when Harding arrived, having spent the previous decade as Beijing and then Toyko correspondent, and became his mentor. In his next job as the FT&apos;s foreign news editor, Thomson assisted Harding&apos;s key move to open a Shanghai office in 1996. The following year, Lambert moved to New York for 12 months to oversee the launch of the FT&apos;s US edition, giving further scope for his talented recruits to flourish. Thomson became assistant editor in London. Lambert says: &quot;The paper was going well to start with, and then a new opportunity was opening up.&quot; If staff wanted to be a foreign correspondent, and report from around the world, they had their chance. Harding seized it. Bell still remembers a piece he wrote from Shanghai: &quot;It was a matter of pride that he impressed with an article on how to cook a snake.&quot; Access to people in high places Harding went on to become media editor and Washington bureau chief. The FT, with its focus on business, finance, economics and foreign affairs, provides access to very powerful people. That is how Harding first met Rupert Murdoch, and his son James. Lambert observes that the US expansion served as &quot;a very important pulpit&quot; to get noticed by the White House for top FT writers. Bell notes: &quot;What they see is people with a good mind, capable of dealing with lots of things, an ability to learn and then act on that knowledge. We did send people to quite important assignments quite young.&quot; Peston agrees. &quot;The FT opens doors. You got access not available anywhere else to journalists. I know, I compare it with access I got previously on the Independent,&quot; he says. &quot;It was amazing. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. At the FT the top politicians, civil servants, businessmen and leaders, they came to you. They wanted to talk to you.

The process is known as cloud seeding, and was used to increase the chance good weather for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. A heatwave across central and eastern China has led to drinking water shortages for almost 3 million people in Jiangxi and Hubei and hit crops. On Wednesday, Shanghai had its hottest day since records began 140 years ago, with temperatures soaring to 40.8C, and authorities issued a\u00a0fifth red alert warning for further extreme heat. Local media published pictures of prawns and meat cooking in pans set on manhole covers. At least 10 people have died in Shanghai&apos;s heatwave, while officials say Hunan and Chongqing have each seen three deaths from heatstroke. Electricity output soared to an all-time high in China last month with experts blaming increased use of air conditioners, and some areas in the south have complained of power failures. Ma Xuekuan, chief forecaster of the national meteorological office, said temperatures across the south should begin to drop from 13 August but might remain above 35C in some areas. But while some areas are struggling to cope with the lack of rain and the drying up of water sources, others have endured downpours. Last month, at least 44 people died in severe flooding and thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed after heavy rainfall in areas including Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, in the south-west. In Heilongjiang, in the north-east, workers have increased flood protection measures after weeks of heavy rain. Scientists say that while individual weather events cannot be attributed to global warming, the risk of extreme weather is rising. Lin Erda, a member of the national expert committee on climate change and a professor at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said: &quot;The chances of high temperature and precipitation are continuously increasing in China, [but] it is hard for climate experts to predict how or in what degree.&quot; He said he believed artificial precipitation would be effective in some areas, but noted that it worked only under certain conditions. &quot;In the long run, we can only prepare to deal with climate change, and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases to slow down global warm.&quot; Li Weijing, another climate expert, told the state news agency, Xinhua, that extreme weather events were becoming more frequent and that climate change would cause China&apos;s rain belt to move north in the summer. Jiang Tong, a research fellow with the China Meteorological Administration&apos;s national climate centre, told the Global Times that many cities were not prepared for such severe weather at present.

Tesco is expected to pay millions in fees for the deal, which will leave it with a 20% stake, however, it means the Tesco name is likely to disappear from the country all together following integration. Both sides are understood to have been in talks since before Tesco&apos;s full year results in April where chief executive Philip Clarke said the company would take a &quot;more cautious&quot; approach towards China. Three years ago, in his previous role as head of international, Clarke had unveiled plans to open 80 vast shopping malls, all including a tesco hypermarket, across China that would have made its retail portfolio bigger than the UK. However, following the disastrous withdrawal from its ill-fated US Fresh &amp; Easy venture which cost \u00a31.8bn, Clarke has refocused his attentions on the UK and reining back excessive spending on expansions. It is not known how much Tesco has spent on its Chinese venture so far, however, former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy revealed in 2010 that the company planned to spend \u00a32bn in the country by the end of 2015. In its most recent quarterly trading update the company revealed that like for like sales in China had fallen 4.9% and that sales fell in every international location except Malaysia and Hungary. The memorandum of understanding with CRE is unlikely to see any deal completed until next year, but if successful it would create a business with annual sales of \u00a310bn. Analysts generally welcomed the move, saying Tesco was unlikely to become a serious national contender without investing billions of pounds more into the country. Mike Tattersall, retail analyst at UBS, said: &quot;It&apos;s a pretty sensible transaction all round. Tesco has a sub-scale business in China. To achieve scale and profitability they would need to spend a lot of money, billions more. &quot;That does not fit with the current strategy of the group which is all about cash generation and fiscal responsibility. &quot;In the development of a market like China consolidation is a natural progression. It&apos;s not the embarrassing retreat that happened in the US. They got the business where they wanted it to be without spending lots of money.&quot; The entrenchment is the latest by Tesco this year, after it pulled out of the US and Japan, although it has had some success in the far east, with South Korea and Thailand both performing well. The plans for a US sale continues, but so far no buyer has emerged and there are now suggestions that the only viable option may be to shut down the operation. According to Tesco&apos;s website, China still remains &quot;strategically important&quot;. The grocer opened 12 new hypermarkets last year, and is due to launch an online groceries business in Shanghai later this year. However, Tesco has struggled to win over Chinese customers. Last year sales dropped 1%. Other British retailers have also struggled in China in recent years. B&amp;Q attempted a solo expansion into China in 1999 which was initially successful, but eventually led to the company cutting half its number of stores after years of losses. Marks &amp; Spencer, which has stores in Shanghai, had a disastrous initial launch after the company shunned local knowledge and hoped to copy the same model as its Hong Kong stores. The business is now improving. Tattersall explained the difficulties with expanding into China: He said: &quot;The problem with China is how attractive it is. It&apos;s so big and it&apos;s long term pot is so large that all the international retailers are looking at the same metrics. All the lights go green and they all pile in at the same time. Everyone is throwing capital at it so you have more and more competitors at the same time. Like-for-like growth is very difficult to come by and gross margins are tough. &quot;Inflation is high so from a food retailer&apos;s perspective, you have to pay a lot in wages, which is going up at double digit rates too.&quot; Retail adventures in China B&amp;Q The UK&apos;s biggest DIY chain headed for China in 1999, opening its first store in Shanghai. The business made a profit for a couple of years, but performance slowed after the Chinese government introduced measures to cool the housing market after the infamous ghost towns started popping up. B&amp;Q did not help itself by over-expanding in the early 2000s at a time when western businesses were keen to get into China at any cost. In 2009, parent company Kingfisher&apos;s new boss Ian Cheshire announced a repositioning of the China business as losses mounted to \u00a350m. Store numbers were cut from 63 to 40 and a further 17 were downsized. Since then the company has seen a modest recovery in China and in its most recent results B&amp;Q China saw a 10.7% like for like sales boost. Marks &amp; Spencer M&amp;S launched its first wholly owned China store in 2008 \u2013 it generally favouring joint ventures or franchises in other territories. However, the store opening on the West Nanjing Road, Shanghai, did not go well, with a business model based on its Hong Kong store failing to transfer successfully to the Chinese mainland. To make matters worse, a customer fell from the escalators and died, putting a so-called curse on the store and causing shoppers to steer clear. A year later chairman Sir Stuart Rose admitted the company &quot;screwed up&quot; after supply chain problems left the food hall virtually empty. He also said they must return to &quot;basic shopkeeping&quot; after not stocking enough smaller sizes. Bosses eventually fixed the problems and there are now 15 stores in the Shanghai region, 15 in Hong Kong and an online offer. Metro The German hypermarket giant entered China with a fanfare two years ago, opening 12 stores last year and vowing to have 100 by 2016. An online business-to-business store was also launched last year along with electronics stores Media Markt. However, earlier this year the company was forced to pull out of the Media Markt stores after it was constantly beaten by cheaper and better ranges online. Chief executive, Olaf Koch, said at the time: &quot;In order to keep Metro Group on target for success, it is essential for us to concentrate on those business units and markets where we can clearly sharpen our profile and build up a strong market position.&quot; The company said its Metro Cash &amp; Carry self-service wholesale business would continue. Best Buy The American electronic giant opened in China in 2006 with a majority stake in Nanjing-based retailer Five Star, spending $180m, but the operation struggled from the beginning. During the US recession management focused on the struggling US market and took its eye off China, leaving to underinvestment. The retailer&apos;s own-brand stores never adapted to the local market or succeeded in wooing the Chinese customer. In 2011 it shut its own brand big box stores to focus exclusively on the Five Star brand, but it has lost market share.

Dog walkers. Noise \u2013 the infernal machine. It&apos;s hard to hear grasshoppers or the wind in the trees. Little pockets of messy land. Untidy hedges. Derelict buildings \u2013 whatever happened to them?&quot; Matthew Oates is listing the changes in our countryside over the past half century as we plummet through the leafy lanes of West Sussex towards his old school. Fifty years ago this week, Oates was\u00a0given a butterfly net for his 10th birthday. In the long grass by his school cricket pitch, he caught large whites and\u00a0small skippers, and a passion for nature was born. Oates is still mad about butterflies, but he is also now an expert in the management of land to conserve insect life, and the country&apos;s leading authority on the elusive purple emperor. Every season, he has kept meticulous diaries about the changing weather and\u00a0how plants and animals have fared. He is an astute and unconventional observer of the profound transformation of the British countryside, and our\u00a0changing relationship to it\u00a0\u2013 the perfect person with whom to embark on\u00a0a modest pilgrimage into the\u00a0past, via\u00a0the places in which he encountered wildlife as a child. It is easy to focus on the losses. The conservation movement is gripped by a sense of crisis and doom, more so than ever this year. Concern for the environment has disappeared from the political agenda. Climate change, cutting carbon and renewable energy have some traction, but saving species from extinction, curbing development and protecting or restoring the countryside are ignored by decision-makers. Turtle doves and barn owls were this week revealed to be in crisis. The hen harrier, a magnificent bird of prey, has failed to breed in England this summer, and now stands on the brink of extinction. The State of Nature, a report published in May by a coalition of environmental charities, found that more than half our wildlife species are in decline. After futile attempts to work with the coalition, conservationists are now openly in despair: all mainstream parties, they know, are unwilling to see economic growth compromised by a concern for nature. &quot;We are heading for Armageddon in terms of nature. We are faced with a nightmare of no nature in large parts of southern England,&quot; says Mark Cocker, author of Birds and People, a monumental new account of the role birds play in human life. &quot;The filigree of our lives, the things that make it fantastic \u2013 silver-washed fritillaries, nightingales, dunlin, water voles chomping away at the edge of the pool \u2013 are disappearing. We are faced with the most appalling loss.&quot; Cocker&apos;s passion echoes a rollickingly fierce speech to the Welsh assembly earlier this summer by Iolo Williams, the\u00a0RSPB officer turned Springwatch presenter, which is still being passed around and debated among naturalists. In it, Williams recalled his childhood by the Vyrnwy river, currently imperilled by proposals for pylons and infrastructure to service vast wind farms. The Mid\u00a0Wales countryside may still appear glorious but, according to Williams, it is bereft: water voles, trout, curlew and cuckoos are gone; so, too, are insects and hay meadows (Wales has lost 99% of\u00a0its hay meadows since the second world war). On the moors, alien conifers have been planted. &quot;It&apos;s like going and looking at war graves. Every single tree is a death-knell, a nail in the coffin of that moor,&quot; said Williams. &quot;We really are on the brink of disaster.&quot; Oates and I began our pilgrimage at perhaps the best-protected environment of all: a British public school. His passion for nature was first sparked at Christ&apos;s Hospital school, founded for poor children and in 1902 relocated from London to 230 acres of countryside near Horsham. Its grounds look magnificent, and the cricket pitch where Oates caught his first butterfly is intact, of course. The\u00a0outside world has pricked this leafy bubble, however. The sky, once full of house martins, is now virtually silent except for aeroplanes, and only one mud nest is visible in the eaves, where once there were hundreds. Similarly, the tree creepers and holly blues that Oates remembers in profusion only appear in ones and twos. Instead, there is a ceaseless rumble of traffic on the A24. But this is not a straightforward picture of degradation. A buzzard cries as it floats overhead, and\u00a0rabbits and deer pick through the woods, where there were none 50 years\u00a0ago. &quot;The beauty of the place has actually increased. There&apos;s a lot less pointless lawn-mowing, it&apos;s a lot more bushy and it&apos;s still got this feeling of immense tranquillity,&quot; says Oates. While the school assures us there is a thriving ecology group and its 850 pupils are free\u00a0to roam the grounds \u2013 enjoying the kind of access to wildlife untasted by most children \u2013 there is no old schoolmaster, as Oates once had, to run the Butterflies and Moths Club every Tuesday afternoon. Halfway through Oates&apos;s schooldays, the master retired and boys suddenly lost interest in butterflies. Children are unlikely to be inspired by nature if adults aren&apos;t. As a boy, Oates would creep out of school and go butterflying in a nearby wood. We head there, down a surprisingly tranquil lane, and walk on to a flowery ride, full of silver-washed fritillaries. Another buzzard flies overhead. When Oates was a boy, conifers were planted by the Forestry Commission and\u00a0non-native Norway spruce slowly strangled the life out of the wood. In\u00a0the 1960s, Oates found rare species \u2013 the Duke of Burgundy, the pearl-bordered and the small pearl-bordered fritillary \u2013\u00a0but by the time he\u00a0finished school, all three butterflies had become extinct here. The\u00a0conifers had grown so tall and dense that no sunlight or wild flowers could survive below them, and the insects and birds vanished, too. Over the last three decades, conservationists have at least won the argument against what Oates calls the &quot;folly&quot; of coniferisation. The Forestry Commission now removes conifers from ancient woodlands. In Oates&apos;s childhood wood, the conifers blew down in the great storm of 1987 and the wood was allowed to regenerate naturally. Twenty-six years on, it is full of tall native birch, ash\u00a0and sallow. &quot;The scars of the 20th century have been wondrously healed,&quot; says Oates, smiling as we watch a purple emperor glide between the treetops. &quot;It\u00a0shows the power of nature when we stop interfering.&quot; It is not an unmanaged tangle, however: changes to woodland management are &quot;a huge positive&quot; over the last 50 years, says Oates, and in\u00a0these woods the trees are thinned to enable wild flowers to thrive alongside butterflies. But the three species that became extinct in Oates&apos; childhood have not returned, and are lost to most of the south-east. Another thing is missing: children. &quot;We were continuously outside,&quot; says Oates. &quot;We played on farms. Now farms are a dangerous environment. Even farmers&apos; children no longer play on the farms.&quot; A compelling brew of rational and irrational fears about traffic, stranger-danger and health and safety have stopped children growing up in nature. Like many naturalists, Cocker is concerned that wildlife is losing a battle with virtual worlds. &quot;People are so cut off from their environment by iPads and smartphones and electronica,&quot; he says. &quot;The loss of ecosystems is paralleled by the expansion of the digital ecosystem.&quot;            This squeeze on time spent in nature may be an unavoidable consequence of a society liberated from labouring on the\u00a0land. Wildlife will invariably decline if we are oblivious to it, but Williams&apos;s speech identified a more specific culprit. He did not blame the farmers for pesticides or ploughing up hay meadows or\u00a0foresters for planting conifers over the\u00a0moors. &quot;They have just taken what money was available, they&apos;ve used the grant system to do what they were encouraged to do,&quot; he says. &quot;My anger, and it is\u00a0an anger \u2013 it&apos;s a venom \u2013 is aimed at those grey, fat-salaried, spineless bureaucrats who sat by and watched all\u00a0of this happen.&quot; More specifically, this means the contemporary conservationists who work for the likes\u00a0of Natural Resources Wales (whose\u00a0very name screams exploitation) and have failed to stop the destruction of our countryside. Cocker disagrees. &quot;That was one fantastic speech but he&apos;s fundamentally wrong. It&apos;s not &apos;them&apos;. It&apos;s not some fatcat with a big pension \u2013 it&apos;s you, it&apos;s me, it&apos;s us. Iolo wants it simple \u2013 that he is the good guy and he can blame some faceless bureaucrats. But that is not the problem. The problem is we don&apos;t wish nature conservation to stand in the way of economic growth.&quot; And this boils down to individual behaviour. &quot;I&apos;m still eating meat, I&apos;m still flying, I&apos;m still doing all the things I shouldn&apos;t.&quot; It is easy to despair, but Cocker insists he also has hope \u2013 if everyone becomes an activist. &quot;You cannot wander through your life telling people of the wonder of butterflies,&quot; he tells me. &quot;I&apos;ve awakened from a nature-writing slumber to feel that if I\u00a0don&apos;t take action I will go to the grave a\u00a0lesser person, because we are fucked.&quot; Actions, he says, can be big and small. Gardens make up 1m acres of British land. If every garden was planted with 50% native species, that would be an enormous boost to insects and birds. Cocker is also getting political: a key player in New Networks for Nature, he hopes to persuade the chief executive of\u00a0every environmental charity in the country to support a festival of nature. However, conservationists are divided over the best way to save nature\u00a0when Conservatives, Labour and,\u00a0critically, ordinary people, are reluctant to put wildlife ahead of immediate financial self-interest. Green\u00a0thinkers such as\u00a0Mark Lynas argue that a\u00a0&quot;technofix&quot; will save us; others, such as Tony Juniper, make a convincing case\u00a0for the\u00a0economic value of nature through &quot;ecosystem services&quot;. Putting a monetary value on a view, or a tree, may be the only language that modern capitalism understands, but many argue that basing conservation solely on appeals to\u00a0pragmatic self-interest sells nature short. The save-nature-because-it-will-save-us (or make\u00a0us rich) argument may rescue the honeybee, but it will never protect the nightingale or the water vole. And how will we save anything if\u00a0we fear nature, or simply have no feeling for it? Oates says the doom and gloom is because conservationists are overwhelmed with grief, loss and failure. &quot;We&apos;ve fought the wrong battle,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ve fought a battle over land and the real conservation battle is in people&apos;s hearts and minds.&quot; That sounds good \u2013 but how could this battle be won? Rather than reducing the beauty of the countryside to a price set by an economist, I wonder if minds might be won by scientific identification of the health benefits of nature. More research into how wildlife aids physical and mental wellbeing must be\u00a0a\u00a0good start \u2013 although it could, of course, show that a home in a Shanghai high-rise is as mentally and physically beneficial as life by a lake in Finland. &quot;That&apos;s my nightmare,&quot; says Cocker, &quot;but I&apos;m pretty sure there will be evidence to prove we need the flowers and the birds.&quot; Fostering greater heart for wildlife, however, can probably only come through time spent in nature. For most of us, the countryside is now a place of leisure, rather than work, and adrenalin sports are increasingly popular. Oates would prefer to see more walking, fishing, foraging or butterflying (with cameras rather than nets \u2013 Oates&apos;s old net is\u00a0just for our pictures): activities that &quot;get\u00a0us still and quiet in nature as opposed to charging through it&quot;. Children, he believes, need initial inspiration or encouragement, but are then better left alone. &quot;They need time without adults. They&apos;ve got to be able to\u00a0explore, have fun, go and muck about,&quot; he says. While a forthcoming documentary, Project Wild Thing, brilliantly shows how parents need to be\u00a0persuaded of the benefits of nature more than children do, Oates would also\u00a0like to see more support for wildlife lovers at secondary school, where peer\u00a0pressure dictates that nature is for\u00a0geeks. Oates&apos;s old school and woods look better today than 50 years ago, but the missing species show the long-lasting legacy of environmental destruction. The most uplifting moment of our pilgrimage came when we reached the chalk grassland of the North Downs. When Oates first visited Denbies hillside four decades ago, the meadows were overgrown and several butterfly species were on the brink of extinction. Now the grassland is grazed for conservation by the National Trust, and flowers and insects are thriving. A year after the worst summer on record for butterflies, thousands of chalkhill blues shimmer on the slopes. &quot;Yes there are horrible, irreversible losses, but nature is more dynamic than we think,&quot; he says. &quot;The way butterflies have bounced back after last year&apos;s apocalyptic summer is just miraculous.&quot; He takes heart from Wordsworth: &quot;What we have loved, others will love, and we may teach them how.&quot; No matter how urban we become, &quot;this love of nature is innate in all of us&quot;, believes Oates. &quot;It&apos;s just a matter of finding that catalyst. It is\u00a0about realising the interconnectivity of\u00a0everything and what our real needs actually are \u2013 and they are beauty, wonder, passion and\u00a0love.&quot; \u2022\u00a0This article was amended on 16 August 2013 because the original said hen harriers have failed to breed in Britain this summer.

Click here to view  2 Guns shows that the cop buddy movie has flatlined. It only took 24 hours for the film to vanish from my mind \u2013 and I took notes. Yes, it&apos;s the umpteenth buddy-cop retread, where two wily but likable antagonists are forced to team up to fulfil their competing agendas. Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington play undercover operatives posing as drug traffickers in order to snag Edward James Olmos&apos;s Latin drug lord. Their chemistry and fast-talking effervescence are instantly appealing: Washington the swaggeringly confident dandy, and Wahlberg all nerves, jitters and querulousness. But as usual, the problem is the formula, not the duo. Diverting as the banter is, there&apos;s no dodging the fact that Walter Hill&apos;s 48 Hrs has officially now been remade for the bazillionth time in 31 years. Back in 1982, 48 Hrs was an original, a meshing of elements from Two Rode Together, In The Heat Of The Night, Bustin&apos; Loose and Thunderbolt And Lightfoot (the buddy thriller ne plus ultra), all kicked into another dimension by Hill&apos;s gift as a kinetic action director, trained by Peckinpah himself in the school of fountaining blood squibs. Added to that was the felicitous casting of a prematurely ragged Nick Nolte and an unknown Eddie Murphy, whose mutual racial antagonism seems shockingly forthright today (Nolte drops the N-Bomb a lot), facing off against a psychopathic young James Remar. For old-school Hill fans, 48 Hrs was the last of a superb series of revisionist 70s genre pieces, such as Hard Times, The Driver, The Warriors, The Long Riders, Southern Comfort, and the first indication of the rot that would blight his work in the 1980s. His Red Heat was essentially the same movie, while Another 48 Hrs, oddly, was not. Meanwhile, the tsunami of knock-offs began to build: Lethal Weapon, Stakeout, Bad Boys, the later Die Hards, Tango And Cash, Blue Streak, Chill Factor, Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon, Money Train\u2026 There were some keepers like Midnight Run, The Last Boy Scout and, recently, The Heat, all of them blessed with adroitly paired performers. If you were stuck with the formula, but lacked fireworks in the main casting \u2013 think Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding in Chill Factor \u2013 you were sunk. The buddy thriller, with its one plot, has long been a stabilser-wheels genre for cheap, presumed malleable, foreign directors such as 2 Guns&apos; Baltasar Kormakur, from Iceland, who also made Wahlberg&apos;s negligible Contraband, or Chilean-Swede Daniel Espinosa, who made Denzel&apos;s buddy-ish Safe House. The stars and their acting coaches handle themselves, the pliable newcomer directs, but the Machine makes the movie, because the Machine has always made this movie, except for that first time, which now seems so poignantly long ago.", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Eddie Murphy", "Nick Nolte", "Mark Wahlberg", "Denzel Washington"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-12T05:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/12/cath-kidston-sales-boom-asia", "sentences": ["In Shanghai, for example, there are a lot of bright printed products, so we fit in really well.", "The group now has 58 stores in the UK and 60 across China, Spain, Thailand and South Korea, with a new flagship store opening in Shanghai as well as the first major UK shop on London&apos;s Piccadilly, due to open in December."], "title": "Cath Kidston's florals are a hit with Asian market as sales boom", "article": "Cath Kidston&apos;s floral-print handbags and homeware have proved such a big hit with Asian customers the retailer now has more overseas stores than British ones for the first time.

Customers get the quirky Britishness and sense of humour of the brand. &quot;Obviously, there are some products that are focused for individual markets, such as the bento lunchbox which sells really well in Japan, but overall all categories have seen growth.&quot; Handbags have sold particularly well and some of the floral prints have been used for 20 years, he added.

Worldwide network sales, which include wholesale to retailers, increased by 24% to \u00a3129m.

We obviously want those people to keep buying from us, but we also know there are still three out of four women who haven&apos;t shopped with us,&quot; Wilson said.The company was founded by designer Cath Kidston as a shop selling vintage fabrics.

We are mutually respectful of what we both bring to the party.&quot; As well as adorning everything from oven gloves to lampshades, the brand has also collaborated to decorate Roberts radios and design floral Millets tents. Most private equity companies have a short-term strategy to exit businesses after a few years, but Wilson said TA were very supportive and were in the business for the long term. &quot;They recognise that this is a growing business and that we want to reinvest the profits to grow the business.&quot; Plans for further overseas growth will focus on Asia, but Wilson did not rule out looking at markets including the US and, while the UK venture has been successful, he wants to avoid overexposure.", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business", "Annual results", "UK news", "Fashion"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-12T18:08:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/15/steven-spielberg-zhang-yimou-china-collaboration", "sentences": ["In an interview with the China Daily newspaper Spielberg said &quot;&quot;I made &apos;Empire of the Sun&apos; in Shanghai in the 1980s and want to come back one day to make a movie in China.&quot; Calling Zhang, the director of the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, his &quot;dear friend&quot;, Spielberg said: &quot;We would work together on an international film that could take place in China.&quot; Spielberg was speaking ahead of the 20 August release in China of the 3D version of Jurassic Park, which is going ahead despite the row over the withholding of box office receipts due to Hollywood films."], "title": "Steven Spielberg aiming to make a film with Zhang Yimou in China", "article": "Steven Spielberg is aiming to make a film in China in collaboration with Zhang Yimou, one of China&apos;s best known directors, according to reports.

A so-called fat finger trading error at a large Chinese brokerage was reportedly behind wild swings on the country&apos;s stock market on Friday. China&apos;s main stock index was up as much at 5.6% at one stage and trading volumes were up more than 50% on the day before as 1.5bn shares changed hands. The buying frenzy appears to have been triggered by China Everbright Securities sending through billions of incorrect purchase orders for shares. The brokerage&apos;s own shares were soon suspended, China&apos;s securities regulator said it was looking into the volatility and by the end of play the morning&apos;s spectacular rally had been undone by equally dramatic plunges in share prices. That left the Shanghai Composite Index down 0.6% on the day. The rollercoaster session sparked scare stories that regulators had engineered a spike to punish short-positions in Chinese banks and a number of other theories soon started to run around trading rooms. But Everbright, China&apos;s fifth-largest brokerage, issued a statement to the stock exchange that part of its trading operation &quot;had a problem when using its own arbitrage system&quot; and that it was launching its own probe into the day&apos;s events. The group was also applying to cancel all its morning trades, according to business newspaper the 21st Century Business Herald. Whether that &quot;problem&quot; was man- or machine-made was unclear. &quot;We know something went wrong at Everbright Securities, but whether it&apos;s a fat finger human error or something went wrong with the technology or the execution of one of their algorithms remain to be seen,&quot; said a Shanghai-based trader at a major Chinese brokerage told Reuters. Should the misplaced trades turn out to be a result of human error, it would be far from the first time such a bungle has shaken stock markets. Fat finger errors have become a common feature in exchanges populated by frenetic traders who from time to time erroneously tag on extra zeros and mis-type share names. In one of the most dramatic fat finger events, a trader at Mizuho Securities cost the brokerage about $335m in 2005 when he mistakenly offered 610,000 shares at 1 yen each, rather than one share at 610,000 yen. A Lehman Brothers dealer in London wiped \u00a330bn off the FTSE in May 2001 when he inadvertently ordered sales of shares in blue-chip companies such as BP and AstraZeneca that were 100 times larger than intended. He keyed in \u00a3300m for a trade which should have been \u00a33m. The drama on Chinese exchanges on Friday was in contrast to European markets where the FTSE 100 eked out modest gains of 0.3% to close just shy of 6,500 points, recovering little of a drop on Thursday when fears of America&apos;s loose monetary policy being unwound sooner rather than later sparked a sell-off around global stock markets. At the time of the London markets close, major share indices on Wall Street were largely unchanged as concerns about lacklustre consumer sentiment and a string of disappointing corporate updates weighed on investor sentiment. The pound meanwhile strengthened to a two-month high against a basket of other currencies as traders moved forward their bets of interest rate hikes following the latest batch of economic data to suggest the economic recovery may be gathering steam. &quot;It&apos;s been another good week for the pound, up for the fifth week in six against the US dollar,&quot; said Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Stock markets", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-16T16:39:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/18/china-northeastern-sea-route-trial-voyage", "sentences": ["These factors will severely limit the route&apos;s potential in the short term, a point stressed by Zhang Yongfeng, a researcher at the Shanghai International Shipping Institute."], "title": "China's voyage of discovery to cross the less frozen north", "article": "For a ship on a mission of worldwide importance, the Yong Sheng is a distinctly unimpressive sight.

They are intrigued, not by its cargo, but by its route \u2013 for the Yong Sheng is headed in the opposite direction from the Netherlands and sailing towards the Bering Strait that separates Russia and Alaska. Once through the strait, it will enter the Arctic Ocean, where it will attempt one of the most audacious voyages of modern seafaring: sailing through one of the Arctic&apos;s fabled passages, the Northern Sea Route. The passage, which hugs the coast of northern Russia, and its mirror route, the Northwest Passage, which threads its way through the islands and creeks of northern Canada, have claimed the lives of thousands of sailors who tried for centuries to cross the Arctic in an attempt to link the ports of the Far East and Europe by sailing via the north pole. Thick pack ice, violent storms and plummeting temperatures thwarted these endeavours. But global warming has transformed the Arctic in recent years and its summer ice cover has dropped by more than 40% over the last few decades, raising the prospect that it may soon be possible to sail along the Arctic&apos;s sea routes with ease \u2013 a notion that is proving irresistible to shipping lines, not to mention mining companies as well as oil and gas exploration firms. All believe the region is ripe for exploitation. Several fairly large ships have already sailed the Northern Sea Route. However, the voyage of the Yong Sheng, backed by the Chinese government, has special significance. This is the first attempt by the world&apos;s biggest exporter to exploit the Arctic&apos;s disappearing ice to reach its biggest market \u2013 the European Union. &quot;We always knew global warming would affect the planet first in the Arctic, but we have been floored by the rapidity of that change,&quot; said Mark Serreze, director of the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado. &quot;Temperatures have risen dramatically. At this rate, I would expect the Arctic to be completely free of ice in summer by around 2030. That is why everyone has become so interested in the region.&quot; The attraction for China in opening up the Northern Sea Route is straightforward. According to Cosco, the Yong Sheng&apos;s 3,380-mile journey will take about 35 days, shaving two weeks off the traditional route between Asia and Europe via the Suez Canal. &quot;The Arctic route can cut 12 to 15 days from traditional routes, so the maritime industry calls it the Golden Waterway,&quot; Cosco said when it announced the Yong Sheng&apos;s voyage. For good measure, the new route will avoid the pirate-invested waters of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. Making such cuts in transport times means major savings in fuel and lower costs for its products, hence China&apos;s new enthusiasm for all things polar. Although its border goes nowhere near the Arctic, China recently gained observer status in the Arctic Council, a group of nations \u2013 Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States \u2013 with major interests in the region. China, whose total foreign trade was worth $3.87tn (\u00a32.5tn) last year, can see clear economic benefits from exploiting the warming that is gripping the planet and shrinking its northern sea ice shelves. This point was stressed by Professor Qi Shaobin of Dalian Maritime University in China. Opening up the Arctic &quot;will change the market pattern of the global shipping industry because it will shorten the maritime distance significantly among the Chinese, European and American markets&quot;, he told Chinese state media last week. And shipping figures certainly look encouraging. Russian authorities said last week they had already granted permission for more than 370 ships to sail the route this year. In 2012, only 46 ships sailed the entire length of the passage from Europe to Asia, while in 2010 only four vessels made the voyage. In the wake of these figures, several proposals have been announced to take advantage of the expected expansion in Arctic shipping. Iceland is considering plans, backed by German entrepreneurs, to build a major port on its north-eastern shores. Similarly, Stornoway Port Authority in Scotland said last month that it was considering building a special port for Arctic ships so they could refuel and discharge cargoes into smaller vessels for onward shipment to Rotterdam, Le Havre, Liverpool or London. In addition, Valentin Davydants, captain of Russia&apos;s Atomflot fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers, has estimated that 15m tonnes of cargo will use the full Northern Sea Route by 2021. It sounds impressive until you realise that 929m tonnes of cargo was shipped through the Suez Canal by 18,000 vessels in 2011. By that standard, the Northern Sea Route has still got a long way to go in transforming world shipping. And other issues affect the attractiveness of sailing in Arctic waters. The seas around the north pole may be losing their summer ice cover but there is still the ever-present danger of icebergs and drifting slabs of pack ice. &quot;Satellite photographs may suggest an area is completely clear of ice, but there is still a chance that a ship will encounter drifts of ice,&quot; said Serreze. &quot;It is very unlikely that the Yong Sheng will go through these waters on its own. The Russians have the best, most powerful armada of ice-breakers. Some of these are huge nuclear-powered vessels, and I would expect one of these will have been hired to escort the Yong Sheng on the main part of its journey.&quot; The last point is crucial. The Arctic Ocean will eventually lose its sea ice cover for several months in summer, but this is not likely to occur for a couple of decades. For the foreseeable future, the Northern Sea Route will therefore be open for only a few weeks in summer and still require ice-breaker escorts. These factors will severely limit the route&apos;s potential in the short term, a point stressed by Zhang Yongfeng, a researcher at the Shanghai International Shipping Institute. &quot;The navigable period of the passage is relatively short, while the port and pier infrastructure along the route is incomplete,&quot; he told Fox News. Then there is the major expansion of the Panama Canal, expected to be completed by 2015. When that happens it will be possible to take ships that have more than double the upper cargo capacity on vessels currently allowed in the canal. Again, the major beneficiary is expected to be China with its voracious export plans. The costs of shipping its goods to the eastern US are predicted to drop by more than 30% as a result of the Panama&apos;s expansion. &quot;For the next decade, I would have thought that the expanded Panama canal will have a far greater impact on world trade than opening up routes in the Arctic,&quot; Serreze said. Others disagree, however. One estimate suggests that between 5% and 15% of China&apos;s international trade could use the Arctic route by the end of the decade. And where China leads, the world is very likely to follow.", "tags": ["Arctic", "China", "Climate change", "International trade", "Climate change", "Business", "World news", "Global economy", "Travel and transport", "Environment", "Sea ice", "Polar regions"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-17T23:04:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/18/tax-vodafone-dublin", "sentences": ["It is an association that has draped Vodafone&apos;s red ensign across racing racks from Silverstone to Shanghai."], "title": "How tax drove Vodafone brand to Dublin", "article": "It is an association that has draped Vodafone&apos;s red ensign across racing racks from Silverstone to Shanghai. The British mobile phone group&apos;s longstanding involvement with Formula One, through multimillion-pound sponsorship deals with Ferrari and then McLaren, has helped make its brand world famous. But few of Vodafone&apos;s customers will be aware that, for four years, the marketing of these high-profile sponsorship deals was run not from its headquarters in the English market town of Newbury but from a satellite office in Dublin. In 2002, Vodafone began using a Dublin-based subsidiary, Vodafone Ireland Marketing, to collect royalties and brand management fees from operating companies and joint venture partners doing business under the British brand. The collections were made from countries around the world \u2013 with the exception of the UK and Italy. The sums collected grew steadily. In 2006, after reviewing royalty rates paid in other industries, Vodafone&apos;s royalties went up from 0.7% to 1.75%. By 2007, Vodafone Ireland Marketing Ltd, a company employing no staff and registered to an industrial estate in the Dublin suburb of Leopardstown, reported a turnover of \u20ac380m (\u00a3325m) a year. Eventually, Vodafone decided that the Dublin subsidiary should employ staff, and told certain members of its global marketing team, based in Newbury and London, that they would have to relocate to Ireland. By September 2007, global director of brand customer experience David Wheldon, now a Barclays executive, had agreed to move and head the new team. Global chief marketing officer Frank R\u00f6vekamp, while remaining in London, became a director of Vodafone Ireland Marketing. It was decided the Dublin team would oversee international advertising accounts, and Vodafone&apos;s big sponsorship deals including Formula One, the Champions League and the Ashes cricket Test series. Two former Vodafone marketing staff, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said the request to move came out of the blue. &quot;Suddenly, within a very short period of time, the team were uprooted from the base in London to Dublin,&quot; said one employee. &quot;Everything was sorted out really, really quickly.&quot; No reason for the move was given in writing, staff said, but in background conversations with managers, employees were given to understand it was important for tax reasons to show that brand marketing activity was taking place in the same country \u2013 Ireland \u2013 as the brand royalties were being collected. &quot;. Vodafone never told us in an official way why the team had to moveEverything was handled with lawyers, and HR was clearly instructed by the legal team as to what they were allowed to say,&quot; according to the source. &quot;Clearly this was a very important financial move for Vodafone, because the team was offered lucrative relocation packages to move to Dublin. They were treated quite royally. There was no financial reason other than if the team hadn&apos;t moved they would have exposed themselves to a huge tax liability.&quot; Despite the generous incentives, the move had its human costs. From a team of 20 earmarked for transfer to Ireland, only a handful made the move. The second source said: &quot;It was quite clear: go to Dublin and go quickly or here&apos;s your redundancy. It&apos;s fair to say morale was pretty awful at the time, some of them hadn&apos;t been there that long, people with families.&quot; Asked about the reason for the relocation, the company said in a statement: &quot;Vodafone&apos;s group brand and marketing function was established during a period of significant international expansion. Vodafone is a global business, and it is therefore feasible to locate centralised group functions in a number of different locations depending on a range of factors. Dublin was identified as a location for this activity on a number of grounds including the commercial, regulatory and tax environment in Ireland at that time.&quot; The Irish accounts illustrate one important advantage: if the firm could show it was &quot;carrying out trading activities&quot; from Dublin, the corporation tax rate would be halved. According to the 2008 company filings: &quot;Following the establishment of the global brand management function in Ireland the activities of the company have increased. A confirmation has been obtained from the Irish Revenue that the company is now carrying out trading activities and, accordingly, subject to the corporate tax rate of 12.5%.&quot; The rate would apply from 1 November 2007. While the Irish tax authorities were accommodating, HM Revenue and Customs raised objections to Vodafone&apos;s previous arrangements. Its Irish tax payments were challenged in a dispute that was eventually settled in March 2009. Vodafone said the settlement related to a number of years prior to 2007. It declined to say how much was paid to HMRC but accounts show it eventually claimed back \u20ac67m from the Irish government, which was then handed to Britain &quot;as part of the overall settlement&quot;. This settlement, which has never been mentioned separately in Vodafone&apos;s annual reports, or discussed publicly by the company , was entirely separate from the \u00a31.25bn Vodafone paid HMRC in 2010 after a long dispute over its activities in Luxembourg. A spokesman for HMRC declined to confirm the grounds for its challenge, the sum claimed back from Vodafone, or even that a settlement was made. HMRC is by law prevented from discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers. Vodafone says HMRC has made no allegation of wrongdoing on its part. The dispute, it says, &quot;related to a number of technical factors regarding inter-group transfer pricing arrangements&quot;. This refers to charges paid between sister companies \u2013 in this case Vodafone&apos;s royalty payments \u2013 which are used to transfer taxable profits from one country to another. In October 2011, Vodafone made an about-turn, and the marketing team was ordered to return to Britain. The Irish brand subsidiary was wound down, and according to a company spokesman its activities have transferred to a UK company that pays all its profits into the British plc and is taxed under UK rules. Vodafone&apos;s Irish adventure was not an entirely bruising experience. Before it closed, the Dublin office paid more than \u20ac1.04bn (\u00a3900m) in dividends during a four-year period to a parent company, Vodafone Investments Luxembourg Sarl \u2013 based in the low-tax jurisdiction of Luxembourg.", "tags": ["Vodafone", "Telecommunications industry", "Business", "Ireland", "Europe", "World news", "HMRC", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-18T18:19:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/21/bo-xilai-trial-china-court", "sentences": ["While other politburo members have been prosecuted \u2013 notably the former Shanghai party boss Chen Liangyu, jailed for 18 years for bribery and abuse of power in 2008 \u2013 none have been as influential as Bo and none fell in such extraordinary fashion."], "title": "Bo Xilai to go on trial in China's biggest political court case for decades", "article": "China is preparing for its biggest political trial in decades, with police and a handful of protesters gathering at the court where the ousted politician Bo Xilai will stand trial. Bo&apos;s appearance at the hearing in Jinan, in the eastern province of Shandong, on Thursday will be the first public sighting of the charismatic 64-year-old for 17 months. He faces charges of bribery, corruption and abuse of power. The former Communist party secretary for Chongqing is certain to be convicted, analysts say, and most predict he will receive a lengthy prison sentence. Almost all Chinese trials end in conviction, and in a case this sensitive senior leaders will have approved the judgment in advance. About 10 people protested outside the courthouse in Jinan on Wednesday, holding signs reading: &quot;We&apos;re watching the Bo trial to see if it&apos;s fair and just.&quot; One, from Chongqing, told Reuters: &quot;This trial is illegal. We don&apos;t believe in any outcome of this trial.&quot; Another, from Beijing, said: &quot;Bo Xilai is not corrupt \u2013 Bo Xilai works for the people and is a good cadre.&quot; Others appeared to be using the trial to voice personal grievances, a common tactic when cases attract media attention. Critics of Bo have also voiced scepticism, particularly if reports of the case against him prove correct. He is believed to be accused of taking 25m yuan (\u00a32.6m) improperly, a relatively modest sum by the standards of other high-profile corruption cases, and the charges are thought to relate only to his time as an official in the north-east, a decade or more ago. &quot;Everyone knows it is a set-up,&quot; said a historian, Zhang Lifan. &quot;People won&apos;t believe Bo only embezzled a small amount.&quot; He added: &quot;The so-called &apos;anti-corruption&apos; [efforts] are the name that covers their political struggles.&quot; Wu Qiang, a political scientist at Tsinghua University, added: &quot;Bo still has a large group of supporters inside the party who can influence the direction of public opinion. So the trial against him is concentrated on three crimes, not all the mistakes or things he was accused of.&quot; Bo has long been a polarising figure, winning ardent support and spurring opposition both inside and outside the elite. His campaigns as party secretary of Chongqing, where he promoted Maoist-inspired &quot;red&quot; culture and launched a crackdown on &quot;black&quot; organised crime, won the admiration of many residents. But others were disturbed by his ruthless tactics in the anti-gang drive and by his obvious ambition. He was toppled after his former police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to the US consulate in Chongqing in February 2012 and told diplomats that Bo&apos;s wife, Gu Kailai, had murdered the British businessman Neil Heywood in November 2011. The 41-year-old&apos;s death was initially ascribed to natural causes. Gu was given a suspended death sentence for the murder last year and a family servant was jailed as her accomplice, although numerous questions remain about the case. Wang was jailed for 15 years for defection, accepting bribes, abusing power and initially covering up Heywood&apos;s murder. Although state media have described Bo&apos;s trial in courtroom number five as &quot;open&quot;, foreign journalists who applied for seats were told that they had already been filled. Spokespeople for the intermediate court said there will be a press briefing when the court adjourns. Bo&apos;s case is the biggest political drama since the 1980 trial of the Gang of Four for their crimes in the cultural revolution. While other politburo members have been prosecuted \u2013 notably the former Shanghai party boss Chen Liangyu, jailed for 18 years for bribery and abuse of power in 2008 \u2013 none have been as influential as Bo and none fell in such extraordinary fashion. Bo and Gu&apos;s son, Bo Guagua, who lives in the US, said this week that he hoped his father would be given the chance &quot;to answer his critics and defend himself without constraints of any kind&quot;. Lawyers hired by Bo&apos;s family were not permitted to represent him. &quot;Bo is famous for &apos;cracking down on the black&apos;. Now Bo suffers the &apos;cracking down on the black&apos;.

Scientists discovered the strain by accident while testing chickens, ducks, geese and other birds for the H7N9 virus that has infected more than 130 people and killed 40 since it was first detected in March. The new strain, H7N7, poses a potential threat to people, according to lab tests which found that the virus caused severe pneumonia in ferrets, which are used as proxies for humans in flu research. An international team led by Yi Guan, a flu specialist at the University of Hong Kong, took samples from chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, partridges and quail at markets in Shandong and Zhejiang provinces to the north and south of Shanghai, and further samples from markets in Guangdong. They found H7N9 in chickens in Rizhao, Shandong, and the new H7N7 in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. The discovery that H7N9 still lurks in chickens at markets has raised fears that it could break out again in people and evolve into a more virulent form. Genetic tests suggest that the virus arrived in China with migratory water fowl from east Asia, jumped into domestic ducks, and then into chickens on at least two occasions. Guan said Chinese authorities may have to close hundreds of live poultry markets for good to prevent lethal strains of bird flu spreading through the human population. The March outbreak of H7N9 led health officials in China to close scores of live poultry markets in the Shanghai area, but many reopened within a month or two when cases of human infections began to fall. At the time, Keiji Fukuda, an assistant director general at the World Health Organisation, said it was unlikely the virus had &quot;simply disappeared&quot;. Guan&apos;s study confirms the virus is still circulating in birds, alongside related viruses that may also be a danger to people. &quot;The virus is still at large. It&apos;s still in the birds,&quot; Guan said. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t think that it will disappear naturally.&quot; Most people who caught H7N9 visited live poultry markets before they fell ill. Markets in Shanghai sell about 175 million chickens a year, 120 million of which are bought live, according to the city&apos;s agricultural department. Since they are the source of so many infections, Guan said, &quot;the authorities should seriously reconsider having live poultry markets in big cities&quot;. Instead, the birds should be killed at a central slaughterhouse and sent on to market, to reduce human contact with the live animals. The Chinese government is considering closing markets in Nanjing and Suzhou as part of a pilot project, and ultimately hopes to shift consumer tastes towards frozen chicken. Writing in the journal Nature, Guan calls for long-term surveillance of viruses in birds, to give health authorities early warning of dangerous strains that emerge. &quot;The discovery of a novel H7N7 lineage that can infect ferrets reminds us that even if H7N9 does not return, there are risks lurking amongst the great diversity of avian influenza viruses,&quot; said Peter Horby at Oxford University&apos;s clinical research unit in Hanoi, Vietnam. &quot;The data do all point to live poultry markets being a major source of human infections with H7N9 virus,&quot; he added. &quot;Moving live poultry markets out of urban areas may reduce the frequency of contact between infected birds or contaminated environments and humans, but there is a range of interventions that could reduce the risks of these markets being hubs for transmission and reservoirs of infection.&quot; In the past, better cleaning procedures, bird-free &quot;rest days&quot;, and segregation of animals at markets helped slow the spread of the H5N1 strain of bird flu.", "tags": ["Bird flu", "Society", "Health", "World news", "Infectious diseases", "Medical research", "Microbiology", "Science", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Veterinary medicine"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-21T17:51:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/china-major-political-trials-bo-xilai-timeline", "sentences": ["2006  Chen Liangyu, Shanghai&apos;s party secretary and a politburo member, is toppled; state news agency Xinhua warns he has created &quot;malign political effects&quot;."], "title": "China's major political trials \u2013 a timeline", "article": "1980  The Gang of Four and the &quot;Lin Biao clique&quot; are tried for their roles in the Cultural Revolution in a partially televised trial in Beijing that lasts weeks.

These included allegations that it falsified expenses in China between 2006 and 2009 that allowed its sales representatives to provide gifts and hospitality.

The firm had about 10 employees. &quot;Among the 500 investigative reports seized by police, more than 10 were found to have infringed on Chinese citizens&apos; right of privacy,&quot; the Xinhua report quoted police as saying. A consulting company registered by the couple in Hong Kong in 2003 did not have an office or any employees, the Shanghai law enforcement agent Lu Wei told CCTV. &quot;You can say it was just a shell company,&quot; he said. In China an arrest typically means police believe they have enough evidence for a case to be brought to trial. Detentions can last for weeks and end in release without charges being filed.

Herm\u00e8s, best known for its \u00a34,500 Birkin bag favoured by Victoria Beckham and Julia Roberts, saw sales rise 11% to \u20ac1.77bn (\u00a31.5bn) as operating profits soared 14% to \u20ac584.1m for the first half of the year. The results gave the group an impressive 33% profit margin, which would be a record for the company if it is maintained for the rest of the year. Demand for silk scarves was strong, with Asian customers particularly keen to keep up the insatiable appetite for luxury goods in south-east Asia. However, watch sales fell. Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, grew 17%, but they rose by 13% in France and 15% in the rest of Europe thanks in part to Asian tourists taking items back home. Luxury shoemaker Ferragamo also saw a healthy boost in sales, up 11% to \u20ac625m (\u00a3533m), as Asian shoppers and well-heeled tourists in Europe snapped up its wares. The Asia Pacific region is now the best-selling area for the company, which counts Lady Gaga and Angelina Jolie among its fans, accounting for 38% of sales \u2013 up 13%. European sales rose 14% and account for 26.7% of the total, but the company put the surprise rise down to wealthy Asian, Russian and Middle Eastern tourists. Net profits for the first six months of the year rose 81% to \u20ac81m. Several prominent luxury brands have reported strong sales across Asia, or see Asian tourist customers as a key driving force for their businesses. Last month Kering Group, owner of Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, saw sales in China jump 19%, while the British brand Burberry recently revealed double-digit growth in China and the opening of two new Shanghai stores.

Shanghai topped the OECD&apos;s league table with 14.6% of students, while Finland was the best in Europe with 8.5%. The OECD said the results were important to show the depth of a nation&apos;s talent pool for future economic growth, with the most proficient students being the most likely innovators and producers of new knowledge and technologies. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD&apos;s deputy director for education and skills, said: &quot;High-level skills across the three key subject areas are critical if countries are to create workers able to compete in the global market for jobs.

While a chief executive&apos;s top priority is day-to-day operations, directors&apos; main job is to think big, look out for long-term material risks to shareholder interest and advise on strategic opportunities. By these standards, sustainability should be a natural fit for most directors. In practice, though, boards have engaged less with sustainability than many CEOs or shareholders would like. A study by EY (formerly Ernst &amp; Young) that looked at all shareholder proxy initiatives found that the largest share, 45%, dealt with environment and social issues - and, in the past five years, shareholders voted to support these initiatives at steadily higher rates.  &quot;Investors see sustainability questions as highly material to company strategy,&quot; says Aron Cramer, CEO of BSR. &quot;Whether it&apos;s the decision to enter frontier markets like Myanmar or how best to operate in a climate-constrained world, these factors materially effect whether a business thrives or not. These are exactly the kind of things boards should be thinking about.&quot; Sustainability-minded CEOs are looking for some help from their boards, too. A 2010 poll of CEOs conducted by the UN Global Compact concluded that 93% of chief executives wanted their board members to discuss and act on environmental, social and governance issues. Yet that same year, only 75% of CEO respondents reported that their company directors took an active role in &quot;considering and acting on sustainability&quot;.  If both investors and CEOs are pushing for boards to get smarter about sustainability, it&apos;s curious that progress has been so slow. The culprits, Cramer says, are corporate convention and a lack of education. Directors are typically drawn from financial, legal and management backgrounds; thus very few have formal sustainability training.  The UN Global Compact - the world&apos;s largest corporate citizenship and sustainability initiative - hopes to tackle this sustainability-IQ deficit with its LEAD Board Programme, which it&apos;s getting ready to trial this fall. So far, five companies have agreed to trial the [program, which will consist of two half-day sessions delivered by an expert mediator: power and gas utility Enel and petroleum producer Eni (both of Italy); power and gas utility Eskom (of South Africa); chemicals maker Yara (of Norway); and cellular company SK Telekom (of South Korea).  Five best practices for boards The UNGC has been developing the program since January of 2011, consulting with Cramer and a dozen or so other global sustainability leaders. Some of the top practices the program will emphasize include: * Define the business case for sustainability. Boards should help define how and why sustainability can benefit shareholder interest by boosting sales, cutting costs and/or enhancing profits. Once directors map out the issues that are most material to the company, they can single out top priorities, which in turn can help the chief executive lead the mission \u2013 and get buy-in from employees and business partners.  * Establish or approve targets. Just as they do for sales, market share growth, and other key indicators, boards should help establish or approve sustainability targets \u2013 both in the short- and long-term \u2013 for their companies&apos; sustainability performance and include them in the business strategy. A wide range of metrics is available, from mature standards such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index to more industry-specific measures, or early-stage metrics can be developed in house.  * Set clear standards for performance and recruitment. Boards should align annual performance reviews of incumbent executives with criteria that make sustainability a priority, just as they do with stock price, sales growth and other conventional performance indicators. When hunting for a new executive, boards should include sustainability in the search criteria. Candidates should be able to demonstrate clear understanding of \u2013 and a commitment to \u2013 their industry&apos;s best sustainability practices.  * Link remuneration to long-term goals. Executive bonuses have long been linked to short-term financial targets. Given that sustainability stabilizes growth over the long term, but must be implemented in the near term, it follows that CEOs should be rewarded along both timelines. For example, progress toward long-term interests can be rewarded by linking part of pay to stocks, bonds or reserve payments released a decade or so in the future. For near-term rewards, boards can link a share of CEO&apos;s regular cash compensation to the achievement of year-to-year sustainability objectives. * Take responsibility for implementation and communication. Communicating sustainability achievements to shareholders is also vital, whether in a separate sustainability report or integrated into the financial reporting. Directors should also formally sign off on the company&apos;s sustainability report. Although this is not legally necessary in most jurisdictions, director signatures send a high-profile confirmation to stakeholders that sustainability and transparency are company priorities. Required reading If all goes according to plan, the curriculum will be tweaked according to feedback from the pilot companies and then rolled out to all comers in 2014.  In time, these voluntary lessons may become required reading in some markets, Cramer notes. South Africa was the first country to mandate an integrated reporting standard, including sustainability metrics, for listed companies. Trading exchanges in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Sao Paolo are moving in a similar direction, he says.  As the sustainability reporting standards spread, more corporate directors will want to get up to speed, before they&apos;re obliged to do so.

The names of Chery, Xiaomi and Baidu are synonymous with cars, mobile phones and internet search in China but they do not resonate abroad in the way that Ford, Samsung and Google straddle the globe. Likewise, there is no Chinese equivalent of Sony, Boeing or Coca-Cola, despite the ambition of the political hierarchy to convert a nation of 1.3bn people into a consumption-driven juggernaut. That lack of a worldwide champion means that Made in China lacks prestige as a label, despite the country&apos;s importance as the world&apos;s factory floor, making everything from iPads to Topshop garments. And that reputation as a global manufacturing hub is one of the problems, nurturing a perception that China is synonymous with cheap, low-quality goods. Newspaper headlines in the west declaim stories about China&apos;s toxic baby milk, lead-contaminated toys and fake pharmaceuticals. But this is changing, as China&apos;s leaders force that economic shift from export-based growth to consumer spending. They are pumping money into research and development so that Chinese brands can compete with foreign rivals in a burgeoning domestic market. Furthermore, many of these companies have taken that baton and are running towards foreign markets, with the hope that global success will result. Much of the push comes in the form of state subsidies \u2013 according to the state-run China Daily newspaper, the country spent \u00a3105bn on research and development last year. A number of Chinese companies have delivered high-quality products abroad, mainly through combining with other international conglomerates. For example, computer maker Lenovo bought IBM&apos;s PC division in 2005 and five years later Geely Automobile bought Volvo from Ford. But analysts say China&apos;s quest to deliver a global brand, while fuelled by an abundance of cash and ambition, may face insurmountable obstacles such as a rigid corporate culture and a top-down approach to innovation. The draconian education system encourages rote memorisation over creativity, while its political system discourages risk-taking and going against the grain. &quot;There&apos;s a conflict of interest that China has \u2013 one which supports as well as deters innovation \u2013 and that is central government control,&quot; says Bill Dodson, the Shanghai-based author of China Fast Forward: The Technologies, Green Industries and Innovations Driving the Mainland&apos;s Future. He adds: &quot;China says OK, we&apos;re going to identify 20 companies to go out and become global brand champions, and we&apos;re going to give them whatever money and resources they need to do that. But if the companies become too big for their britches, or snap back at central government, or become too autonomous, there&apos;s a reining in.&quot; Analysts point to Japan and South Korea&apos;s success in developing global brands as evidence that China could soon follow. Before the 1980s, Japan&apos;s manufacturing base endured the same derision as China&apos;s, but that was before brands such as Sony, Nissan, Toyota and Honda established themselves globally. South Korea&apos;s capital, Seoul, was once reliant on foreign aid to overcome the devastation of the Korean war. It is now one of the world&apos;s most technologically advanced urban centres. Samsung, founded more than 70 years ago as a trading company, is now one of South Korea&apos;s two most successful conglomerates. Its subsidiaries deal in everything from theme parks to life insurance. Taken as a whole, it produces a fifth of the country&apos;s global exports. Its other global superpower, Hyundai, was founded in 1947 as a construction firm and began exporting cars to the US in the 1980s. This month, it unveiled a \u00a331,000 concept car, the HCD-14 Genesis, which it hopes will take on the world&apos;s top brands. Among China&apos;s biggest hopes for a global breakthrough is car maker Chery, founded in 1997. Its most popular model is the QQ City Car, a pod-like hatchback that seems ubiquitous among China&apos;s middle-class families. The company has established joint ventures with a number of foreign brands, including Jaguar Land Rover and in 2011 it exported around a quarter of its production total. Yet Chery has yet to create an image that will turn heads in New York and London. &quot;While Chery is enhancing its hard power actively, it also pays close attention to fostering soft power,&quot; boasts the company&apos;s English website, taking a cue from the country&apos;s diplomatic rhetoric. &quot;With vigorous culture of innovation, Chery has realised the great-leap-forward development and has received deep concern and great attention from the leaders of the country and the Party.&quot; Sceptics say that Chinese brands like Chery will never surpass foreign rivals unless they can embrace fundamental principles of innovation \u2013 open communication, risk-taking \u2013 that require more than cash. This extends to creative industries, such as music, film, and fashion. &quot;We get these endless things from the government saying there should be more innovation and brand building,&quot; says Paul French, chief China market strategist at market research firm Mintel. &quot;But there isn&apos;t anything behind it. The problem is that no one really wants to invest in innovative design. It&apos;s very market-led. So if reports come to the stores that red shirts are selling, they&apos;ll tell their in-house designers to design more red shirts. This means the designers don&apos;t get a chance to do anything.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think anyone in government understands creative industries,&quot; French adds. &quot;They spent 60 years driving creativity out of the system. To reintroduce it in 10 minutes is a bit hopeful.&quot; Chinese companies are trying to buck that trend. For instance, Huawei, the world&apos;s largest telecoms equipment maker, headquartered in Shenzhen, has more than 140,000 employees, nearly half of whom work in R&amp;D. The company applied for 54,000 patents in 2012, 14,000 of them outside China. However, Chinese technology upstarts will struggle to make inroads into western markets, judging by Huawei&apos;s sometimes faltering progress, because of the political problems they face. Huawei has been barred from operating in the US because of security concerns and its UK operations are the subject of a review by Britain&apos;s national security adviser, Sir Kim Darroch. Robin Li, boss of Baidu, China&apos;s leading search engine, announced a plan to crack the Japanese market in 2007. Last year, when diplomatic tempers flared amid a territorial dispute over a series of islands in the resource-rich East China Sea, Baidu&apos;s main page displayed a cartoon illustration of the islands beneath an oversized Chinese flag. Japanese consumers were incensed. The company has lost more than \u00a360m on the project. WeChat, a smartphone instant messaging app similar to WhatsApp in the US, has taken off in south-east Asia and recently launched an advertising campaign in India featuring Bollywood stars. WeChat has a leg up on its competitors because of its easy-to-use interface and sophisticated integration of features: it combines an Instagram-like photo-sharing tool, a voice-messaging service, and an array of social functions designed for meeting strangers. Yet in January, users discovered that sending politically sensitive terms across international borders returned the words &quot;the message you sent contains restricted words. Please check it again.&quot; WeChat developer Tencent called the incident a &quot;glitch&quot;. &quot;In terms of China&apos;s consumer internet, more than any cultural factors, the biggest barrier would be the regulations and protectionism surrounding the internet,&quot; says Kai Lukoff, co-founder of TechRice, a blog about China&apos;s tech sector. &quot;You have this iron curtain 2.0 that separates the internet culture in China from that of the rest of the world. So \u2026 when Chinese companies go abroad, they feel woefully out of place.&quot; Yet that has not stopped them from trying. This week, popular smartphone maker Xiaomi pulled off a coup by hiring Google&apos;s former vice-president for Android product management, Hugo Barra, to help it expand its global presence. The two-year-old company has established a reputation for producing high-quality, low-cost Android phones. The low-cost smartphone market is drawing Apple&apos;s interest, but Xiaomi is ahead, having already expanded to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Experts say Chinese companies in newer industries such as smartphones stand a better chance of gaining traction abroad. &quot;In western markets we have all these legacies, the infrastructure, built in: the desktop PC, the landline, the fax. In China, they could just leap ahead to the latest and greatest,&quot; says Rebecca Fannin, the author of Silicon Dragon: How China is Winning the Tech Race. Chinese companies have gone to great lengths to avoid the stigma associated with their country&apos;s brands. &quot;They produce a lot of stuff which western people like and use, they&apos;re just not under a Chinese brand name,&quot; says Sam Lipoff, a doctoral student at Harvard Business School who researches innovation in China. Domestic conglomerates often acquire foreign brands, and encourage them to maintain their native identities. Some of these deals have been extremely ambitious, such as the acquisition of British yacht maker Sunseeker by the Dalian Wanda conglomerate. Herborist, a Chinese cosmetics firm, has taken a different tack, marketing its products internationally as &quot;made in Shanghai&quot;, evoking images of bustle and grandeur, rather than dark industrial-belt factories. &quot;This begs the question: what makes a company Chinese?&quot; Lipoff says. &quot;That its workers are in China? Or its offices? Or it sells to Chinese customers? Or has a Chinese name? This is an important thing to think about.&quot;", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "Business", "China", "Mobile phones", "Automotive industry", "Internet", "Telecoms", "Technology", "World news", "Technology sector"], "publicationDate": "2013-08-31T23:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/01/best-visial-arts-autumn-2013-paul-klee-vienna", "sentences": ["Britain&apos;s China autumn also includes a solo show by Shanghai artist Zhang Enli, who is to create an ambitious painted installation at the ICA (16 October to 22\u00a0December)."], "title": "The best visual arts of 2013: from Paul Klee at Tate Modern to Vienna at the National Gallery", "article": "Paul Klee In his own eyes, Paul Klee (1879\u20131940) was a logical thinker whose art was built by rational processes.

Long before Leonardo da Vinci drew his first landscape, Chinese artists were painting seductive and contemplative panoramas of mountains and forests. These prodigious pictures will be shown at the V&amp;A in its autumn blockbuster Masterpieces of Chinese Painting 700-1900 (26\u00a0October to 19 January), an encounter with some of the world&apos;s most dazzling and thoughtful art. This survey of China&apos;s ethereal paintings is fleshed out by The Chinese Art Book, published by Phaidon on 14 October, a gorgeously laid out overview in which classics like Chen Rong&apos;s Nine Dragons, painted in 1244, - the original is in the V&amp;A show - are juxtaposed with contemporary artists from heroic Ai Weiwei to the fireworks of Cai Guo-Qiang. Britain&apos;s China autumn also includes a solo show by Shanghai artist Zhang Enli, who is to create an ambitious painted installation at the ICA (16 October to 22\u00a0December). It&apos;s one thing for critics and curators to single out the next rising star from China, expecting hushed reverence from the general public, but quite another for us to genuinely engage with the art of China\u00a0past and present. That&apos;s why China&apos;s moment this autumn matters. We can see at the V&amp;A, or in The Chinese Art Book, how Ai Weiwei comments on millennia of creativity when he exhibits porcelain replicas of sesame seeds: back in 940 AD, when dark ages Britain was hunkering down against Viking raids, Chinese artist Huang Quan was painting profoundly realistic studies of birds and animals.

At the beginning of the window most Arsenal fans would have wanted a forward, defensive midfielder, centre-half and/or goalkeeper. In other words a midfield ball-player was down the list. But the chance to take Mesut Ozil was one they had to seize. The deals (selected) In Mesut Ozil (Real Madrid, \u00a342.5m), Mathieu Flamini (Milan, free), Yaya Sanogo (Auxerre, free), Emiliano Viviano (Palermo, loan) Out Gervinho (Roma, \u00a38m), Vito Mannone (Sunderland, \u00a31.5m), Marouane Chamakh (Crystal Palace, free), Andr\u00e9 Santos (Flamengo, undisc), Andrey Arshavin (Zenit St Petersburg, free), Denilson (S\u00e3o Paulo, free) Aston Villa Did they get what they wanted? More depth to a young squad and securing Christian Benteke on a new contract represents an encouraging window for Paul Lambert. Antonio Luna has made an immediate impression and Villa have removed several high-earners from the books.

Can be pleased with their dealings as they acquired Premier League experience in Tottenham Hotspur&apos;s Steven Caulker and Peter Odemwingie, while the spiky Chilean midfielder Gary Medel could prove a star buy for Malky Mackay.

They missed out on Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s principal target, Wayne Rooney, but signed a short-term alternative in Samuel Eto&apos;o and will have enjoyed trumping Tottenham for Willian. Marco van Ginkel and Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle were interesting, younger additions.

In as much as they completely overhauled the squad who won promotion, they have achieved their aims. Ian Holloway had recruited 11 players before deadline day, with the splurge continuing into the last few hours of the window.

A new owner and some useful additions \u2013 Scott Parker and Darren Bent should thrive, Maarten Stekelenburg represents pedigree and Adel Taarabt can excite. Fernando Amorebieta and Derek Boateng may need time to settle.

Steve Bruce has always been a great trader and this window was no exception. He will be particularly pleased with the signing of Tom Huddlestone.

Manchester City spent \u00a388.5m on Fernandinho, J\u00e9sus Navas, Stevan Jovetic and Alvaro Negredo early to allow Manuel Pellegrini time to bed them into the squad. The later arrival of Mart\u00edn Demichelis for \u00a33.5m finished off a satisfactory summer. The deals (selected) In Fernandinho (Shakhtar Donetsk, \u00a330m), Stevan Jovetic (Fiorentina, \u00a322m), J\u00e9sus Navas (Seville, \u00a317m), Alvaro Negredo (Seville, \u00a316.4m), Mart\u00edn Demichelis (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, \u00a33.5m) Out Carlos T\u00e9vez (Juventus, \u00a310m), Denis Su\u00e1rez (Barcelona, \u00a31.3m), Maicon (Roma, undisclosed), Wayne Bridge (Reading, free), Roque Santa Cruz (M\u00e1laga, free), Kolo Tour\u00e9 (Liverpool, free), Gareth Barry (Everton, loan) Manchester United Did they get what they wanted? The answer ranges between a qualified &quot;yes&quot; to a resounding &quot;no&quot; after Marouane Fellaini arrived and Ander Herrera and Fabio Coentr\u00e3o did not. David Moyes began the summer targeting Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara and Cesc F\u00e1bregas while Leighton Baines also escaped United&apos;s grasp.

Alan Pardew said he wanted two strikers and to hold on to his best players. He has achieved the latter while Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my has arrived on a season-long loan from QPR. So Newcastle \u2013 who signed five players in January \u2013 are not in too bad shape.

Chris Hughton has been under pressure to add creativity and firepower and he has certainly done so; the loss of Grant Holt has been offset by the signings of Ricky van Wolfswinkel, Gary Hooper, Johan Elmander and Nathan Redmond. The deals (selected) In Ricky van Wolfswinkel (Sporting Lisbon, \u00a38.5m), Leroy Fer (FC Twente, \u00a37m), Gary Hooper (Celtic, \u00a35m), Martin Olsson (Blackburn Rovers, \u00a32.5m), Nathan Redmond (Birmingham, \u00a32.2m), Javier Garrido (Lazio, \u00a31.28m), Carlo Nash (Stoke, free), Johan Elmander (Galatasaray, loan) Out Grant Holt (Wigan, \u00a32m), James Vaughan (Huddersfield, \u00a31m), Tom Adeyemi (Birmingham, free) Southampton Did they get what they wanted? Southampton&apos;s dealings demonstrated this club&apos;s progression under Nicola Cortese&apos;s stewardship. Dejan Lovren was an eye-catching arrival from Lyon, Victor Wanyama enjoyed the Champions League at Celtic last season, while Pablo Osvaldo arrived with a reputation. The deals (selected) In Pablo Daniel Osvaldo (Roma, \u00a315m), Victor Wanyama (Celtic, \u00a312.5m), Dejan Lovren (Lyon, \u00a38.5m) Out Vegard Forren (Molde FK, undisclosed), Dean Hammond (Leicester, undisclosed), Sam Hoskins (Yeovil, free), Richard Chaplow (Millwall, free), Steve de Ridder (Utrecht, free), Ryan Dickson (Colchester, free), Ben Reeves (MK Dons, free), Frazer Richardson (Middlesbrough, free) Stoke City Did they get what they wanted? A little mixed as Mark Hughes addressed the shortage of left-side players in his squad but the window overall was a struggle. The new manager brought in seven players and allowed 12 to leave, with Michael Owen also retiring.

Rapid growth in air travel means even more people will be visiting them in the future. So where does the world want to visit, do business, or live? Ipsos Mori has surveyed more than 18,000 people in 24 countries, to find out. The most striking finding from the Ipsos Top Cities research is that there are a handful of &quot;superbrand&quot; cities. New York is the clear leader, but London and Paris, in joint second place, do very well indeed, chosen by large numbers of people as places they want to go. But the world&apos;s public don&apos;t just think about America and Europe. The United Arab Emirates may be home to the tiniest fraction of the world&apos;s population, but punches far above its weight in terms of profile, as witnessed by Abu Dhabi&apos;s fourth place as somewhere to visit. Meanwhile, Sydney&apos;s claims to truly be a &quot;world city&quot; are confirmed. It&apos;s clear that the global public is quite discerning and knows the cities well enough to avoid having to make hasty generalisations. New York is the place to make money. Paris is the best place to spend it. But for us, the surprise star is Zurich, which beats all its rivals in being the place the world&apos;s public would most like to live. London receives a global vote of confidence. It is a genuine all-rounder, appearing in the top five for each question, an achievement only matched by New York. If we restrict our focus to the young, it is London, along with New York, which is the most popular place to live for under-35s all over the world. And when we look at the views of the 11 European countries, London is the continent&apos;s most important city. Together with positive signs for the UK economy generally and in the wake of London 2012, this is both a sign for celebration by Boris Johnson and a prompt: what now needs to be done to ensure London continues to punch above its weight? Will all the people who want to move to London be welcomed or even housed? Three hundred miles away from London, Paris will not be too downbeat. The capital of the world&apos;s most visited country is the clear winner as the world&apos;s favourite place to visit, whether respondents are from Argentina, Australia or Canada. But Paris falls down on its reputation as somewhere to do business, and this will surely worry French policy-makers as they debate what needs to happen to get France&apos;s economy moving more quickly. Just 7% see France as one of the world&apos;s top business locations. It is beaten by Washington, a city not normally associated with the commercial world, as well as Mexico City, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Shanghai. Rome is in a similar position, with just 2% seeing it as a business centre, only a tenth the number who rate it a top place to visit on holiday. At the other end of the spectrum are Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, which perform strongly as places for business, but are not seen as attractive places to live. There are also questions to be asked in those cities which, despite their status, size, history and other attributes, have a relatively low profile, at least when looked at on the world stage. Cities in this cohort include Madrid, Istanbul (fieldwork was conducted before this summer&apos;s protests) and Bangkok. President Putin may be disappointed to see Moscow ranked alongside Brussels, in 31st place \u2013 if he wants more tourists he has lots to do. Finally, there are the cities that are just not popular at all. Tel Aviv, Tehran and Karachi are anchored to the foot of the table, and barely trouble the scorer. Some will be surprised to see Budapest, Casablanca and Warsaw occupying the places just above them. What of the future? Well, this is the first survey Ipsos has conducted of this kind, and we look forward to tracking our cities&apos; progress, perhaps adding a few more (such as Dubai) to the field as well. One thing to watch will be the perspectives of different generations, and how they evolve. At the moment, there is a broad consensus between younger and older people on the best places for business and best to visit. But on the best place to live we have an entirely different pattern: for the world&apos;s 50- to 64-year-olds, it&apos;s Zurich, Sydney and Toronto which occupy the top three places. But among the under-35s, it&apos;s London, New York and Paris. Can London hold on to its top slot as this younger generation get older?

The brief encounter. The dangerous liaison. Our usual descriptions fascinate briefly, then fizzle out. They don&apos;t reveal enough. In fiction, as in life, I&apos;m drawn to questions of who and how we love, the losses we fear, and what we&apos;ll risk \u2013 absurdly or boldly \u2013 to feel alive under the skin.  For most of us, the thrill of a story about an infidelity is less about sex than it is about intimacy, that magnetic line of connection between two bodies and their secret selves. Intimacy shared with another person is often the first real betrayal to any union, and the first plunge out of one&apos;s depth.  In fiction, characters misjudge the depth of the fall. Others rush headlong into the stuff of life. As they do, they&apos;re laid bare \u2013 literally (almost certainly) and metaphorically (always). We see what it is to be human: to yearn, to feel joy, to suffer and to see the world transformed. 1. Madame Bovary by Gustav Flaubert  Who can forget Emma and L\u00e9on&apos;s furious cab ride through the streets of Rouen, their illicit passion concealed from view? In 1857, following publication, the Second Empire tried Flaubert for offences to morality and religion. He was acquitted, and the novel became an immediate bestseller. From the distance of the 21st century, it is easy to lose sight of just how radical Madame Bovary was when it first appeared, not only in its new &quot;objective&quot; style of prose, but also in its refusal to either romanticise or sermonise. Flaubert confessed to weeping at times as he wrote; he sympathised so much with Emma in her final days that he felt physically ill. 2. Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy Anna and Vronsky. The busy train compartment. That first passing glance, as if of recognition \u2026 In 1872, Tolstoy saw the wrecked body of a woman who was abandoned by her married lover, a landowner friend of the family. The woman had thrown herself under a train. Was it a tragedy or a grim reinstatement of the natural order of marriage and family? Tolstoy initially planned to tell the story of a woman who &quot;ruined herself&quot; with an extramarital affair, but Anna instead emerged vivid and bright. 3. Lady with Lapdog by Anton Chekhov  Short stories, in their brevity and intensity, are natural vehicles for the study of illicit love and infidelity. In Lady with Lapdog, the married cad Gurov spots Anna Sergeyevna, his next victim, while dallying in the seaside resort of Yalta: &quot;A young woman walking along the promenade: she was fair, not very tall \u2026&quot; Anna is half Gurov&apos;s age and passionate, but he considers her unremarkable. She departs for home and husband, but Gurov is changed: &quot;He felt profound compassion, he longed to be sincere, tender \u2026&quot; Chekhov was branded the &quot;high priest of\u00a0unprincipled\u00a0art&quot; because he refused to pass authorial judgment upon his characters. 4. Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover by DH Lawrence  Frieda Lawrence reportedly told friends that her husband had been impotent, an apparent symptom of his tuberculosis, since 1926. Frieda, we&apos;re told, took lovers. If these turbulent details of the marriage are true, one can imagine the personal sense of loss and grief that fuelled the transformation of that personal tale into the story of Constance Chatterley, whose upper-class landowner husband was paralysed from the waist down during the Great War. Sections of text were omitted on its UK publication by Martin Secker. Only later, in the famous obscenity trial of 1960, would the hoo-ha be hosed down for good \u2013 and the jurors were thanked by Penguin Books in the dedication to a new, triumphant edition. 5. The End of the Affair by Graham Greene Has a prose style ever been so sharp and so nuanced? The complications of a love triangle come into devastating focus in this story of love between the bomb blasts of the second world war: &quot;We paid no attention to the sirens. They didn&apos;t matter. We weren&apos;t afraid of dying that way.&quot; Sarah Miles \u2013 modelled loosely upon Greene&apos;s lover, Catherine Walston \u2013 is the wife of the kindly, but seemingly deadbeat, civil servant Henry Miles. There is much more to Henry than meets the eye, but this is really the story of Sarah&apos;s lover. Maurice Bendrix, a middle-aged writer, is our narrator and a man who, years later, after Sarah&apos;s death, is haunted by her exasperating and mysterious decision to end their affair. 6. Lust, Caution by Eileen Chang  In Japanese-occupied Shanghai, a beautiful student actress named Jaizai is asked by a student rebel group to take part in a &quot;honey-trap&quot; operation to help arrange the assassination of Yi, a middle-aged collaborator and an official in the puppet government. Firstly she befriends his wife and then stealthily moves into their social circle. In the translation I read, I often found it difficult to get a feeling for the quality of the prose. But this story of infidelity \u2013 Yi&apos;s calculated passion, Jaizai&apos;s deceit, and her last-minute betrayal of her political cause (&quot;Run,&quot; she said softly) \u2013 raises profound and tantalising questions, to which I suspect there are no answers. 7. Asylum by Patrick McGrath Stella Raphael is the wife of Max, a forensic psychiatrist who has taken a job in a high-security mental hospital, where she meets Edward Stark, a talented sculptor who is confined to the hospital for the murder of his wife. Asylum is a gripping study of erotic obsession, and in the making of it, McGrath re-invented the gothic form for contemporary fiction. The story is edgy and relentless. It knocked the breath out of me. 8. Intimacy by Hanif Kureishi  I remember very clearly the furore this book caused when it was published. How could a slim novella create such a blast? It&apos;s an autobiographical story based on Kureishi&apos;s affair with the much younger woman for whom he left his partner. I didn&apos;t read it when it first came out, because I was sure it would leave a very bad taste in my mouth. Although I finished it a few years ago, I&apos;m still uneasy with the power of a writer to claim an authority on the page and, in so doing, to betray the lives and memories of others. That said, Intimacy also surprised and moved me with its wit, delicacy and complete lack of pretension. 9. Notes on a Scandal by Zoe Heller &quot;It is mad to describe a middle-aged adulteress as innocent, and yet there is something fundamentally innocent about Sheba. It goes without saying that she is capable of all kinds of sin. But she is not one of life&apos;s schemers.&quot; Such is history teacher Barbara Covett&apos;s appraisal of her new colleague, Sheba Hart. Sheba&apos;s husband, Richard, is much older than his wife, and their marriage is becalmed. The blooming youth of her daughter, Polly, makes Sheba more aware of her own physical and sexual decline. Enter Steven Connolly, the underage pupil Sheba will have an affair with. Somehow, quite madly, I missed this novel when it was shortlisted for the 2003 Booker prize. I gulped it down belatedly, in a single, marvellous sitting. 10. A Bit on the Side by William Trevor Once again, the compression of the short story form \u2013 its innately fleeting quality \u2013 is almost uncannily suited to the subject of affairs, and also to the evocation of their intensity and their often inevitable endings. With Trevor, as with Chekhov, we are in a story populated by ordinary people: he, a married accountant; she, a newly divorced secretary. Yet A Bit on the Side is a profoundly compassionate story; it examines the hard-edged solitudes of life and it responds with tenderness and a sharp, far-seeing eye. \u2022 Unexploded by Alison MacLeod is published by Hamish Hamilton and longlisted for the 2013 Man Booker prize", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Fiction", "Short stories"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-04T15:15:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/04/why-cheap-meat-costs-earth", "sentences": ["In her book Frankenstein&apos;s Cat, food science writer Emily Anthes describes what she saw at Fudan University in Shanghai: &quot;Peek into the 45,000 mouse cages and you&apos;ll see a collection of misfits."], "title": "Why cheap meat costs the Earth", "article": "In the rich world, each of us consumes or uses 30 or more animals a year (the bulk \u2013 52 of the 59 billion \u2013 are chickens). We don&apos;t, in the nutritional sense, need these animals to feed us \u2013 certainly not in those numbers. Yet, in order to eat them at an acceptable price we have to imprison them, alter them genetically and chemically, and kill them. We have moved inexorably into ever greyer ethical territory. Any planning for a food future that still envisages using animal products and meat must debate the &quot;moral cost&quot;. I am not sentimental. I have killed and butchered many kinds of animals, and have been on prearranged visits to slaughterhouses in Britain and abroad. I have seen the job done carefully and kindly. It would have been better if I had just dropped in to those abattoirs, but the business of meat production is secretive; if it were public, it would lose customers. In some places, the meat trade is less shy: I&apos;ve seen puppies blow-torched in tiny cages to remove their hair before butchering \u2013 a normal village practice in Vietnam. Many moral meat eaters think the horrors of the slaughterhouse are exaggerated. But impartial research by American scientist (and abattoir designer) Temple Grandin reveals extraordinary and unnecessary horrors. She reported &quot;deliberate acts of cruelty occurring on a regular basis&quot; at 32% of the slaughterhouses she visited in the US: 26% of the chicken-killing facilities had abuses that should have meant immediate closure; chickens scalded to remove their feathers, thrown in the trash and found later, still alive; a worker dismembering a fully conscious cow; cows, which are usually stunned then bled while their hearts are still pumping, &quot;waking up on the bleed rail&quot;. &quot;What went on when she wasn&apos;t looking?&quot; asked Jonathan Safran Foer, in his fascinating moral dissection Eating Animals. Cheap meat means corners cut on safety, health and welfare: humane treatment generally slows down a production line. Safran Foer quotes research that shows &quot;demand for lean pig meat \u2026 has led the pork industry to breed pigs that suffer not only more leg and heart problems, but greater excitability, fear, anxiety and stress \u2026 We have focused the awesome power of modern genetic knowledge to bring into being animals that suffer more.&quot; But animals that feel more pain may not be the worst moral horror on the menu. Genetic modification by gene splicing offers the chance to make infinite changes \u2013 removing unwanted features or introducing characteristics from any living thing, be it mammal, fish, insect or flower. Already Chinese scientists are tampering with the genes of laboratory mice to see what they can get. In her book Frankenstein&apos;s Cat, food science writer Emily Anthes describes what she saw at Fudan University in Shanghai: &quot;Peek into the 45,000 mouse cages and you&apos;ll see a collection of misfits. By randomly disabling the rodents&apos; genes, the scientists here are churning out hundreds of odd animals, assembly-line style. They have created mice studded with skin tumours and mice that grow tusks \u2026 One strain ages at warp speed. Another can&apos;t feel pain.&quot; The worry for the moral meat eater is in losing the benchmarks by which we can judge animals&apos; treatment. How will welfare legislation, applied to specific vertebrate species, adapt as the species do \u2013 to, say, a pig with no pain reflex? Academic philosopher Adam Shriver said in 2009 that it may already be possible to &quot;genetically engineer factory-farmed livestock with a reduced or completely eliminated capacity to suffer&quot;. He cites research at Washington and Toronto universities, where the brains of mice have been altered so that, although they still feel pain, they don&apos;t avoid it as untampered mice might. GM scientist Professor Helen Sang, of the Roslin Institute, told me such changes could be pursued using gene-editing techniques. She manipulates poultry genes, splicing together parts of DNA to achieve useful adaptations. What she does is no more than a different way of modifying genomes \u2013 something humans have been doing since they first domesticated animals 10,000 years ago. She explains this with patience and some wariness \u2013 the Daily Mail has described her workplace as &quot;Frankenstein&apos;s farmyard&quot;. Her most famous work, so far, has been in treatments for human illnesses, but her interests lie in more than disease resistance: in GM there are environmental benefits \u2013 as well as productivity and quality improvements \u2013 that will be advantageous to food security and society. Her view is that these benefits can&apos;t be achieved by conventional breeding. &quot;There&apos;s nothing innately wrong in genetic modification, as long as ... you characterise the effects of that carefully \u2013 and you don&apos;t put in antibiotic-resistance genes, or anything like that. But, because people are very suspicious of using these technologies, you can argue that we should concentrate on using them for things that can&apos;t be achieved by selection.&quot; For Sang, there are ethical issues. She is not alone. Judging by the response to an op-ed by Shriver in the New York Times in 2011, people who care about animal rights believe we should stop factory farming rather than modify animals not to suffer. Commentators such as agricultural economist Simon Fairlie say Shriver&apos;s proposal is an attempt to make animals into the &quot;automata&quot; that the philosopher Descartes said they were three centuries ago. Fairlie doesn&apos;t like Shriver&apos;s &quot;lunatic&quot; notion, and neither do I. And, of course, the driver will not be better meat, but meat that is less trouble. Indeed, it should demand a whole new round of debate over meat eating: if society sanctions meat-machine animals with no feelings and no rights, the only feasible way to oppose it would be to be against all meat eating.

Workers are asked to stand for 12-hour shifts with just two 30-minute breaks, six days a week, the non-profit organisation China Labor Watch has claimed. Staff are allegedly working without adequate protective equipment, at risk from chemicals, noise and lasers, for an average of 69 hours a week. Apple has a self-imposed limit of 60 working hours a week. The problems were uncovered at a plant in Wuxi, near Shanghai, where Apple&apos;s first low-cost handset, dubbed the iPhone 5C, is being produced. The plant is owned by Florida-based Jabil Circuit, a US company with 60 plants in 33 countries including Scotland, and a turnover of $17bn (\u00a311bn) a year. Jabil said it had uncovered problems last month and was taking immediate steps to investigate the allegations. Apple said its experts were &quot;already on site&quot; to look into the claims. &quot;It is the duty of national governments to regulate the conduct of their companies abroad,&quot; China Labor Watch argued. &quot;The US government also shares in the responsibility for labour abuses committed by US companies manufacturing in China.&quot; Jabil has 30,000 employees at Wuxi, where cases for the colourful iPhone 5C are being . The majority are hired indirectly through employment agencies, the investigators claim. Local laws set a limit of 30% agency workers in any company&apos;s workforce to prevent the exploitation of staff. In order to be recruited, staff are asked to sign two-year contracts and pay significant sign-up fees, and are also charged to process identification documents, open a bank account for wages, and for intrusive medical examinations. The report, published on Thursday, is based on interviews with about 90 employees and evidence from an undercover investigator who worked at Wuxi for a month. It also claims that female workers were asked to take pregnancy tests, which would be both against Chinese law and a breach of the code of practice imposed last year by Apple on all its suppliers. Apple has made efforts to improve conditions in the factories where its products are assembled after uproar over the treatment of workers at the vast Foxconn factories, where iPhones are assembled. The Jabil factory arranges accommodation for workers in dormitory blocks where some sleep eight to a room, suffering disturbed rest because the rooms are shared by a mixture of day- and night-shift staff. The report claims the base wage at Jabil is 1,500 RMB (\u00a3160) a month, half the average monthly wage in the city of Wuxi. Only by working 100 hours of overtime a month can employees secure an income that matches the average.

We take seriously any allegation that we are not fulfilling that commitment and are taking immediate action to ensure recent allegations are thoroughly investigated and, if found to be credible, corrected.&quot; Apple said in a statement it was &quot;committed to providing safe and fair working conditions&quot; adding: &quot;We lead the industry with far-reaching and specialised audits, the most transparent reporting and educational programmes that enrich the lives of workers who make our products. Apple is the first and only technology company to be admitted to the Fair Labor Association, and we are dedicated to protecting every worker in our supply chain. &quot;We are proud of the work we do with our suppliers to improve conditions for workers. Our programme goes far beyond monitoring by ensuring corrective actions where they are needed and aggressively enforcing our supplier code of conduct wherever Apple products are made. We believe in transparency and accountability, both for our suppliers and ourselves.&quot; Jabil was founded in 1966 in a garage in Detroit by William Morean and James Golden, who combined their first names \u2013 James and Bill \u2013 to christen their company. As American companies such as Apple exported their manufacturing to countries with lower wages, Jabil followed, opening its first plant outside the US in Scotland in 1993.

The situation is desperate for the Ferrari driver. Alonso is 46 points off the lead going into a race on the Italian team&apos;s home soil in front of the most passionate (and one-eyed) supporters in F1. He said: &quot;We need to change this situation and we will be happy finishing in front of [Seb] here in Monza and in Singapore. And finishing in front of Seb means being on the podium minimum. We know how strong he is. If we cannot finish in front of him and keep losing points we need to start thinking of the 2014 project because it will only be six or seven races remaining with a massive points gap.&quot; Lewis Hamilton has similar thoughts about Sunday&apos;s race. &quot;I am definitely not coming to the race and thinking if I finish second it will be OK. I need to be winning.&quot; Third-placed Hamilton is 58 points behind Vettel. He pulled back the lead when he won the Hungarian Grand Prix two races ago but Vettel cancelled that progress when he won the last race in Spa two weeks ago. Hamilton, who won here last year, added: &quot;I would love to have that experience again this year - I&apos;d pay to have that experience. If I&apos;m up there and I&apos;m being booed [as he was last year] that means I&apos;ve won, so I definitely want that.&quot; In a sense there is even more pressure on Alonso&apos;s team-mate, Felipe Massa. According to reports in Italy, this will be his last chance to impress his Ferrari bosses after another disappointing season (he is seventh in the championship with less than half Alonso&apos;s points). In reality Ferrari have not made up their minds about their drivers for next year because the car is their priority. They would love an excuse to keep Massa.Formula One faces an angry backlash from Austin after scheduling a new Mexico Grand Prix on 9 November next year, one week before the GP in Texas. Last year&apos;s inaugural race in Austin was considered to be one of the great successes of the season but a great deal of that success was down to the high number of Mexicans at the Austin circuit. Repeatedly, F1 has made inroads into the vast American market \u2013 Watkins Glen, Indianapolis, Phoenix, for example \u2013 before failing to build on its success, and Austin could be another example. Mexico City has been included in a provisional 21-race calendar for 2014, a schedule which also includes new events in Austria and Russia, although as expected there is no New Jersey on the draft. Teams are known to be against anything more than 20 races, so one of the those listed will probably drop out; Korea, Russia and Mexico all await confirmation. The last Formula One race held in Mexico was in 1992 and it was won by Britain&apos;s Nigel Mansell, his world championship year. A return to Mexico would delight the McLaren driver Sergio P\u00e9rez, who is from Guadalajara and visited his homeland recently. He said: &quot;I hope to see a grand prix here soon. It would be a great opportunity for the country. There&apos;s a lot of enthusiasm for F1 in Mexico. People would love it and it would be a great opportunity for the country.&quot; Perez is one of two Mexican drivers on the grid. The other is Sauber&apos;s Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez. More important even than them, perhaps, is the F1 commerical rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, who is known to have a soft spot for the race in Mexico. 13 April and 19 October are the provisional dates for Korea and Russia. If one date is to be cut from the itinerary the majority of people in F1 would vote for the unloved Korea event to be taken out. 2014 F1 schedule: March: 16 Australia (Melbourne), 23 Malaysia (Sepang).

The world&apos;s second-largest chip maker after Samsung, Hynix supplies a third of the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips sold globally. The company has halted production at its factory in Wuxi near Shanghai after the blaze tore through the foundry for 90 minutes. The impact on prices at the DRAMeXchange, the largest Asian market for components, highlights how device makers face rising costs. Booming smartphone sales mean demand for specialist materials is so high that it can quickly outstrip supply. The cost of the benchmarck DDR3 2-gigabit chip jumped by 30 cents to $1.90 on Thursday, the biggest increase since September 2010, Bloomberg reported. Hynix is said to supply Apple, Samsung, Lenovo, Dell and Sony, which use its components in a range of devices from phones to tablets and laptops. The fire on 4 September during installation of equipment at Wuxi damaged the clean room, which one industry expert said could take half a year to fully rebuild. &quot;We are still investigating the extent of damage,&quot; SK Hynix stated. &quot;Currently, there is no material damage to the fab equipment in the clean room, thus we expect to resume operations in a short time period so that overall production and supply volume would not be materially affected.&quot; The clean room is the heart of the foundry, where chip wafers are produced in an environment controlled to eliminate dust and dampen vibration. Temperature and humidity are also programmed in order to minimise static. &quot;It will take at least half a year before SK Hynix&apos;s damaged clean room is fully rebuilt,&quot; market research firm TrendForce said in a report. &quot;Such an event is likely to cause the price uptrend of PC DRAM and mobile DRAM to continue throughout&quot; the fourth quarter. Hynix, which is headquartered in South Korea and has an estimated 30% of the global DRAM market, saw its shares fall nearly 4% in Seoul on Friday. Samsung, which is the largest supplier of these components with a near 33% share, according to TrendForce, saw a slight lift in its share price.

His post-match assessment was to the point and honest. He had chosen the wrong time to play &quot;a bad match&quot;, he said, adding: &quot;If I&apos;m meant to win every grand slam I play or be in the final \u2026 it&apos;s just very, very difficult just now.&quot; Although Murray&apos;s departure from New York on Thursday night \u2013 from court to press conference to airport in the space of a few hours \u2013 was nearly as swift as his capitulation in three sets to Stanislas Wawrinka, he did not lack for friends in high places. The former world No1 and seven-times grand slam title-winner John McEnroe, who suffered his own soaring highs and swooping crashes, has no doubts Murray will recover quickly from the defeat and believes he should take a break to breathe life into his tennis after a summer in which he added the Wimbledon title to his Olympic gold and US crown. Murray may well heed that advice after joining the Great Britain team for their Davis Cup tie against Croatia in Umag next week, although he is committed to the Masters 1000 tournaments in Shanghai and Paris at the beginning and end of October. &quot;He is going to decide, but I would take a month off,&quot; McEnroe said in the immediate aftermath of a defeat few (apart from Wawrinka) predicted but some feared, given Murray&apos;s low-key performances in the previous four matches here, and his stuttering form since Wimbledon. &quot;He had it a lot tougher than I did and there was a lot more pressure. I felt like I was dealing with a lot of pressure when I played Wimbledon, some of it self-inflicted, but it was a lot more so for Andy. &quot;He has been through a lot over the past 10 years and he should take a break, and try to finish strongly in London at the World Tour Finals. Then he can start to get ready for the Australian Open. I certainly wouldn&apos;t be too concerned about the next few months if I were him.&quot; Darren Cahill, the Australian who briefly worked with Murray before he took on Ivan Lendl as his coach, said: &quot;I think what he has accomplished over the last 14 months has been remarkable. There was always going to be a natural let-down at some stage. Since he won Wimbledon he&apos;s got that feeling of: &apos;Where to now?&apos; &quot;I know he struggled on the hard courts to get himself going, he worked his backside off to get through to the quarter-finals without really playing great tennis. I don&apos;t feel it was all that surprising, considering that he was up against a top-quality opponent who took advantage of that. &quot;All his life he&apos;s been chasing the Wimbledon title and to live a day in his shoes and to understand the pressure he is under is a difficult thing to do. To accomplish that and then get straight back up for the next challenge is very tough. Time will be his best friend at the moment. He can reset his mind and his body and set some new challenges. He will come back even stronger.&quot; McEnroe reckons Lendl, with whom Murray has won two slam titles, can guide him to more majors. &quot;Ivan has done a great job,&quot; McEnroe said. &quot;They will go back to the drawing board, because the top guys are always figuring out ways to get one or two per cent better. If you are able to do that, then great things will happen.&quot; He does not think Murray has peaked after years of striving to break through to the upper echelons of the game. &quot;The more you win, the more people expect you to win, but you have to keep a realistic assessment of what has happened. He has looked a little weary mentally to me. I&apos;m not around him enough to know that for sure, but I wasn&apos;t surprised he struggled in Cincinnati and Montreal. &quot;He is normally tough to beat in longer matches but Stan played a great game and it looked as if it was getting to him. There are a lot of things that can get to you out there. I should know. &quot;But I am surprised, absolutely, that he lost, although Stan has been looking pretty confident. I have seen him about the locker room and he looks to have something different about him. But I think Andy was on such a high that, after all those years trying to win Wimbledon, it was inevitable there would be a let-down. The question was, how much? It is not easy to turn it on again quickly. &quot;He has been pretty flat for the whole summer. I think it is just a mental thing and he is a little weary after all the effort. I would still look at it as an incredible year for him, he has done something for the first time in 77 years. It is amazing \u2013 and that high is so high, you just can&apos;t grasp how big an achievement it was. And he didn&apos;t have that much time off where he could sit back and enjoy it. He was almost straight back into training. &quot;But the fires are burning. There are four slams a year and you just don&apos;t win them all the time. I played in over 100 of them and only won seven. It&apos;s not like I was winning all the time. He is different because his trend is more like Ivan, in that he is winning them a bit later in his career. The key for him is just trying to chip away and one a year would be amazing.&quot;", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "US Open tennis 2013", "US Open tennis", "John McEnroe", "Tennis", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-06T21:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/09/gemma-arterton-christopher-nolan-ruth-rendell", "sentences": ["Sevcik, whose film Normal: the D\u00fcsseldorf Ripper won the best director prize at the Shanghai film festival in 2009, is due to shoot early next year on location in London."], "title": "Gemma Arterton and Tim Roth to star in revived Christopher Nolan mystery", "article": "A never-completed Christopher Nolan film project is set to be revived with Gemma Arterton and Tim Roth in the lead roles.

They are simultaneously criticised and lauded. And while few can agree on which methodology is the most robust, there is consensus that global university rankings are here to stay, that no ranking is all encompassing and that their influence is growing. Students, universities and governments are taking note and action. The first international rankings, the Academic Ranking of World Universities or Shanghai Rankings, were published in 2003 by Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. These were initially used to establish the standing of Chinese universities internationally following the launch of a government initiative to create world-class universities. But in today&apos;s more internationalised sector, governments across the world are using rankings to measure their global competitiveness. The Shanghai Rankings were soon followed by the QS World University Rankings and Times Higher Education World University Rankings. With students and academics facing greater options and opportunities, the existence of three ready-made lists of the world&apos;s best universities have heightened competition the world over and governments are now paying closer attention, even utilising rankings to make policy decisions. Education has become a top priority in emerging economies and many are looking to form partnerships with world leading universities. The Brazilian government&apos;s national scholarship programme, Science Without Borders, aims to send 100,000 students and researchers in primarily STEM subject areas to some of the world&apos;s best institutions. These partner universities were selected based on their position in the QS and Times rankings. In an effort to ensure quality, India&apos;s University Grants Commission also requires any foreign university wanting to partner with Indian universities to be ranked among the top 500 in the world. University rankings are also impacting immigration policy. With the number of internationally mobile students projected to grow due to changing demographics and rising incomes in developing countries, overseas students are big business. They contributed over \u00a310bn to the UK economy in 2011-2012 alone. As a result the UK government is looking to attract 90,000 more overseas students by 2018. However, the current debate surrounding UK immigration policy has led to an increasingly negative perception among overseas students, making them feel &apos;unwelcome&apos;. This has led to a sharp decline in the number of Indian and Pakistani students studying in the UK. Immigration policy is also impacting the recruitment of top academics and researchers. France has capitalised on this and opened its borders to Indian students by easing visa restrictions. Other countries looking to improve their standings in the rankings have also opened their borders. Countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands have changed their immigration laws to favour those who have graduated from top global universities. In points based systems, graduates from the highest ranked universities in the QS, Times and Shanghai Rankings are awarded more points. In a bid to make itself more attractive to international academics and expatriates, Russian authorities recently instituted a new legislation that will recognise degrees from foreign universities that are among the top 300 inthese rankings. However, those students who have not graduated from top universities or from former Soviet republics (excluding Uzbekistan) will still need to undergo a lengthy certification process. This development is in line with other initiatives the Russian government is introducing to improve its global competitiveness, such as sending more students abroad to study at elite universities. Russia is also taking steps to overhaul its own higher education sector as a result of its poor performance in the global university rankings. Following an independent audit of its universities, 15 were selected to receive special grants to improve their compliance with rankings criteria. Other countries such as Germany, France, Japan and Singapore have introduced similar programmes to improve their higher education systems and build world-class universities. In Asia in particular, the university rankings have created a &apos;reputation race&apos;, which sees both universities and governments closely monitoring the changing criteria for university rankings. Making policy decisions based on university rankings is not a simple process. Global university rankings have their limitations. The indicators and criteria used are not all encompassing and often measured via proxies. There is a greater overall emphasis on research than teaching, despite the context of rising tuition fees, when prospective students are looking for the complete package. This emphasis also puts universities that are more focused on the arts and humanities at a disadvantage due to the heavy weighting of citations to measure research influence. Much of the controversy surrounding the university rankings concerns their methodologies and which is the most robust \u2013 or, conversely, most gameable. There are various shortcuts universities can take to improve their scores such as taking on part-time professors that are highly cited. Ultimately, university rankings are a tool. When using a particular ranking, it is important to be aware of its limitations as well as its intended audience. While QS design their rankings primarily for students, other rankings are aimed more overtly at university leadership. Any list only highlights a small percentage of the world&apos;s universities and as a result, many institutions, particularly in developing countries, are at a distinct disadvantage. Like them or loathe them, however, university rankings seem to be here to stay. In Asia and Latin America, companies have begun to produce regional rankings. And with US president Barack Obama planning to create his own own &apos;Obamarank&apos; league table of US universities in an attempt to nudge down the cost of college education, the global interest in ranking higher education only looks set to grow.

Yet in Cupertino, the California-based company&apos;s unveiling of two new iPhone models on Tuesday night left some of them scratching their heads. On Wednesday morning Apple showed taped footage of its Silicon Valley product release to about 80 reporters at a swish Beijing hotel. It was the company&apos;s first-ever media event in China, leading many analysts to believe that one of the new models would be specifically aimed at capturing the Chinese smartphone market, currently the largest in the world. Many China tech analysts predicted that one of the new models \u2013 the iPhone 5C, a slightly less expensive, plastic-backed version of the iPhone 5 \u2013 would cost 3,000 yuan (\u00a3310), giving it an edge over low-cost competitors. Yet on Wednesday, the company announced that a 5C with 16GB of memory would cost 4,488 yuan (\u00a3465), roughly the same cost as the iPhone 5. The other model, the iPhone 5S \u2013 which features faster hardware and a fingerprint reader beneath the home button \u2013 will sell for 5,288 yuan (\u00a3547). Nicole Zhou, a 30-year-old employee at a state-owned enterprise, bought herself a Samsung S4 phone on Wednesday afternoon, hours after the announcement. &quot;I didn&apos;t know the price was going to be 5,000 yuan,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t see any really big difference between this and the other new iPhone.&quot; Users of China&apos;s most popular microblogging service Sina Weibo chimed in as well. &quot;The C stands for costly,&quot; was one common refrain. The &quot;S&quot; in 5S, some users surmised, may stand for &quot;superfluous&quot; or &quot;super-expensive&quot;. Other users compared the 5C&apos;s colourful plastic shell to a potato peeler. &quot;Every family in Britain could use an iPhone 5C \u2026 because you need something in the kitchen to take care of all those potatoes,&quot; wrote a user calling themselves A-Chuan Wants to Rest. Apple stores in China will begin selling the handsets on 20 September, the same day as they hit shelves in the US. &quot;Even though Apple has a lower-end iPhone now, its price is still considered mid-end in China and not low-end,&quot; Sandy Shen, a Shanghai-based analyst for Gartner, told Reuters. &quot;Considering Apple&apos;s old rival Samsung and domestic players such as Huawei, Lenovo and Coolpad all have phones in that category, Apple will still lose out in market share in these key segments.&quot; China is Apple&apos;s biggest market outside of the US and Europe, but its market share has declined precipitously over the past year, as international competitors such as Samsung and local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi introduce comparable phones at lower costs. Apple is currently ranked seventh in the country in terms of sales. While Apple has lost much of its market share, it has not lost its prestige. &quot;It&apos;s like, all of my colleagues were watching the media release really closely,&quot; said Chen Xin, 23, a human resources employee at a five-star hotel in Beijing. &quot;For them, the price means nothing compared with the prestige of the brand. Everybody thinks that Apple products are really cool.&quot; Chen used an iPhone 4S until last year, when she bought a Samsung phone.

Having worked in the advertising industry for 20 years, I couldn&apos;t agree more! Well I don&apos;t think many of us would have turned down a visit from Sir David. He was a towering figure in broadcasting and one who will be sorely missed by many people here today. Of course Sir David was one of the first people to become famous through his appearances on television. And over his lifetime he saw a revolution in both the role and the reach of TV. When he made his debut, in the early 60s, there were just two channels. Most shows were in black and white and an average television was just 12 inches in diameter. What changes he saw. Today&apos;s television Nowadays the average viewer has hundreds of channels to choose from \u2026 flat screen tellies are the norm \u2026 and you can access television through tablets, smartphones, consoles \u2026 basically any device that is connected to the internet. But as you know better than me, content which looks like television \u2026 sounds like television \u2026 perhaps even appears on the television, is not necessarily television. Not technically at least. With the rise of smart TVs, video-on-demand content, and a drift towards IPTV, definitions have to change. And so do the approaches that need to be taken. There are regulatory implications for government here, and we used our recent connectivity, content and consumers paper to set out our determination to tackle these. But rather than dwell on what this means for government, I want to talk this evening about what it means for the industry. It is my belief that these technological changes offer countless opportunities to you, to your industry and to many others in the content business. The world is changing, and changing fast, but those who rise to the challenge \u2013 who give viewers what they want, when they want it and how they want it \u2013 will be those who stay ahead. This sort of viewer control is what Kevin Spacey recently referred to as marking television&apos;s &quot;third golden age&quot;. Central to this golden age is content. Technology and its implications The range of content providers is large and growing. Just look at the reach of Netflix, Lovefilm and, of course, YouTube. On YouTube alone, 100 hours of video are uploaded every minute and much of this content is user-generated, being produced \u2013 and uploaded \u2013 by individuals keen to share it with the world. Finger-biting babies, deer-chasing dogs and cats in shark outfits seem to be our new cultural icons. Some of these people turn their passion into a profit. For example I met Jack and Finn at the YouTube studios last year. Their British charm is taking the US by storm with their channel, JacksGap. There are now one million channels earning revenue through YouTube&apos;s partner programme \u2026 YouTube was not even invented a decade ago and now people watch 6 billion hours of content on it each month. Some might think this foretells the end of television as we know it. Indeed, it was at this conference some years ago that people predicted the internet would kill off television. (I would be interested to hear your predictions this year \u2026) Yet the astonishing thing is just how well broadcasting is holding up. Families still sit down together around the telly and viewing in the UK is currently at record levels. The average British viewer watches more than four hours of television each day \u2026 and 90 per cent of that viewing is live and linear. This might be a controversial view but I think this helps prove a simple argument: rather than the internet being bad for broadcasting, it is actually a benefit. Rather than acting as a substitute to traditional broadcasting, it can actually complement it. The new opportunities are ably demonstrated by the advent of connected TVs, where extra content can be offered and certain channels can now be viewed outside normal broadcast hours. I believe online content, whether viewed through a connected TV or through a tablet, will support traditional viewing by allowing new audiences to be developed, new specialist interest groups to be reached and new catch-up opportunities to be offered. In short, the appetite for content is great and growing. This is just as true in Shanghai as it is in S\u00e3o Paulo. The demand is truly global. Where Britain sits This has enormous implications for the economic potential of television. Britain is well placed to profit as a result, thanks to our unique model of public service broadcasting, existing alongside strong commercial broadcasters, with both fuelling our world-beating indies. In 2012, Pact estimated that the UK independent production sector was worth \u00a32.8bn, which is 16.5% more than in the previous year. How many other sectors can claim that sort of growth? This country has an astonishing record of producing content which is popular all around the world. Shows like Top Gear and Downton Abbey top the ratings across the globe. And Great British formats are just as successful \u2013 Strictly is licensed to 48 countries worldwide and boasts a global audience of more than a quarter of a billion people. We have a hugely successful television industry and are attracting record levels of investment. But we all want to build on that success. That is why this government has introduced tax reliefs for high end television and animation. The recent announcement that Cumbernauld has been picked as the location for Outlander shows these reliefs are already encouraging more productions to our shores. We have become a global hub for content production. We have a greater range of players investing in the TV sector and in UK television content than ever before. And success breeds further success. Our television industry supports jobs and growth in the wider creative industries, as well as fuelling the creative fire of the script-writers, and the other content creators, of tomorrow. Contribution of PSBs Commercial broadcasters are making a significant and growing investment in UK content, spending over \u00a3600m in 2012. But our public service broadcasters still account for the lion&apos;s share of investment, taking the total to over \u00a33bn last year. Because of this investment, and because public service content continues to attract the most viewers, it&apos;s important that they are given the means and the mission to capitalise on the new online opportunities. As a government we are clear that: \u2022 When people switch on, no matter what device they are using, PSB channels should be easy to find \u2022 Our PSBs should not have to pay other platforms and service providers to carry their content, especially given the clear value this content provides \u2022 And websites should not be freeloading off PSBs&apos; content. This is intellectual property which needs to be protected so that money will flow back to create more great television But, in return, there are specific areas I think public service broadcasters ought to focus on. Firstly \u2013 I want them to think about what they can do give our country an even greater global profile. Technological developments are making it easier to present UK content to the world, which will help shape the way people view our country. Last year&apos;s Olympic and Paralympic Games \u2013 covered brilliantly by the BBC and Channel 4 \u2013 showed us at our very best. This demonstrates the powerful role the PSBs can play role in promoting Britain. This has important implications \u2026 influencing the way we are perceived \u2026 encouraging people to visit our shores \u2026 and increasing the willingness of people in other countries to do business with us. To be blunt, TV reaches places that our ambassadors can&apos;t. I know that the &quot;soft power&quot; agenda is one of Tim Davie&apos;s big priorities and I will be working with him, and with the other broadcasters, on this. Secondly, I think that PSBs can work even harder to support our creative industries, by sparking this country&apos;s creative talent, by developing the skills needed and by showcasing the best of British content. I ask myself if the PSBs can use new technology and their online platforms to make more content available from other parts of the creative industries? Or from our amazing arts sector? Or could they share their audience insights to help others monetise their content \u2013 particularly in overseas markets? PSBs have a significant role to play in driving the international growth of the British creative economy \u2026 increasing the UK&apos;s total share of the pie \u2013 not just their piece of it. Last, but by no means least, the PSBs must continue to play their part on the home front, producing the type of content which UK audiences value, but which might not be as ripe for global or commercial exploitation. They will always have an important role to play catering for audiences young or old, from across the UK, reflecting the range of political, cultural and religious beliefs. As the biggest provider of content, the BBC is particularly important. Governance of the BBC The BBC. A phenomenal worldwide brand, a mighty partner, and a formidable competitor. But this has undoubtedly been one of the most challenging years in its history. Monday was a grim day for its senior management. There is a risk of events like this overshadowing the unstinting work of its staff. This must not be allowed to happen. The corporate dramas of the BBC should never eclipse its actual dramas. The collective talent of the BBC won 15 BAFTAs in May. Stars like Ben Whishaw of &apos;The Hollow Crown&apos; and Olivia Coleman in &apos;Twenty Twelve&apos; picked up awards. Underpinning their success were talented production teams, supported by dedicated staff throughout the BBC. I pay tribute to all of them. But the recent focus has unfortunately been on the BBC&apos;s governance. It is worth reminding ourselves that the Trust was borne out of the aftermath of the Hutton inquiry, when the governance of the BBC, particularly its board of governors, came in for significant criticism. This criticism focused on insufficient independence and a lack of clarity over the separation of roles. Does that sound familiar? I have been clear that there is ongoing confusion over where the roles and responsibilities of the executive stop and the Trust start. This must be addressed. It will come as no surprise to anyone here that governance arrangements are kept under review. Concerns over the Trust are not new. In 2009, the last Labour culture secretary told this conference that he was not convinced that the BBC&apos;s governance model should stretch beyond 2016. He pointed to the tension implicit in the Trust being &quot;both regulator and cheerleader&quot;. And in the aftermath of Monday&apos;s hearing a whole host of MPs and commentators once again lined up to declare the Trust model as &quot;broken&quot;. It is no good waiting until a new charter in 2017 to act. Under the leadership of Tony Hall, a new team is being put in place. Some changes have already been announced \u2013 for example the \u00a3150K cap on pay-offs. And more will be done by the BBC to try to remove the confusion over the two bodies&apos; respective roles. As you would expect, given all of these changes, I will continue to keep the BBC&apos;s structures and effectiveness under review. These are significant changes. Ultimately, licence fee payers rely not only upon the right structures and governance being in place but also upon the BBC&apos;s executive management using their good judgement. And I think serious questions were raised about that judgement by the scale of the severance payments made. Licence fee payers expect their money to be spent properly. This government has done more to deliver transparency around the BBC&apos;s spending than any other, opening up their accounts to an unprecedented level of scrutiny by the National Audit Office. But we now need to ask if more should be done. The NAO&apos;s work has been pivotal in bringing issues to light so I want us to strengthen its role further. It simply wasn&apos;t right that the NAO was prevented from immediately looking at the details of George Entwistle&apos;s severance package. I want a system where the NAO can look at any area of concern without hindrance or delay. Conclusion It wouldn&apos;t be an RTS speech without a bold prediction about the future. This has been an annus horribilis for the BBC. But we all know that institutions can recover and come back stronger from years like that. The BBC will bounce back. The changing world presents them \u2026 and everyone else here \u2026 with new challenges \u2026 but also with new opportunities. Despite the fact we are starting to interact with television in a different way, the appetite for live broadcasting retains its strong appeal. But the viewer will come to expect more. Both in terms of how content is delivered, but also what is delivered. Viewers will think that their favourite content should be available at all times, on all devices. And their desire for customised content will become greater. As an industry you are already responding to these growing demands, driven by an unwavering focus on giving the consumer what they want. And your ability to respond to these demands will be helped by new technologies and better infrastructure, whether that is in the form of superfast broadband or a 4G - or even a 5G - signal. As a result, broadcasting will retain its unique place at the heart of British life. It will continue to bind us together, through events of national significance \u2026 It will also educate, inform and entertain us \u2026 And it will remain a big beast of the economy, investing in home-grown talent and exporting to the world. What drives this all is content. And no-one creates content quite like the British television industry.

You steal a look over his shoulder, and what would please you more: to see him playing Angry Birds, or coding?&quot; The words of education secretary Michael Gove earlier this year, in a speech that took a further potshot at the thought of children who &quot;while away hours flinging electronic fowl at virtual pigs&quot;. Perhaps he&apos;s more of a Candy Crush Saga man. Unsurprisingly, there was no role for Angry Birds in Gove&apos;s plans to reform the UK&apos;s national curriculum, but his comments were disappointing for two reasons. First: for the assumption that playing a popular game and learning to code were mutually exclusive activities, and ignoring the possibility that the former could lead to the latter, with the right resources and encouragement. Second: what Gove&apos;s speechwriters thought was a witty rhetorical jab at an easy scapegoat belied a lack of awareness of the educational ambitions of Rovio, the company behind Angry Birds, which have been public for some time. The company has worked with the likes of National Geographic, NASA and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) on science-related books and educational materials around past Angry Birds games, but now it&apos;s launching something more ambitious called Angry Birds Playground. Developed in partnership with the University of Helsinki and based on the Finnish national curriculum, it&apos;s an educational programme covering maths, science, music, language, arts and crafts, physical education and social interaction. Aimed at children around &quot;kindergarten&quot; age in Finland \u2013 around six years old \u2013\u00a0the programme&apos;s materials will include books, posters, game cards, a five-string instrument and physical games as well as digital content. The programme was unveiled in China last week, where it will be launching first in a Shanghai early-learning centre. &quot;It&apos;s not just games we&apos;re talking about here: it&apos;s a full 360-degree approach to learning, where games are just one part of it. It&apos;s not learning by sitting down and playing with a digital device,&quot; says Sanna Lukander, Rovio&apos;s vice president of learning and book publishing. &quot;There&apos;s a real substance to it, and a healthy balance between rest, play and work. We feel it&apos;s necessary to talk about healthy nutrition and physical exercise, as part of this approach to learning, balance and wellbeing.&quot; The University of Helsinki will remain involved with Angry Birds Playground, training teachers to use the programme, incorporating their feedback into future versions of it, and researching how effective it is. It&apos;s about more than just exporting Angry Birds in educational clothes, then: this is about Finland exporting its educational philosophy and expertise, and using a popular brand to do it. &quot;We&apos;re not just putting a sticker on something, We&apos;re combining two brands. One is Angry Birds with its global reach and people recognising the characters and being motivated to learn more,&quot; says Lukander. &quot;But the other brand is a long legacy of work done in Finland by educational experts, and beautiful co-operation between the authorities, schools and book publishers.&quot; She also stresses that digital games are just one element of Angry Birds Playground, with board games, sports and physical activities taking a high priority alongside elements that even a traditionalist education secretary might appreciate. &quot;We are studying the formats of the content carefully. We certainly believe a traditional book is good for certain parts, and also that it&apos;s important for children to use pen and paper,&quot; says Lukander. &quot;We also want the children to start learning about music through composing themselves, so we have the five-string instrument. It&apos;s a real instrument, not a toy. We already see them enjoying the feeling that they can accomplish something, and of music as something composed by people.&quot; Digital elements will range from games and mobile content through to collaborative activities designed for interactive whiteboards in classrooms.     Rovio's Sanna Lukander, talking at an event in London earlier in 2013. Photo: Stuart Dredge    Plans beyond China? Rovio is talking to a mixture of public schools (in the non-UK sense of the phrase) and private-sector companies, with the mix varying from country to country depending on the educational system. &quot;What&apos;s most interesting is to promote the very open and wonderful dialogue that the Finnish authorities have with schools and textbook publishers,&quot; says Lukander. &quot;There are countries where the authorities take the decisions and let people in schools know how things should be run, but here we have an open dialogue, and work on the national curriculum together.&quot; Meanwhile, Rovio will continue the other side of its book publishing business, working with partners like National Geographic on Angry Birds books that include educational content. That company is releasing a new &quot;Science Behind the Saga&quot; book this week, for example, tying in with the release of Rovio&apos;s Angry Birds Star Wars II game for smartphones and tablets. &quot;I love the Society and working with their books department: they really know how to tell stories with a twist that engages children,&quot; says Lukander, emphasising again that Rovio&apos;s books business is more than a licensing cash-in. That is the key point about something like Angry Birds Playground, though: the fact that however serious its educational intent is, the programme is also promoting a series of paid games and its hundreds of commercial spin-offs. I suspect it will be a divisive issue for parents and teachers alike: some seeing it as unacceptable commerce in the classroom, and others seeing it as a pragmatic attempt to use children&apos;s favourite characters to help them learn as well as play. Is Rovio concerned about Angry Birds Playground being seen as just another way to sell the Angry Birds brand? &quot;It&apos;s definitely something that has to be discussed, because that&apos;s not how I see it. I see the characters as engaging and motivating, because I work on the publishing side,&quot; says Lukander. &quot;We have authors writing beautiful stories about these characters and their world. I see them as literature. And some characters that are born from literature may also have some commercial aspects attached to them later on. I don&apos;t see that as any kind of threat.&quot; She points to Harry Potter and \u2013 in Finland \u2013 the Moomins as existing examples of popular literary characters being used in schools to get children reading stories, and talking about some of the issues they raise. &quot;I could understand the concern if people thought we had the wrong people working on education content, but we have educational specialists working on this,&quot; says Lukander. &quot;This is not a licensing thing, and Rovio is not a games company any more. It&apos;s a media company, and like many other media companies, it has an educational arm. We&apos;re trying to do something meaningful and good with these characters.&quot;", "tags": ["Angry Birds", "Education", "Children", "Apps", "Technology", "Media", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Games", "Rovio", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-16T12:23:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/18/tv-highlights-three-day-nanny", "sentences": ["Snooker: Shanghai Masters8am, British Eurosport Live coverage from the Shanghai Grand Stage in China of the Shanghai Masters, with a freshly stuffed prize pot offering \u00a380,000 to the victor."], "title": "TV highlights 18/09/2013", "article": "Snooker: Shanghai Masters8am, British Eurosport Live coverage from the Shanghai Grand Stage in China of the Shanghai Masters, with a freshly stuffed prize pot offering \u00a380,000 to the victor.

Back in Chinatown, Yaowarat Road loses its outer lanes after dark to countless food stalls serving stir-fried seafood, roast duck and soups. Day three: new Bangkok Modern Bangkok is centred along Rama 1 Road, which becomes Phloen Chit Road, before transforming into seemingly never-ending Sukhumvit Road. This is the city&apos;s retail and entertainment heart and the superb BTS Skytrain runs overhead along much of this route.     Central World Shopping Plaza, Bangkok, Thailand.

According to the Hurun Report&apos;s &quot;Hurun China&apos;s Women Rich List 2013&quot;, three of the world&apos;s five wealthiest women with assets of over $1bn (\u00a3626m) \u2013 and six of its top 10 \u2013 are Chinese. None of the world&apos;s top 10 richest men are from mainland China. China&apos;s wealthiest woman is Yang Huiyan, the 32-year-old heiress to Country Garden, an expansive property developer in the affluent southern province Guangdong. Yang has assets of 51bn yuan (\u00a35.2bn). She graduated from Ohio State University in 2003. Yang is followed by Chen Lihua, 72, of Fu Wah International, an &quot;industrial investment company&quot; founded in Hong Kong in 1988. Chen, worth 37bn yuan, was named one of &quot;the world&apos;s 100 most influential people&quot; by Time magazine last year for her philanthropic efforts. About a quarter of the list&apos;s 50 wealthiest women work in real estate; 18% of them are involved in finance. China&apos;s richest women are generally younger than their male counterparts, with an average age of 48 compared with 52. &quot;What I&apos;ve asked myself is: why are Chinese women so successful? I think there are a number of different dynamics at play,&quot; said Rupert Hoogewerf, the Hurun Report&apos;s publisher and chairman. &quot;One is that there&apos;s the one-child policy, which means that they have a very short career break, compared with someone who has three children or more. Plus there&apos;s the fact that in Chinese society, children are brought up by grandparents, traditionally,&quot; giving mothers more time to pursue their careers. &quot;Another dynamic is that it might just be this generation \u2013 relatively speaking, they&apos;re much more successful here than in the rest of the world,&quot; he added. The ranks of China&apos;s super-rich have grown exponentially in recent years. One decade ago, China had no billionaires. Last year, it had 64. When the Hurun Report unveiled its 2013 rich list last week, ranking China&apos;s 1,000 wealthiest individuals, it had 315. Women have also established a growing presence at the highest rungs of the country&apos;s corporations. In 2013, women held 51% of all senior management positions in China \u2013 a higher proportion than any other country and up from only 25% last year, according to a report by the Chicago-based accounting firm Grant Thornton.

The reigning Wimbledon champion still wants to play in the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich in November but that is unlikely. He has already wiped out his Asian schedule and his medium-term aim is to recover from treatment to be in shape for his annual winter training block in Miami during December. If his recovery goes to plan, he hopes to be fully fit for Melbourne. &quot;Next week Andy is set to undergo minor back surgery in an effort to clear up a long-standing back problem,&quot; a statement from Murray&apos;s team said on Thursday. &quot;He will definitely miss tournaments in Bangkok, Tokyo and Shanghai. The problem flared up during the Italian Open this year when Andy was forced to retire and he sought advice from a range of specialists. After recently playing on hard courts and clay Andy once again sought medical advice about solving the issue once and for all. The aim is to be fully fit for the new season.&quot; A Murray insider described his chances of playing in Greenwich as &quot;touch and go&quot;. Although the surgery will be &quot;non-invasive&quot;, according to a source, it would seem inadvisable to risk aggravating the injury. The Scot, who has been troubled with persistent back pain since the season-ending tournament final in 2011, decided in the past few days that stitch-and-mend treatment is proving detrimental, even though he has won the US Open and Wimbledon titles since. He said in a tweet on Thursday night that he would be &quot;back stronger&quot; and also wrote: &quot;Thanks so much for all the nice messages today... Will let everyone know how it goes.&quot; He was struck down midway through the Rome Open this summer and pulled out of the French Open, a wise choice given his storming performance at Wimbledon, where he beat the world No1, Novak Djokovic, in three sets in the final. However, Murray&apos;s form fell away a little after Wimbledon, in Montreal and Cincinnati, and he lost to a resurgent Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows, where he had gone with high hopes of retaining the US Open title. Murray handled the physical pressure of leading Great Britain&apos;s Davis Cup tie against Croatia last weekend, winning both his singles and partnering Colin Fleming to take the doubles in a 4-1 triumph that put the team back in the elite world group for the first time since 2008. He later declared his commitment to remain in the squad for Great Britain&apos;s opening away match against the United States, straight after the Australian Open. It is clear that Murray and his coach Ivan Lendl look at the Melbourne tournament as the priority now. The option was to manage the injury with pain killers but it became increasingly obvious that strategy would have to be revised once his mobility in big matches made him vulnerable, most obvious in his loss to Wawrinka. The specialist physio Mark Bender accompanied him in New York, in the absence of the recently departed Andy Ireland, but he was not able to play with the fluency he showed earlier in the summer. It is thought the struggle of coming through three matches on the demanding clay of Umag last weekend convinced him he should seek a more radical and lasting solution. He was buoyed by the experience of lifting Great Britain back to the top of world team tennis, but the effort clearly took its toll. The nature of Murray&apos;s injury remains a minor mystery. He has refused in the past to confirm if it is disc-related, and, if it were, he might have to contemplate an extended absence from the game, much the same as Rafael Nadal did when he took seven months out to ease the long-term pain in his knees. It is thought Nadal&apos;s spectacular comeback, which he crowned with victory in the US Open final over Djokovic, convinced Murray to opt for a more drastic solution to his problem. There is no guarantee of surgical success with such an injury but Murray was tiring of the constant reliance on pain killers to get through tough matches. Although he has long insisted it is not a priority for him to reach the No1 world ranking, that quest will take a serious hit as he withdraws from key tournaments over the next two months. It is a brave call by Murray, but a judicious one. It is pointless playing on in pain that can only exacerbate the underlying complaint and, if he returns strong and fitter in January, he will be able to launch a more convincing assault on the major titles in 2014. He is still only 26 and has plenty of time to rebuild. Were he to carry on playing, he could only continue to store up trouble for the future. The increased physicality of the modern game has stretched all players to their limits and the new challenge for those in the top 10, who regularly go deeper in tournaments, is to managed those demands on their bodies.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Sport", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-19T18:10:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/20/epa-limit-us-coal-plant-pollution", "sentences": ["International demand for coal has also fallen, with China earlier this month banning the construction of new coal plants around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to control air pollution."], "title": "EPA outlines first steps to limit US coal plant pollution", "article": "Barack Obama took his first real step to fulfilling his sweeping climate action plan on Friday, proposing the first rules to limit carbon pollution from future coal-fired power plants. The new rules on natural gas and coal plants, announced by the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, will for the first time limit the single largest source of carbon pollution: greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. &quot;The EPA action today to address carbon pollution from new power plants is an important step forward,&quot; McCarthy said in a speech to the National Press Club. &quot;It&apos;s a necessary step to address a public health challenge that we simply can not afford to ignore any longer.&quot; Dan Lashoff, who leads the climate programme of the Natural Resources Defence Council, said: &quot;Basically the EPA declared the days of unlimited carbon pollution are over.&quot; The new rules are just a first step for the EPA in capping emissions from the power industry, but they are already under attack from industry and Republicans accusing Obama of waging a war on coal and will almost certainly face legal challenges. Natural gas plants already meet the standards for new power plants, an EPA official said in a conference call with reporters. But coal is a far dirtier fuel when burned and the new standards announced on Friday will require future plants to be about 40% cleaner than the coal plants in operation today. Opponents say the standards on new power plants cannot be reached without expensive new carbon capture technologies still not in commercial use. McCarthy said the rules introduced on Friday could come into force within the year. The EPA will take far more ambitious, and contentious, action in June 2014 when it proposes new rules to limit carbon pollution from existing power plants, which are the country&apos;s single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. &quot;The proposal that we are putting out today is about new sources \u2013 new, new new, it&apos;s not about existing,&quot; McCarthy said. But she reaffirmed repeatedly the EPA was working with states and industry on the new rules for existing plants. &quot;These proposed standards are the first proposed uniform standards on new plants,&quot; said McCarthy. &quot;They do not apply to old plants.&quot; The announcement was just the first step to fulfilling Obama&apos;s sweeping promises to act on climate change, and McCarthy said the EPA was already working with industry to ease the way for the even more ambitious task of controlling emissions from existing power plants. As outlined on Friday, those rules would cap greenhouse gas emissions at 1,000lb (453kg) of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour for larger scale new gas-fired power plants, and 1,100lb of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour for new coal-fired power plants. Existing coal-fired power plants burn between 1,600 and 2,100lbs of carbon dioxide an hour, and it will be impossible for future coal-fired plants to meet those standards without expensive new carbon capture technologies. McCarthy said industry could embrace new technologies to meet the standards. &quot;New power plants, both natural gas and coal-fired, can minimise their carbon emissions by taking advantage of available modern technologies,&quot; she said. But as the coal industry has frequently pointed out, such technologies remain untested on a commercial scale. There are no coal plants currently using such technologies anywhere in the world. Only one is under construction so far in America, in Mississippi, with three other such coal plants planned in Texas and Illinois. However, McCarthy said repeatedly that carbon capture and storage was a feasible and available technology. &quot;It has been demonstrated and it is actually being constructed in real facilities today,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe the proposal rather than killing future coal actually sets out a pathway forward for coal to be part of the diverse energy supply in the future.&quot; The new limits are slightly weaker than those first proposed 18 months ago, that were then withdrawn amid looming legal challenges. McCarthy acknowledged the EPA had been swayed by the industry pushback on the new power plant standards. Even so, Republicans in Congress accused the EPA of jeopardising Americans&apos; access to cheap electricity, and argued the new rules would have only a marginal impact on emissions globally, because of rising pollution from India and China. The West Virginia coal association said the new EPA standards would put coalminers out of work, and raise household electricity prices. &quot;These new rules are expected to stymie the construction of new, and the expansion of existing, coal-fired generating plants,&quot; the association said in a statement. &quot;If you can&apos;t build new coal-fired power plants or expand the ones we have, EPA&apos;s directly taking West Virginia coal jobs.&quot; Environmental groups broadly welcomed the proposals although WWF described the EPA announcement as a &quot;modest&quot; first step. Others said the real test of Obama&apos;s commitment to climate action would come next June when the EPA introduces standards for existing plants. &quot;Today&apos;s announcement delivers a strong signal that the administration will use its authority to tackle climate change,&quot; said Kevin Kennedy, director of the US climate programme at the World Resources Institute. He noted that the EPA announcement came at a time when coal was already being sidelined by market forces. &quot;Market dynamics, including the emergence of low-price natural gas, have been driving US power suppliers away from coal production,&quot; he went on. Coal-fired power plants are the country&apos;s single-largest source of electricity, generating 37% of supply last year, as well as about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. But coal&apos;s share of electricity generation is down from about 50% a decade ago as old plants are displaced for natural gas. With the advent of the EPA rules, a number of new coal plant projects have already been cancelled. According to the US Energy Information Administration, over the next three years, utilities plan to build only eight new coal-fired power stations compared with 91 new gas-fired ones. International demand for coal has also fallen, with China earlier this month banning the construction of new coal plants around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to control air pollution. In the US, half a dozen planned export terminals for coal have been cancelled because of political opposition and softening demand, but the industry remains a powerful political force.", "tags": ["Coal", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Pollution", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)", "Barack Obama", "World news", "Obama administration", "US news", "US politics", "Carbon capture and storage (CCS)"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-20T16:01:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/21/darcey-bussell-life-on-plate", "sentences": ["They were still in Mao suits on bicycles in Shanghai and Beijing and food was boiled cabbage with stringy bits of meat for breakfast and these weird white balls for lunch."], "title": "Darcey Bussell: 'Mum sent me to ballet class to control my clumsiness'", "article": "My earliest memory is of Weetabix.

I&apos;d spill things and get food down me, so Mum never wanted me in there. If I said I&apos;d help, she&apos;d draw breath. It was a reason she sent me to ballet classes \u2013 to control my clumsiness. And to sort out my bendy legs. At 13 I started, late, at the White Lodge [the Royal Ballet&apos;s school in Richmond Park]. It was 15 to a dorm back then and the food wasn&apos;t great. I remember tongue sandwiches quite a lot. We used to head to Sheen for chips, and one friend, from up north, introduced me to pork scratchings. Two months after I joined the company, at 18, we went on a tour of China, Japan, Thailand. I vividly remember packing my tour box \u2013 theatre make-up, ballet shoes, dance clothes and lots of Cup a Soups.

The ballet is serene with many still moments, so constant popcorn doesn&apos;t really suit that. I was never a dancer who was self-conscious about everything I ate. It was about having enough carbohydrates and proteins and eating at 2.30pm so you didn&apos;t get stomach cramps from nerves. But I never really thought about everything going in my mouth until I had an injury and was on the sofa, leg in a cast, feeling, &quot;Oh my God, I&apos;m turning into a couch potato.&quot; When I began learning to cook after retirement from the Royal Ballet my cup cakes were the first thing my daughters appreciated.

Wang told reporters that he expects China&apos;s box office, currently the world&apos;s second largest, to take the top spot from the US by 2018. &quot;Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis is a major measure to implement the national policy of building a cultural power,&quot; he said. Yet the country&apos;s film industry is burdened by a stultifying bureaucracy and draconian censorship apparatus. While its box office has grown dramatically in recent years, Hollywood imports account for the bulk of its profits. US-China \u00adco-productions have become common, but few have gone on to conquer global markets. Many get so tangled up in negotiations that they never make it past the planning stages. Wang seems undeterred. &quot;With the huge potential that comes with a population of 1.3 billion, the global film industry will recognise that the sooner you partner with China, the sooner you make more money,&quot; he said, according to the state newswire Xinhua. Dalian Wanda is best-known for its real estate throughout China, including 72 Wanda Plazas, sprawling developments that usually include shopping malls, hotels and cinemas. The company&apos;s international ambitions are expansive. Last year, Wang acquired the US multiplex chain AMC Cinemas for \u00a31.6bn. He is building luxury hotels in New York and London. And last week he donated \u00a312m to the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences, which will name a new film library in his honour. The Shanghai business magazine Hurun Report has put Wang&apos;s net worth at \u00a313.7bn, making him China&apos;s richest man, though assessing the wealth of Chinese entrepreneurs is notoriously difficult since virtually all of them are closely linked with government officials, whose assets are wide-ranging and usually well-hidden. China is already home to Hengdian World Studios in coastal Zhejiang province, an 815-acre complex which includes replicas of ancient imperial palaces.

In 12 years as a grand prix driver the 37-year-old Australian has always been the most warm and human of competitors in a cold and often vicious business, so it was hardly surprising that last weekend, after the Singapore Grand Prix, he hitched a lift back to the pits on the Ferrari of his friend, Fernando Alonso, or that he has since received a 10-place grid punishment at the next race in Korea. Sebastian Vettel won in Singapore, to virtually seal his fourth successive drivers&apos; title, but he was booed on the podium for the third consecutive race as his ruthless decision-making has not won him the affection which envelops his Red Bull team-mate. Their acrimonious relationship has stained Webber&apos;s last few years \u2013 yet it feels appropriate that he should first voice a different emotion as the end hurtles towards him. &quot;I&apos;m proud,&quot; Webber says. &quot;I know where I grew up [Queanbeyan in New South Wales] and the unlikely scenario of me leaving Australia and coming here [London]. I would never have imagined me ending up having raced in over 200 grands prix with some pretty special wins on the big stage \u2013 toe-to-toe fighting all the way. I&apos;ve got nine wins and 38 podiums. And I&apos;ve never missed a race. I&apos;ve never missed a test session. I&apos;ve never missed an hour in the car.&quot; At the start of the 2009 season, just 11 weeks after he fractured his right leg in a break almost as bad as that which changed the football career of Eduardo da Silva forever, Webber should have used crutches to reach the car on the grid \u2013 but he knew &quot;the messaging would&apos;ve been all wrong&quot;. Surely there must have been some test sessions or races he was close to missing? &quot;I had food poisoning in one race but I still finished it \u2013 Fuji in &apos;07. I&apos;ve also competed with fractured ribs \u2026&quot; Webber shrugs but he&apos;s more than just a hard-boiled Aussie bloke who can grit his teeth and growl about commitment and determination. He has carved out an extraordinary life from a distinctly unpromising start. &quot;The numbers speak for themselves. Only three drivers from Australia have ever won a grand prix in 60 years [Jack Brabham and Alan Jones are the others]. So it&apos;s not a particularly easy category for us to crack. I&apos;ve hopefully left a legacy for other Aussies \u2026&quot; In late June Webber announced his decision to retire from Formula One and join Porsche next year, when he will race sports cars in the FIA World Endurance Championship. He could not disguise his satisfaction when Red Bull, who appeared startled by his choice, eventually appointed another Australian, Daniel Ricciardo, as his replacement. &quot;Exactly. Daniel&apos;s on his way now \u2026&quot; Webber&apos;s own route to the peak of F1 was very different to Ricciardo who, at 24, will drive for the grid&apos;s dominant team. &quot;When I first came to England in the mid-1990s,&quot; Webber says, as he recalls trying to break into Formula Ford and then Formula Three, &quot;I stayed in this box room in Hainault [in north east London]. It was winter and you&apos;ve got condensation on the inside of the window. It was hard. At the track the other drivers rocked up in fancy cars and you&apos;re in your B-reg Fiesta. But that&apos;s petrol for your fire.&quot; During those earliest days in his Hainault bedsit, which he shared with his long-term partner Ann Neal, and her then baby son, Luke, did he question his ability to reach Formula One? &quot;I was very doubtful. The first two years in England were on a shoestring. I was getting \u00a343 a day. Our first rent was \u00a3550 a month which, bloody hell, was a lot of money. Annie was working hard, but she had Luke as well. Sometimes the groceries were a challenge for the three of us. It was very tight. &quot;I was so naive. I would go from Hainault station and it was four stops on the tube to the gym. And I didn&apos;t have a clue what to do. You&apos;re a monkey with a machine gun. Every day you&apos;re trying to teach yourself by doing something different. That tenacity and drive helps when you&apos;re competing professionally because that&apos;s when people tell you if you&apos;re doing a shit job. You know what it&apos;s like at the top end of professional sport. People change \u2013 but I&apos;ve been lucky. I&apos;ve had the same people around me since day one. We&apos;ve had some great highs, some hard lows.&quot; It took Webber 131 races, and eight years of trying, before he won his first grand prix in Germany in 2009. &quot;That first win was probably the sweetest,&quot; he says with a grin, &quot;because of the way I won it, from pole, and after a drive-through penalty. To drive away from Seb and win by 30 seconds, in his backyard, was a nice way to get my first win.&quot; There have been so many bitter spats with Vettel, starting in Japan in 2007 when the young German drove Webber off the track while at Toro Rosso. The Australian was furious because, despite vomiting inside his helmet during the race, he was lying second to Lewis Hamilton. &quot;It&apos;s kids,&quot; he said, &quot;they fuck it all up.&quot; As team-mates the altercations intensified \u2013 particularly when Red Bull favoured Vettel. Just before qualifying for the British Grand Prix in 2010, the upgraded front wing of Webber&apos;s car had been given to Vettel. Webber still went on to win the race the following day, which, as he said dryly, was &quot;not bad for a No2 driver&quot;. Earlier this season, in Malaysia, Vettel flagrantly ignored team orders and overtook Webber to win the race. &quot;2010 was harder because there was a lot more at stake then. That was difficult to swallow. You put so much into it and you get half a brick put into your backpack. In Malaysia, during those last 15 laps, I did a lot of thinking as to how the whole scenario had got to that point. I wasn&apos;t surprised by what Seb did, but just how it had reached that point.&quot; Vettel expressed contrition after the race but at the next grand prix, in Shanghai, he implied he would do it all again. His attitude might be one of the reasons he keeps being booed. &quot;I suppose some of the private discussions that Sebastian and I have had since then have been a bit disappointing,&quot; Webber says. &quot;Forget the track stuff. We&apos;ve had some private discussions and we weren&apos;t super-happy with how they went and how we felt about each other. It&apos;s tested the relationship to the maximum.&quot; Has the atmosphere improved since Webber announced that he was leaving Formula One? &quot;Not really. We&apos;re just going through the professional situation because you&apos;ve got a lot of people busting their balls for you \u2013 the guys working on the car.&quot; Does the 2010 championship still eat away at him \u2013 when he led Vettel going into the final race only for the German to win his first title and Webber to finish third? &quot;Yeah. In a way I suppose it would&apos;ve been better not to have been so close. But I look back at so many races that year of which I was proud. It was a pretty phenomenal year and no one would have predicted that the guy who ended up winning it hadn&apos;t led all year. But you always want more.&quot; The only decision he would change, if he could, &quot;would be to have gone to Renault rather than Williams [in 2005]. Renault hadn&apos;t won a race but soon after that they ran it. They were like the Red Bull of the time. I would&apos;ve been winning earlier and had Fernando [Alonso] as a team-mate. So I had to rebuild myself and that took a bit of juice out of me. The fractured leg took more juice out of me in 2008. So I had a couple of really solid uppercuts which took the wind out of me. I also started late, although 24 is probably the right age. Look at [Nigel] Mansell and [Mika] Hakkinen. Those guys didn&apos;t start until then. That was normal. You didn&apos;t get near a top car. Now, with simulators, the kids are coming in so fast. We&apos;ve got so many guys on the grid who probably shouldn&apos;t be there.&quot; Has nostalgia taken hold as he races tracks like Spa and Monza and Silverstone for the last time? &quot;I think Melbourne and Monte Carlo were really the two where I felt that. I was pissed off I didn&apos;t get to the podium in Melbourne as it&apos;s the only race where I&apos;ve never reached the podium \u2013 and it&apos;s my home GP. It&apos;s also where I had my first ever F1 race.&quot; Webber finished fifth in 2002 and won those hard-earned points in a struggling Minardi. &quot;Exactly. I must&apos;ve used up all my Aussie credits then.&quot; Did he know that this would be his last season when he sat on the grid in Melbourne this year? &quot;Yeah. I took all the Aussie and English journalists out to dinner so I knew it was my last race in Melbourne. I think I&apos;ll have another moment like that in Brazil [the season finale on 24 November].&quot; Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, was taken aback when he heard about Webber&apos;s decision just before Porsche confirmed that he had signed a contract to join them. &quot;My communication with Dietrich [Mateschitz, Red Bull&apos;s owner] was always open and very strong,&quot; Webber says. &quot;That was important. I never asked him not to say anything, it was up to him how he dealt with that. We&apos;d always had a good relationship and I told him I wanted to stop even if he said there was always a seat for me. Once he&apos;d been informed, then it was good for me and Porsche to get the announcement out nice and cleanly. &quot;I still feel hungry to finish off the year well but I&apos;m also hungry for the next stage of my career. I&apos;ve spoken to a few sportsmen, like Pat Rafter, who didn&apos;t get their retirement right. You can&apos;t hang on if the fire in the belly is dropping. The last few years I&apos;ve felt it dropping slightly. But the move to Porsche will relight the old fire. Moving into a new work environment, with a different team, will be good.&quot; Webber&apos;s continuing professionalism is obvious as, during a day at GEOX, the shoe company who are one of Red Bull&apos;s joint sponsors, he cheerfully completes his promotional duties at their Oxford Street store. There is much about Formula One that Webber won&apos;t miss, but his familiar enthusiasm is obvious. &quot;I&apos;ll miss working with Adrian Newey,&quot; he says of Red Bull&apos;s brilliant designer who has been the key figure in the team&apos;s success for the past four years. &quot;Adrian is phenomenal and when I&apos;m in a rocking chair at 75 I&apos;ll still remember how awesome it was working with him. I&apos;ll also just miss driving the car and being out there on your own, racing. But the decision is made and, mate, it&apos;s the right decision.&quot; GEOX supply all shoes worn by the Red Bull racing team.

Yang Hui, a 16-year-old student in Zhangjiachuan county, Gansu province, was arrested after posting messages castigating local police for their handling of a murder case. The authorities accused him of &quot;spreading rumours, inciting mass demonstrations and seriously obstructing social order&quot;. He was released on Monday after seven days in custody. Chinese web users were incensed by the arrest; in retaliation, some began exploring the backgrounds of county officials. They criticised party chief Liu Changjiang for wearing luxury watches which, as a public servant, should have been beyond his means. One uncovered old court documents accusing police chief Bai Yongqiang of giving 50,000 yuan (\u00a35,111) in bribes to his former boss between 1995 and 2005. Bai has since been suspended, according to a Monday night post on the county government&apos;s website. While the Chinese state newswire Xinhua said Bai&apos;s suspension was unrelated to the boy&apos;s arrest, experts say the intense public scrutiny may have played a role in his release. &quot;This kind of thing places a lot of pressure on the local government,&quot; said Xu Xin, a law professor at the Beijing University of Technology who gave Yang pro bono legal counsel. &quot;Public opinion is really important here.&quot; On Tuesday afternoon, the county government&apos;s phone line was disconnected. China launched a severe crackdown on what it calls &quot;online rumours&quot; this summer in an effort to rein in the country&apos;s freewheeling online communities. China&apos;s microblogging websites have more than 500 million users, and a growing number have been using the sites to expose corrupt officials and criticise controversial policies. Dozens of prominent activists, political commentators and even celebrities have been detained in recent weeks, including prominent human rights lawyer Xu Zhiyong and Charles Xue, a venture capitalist with 12 million followers. Yang was among the first victims of a new &quot;judicial interpretation&quot;, announced this month, which endorses jail sentences of up to three years for users who write &quot;defamatory&quot; posts that are forwarded more than 500 times. &quot;Arresting somebody for spreading rumours on the internet, that doesn&apos;t surprise me much at all,&quot; said Xu. &quot;But to arrest a child, I found that astonishing.&quot; The chain of events leading to Yang&apos;s arrest are hazy. On 12 September, the manager of a local karaoke bar was found dead on the pavement near his club; local police quickly labelled the death a suicide. Yang spoke to the dead man&apos;s family and, over the next few days, posted a series of notes to his microblog accusing the police of covering up a murder. He said the club owner was an employee of the local courthouse, and police tried to silence his family members by beating them. The posts briefly went viral before censors took them down. After his release on Monday, the bespectacled teenager posted a photo of himself to Sina Weibo, China&apos;s most popular microblog, in a sweater which reads &quot;make the change&quot;. His right hand is raised in a victory sign. &quot;Today I formally returned to my third-year middle school studies,&quot; he wrote on Tuesday afternoon. &quot;Everything that you internet friends have said will be forever engraved on my heart.&quot; China blocks overseas websites which it deems politically sensitive, such as Facebook, Twitter, and the New York Times. Yet authorities may make an exception for a forthcoming free trade zone in Shanghai, the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday, citing anonymous government sources. The zone will span a 28.8 sq km swath of the city&apos;s Pudong district and will abide by a set of still-unknown economic policies meant to attract foreign investment. It is due to open later this month. &quot;In order to welcome foreign companies to invest and to let foreigners live and work happily in the free trade zone, we must think about how we can make them feel at home,&quot; the paper quoted an official as saying.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "Social media", "Digital media", "Internet", "World news", "Technology", "Media", "Censorship"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-24T14:59:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/sep/25/china-uk-female-senior-managers-study", "sentences": ["Even in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, I haven&apos;t seen women holding senior positions,&quot; he said."], "title": "China: setting the new standard for women in top jobs?", "article": "I have been envious of Chinese economic growth rates for as long as I can remember. If a recent report  published by Forbes magazine and Grant Thornton is to be believed, I now have even more to be envious about. According to this alarming report, 51% of senior management positions in mainland China are held by women. This places China at the very top, miles ahead of the 24% global average rate. When I spot the UK&apos;s relative position in this report, I am astounded. Not only do we lag significantly behind China, with a mere 19% of senior management positions held by women \u2013 we also feature in the bottom ten. And it gets worse \u2013 we are alarmingly close in the rankings to India; a country where discrimination against women is deep-rooted and widely prevalent. I am both intrigued and disturbed by this report. What is China doing to support the progression of women that we aren&apos;t? One commonly cited school of thought evolves from the political and social context of China. The emancipation of women has been a longstanding political issue in China; particularly since the People&apos;s Republic of China was founded in 1949. Since then, the communist parenthesis has strongly encouraged the employment of women outside the home. As a result, China was one of the first countries to ratify the UN International Convention on the elimination of discrimination against women. It was one of the first countries to implement legislation specifically for the interests of women. It was after such laws came into force that women began to seek employment in state owned enterprises and corporations. During the last few decades, however, large numbers of women working along production lines and other firms have been laid off and left in poverty. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor women in such scenarios are pushed into entrepreneurship. This &quot;poverty push&quot; often serves as a real driver for women to succeed. However, Alpesh Patel, the British government&apos;s senior dealmaker for China and author of the female entrepreneurship book Our Turn, strikes a note of caution here. &quot;In my capacity as the dealmaker responsible for India, China, Malaysia and Singapore, I do not recognise this 51% statistic. Even in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, I haven&apos;t seen women holding senior positions,&quot; he said. &quot;If the 51% statistic does hold true, I would stress two points for the UK to consider: are women in the UK falling behind because they chose to? Or has the one child policy in China led to more women being forced into becoming the breadwinner?&quot; These observations lead me to draw the following conclusions: 1. We need to do more to support any policies and targets which seek to address this issue in the UK. The social and cultural revolution in China and principles of communism meant that China was able to achieve such targets that would never be palatable in western liberal democracies. In the UK, even positive discrimination targets are seen as a negative form of intervention. 2. We need to ensure that equality measures are relative. While a 2% year-on-year growth may indicate progress, this may not be the case when other countries are reporting double-digit growth rates. 3. We need to change our mindset and believe that we women can go further. Zhang Xin, CEO of SOHO China, said that &quot;in China, no matter what industry you&apos;re in, you can try something new and put all your thoughts into doing so, because nothing was previously there. It still feels like anything is possible&quot;. 4. This is a complex issue which hasn&apos;t been adequately tackled in the UK. We have a long way to go. I look forward to reading next year&apos;s report and seeing the UK shift from the bottom ten category into the top ten. After all, anything is possible.

Greyish white, it straddles the boundary between the yellow line of the road and the Tarmac. Really, it looks nothing like spit \u2013 but now it&apos;s famous spit. Possibly even celebrated spit. For this gobule of saliva was photographed, probably by the police&apos;s community support officer, at the scene in Leyton, east London, and submited as part of 18-year-old Khasheem Kiah Thomas&apos;s court summons. Along with another man, Zilvinus Vitkas, Thomas last week became the first person to be successfully prosecuted by a council in England for spitting in public, when Thames magistrates court endorsed Waltham Forest council&apos;s view that spitting was a sub-genre of litter. But is spit litter, and is it even a health hazard? To Ross Coomber, professor of sociology at Plymouth University, spit is a many-faceted thing. He is conducting an international spitting survey and spent the summer travelling in Mumbai, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai, comparing the public spitting habits of different nations. He found that &quot;the three most significant spitting nations are India, South Korea and China&quot;. (For would-be students of spit, the spitting in Mumbai was mainly connected to the chewing of betel nut, in South Korea it was closely linked to smoking, and in China to a distaste for swallowing.) In comparison, he says, spitting in the UK is not as prevalent as people tend to believe. &quot;What we are seeing is an exaggerated response to a moderate problem.&quot; For Coomber, attitudes to spitting are based upon &quot;an argument about morality, about what people would prefer to see&quot;. He says that links between &quot;spitting on the ground and public health [are] almost unevidenced&quot;. John Middleton, vice-president of the Faculty of Public Health, would not go that far. &quot;The actual risk to other people in the current circumstances may be very small but it does represent something unnecessary and unpleasant. There are reasons for believing that there is a low level of risk to public health [in terms of] communicable viruses and bacteria \u2013 respiratory viruses, colds.&quot; He cites the possibility of someone treading on spit and then taking their shoes off later; or someone putting spit-addled shoes on the bus seat, and another passenger putting their hand on the seat. Middleton worries that he &quot;wouldn&apos;t want to overstate the health consequences&quot;. Perhaps Coomber is right: this is scarcely about health at all. Waltham Forest council appears to concur: on its website it describes spitting as &quot;antisocial and dirty&quot;, &quot;disgusting and unacceptable&quot;, but there is no mention of health risks. Coomber, who used to spit in public as a teenager in south-east London, says he &quot;doesn&apos;t like&quot; spitting, but points out that, historically, Britain is a nation of spitters. &quot;There are reports of people spitting in parliament right up to the end of the 19th century. I like to remind people that we were still building pubs in the 1930s with spitting troughs at the bottom of the bar.&quot; Punks gobbed at bands on stage. Sports stars spit: cricketers too. People spit when they are cycling or running. Some might practise what Coomber calls &quot;socially responsive spitting&quot; \u2013 spitting when no one is there to see it. Perhaps public spitting is a more ingrained part of British culture than people like to admit.

The hilly course will not suit here in Florence, but for the 19-year-old from Leicester this is a vital next step as she seeks experience in her first senior year. &quot;I was so thrilled to get selection, because I can gain a lot of experience from this,&quot; Garner said. &quot;The plan is to go in and help the team; it&apos;s a strong team with Lizzie there, she&apos;s in great form and my job will be to look after her, work as much as I can in the first half of the race then let the older and more experienced girls finish off the job. It&apos;s really good being part of the British team because we learn to work as a team from early on, so it&apos;s easy to adapt to. As a sprinter it&apos;s something I know all about because of the need to have a lead-out.&quot; When Garner won her second junior world road race title after a fine British team performance in Valkenburg, the Netherlands, last year, the next question was how she would move from being a junior star to the anonymity of senior racing. &quot;It&apos;s a big step up from the distances and pace of junior racing. I&apos;ve done a few World Cup races and I was really happy to get a pro race win in my first year \u2013 that was really big for me.&quot; That win came in a sprint finish in May in the Tour of Chongming Island in Shanghai. &quot;It has been pretty hard going in almost as a beginner all over again. As a junior the longest race I rode was 80km \u2013 as a senior it&apos;s 140km, and that&apos;s a huge difference. It&apos;s been hard adapting from being a top class junior to being an average rider. But it&apos;s been a good experience for me, in the races that suit me.&quot; As a sprinter that means flatter events, such as the Tour of Flanders, rather than the hilly world championship course. Garner comes from a cycling background \u2013 her grandparents were both cyclists \u2013 but early on she and her sister Grace tried a variety of sports: swimming, cross-country running, football and athletics. &quot;I was always the sporty type at school, but cycling was the one we liked.&quot; Grace, 16, appears to be following in her elder sister&apos;s footsteps as part of British Cycling&apos;s talent development programme \u2013 &quot;she will go the same way as me. She is more of a track rider than a road racer at the moment, but she&apos;s very, very good, a big talent.&quot; This year, Garner has spent the season living in the Dutch town of Woudenberg, racing with the Argos-Shimano women&apos;s team, and she has found it a tough experience, although the presence of her boyfriend, the Dutch cyclo-racer Lars van der Haar, has helped in the adaptation process. &quot;It&apos;s been good, it&apos;s a long journey, it was tough leaving my family and friends, but I&apos;m not completely on my own. The language is hard, but I&apos;ll be learning more this winter.&quot; Armitstead for one appreciates what Garner has had to contend with this season but believes she has the brightest of futures: &quot;It&apos;s a huge step for junior girls now \u2013 compared to when I was a junior the jump in distance is too much to make in one season. She&apos;s very, very fast \u2013 the race in China that she won was only 70km, and she did well. She has huge potential because she is an out and out sprinter \u2013 there are not many of those in women&apos;s cycling so she will have the chance to win a lot of races.&quot;", "tags": ["Cycling", "Sport", "Lizzie Deignan"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-27T12:55:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/27/ipcc-climate-report-digested-read", "sentences": ["In the former case, sea level could have risen by a 98cm by the end of the century, seriously threatening cities from Shanghai to New York and meaning hurricanes and cyclones inflict far worse damage when they hit shorelines."], "title": "IPCC climate report: the digested read", "article": "Global change The global climate has already changed in many ways that are unprecedented in the past hundreds or thousands of years, the world&apos;s scientists and governments concluded in the new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These changes have affected every region of the globe, on land and at sea. Continued carbon emissions will drive further heatwaves, sea level rise, melting ice and extreme weather. The changes will last for centuries and limiting the effects would require &quot;substantial and sustained&quot; cuts in carbon dioxide, the scientists report. Temperatures Scientists are now at least 66% certain that the last three decades are the warmest in 1400 years, with global temperature having risen by 0.9C in the last century. However, more than 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases is being stored in the oceans. By mid-century, scientists predict a further rise of 1.4-2.6C if carbon emissions continue to rise as they are today. If emissions were halted almost immediately and significant carbon was extracted from the atmosphere, the rise by mid-century would be 0.4-1.6C. The scientists predict the average temperature between 2080 and 2100 will be 2.6-4.8C higher than today if emissions are unchecked. They are 90% certain that heatwaves will be more frequent and longer. In the oceans, the strongest surface warming is expected in tropical and sub-tropical regions, up to 2C by 2100 and posing a grave threat to coral reefs which sustain much sealife. Scientists conclude that a collapse of the Gulf Stream that warms western Europe, as dramatised in the film The Day After Tomorrow, is very unlikely this century but cannot be ruled out afterwards. Oceans Global sea level has already risen by 20cm in the last century and scientists are now 90% certain that the rate of the rise will increase. The tide line is rising as warming glaciers and ice sheets pour hundreds of billions of tonnes of water into the oceans each year, but an equally big factor is the warming \u2013 and therefore expansion \u2013 of the seawater itself. The new projections for the average sea level in the period 2080-2100 are greater than in the 2007 report, ranging from 45-82cm higher than now if nothing is done to curb emissions to 26-55cm if carbon emissions are halted and reversed. In the former case, sea level could have risen by a 98cm by the end of the century, seriously threatening cities from Shanghai to New York and meaning hurricanes and cyclones inflict far worse damage when they hit shorelines. Sea level projections have been controversial because exactly how fast glaciers and ice sheets will slip into the sea is not well known. A collapse in ice sheets is therefore not included in the estimates and could add tens of centimetres more to the rise. Because the big Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are slow to melt, scientists predict melting and sea level rise will continue for centuries. If a temperature rise of between 1C and 4C is sustained, the vast Greenland ice sheet will completely melt adding 7m to sea level, scientists predict, but over the course of a millennium. The acidity of the ocean is also increasing, due the large amounts of carbon dioxide it is absorbing, and this will continue. This will harm shell-forming sealife but scientists are still determining to what extent. Ice The impact of warming is crystal clear in the faster rates of melting in virtually all the world&apos;s glaciers and the huge ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The ice sheets have been shedding at least five times more water in the 2000s than in the 1990s, the scientists report. Northern hemisphere snow cover has fallen by 11% a decade since 1967 and the temperature of the seasonally frozen ground, or permafrost, has increased by 2-3C in Russia and Alaska. Arctic sea ice has been melting by 9-14% a decade since 1979, while sea ice around Antarctica has been increasing by 1-2%, probably due to current changes. Scientists are 90% sure that Arctic sea ice, snow cover and glaciers will continue to shrink. The scientists say a &quot;nearly ice-free&quot; Arctic ocean in September is at least 66% likely before 2050. By 2100 between 35% and 85% of the remaining world glacier volume will have vanished if emissions are not cut. Permafrost is also 99% likely to shrink further. Extremes It is 90% certain that the number of warm days and nights has increased globally and heatwaves have become more frequent, lasting longer in Europe, Asia and Australia. Droughts have also become more frequent and intense in the Mediterranean and west African regions. The number of heavy rainfall events over land has increased in more regions than it has decreased. It is virtually certain that the frequency and intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic has increased since the 1970s. The scientists concluded it is 99% certain that the frequency of warm days and warm nights increases in the next decades, while that of cold days and cold nights to decrease. The frequency and intensity of extreme downpours is very likely to increase in many populous regions. Pause The last decade has been the warmest on record but although CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have continued to accelerate, surface air temperatures have only marginally increased in the past 15 years, leading some to suggest global warming has stopped. The IPCC scientists reject this, reporting that while the warming trend is robust over decades, there is &quot;substantial&quot; variability within decades. They conclude: &quot;Trends based on short records ... do not in general reflect long-term climate trends.&quot; They add that the heat being trapped by global warming in 2011 was 43% more than the estimate for 2005 in their last report and that over 90% of all the heat added enters the oceans. Carbon budget Scientists calculate that nearly half of all the carbon dioxide that can be safely emitted without raising temperatures above a dangerous 2C has already been emitted. This, says the IPCC, means governments must act quickly to have a reasonable change of avoiding 2C. It is also very likely that more than 20% of emitted CO2 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years after man-made missions have stopped. According to the IPCC, a large fraction of climate change is thus &quot;irreversible on a human time-scale&quot;, except if man-made CO2 emissions are sucked out of the atmosphere over a long period. Geoengineering The scientists report that &quot;geoengineering&quot; the climate by reducing the amount of sunlight being absorbed by earth or by extracting and storing carbon dioxide and other climate-changing emissions is theoretically possible. But, the IPCC warns, there is insufficient knowledge to assess how effective such methods, such as pumping sunscreen chemical into the stratosphere, would be and warns of &quot;side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale.&quot; Abrupt change It is &quot;very likely&quot; that the so-called Gulf Stream, which ferries warm water to western Europe, will weaken over the 21st century. But it is &quot;very unlikely&quot; to collapse or undergo a major transition this century. Further warming will lead to significant methane emissions from permafrost over the next century, equivalent to 50 to 250 billion tonnes of CO2. But the IPCC scientists do not assess the possibility of catastrophic releases this century. Uncertainties In terms of data, information is still limited in some locations and especially from before 1950s. There is also limited data from oceans below 700m. Theoretical uncertainties are how pollution affects cloud formation and the planet&apos;s overall climate &quot;sensitivity&quot;, ie how much it responds to extra CO2 in the atmosphere. The new report slightly reduces the minimum climate sensitivity but at the report&apos;s launch event, co-chair Thomas Stocker said that change, if realised would slow the impacts of climate change by just a few years. There is uncertainty about the contribution of human activity to changes in tropical cyclones and droughts. Other explanations of warming The scientists state: &quot;It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.&quot; The report rules out any significant contribution from changing solar cycles, volcanoes and cosmic rays.", "tags": ["Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "Climate change", "Global climate talks", "Environment", "Climate change", "Science", "United Nations", "World news", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Oceans", "Sea ice", "Sea level", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Geoengineering", "COP 19: UN climate change conference | Warsaw"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-27T16:29:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/29/trailer-trash-final-jason-solomons", "sentences": ["At Shanghai there was a dinner with the late, lovely Anthony Minghella after we&apos;d spent an afternoon talking to students at a gigantic university, followed by my DJing at the Chinese premiere of Woody Allen&apos;s Match Point and getting Maggie Cheung, Andy Lau and Zhang Ziyi on the dancefloor."], "title": "Trailer Trash", "article": "Best festival Trash was born at Cannes in 1999, when the idea struck me that the best way to cover this polymorphously perverse festival was through a diary. So it&apos;s probably in that environment that my column has thrived most. It coincided with the rise of the &quot;festival circuit&quot;, and I was fortunate to have the willing co-operation of the Observer and the festivals themselves in getting to cover so many of them. I still recall the jolt of a morning vodka with Alan Parker in Moscow where, because his Pink Floyd film The Wall was the most famous bootleg of the Soviet era, he is some kind of deity. Marrakech is a wonderful setting for a film festival and I shall cherish an afternoon with Martin Scorsese there, even though he spilt my mint tea as he crossed his little legs under one of those low tray tables. Bangkok briefly held a terrific festival, where I began a friendship with Olivier Assayas, although I mostly remember it for the food. San Sebasti\u00e1n has the best food, of course, and the biggest drinks, although I also saw some fabulous South American films there at the height of the continent&apos;s new wave (such as Bomb\u00f3n el Perro) and had my first interview with Woody Allen and the neurotic cast of Melinda and Melinda.     Martin Scorsese: 'He once spilt my mint tea.' Photograph: Paul Buck/EPA    The saddest festival has to be Edinburgh, which has ineluctably withered since moving outside the rest of the summer festivities there. It&apos;s also the worst walk, along that stinky road to the multiplex. Give me Venice&apos;s smelly canals. Although it too is &quot;at risk&quot; from the Toronto and Telluride festivals, I&apos;ve had some lovely times there and seen some memorable films (When the Levees Broke, Children of Men, Couscous). A moonlit swim in the Cipriani pool with Keira Knightley after the Atonement premiere; a bottle of champagne on the Excelsior beach with Samantha Morton and Laetita Casta; a dance with Spike Lee to Michael Jackson&apos;s Bad. At Shanghai there was a dinner with the late, lovely Anthony Minghella after we&apos;d spent an afternoon talking to students at a gigantic university, followed by my DJing at the Chinese premiere of Woody Allen&apos;s Match Point and getting Maggie Cheung, Andy Lau and Zhang Ziyi on the dancefloor. That&apos;s not to mention Taormina, Locarno, Dublin (I love Dublin) and our own brilliant LFF. But the winner will always be Cannes, where for 12 days \u2013 and nights \u2013 in May of every year this century, I have been at my happiest and Trashiest. Best party The lavish MTV Cannes parties at Pierre Cardin&apos;s bubble house are no longer. Gone are the private villas and the snows of yesteryear. Now there are more PR people than stars and journalists. They have us all by the balls. But the best things happen without pricey VIP rooms and clipboards. AmfAR&apos;s Cinema against Aids gala at Cannes is always spectacular. I went when it was at the Moulin in Mougins and Sharon Stone did the auction \u2013 a lady to whom you couldn&apos;t say no. But now it&apos;s at my favourite hotel in the world, the Hotel du Cap in Antibes. I danced with Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Cameron Diaz there once, and then gave generously to charity. The Vanity Fair party at the Oscars is ridiculously fabulous, but I prefer the unruly old bashes from the early days of the Bifas, when Ray Winstone lead the way. His daughter, Jaime, upholds his legacy. It sometimes goes the other way too \u2013 one of the worst parties was when Vera Drake opened the LFF in 2004: amazing venue, great film, but such a downer that everyone walked around the Great Court in the British Museum in sepulchral silence. However, a key party that sticks in my mind was in 2002, when the Bafta awards ceremony first moved from a slow berth in April to become a vital part of the awards season. Suddenly I was at the Sanderson hotel with Nicole Kidman, Dustin Hoffman, Russell Crowe, Salma Hayek and Julia Roberts all milling around Harvey Weinstein. Madonna popped in later and Anna Friel fell over on the dancefloor. I remember the injection of glamour that it brought to a cold February, helping to re-establish London as the world destination for such things during the next decade. Best star Anna Friel and Samantha Morton were very good value at parties. Michael Fassbender&apos;s an impressive sight in full swing too, and a properly good bloke. Sally Hawkins is really, really funny. George Clooney is a giggle \u2013 he showed me how to tie a windsor knot \u2013 and Tilda Swinton is as passionate as she is hilarious and witty. Obviously at parties and dinners, and off the record, you get the best bits of a person. I was fortunate enough to host 350 episodes of the Film Weekly podcast for the Observer too, and had some wonderful guests giving amazing insights. Sometimes it was the least expected who were the richest voices. Ray Harryhausen was a delight; ditto Bruce Robinson recalling making Withnail and I, Terence Davies getting so excited he turned red, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd on his friend Lars von Trier&apos;s infamous Hitler gag, Sir Norman Foster at the top of the Gherkin and Werner Herzog discussing The Simpsons. My favourite male guests were David Thewlis, Vincent Cassel, John Sayles, Danny Boyle, Jacques Audiard and Denzel Washington. Of the women, it must be Lynne Ramsay, Naomie Harris, B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo, Mira Nair, Mila Kunis and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz.

Would like to thank\u2026 I have measured out my life in Trash. I met my wife on a one-night, 15-hour &quot;assignment&quot; in Ibiza, there and back to the premiere of It&apos;s All Gone Pete Tong; we had a La Dolce Vita-themed wedding (lucky I found a girl who didn&apos;t mind being up to her thighs in a fountain); I wrote of the birth of my first son Cy and his impending diet of black-and-white movies (how hopeful I was, before Dora the Explorer and Fireman Sam); my mother and grandmother have both made it into these pages. And to my dear cousin Amiee, with whom I stayed in LA while covering the Oscars and who was gutted she didn&apos;t get a mention next to Shirley Bassey in dispatches: hello Amiee! Thanks to the stars, directors, writers, execs and PRs who all gamely helped create and sustain 14 years of gossip on and off screen.

It is a beautiful sight in its alarming, unhealthy way. China, I reflect, looks as though it is going to be slow to reveal itself. I\u00a0am here with the V&amp;A, in advance of the first major exhibition of Chinese painting in the UK since the Royal Academy&apos;s attempt at a historical overview in 1936. Some of the pieces coming to London will be more than 1,000 years old and many so frail they have never left Asia before. It is a cause for tremendous excitement because, as former director of the V&amp;A, Mark Jones, who commissioned the exhibition, puts it: &quot;The Chinese tradition produced some of the most beautiful and sophisticated paintings ever made.&quot; Most of us have some grasp of how European art evolved, but Chinese art can seem \u2013 if not quite as impenetrable as Beijing&apos;s smog \u2013 aloof. The exhibition&apos;s senior curator, Hongxing Zhang, who has been involved in much delicate negotiation to bring this show to London (with exhibits coming from China, America, Japan and Europe), is with us on this trip. His modest charm does not conceal his erudition or purpose. His aim is to demystify Chinese art. The exhibition starts in 700, ends in 1900. He says: &quot;I hope people will look at the work as tangible, having an impact on the senses, and not consider Chinese painting as a\u00a0foreign thing but have a direct encounter with it and understand its beauty.&quot; Our seven-day art trip is to be a &quot;direct encounter&quot; with some of the places that have a connection with the exhibition. But it begins with a leap into the present \u2013 a day of contemporary art from which to get our bearings. We drive from the airport to 798 district, Beijing&apos;s modern art centre, once an electronics factory in the Bauhaus style. By the time we get there the mist has gone, the sun is out and it is\u00a0humid. Bikes and tricycles pass at speed, many pedestrians wear face masks, and the air is full of floating white seeds from poplar trees, like escaped upholstery. Contemporary Chinese art became so big between 2006 and 2008 that there was an art-buying frenzy internationally and in China itself (thanks to the Chinese economic miracle). But for some time now art insiders have been talking of burnout \u2013 and the market has plateaued. We visit the studio of the phenomenal Xu Bing (an international artist feted at the British Museum and the Ashmolean), for whom tradition is radical. With the industry of a bird, he collects natural bric-a-brac \u2013 straw, pine branches, tissue paper, scraps of hessian \u2013 and arranges them in a\u00a0light box. He revels in &quot;painting with light&quot; and miraculously reproduces traditional landscapes down to the last ink smudge. He sees the western influence as a stumbling block: &quot;We have so many valuable things in Chinese tradition yet we do not know how to draw on them because for the past 200 years we have been thinking about how to learn from the west.&quot; And so, on that note, we are on our way to Beijing&apos;s Forbidden City, where treasures await us at the Palace Museum. I ask Hongxing Zhang what effect the Cultural Revolution has had on the way people prize traditional art. &quot;It is a deep question, and I can only answer simplistically. The Cultural Revolution involved loss of memory, lack of physical connection, buildings pulled down, living in an alien environment. But it is possible to reconnect with tradition through materials we can feel and touch: scrolls, paper, silk. It is a\u00a0direct way of activating memory. A\u00a0psychological need. Communism as an ideology has gone, but we feel passionate about tradition.&quot; The Forbidden City&apos;s buildings in sealing-wax red make a formidable statement. Waving a camera at their immensity, one feels like a daunted ant. We pass the invitingly named Palace of Mental Cultivation, Hall of Supreme Harmony and Hall for the Weary of Service and are told about the Forbidden City&apos;s most famous, despotic resident, Empress Dowager Cixi, Queen Victoria&apos;s contemporary (brilliantly rehabilitated this month by Jung Chang in her new biography Empress Dowager Cixi: the Concubine who Launched Modern China). Whatever the truth, we learn that Cixi had chutzpah: she splendidly appropriated the emperor&apos;s traditionally male dragon symbol for herself. It is clear that, in China, it is impossible to overstate the importance of symbolism or the delicacy of the alliance between nature and art. Mr Wang of the Palace Museum wears white gloves as he unrolls what is to be one of the V&amp;A&apos;s exhibits: Pomegranates, Autumn Mallows, Chrysanthemums, Blue Magpies and Rooster, a painting on silk by Lv Ji, a late 15th-century court artist. No one knows for whom it was painted, but auspicious messages abound. A strutting rooster represents a lord, a pomegranate tree promises fertility, a single magpie is not for sorrow but for promotion. The piece is so fragile that it can only be shown for short periods. Chinese painting turns out to be about brief encounters \u2013 as if each masterpiece were a\u00a0celebrity making a short public appearance before being driven away in a car with darkened windows. Paintings may spend years in the dark for their own good. The idea of rotation is ancient and refreshing (in every sense). As early as the 13th century, painter Zhao Xigu advised that pictures be changed &quot;every three to four days&quot; so scrolls &quot;will not suffer&quot; and, as importantly: &quot;You will never get tired of them.&quot; It is one of our first great revelations about the way Chinese art diverges from western. But then, for centuries, Chinese and western art led separate lives. Until the Jesuits arrived in China in the 17th century there was no cross-pollination, no western artistic influence on China \u2013 or vice versa. Europe imported Chinese silk and porcelain, but no painting or calligraphy. The west was ignorant of Chinese art. And when the Jesuits first brought vanishing-point perspectives to the east, the Chinese made fun of them. Hongxing prefers to dwell on similarities between artists from east and west but highlights material differences. In the west, artists worked on wood and canvas; in the east, on silk and paper \u2013 after all, a Chinese invention. He also points out the importance of the written language. The Chinese &quot;never had a problem putting words into pictures conceptually \u2013 very different from the west&quot;. Also: western art related to science (think of Leonardo&apos;s theory of colour), while Chinese art was more influenced by the humanities and poetry. Mark Jones explains that one of the reasons he was so keen to commission this show is that the west has been slow to recognise the freedom in Chinese painting, its &quot;adventurous exploration of a\u00a0whole gamut of possibilities that western art only tackled in the 20th century&quot;. It is a list that includes the ability to see paintings as &quot;a process of making abstract marks on a flat surface, as symbolic representations and as a series of gestures&quot;. This last &quot;came naturally to a culture which thought highly of calligraphy and used the same means \u2013 brush and ink \u2013 for both&quot;. At the same time as recognising these freedoms, one cannot but be struck by the Chinese obsession with discipline and rank. Traditional painting is divided into three types: birds and flowers; figures; landscapes. Art was judged by three adjectives. The best work was &quot;divine&quot; (no examples survive). Second best was &quot;untrammelled&quot; (a wonderful word that critics should re-employ without delay) and the third &quot;able&quot;. Presumably when paintings fell short of\u00a0able, no words were wasted on them. We leave Beijing behind for the remotest of destinations: Dunhuang&apos;s Mogao caves, in northwest China, on the edge of the Gobi desert, an extraordinarily wonderful, if not untrammelled, place \u2013 home of Buddhist art on the largest scale in the world. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture in the Tang dynasty. What it has in common with the Christian painting tradition is a link to ancient Greek culture: the world of the Mediterranean stretches from Greece to Dunhuang. The caves are like a closely guarded honeycomb, set into a sandstone hill, situated at what was once a cultural crossroads on the great Silk Road. There are 487 caves in the south, first constructed in 366AD, containing Buddhist art from the 4th to 14th century. Each cave is different, but most include Buddhas (the tallest we saw was 24m high \u2013 we did not reach his golden knees) and animated wall paintings. On one wall alone, unsavoury western travellers are attacked by the Chinese, sea monsters frolic and the figure of Mercy appears (and, one hopes, is about to intervene). These amazing murals are painted by the same artists responsible for the exhibition&apos;s silk paintings (banners, screens and hand-held fans were the main type of painting up to the 13th century). A dozen exhibits originate from Dunhuang \u2013 and one cave in particular. Cave 17, or &quot;the library&quot;, is simple, small and crucial. It was walled up in the 9th century and no one knew it existed until, on 25 June 1900, it was discovered by Wang Yuanlu, a\u00a0Taoist monk sweeping sand from its entrance. It contained a monk&apos;s statue and his ashes and was stuffed, from floor to ceiling, with 50,000 priceless scrolls \u2013 China&apos;s equivalent to Tutankhamun&apos;s tomb. Yuanlu failed to appreciate the national significance of this hoard. He sold off treasures to Hungarian archaeologist Aurel Stein, French archaeologist Paul Pelliot, American explorer Langdon Warner and other opportunistic foreigners. We are shown a photograph of Wang Yuanlu, taken by Stein. Careful inspection reveals the anxiety underscoring his smile. I find the &quot;library&quot; overwhelming and unexpectedly moving: the tranquil statue of the 9th-century monk seems to rise above time, strife and scroll-plundering foreigners. On the wall are his painted personal effects: a\u00a0water bottle and a scalloped bag hanging over a branch. They are conveyed with sketchy haste as if to signify the transience of material possessions although, with all other treasures gone, here they remain. After Dunhuang we travel to Shanghai \u2013 a\u00a0city that moves so fast it keeps grinding to a\u00a0standstill. In the conservation studio at Shanghai Museum I am struck by how often, in China, ancient and modern collide. Inside, the scene is slow and harmonious, yet on the other side of the glass the city&apos;s skyscrapers crowd round. Conservation in China is controversial: there is pride in making art look as good as new \u2013 or old. It is comprehensively thorough. Chinese art was made in the expectation of regular remountings. We are shown how the back of silk can be painted to give the white upside a creamier density. Laying it on thick turns out to be an art. But head conservator Shen Weizhu and his virtuoso team are miniaturists, too, working on what looks like a wrecked autumn leaf \u2013 a silk hand screen, devoured by insects. They strive to retain the original lining because it is the ming zhi (vital life) of the work. It is at Shanghai&apos;s Museum that we are shown a work whose &quot;vital life&quot; is not in question: a 15th-century gem, unseen for five years, coming to the V&amp;A, of courtesans applying an almost scholarly attention to a football (inflated pig bladders were used as footballs in the Beijing court). A\u00a0lady with an unfeasibly silky yellow foot is about to kick\u2026 It is a piece of improbable charm. All week I wonder how such exquisite pieces affect China&apos;s artists and to what extent turning back to tradition is popular because it is safer than looking ahead. At one extreme, one thinks of Ai Weiwei&apos;s 1995 iconoclastic Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn (1995) \u2013 smashing a vase in tradition&apos;s face \u2013 and his outspoken words in the Guardian in 2012: &quot;The Chinese art world does not exist. In a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights, anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence.&quot; At the other extreme is artist Xu Bing, for whom the past remains a powerful resource. He tells us it is the artist&apos;s duty to dream and experiment: &quot;In China the dreams are good, the reality tough.&quot; He sees the future as &quot;a big challenge with a lot of problems to solve&quot;, but explains: &quot;Re-exploring traditional culture has helped me understand why China is in today&apos;s shape.&quot; Professor Craig Clunas, art historian at Oxford University, counsels against generalisations. &quot;We should not seek to impose a narrative of unity. It is China&apos;s diversity we most urgently need to understand,&quot; he says. The western tendency, he believes, when looking at contemporary Chinese art, is to find a\u00a0political critique in everything. The truth is that China is a huge country. And, he observes, its art extends to guo hua \u2013 national painting eagerly sought by Chinese collectors which does not sell to the west. In Hangzhou in eastern China \u2013 our last stop \u2013 we visit the China Academy of Art, China&apos;s most influential arts university, where more than half the pupils are studying traditional Chinese art. When 22-year-old Li Jinrui is asked what calligraphy means to her, she describes calligraphy as if it were a religion that has changed her life. She was a restless child until calligraphy calmed her. Her boyfriend is a calligraphy convert, too. She adds that she is &quot;very fond&quot; of him. The boyfriend looks bashful and everyone smiles. China has many young artists now who are the modern equivalent of the traditional scholar-artists of the past. As Katie Hill, one of the authors of The Chinese Art Book (published this month by Phaidon), points out: &quot;Retreat and hermitage were key themes in Chinese literati painting. The scholar figure turned his back on mainstream politics to keep moral integrity, refusing to take part in the regime.&quot; A comparable young artistic elite &quot;refuses to engage politically because it is not possible&quot;. Retreat is key: centuries before the European invention of the artist as romantic outsider, scholar gentlemen were painting in remote, beautiful places. We are about to end our trip with our own retreat into landscape. When I first glimpse Hangzhou&apos;s West Lake through the coach window, I exclaim with delight because I recognise it from Chinese painting (and my mother&apos;s blue-and-white china). Lake, hills, temple, stone bridge\u2026 Until now, I had supposed such landscapes to be idealised artistic fictions. Hongxing Zhang explains that Chinese artists were never slavishly representational; they painted what they knew \u2013 landscapes of the mind&apos;s eye. Bare Willows and Distant Mountains, a 12th-13th century fan by Ma Yuan (in the exhibition), suggests Hangzhou, but is no duty-doing likeness. Hongxing Zhang identifies a lack of awe in the Chinese attitude towards nature (where awe was a starting point for western landscape painting). &quot;Chinese artists \u2013 and Chinese people in general \u2013 find a friendship in nature, in water or in mountains and feel part of it,&quot; he adds. I think back to the artists I met on the first day in Beijing, struggling to find their place: the energetically disquieting Wang Xingwei, who has secured his reputation by satirising art history from the west, and Xiang Jing and Qu Guangci, married artists on the cover of the latest Chinese Tatler who refer to the past by seeing nature \u2013 particularly animals \u2013 as illuminating. Qu Guangci&apos;s larger-than-life bestiary has the title: Will Things Ever Get Better? On our last morning, I get up early to walk round West Lake. It is 7.15am and it is to be one of the most magical walks of my life. The bridge and lakeside paths are already full of people greeting the day: fishing, feeding ducks, flying kites, doing tai chi \u2013 an ancient man manages an unbelievably supple and high leg stretch. There is gentle sunshine, a light breeze, water lilies and music everywhere \u2013 people with radios and, under a temple, an old man practising his saxophone (old men seem to be Hangzhou&apos;s chief recreationalists). In the evening we return to the lake to catch a boat back. It is dark and warm. The skipper rows with a leaf-shaped oar; we hold bamboo fans; the lapping water is a lullaby. And I am, momentarily, assailed by the illusion that we are part of a Chinese painting: tiny dots afloat, figures in a landscape, on our way home.

Do not fight back, even if you are getting beaten,&quot; he explained. Such lessons are becoming more important; at one Hong Kong airline, cabin crews are learning kung fu.

Beijing Capital has the worst delays of the world&apos;s 35 largest airports, according to the US website FlightStats. In July less than a fifth of planes left on time; Shanghai was not much better. Not one Chinese airport saw even half its flights depart punctually. Though Beijing&apos;s record improved slightly in August, fewer than three in 10 flights were on schedule. On Monday China announced it was cracking down on false terrorist threats, which have contributed to flight delays and diversions, threatening to jail offenders for more than five years. State news agency Xinhua said there had been 80 fake threats to flights and airports this year. But experts say the bigger issue is the massive growth of the airline industry, coupled with air traffic restrictions related to the military use of airspace. The military controls around 80% of the airspace, according to a civil aviation administration official, compared with around 20% in Europe or the US. Cheng-Lung Wu, who researches aviation punctuality at the University of New South Wales, Australia, said: &quot;Military exercises take priority over civilian aviation and often when a military exercise is on it also uses civilian airspace. Here come the air traffic-related delays for your flights: the available airspace is now squeezed even further.&quot; There were 296m domestic passenger journeys in 2012, up almost 9% on the previous year, and the International Air Transport Association predicts almost 200 million more Chinese passengers will have taken to the skies by the end of 2016. Work is under way at dozens of sites to add to China&apos;s 180-plus airports, including a vast new facility at Beijing, which already boasts the world&apos;s second largest terminal. Last month the world&apos;s highest civilian airport opened on the Tibetan plateau. A third of all passengers travel through three cities: Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Chunyan Yu, an expert on airport and airline performance measurement at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in the US, said Beijing Capital was now the world&apos;s second busiest airport in terms of passengers. &quot;The commercial flights are strictly restricted to certain flight paths [so] those &apos;highways in the air&apos; are very congested \u2013 the same as congested highways during rush hours. As flights are already tightly scheduled, there is really no room for recovery.&quot; A private pilot compared US airspace to a soccer pitch: &quot;You can wander from point to point, crossing each other. In China, everyone gets in a line.&quot; Travellers blame airline inefficiency. Wu cited a lengthy delay he experienced at Shanghai not long ago: &quot;The pilot said it was due to weather conditions, but outside it was sunny.&quot; China also takes an extremely cautious approach to the flow of flights, with unusually long gaps between takeoffs and landings, following crashes in the early 1990s. It has had an excellent safety record over recent years. Other procedures could easily improve, say experts. In China, pilots must prepare for push-back and takeoff before telling air traffic control they are ready and sitting in a queue. Elsewhere, controllers advise pilots on the outlook in advance, so they do not have to sit at the gate with their engines running, wasting fuel while the passengers on board grow angrier. Officials have now ordered flights from major airports to take off even if there is no clear landing slot at their destination \u2013 one possible reason for August&apos;s punctuality improvement at Beijing. Experts see that as a patch rather than a solution, and not an ideal one. &quot;It is more risky to keep the planes waiting in the sky. It increases emissions and, more importantly, it extends the pilots&apos; flying time,&quot; warned one scholar from the Civil Aviation Flight University of China, who asked not to be named. Nor is it clear that tired passengers will find extended flights more enjoyable than long waits prior to takeoff. Delays have already encouraged some to switch to the country&apos;s fast-expanding high-speed train network instead.

We heard lectures from Ralph Miliband, among others (Ralph Miliband didn&apos;t hate Britain, says his biographer \u2013 his enemy was injustice, 2 October). He analysed and rejoiced in the great British radical tradition, from the Lollards and Levellers, Thomas Paine, Wilberforce and the anti-slavery movement, Shaftesbury and, yes, the trades unions. He talked also of the remarkable British tolerance and readiness to receive immigrants and refugees, like himself. Of course, he was an immigrant, a socialist and a gifted intellectual \u2013 all the things despised by the Daily Mail. I loathe the Mail and its politics because it expresses everything that is foul about the rightwing in this country. That does not mean I am the less patriotic. Quite the reverse. It is because I love my country that I find the Mail unpatriotic, nasty, intolerant and everything that demeans Britain.Colin PickthallUlverston, Cumbria \u2022 It must have been tempting for Ed Miliband to have ignored the Mail article, assuming it was so ridiculous it would soon be forgotten. However, this is the mistake John Kerry made in 2004 when the swift boat veterans made fictitious claims about his Vietnam war record. The people who benefited were Dick Cheney and George Bush, who both would probably have chosen to keep their own history of that era secret. Incidently, the Mail&apos;s history of not letting the facts get in the way of a good story goes back many years. During the Boxer rebellion on 16 July 1900, their Shanghai correspondent reported &quot;the death of all foreigners in Peking&quot;. They had been &quot;put to death in the most atrocious manner&quot; except in cases where men had been able to shoot their own wives and children before the Chinese burst in. For two weeks the story was believed and a mass service of mourning was organised for St Paul&apos;s Cathedral. This had to be cancelled when it was found not to have happened (Source: Dreadnought, by Robert K Massie, 1992).Colin MacarthurRamsbottom, Lancashire \u2022 The Mail now obviously draws its editorial line straight from Ukip. In the Ukip cultural policy statement in 2010, &quot;Restoring Britishness&quot;, we were told: &quot;As this first generational wave of Marxist-sympathisers age, a new generation is taking their place. Two senior New Labour ministers, David and Ed Miliband, are the sons of Trotskyite Ralph Miliband, who is buried in the same cemetery as Karl Marx\u2026 They represent the next generation of highly placed leftist social engineers, who will carry on the dangerous work the so called &apos;generation of 68&apos; started unless stopped politically.&quot; This was republished on the Ukip website in April 2013. The right judges us by our burial places as well as our written and genetic legacies.Rev Andrew DaveyLondon \u2022 The Mail hates Ralph Miliband because he wanted to create a better world; a more equal and just one, not dominated by the pursuit of profit and the dominance of a small, powerful, rich elite. He was a socialist and proud to be, who drew his inspiration from the struggles of the oppressed and developed a critique of capitalism which was based on a Marxist analysis. His last book, Socialism for a Sceptical Age, published in 1994 (and, by the way, well worth a read), foresaw how private enterprise would come to dominate all sectors of economic life. His answer was the construction of a different society, which would create genuine citizenship and community: yes a socialist society. If that&apos;s evil, then I&apos;m a cabbage.Jol MiskinWorkers&apos; Educational Association, Sheffield \u2022 Of all the countries in Europe, it&apos;s only England where being a Marxist could be construed as proof positive that one is an enemy of the nation, as opposed to merely espousing a mainstream political and philosophic position that some support and some oppose. Is it no wonder that, firstly, the Daily Mail&apos;s mental map sees the English Channel as the same width as the Atlantic Ocean and, secondly, that the rest of Europe see this country as politically, intellectually and emotionally isolationist?Simon Sedgwick-JellCambridge \u2022 The Daily Mail had form long before its appalling support of the fascists during the 1930s (Letters, 2 October). In 1924, it played the red smear card when it published the so-called Zinoviev letter. This purported to be from the Communist International to the Communist Party of Great Britain, calling on British communists to mobilise &quot;sympathetic forces&quot; in the Labour party to support an Anglo-Soviet treaty. The Daily Mail published this just before the 1924 general election, lost by the first Labour government, under the headline Civil War Plot by Socialists&apos; Masters. The letter, probably a forgery concocted by dissident White Russians, and leaked to the Conservative party by MI6, had the desired result. Plus ca change indeed.John KewSawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire  \u2022 As someone who was taught by Ralph Miliband and who (like his sons) admired the man while rejecting much of his politics, I thought your reference to Orwell was spot on (Editorial, 2 October). Orwell&apos;s brand of radical patriotism, captured in his description of the country as &quot;a family with the wrong members in control&quot;, would also qualify him in Mail-speak to be someone who &quot;hated Britain&quot;. The real hatred comes from those who peddle this kind of pathetic nonsense.Professor Tony WrightBirmingham \u2022 Ed Miliband might wreak vengeance on his Fleet Street tormentors in a manner that would benefit the rest of us by closing the tax loopholes that allow the likes of Viscount Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail, to live in Wiltshire but pay tax as though he lives in France.W Stephen GilbertCorsham, Wiltshire", "tags": ["Ed Miliband", "Politics", "Daily Mail", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Media", "Ralph Miliband", "Viscount Rothermere", "Paul Dacre"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-02T20:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/oct/03/red-cross-players-accountable-war-crimes", "sentences": ["Battlefield 4  \u2013 the siege of Shanghai level    I don&apos;t even think that&apos;s what the ICRC wants \u2013 it doesn&apos;t want moral doubt to arise purely through aesthetics, it wants designers to think about international law, and about how warfare should operate."], "title": "Should gamers be accountable for in-game war crimes?", "article": "Don&apos;t shoot the civilians. This is something military games have been telling us for many years. I remember my first go on Taito&apos;s explosive arcade title Operation Wolf \u2013 it was the late-80s and this frenzied blast-&apos;em-up, with its jungle environment and hostage rescue missions, was clearly gunning for a generation of Rambo II fanatics. It even let you control the action with an Uzi-style sub-machine gun bolted to the cabinet. But what it wouldn&apos;t let you do was kill passing civilians: collateral damage of this sort took a big chunk off your health bar.  Of course, this was really more about mechanics than ethics: players were being tested on their reactions and visual awareness, and failure meant a reduction in game time rather than a few moments&apos; reflection on innocent victims. These days, if you accidentally (or otherwise) shoot a civilian or comrade in a military shooter, you&apos;ll probably get a &apos;mission failed&apos; message and a one-way trip back to the last checkpoint. What you won&apos;t get is a military tribunal and a dishonorable discharge.  In a BBC news report earlier this week, however, Francois Senechaud from the International Committee of the Red Cross told a reporter that, due to the increasing verisimilitude between first-person shooters and real-life combat, games should start to abide by the international laws of armed conflict. &quot;Video games that represent contemporary battlefields are very close to reality,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to make out the difference between real footage and the footage you get from video games.&quot; What the Red Cross wants to see then is the player being penalised for carrying out such actions as willfully killing civilians or torturing enemy combatants, both of which are punishable under international law. A Q&amp;A document posted on the organisation&apos;s website explains:  The ICRC is suggesting that as in real life, these games should include virtual consequences for people&apos;s actions and decisions. Gamers should be rewarded for respecting the law of armed conflict and there should be virtual penalties for serious violations of the law of armed conflict, in other words war crimes.   And importantly it adds:  Our intention is not to spoil player&apos;s enjoyment by for example, interrupting the game with pop-up messages listing legal provisions or lecturing gamers on the law of armed conflict. We would like to see the law of armed conflict integrated into the games so that players have a realistic experience and deal first-hand with the dilemmas facing real combatants on real battlefields.   The ICRC says it is now working directly with the developers of modern military simulations and the BBC report contains an interview with Marek Spanel of Bohemia Interactive, creator of the Arma series, who claims the studio&apos;s games will now be implementing the suggestions.     Arma 2: The Red Cross believes that as video games become ever more realistic, they should also adhere to international rules of warfare.    Feasibility studied The question is, how feasible are the ICRC&apos;s aims and will players really take on board the lessons about humanitarian law? It is difficult to imagine a Call of Duty or Battlefield title in which shooting a civilian leads to a mission where the player is detained in a military prison for several months before being tried and sentenced. But then if the consequences of illegal operations are subsumed into the gameplay mechanics \u2013 i.e. shoot civilian, fail mission \u2013 the player will usually read these instances in ludic terms. Within the action, civilians are are not people who deserve humane treatment, they&apos;re walking fail states to be avoided in the pursuit of success.  We do often see the consequences of player actions being threaded into gameplay, but this tends to be in the adventure genre. Titles like Fable, Heavy Rain, Walking Dead and Dishonored all provide different paths for a player depending on their moral decisions during play \u2013 and because the action is combined with a confirming narrative element, the meaning and weight of transgression can come through. The idea of an action adventure that put the player into a series of defining humanitarian situations allowing the story to spin-off in the player&apos;s moral direction is interesting \u2013 but it&apos;s hugely unlikely in the action cinema world of the modern shooter. Furthermore, the ICRC statement makes clear that it is not interested in other genres \u2013 it is concentrating on combat games that depict and concentrate on contemporary battlefields. So how can players be made accountable for their actions beyond simple gameplay devices? How do you move beyond the simple message, &quot;Mission failed, you have broken international law and will spend the next ten years in prison. Re-start mission?&quot;      Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2: shootouts often occur in areas where civilians are in the line of fire.    Moral dilemmas There have been two stand-out examples. In Modern Warfare 2&apos;s notorious No Russian mission a US soldier is embedded with a Russian terrorist organisation and must take part in a mass killing at an airport. Success means blending in with the terror squad, and it&apos;s up to the player to decide whether that extends as far as shooting civilians. The sequence was brave, but also clumsily handled, exploitative and incongruous; however, it did place the player in a position where many felt they genuinely had to weigh up their moral proclivities with the demands of the gameplay mission. Much more intriguing, though, is the scene in Yager Development&apos;s criminally overlooked shooter, Spec Ops: The Line, where three soldiers are stranded in a wrecked Dubai facing a crowd of angry locals. In a scene reminiscent of the Black Hawk Down incident, they must decide whether to shoot their way out or face death. Although actually, it&apos;s more interesting than that, because the first shot fired sends the group fleeing \u2013 something the player won&apos;t know until they commit to pulling the trigger. And vitally, those who point their gun in the air before firing get the same dispersal effect without casualties. In the heat of the game, facing a furious mob, many players will take the lethal option \u2013 but they sure as hell think about it. It is these sorts of split-second decisions that really suggest something about the complexities of combat. But then, of course, these examples offer more than a mere punishment mechanic \u2013 which is what the ICRC seems to be asking for. If all transgressions automatically lead to failure, it&apos;s a zero-sum game that invites only functional thinking. Players need to be able to live with the consequences of actions in more subtle ways. In both Heavy Rain and Walking Dead, players face lethal moral decisions that don&apos;t end the game, or even have ludic consequences for the player, but yet play on the mind and colour the experience. The game may be over but the choices remain \u2013 and by ending chapter of Waking Dead with a guide to the actions of other players, developer Telltale Games cleverly addresses and confronts the process. Often the most affecting moments are those hidden in momentary or supplementary features. The ability to name characters in titles like Cannon Fodder and XCOM, for example, provided a heightened level of emotional attachment for many players. The way we learn little snippets about the lives of the characters passing through our border gates in Papers, Please. The way that mobile phone hacking lets us see into the personal problems of potential targets in Watch Dogs. In games, moral depth is much more about humanisation than it is about punishment. The latter is too intricately tied in with atavistic gameplay systems for us to extrapolate anything deeper than game over. We are, though, surely heading into an era where gamers will have to take greater responsibility for their actions \u2013 if only because the visual fidelity will be there to splatter our violent failings across the screen in HD detail. In Operation Wolf, accidentally machine gunning a glitching sprite that vaguely resembled a non-military human could be easily divorced from the reality of armed conflict. In Battlefield 5 or Call of Duty 27, it may not be so simple to dismiss the sight of a photo-realistic person lying in the dust, eyes rolling back, limbs spasming.      Battlefield 4  \u2013 the siege of Shanghai level    I don&apos;t even think that&apos;s what the ICRC wants \u2013 it doesn&apos;t want moral doubt to arise purely through aesthetics, it wants designers to think about international law, and about how warfare should operate. It wants developers to say, in this mission you must fly an armed drone over a school where terrorists are known to be hiding, and you must decide whether to open fire. And it wants players to understand the consequences of such an action, not just in terms of the score or progress, but in terms of the real world of warfare \u2013 the one that all military games reflect and fetishise..", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Shoot 'em ups", "Call of Duty", "PC", "PS3", "Xbox", "Controversy", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-03T09:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/05/guardian-weekend-magazine-readers-letters", "sentences": ["Yvonne Burnett Banstead, Surrey Given the photos of dogs squeezed in cages, maybe a vegan restaurant would have been a better choice than one where Marina O&apos;Loughlin had &quot;pigs&apos; cheeks cooked until crusty&quot;.Alwynne CartmellBolton, Lancashire Eric Leleu&apos;s photographs brought back memories of my time teaching in Shanghai."], "title": "Your view | Guardian Weekend magazine readers' letters", "article": "So, &quot;feeling small against [this] enormous male character&quot; is what Billie Piper considers a &quot;healthy representation of women&quot; and &quot;quite romantic&quot;?

All around, for many miles, buildings belch out vast black oceans of smoke. But there are more pressing matters at hand \u2013 like, for example, who is about to emerge from the lift that just arrived on the top floor of this vast skyscraper. Because this rooftop is an objective point in the Battlefield 4 map, Siege of Shanghai \u2013 and the elevator is the only way up, for both allies and enemies. Here we are then enjoying a glimpse into the future of the Battlefield series \u2013 one of 10 new multiplayer maps rolling out with the forthcoming instalment. In the Conquest mode, there are three points to secure and hold against the opposing team: one is in an underground carpark beneath a vast open square, the second is on that skyscraper rooftop, and the third is in a shopping arcade built around a large glass atrium. The three points are separated by a large river, with the skyscraper positioned on a thumb of land in the middle \u2013 so, for ground troops, access between the points is via two highly exposed bridges, or a quick swim across the water. It&apos;s a tactically rich set-up, expertly realised by the team at EA Dice. For the carpark point, there&apos;s a glass roof allowing players to lob down grenades, while the clear space makes the square a happy hunting ground for snipers hidden out behind nearby buildings. The shopping centre has two large exits at either end, allowing vehicles to be driven in, but balcony areas along the sides allow the flag to be defended by troops with RPGs. It&apos;s that old FPS magic of give and take \u2013 every entrance is also a risk.  The highlight though, is the point at the top of the skyscraper \u2013 here, the holding team must guard the two groups of elevator entrances, while watching out for enemy chopper attacks. There are also glass areas of the floor that start to crack under gun fire, before exploding away, taking anyone standing on them along for the drop. For the brave or foolhardy, base jumping from the rooftop also affords handy aerial access to the other two flag points, and dropping down from above, firing at unwary enemies is as thrilling as it always has been in the Battlefield series.      Battlefield 4 2    Both Battlefield and Call of Duty want to draw us to the dynamic elements of their latest map designs, and Siege of Shanghai has the most spectacular. It&apos;s possible to take out the columns supporting the skyscraper with grenades, prompting the whole thing to collapse into swirling dust and jagged claws of masonry. Suddenly, the little triangle of land in the centre of the map becomes just about the hardest flag point to hold, as helicopters use the clear airspace to rain down fire and snipers wait on the other sides of the river to take out unwary foes.  It is a map, then, of contrasts \u2013 of neat little skirmishes and then great battles between helicopters and tanks. I like how the play flow can be subtly redirected, perhaps by bringing up the barriers on a bridge, or closing the shutters on a shop \u2013 clever players are able to subtly manipulate their enemies. I also likes the renewed sense of verticality, symbolised by that vast tower in the centre. Everything has an overwatch point, everything is vulnerable from above, and you&apos;re constantly attempting to pincer the enemy, not just from the sides but also from above and below.  There have been some interesting little updates to the interface too. The lobby, which shows the pre-spawn field map, now lets you spawn directly into vehicles \u2013 a simple but effective shortcut. When you pass the cursor over the different flag points, you get a little bit of CCTV footage showing you what&apos;s going on, which brings a little bit of life to the screen.  Elsewhere, vehicle handling has been changed. Tanks and APCs are controlled using a single analogue stick for direction and acceleration; there&apos;s no accelerator/brake set-up. It resembles the vehicle controls in the Lego games and takes a while to get used to, but it may work better in the long run. I haven&apos;t yet tried to fly a chopper.  Only two modes are available in the beta \u2013 Conquest and Domination, the latter a more condensed, infantry-based affair, that I still don&apos;t like in a Battlefield title. There are five more modes to come.      Battlefield 4 3    So yes, this is positive stuff from Battlefield. Graphically, the current gen consoles are showing their age and struggling with some of the depth of aesthetic ambition \u2013 perhaps it&apos;s Shanghai&apos;s endless banks of concrete and steel, but texture detail looks stark in some places. But this map shows that Dice still knows how to create maps that combine stealth and strategy with choke points of sheer ferocity and noise. With Call of Duty: Ghosts also doing some intriguing things with its multiplayer modes and map designs, there is still fun to be teased from these FPS old-timers.\u2022 Let us know about your experiences with the Battlefield 4 open beta in the comments section.", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Shoot 'em ups", "PS3", "Xbox", "PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Skyscrapers", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-07T16:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/prestwick-airport-nationalised-scotland", "sentences": ["Following the agreement of its board earlier today in Shanghai, we are entering into negotiations with Infratil for the potential acquisition of Prestwick Aviation Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries.&quot; The airport&apos;s local MSP, John Scott, who is also one of Holyrood&apos;s deputy presiding officers, said he was pleased that ministers were stepping in, provided that the government aimed to sell it back into private hands once it became profitable again."], "title": "Prestwick airport set to be nationalised", "article": "Scottish ministers are to take Prestwick airport into public ownership in an attempt to rescue the ailing site after years of losses.

One of Scotland&apos;s best known airports, Prestwick is where Elvis Presley is reputed to have touched UK soil for the first and only time, in 1960. But its relative isolation in south Ayrshire means it has struggled to compete against its close rival Glasgow international airport. Once kept afloat by the budget airlines Go and Ryanair, it was put up for sale in March last year after running annual losses of \u00a32m, but none of the prospective bidders were able to strike a deal with Infratil. Passenger numbers peaked at 2.4 million in 2007 but have since slumped to just over one million a year, leaving Prestwick trailing behind Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament that Infratil had been considering several options including the airport&apos;s closure. That would be a &quot;serious and unwelcome development&quot; for Ayrshire and the wider Scottish economy, with 300 jobs at the airport and another 1,100 jobs indirectly linked to it. &quot;We believe Prestwick airport can have a positive future,&quot; she said. &quot;It will require investment and it will take time. However, we believe it can be returned to profitability. We also estimate that the cost of closure to the public purse would be very significant and this is an important factor in our decision.&quot; She dismissed fears that ministers were venturing into difficult territory, since the Scottish government already owned 11 small regional and local airports such as Inverness through Highlands and Islands Airports Limited. Other regional airports including Manchester, Stansted, Newcastle and Cardiff were owned wholly or substantially by public sector bodies such as local councils, Sturgeon said. In addition to the passenger airport, there were 1,800 jobs tied to the aerospace industry cluster at the site. &quot;I can therefore advise parliament that the Scottish government has advised the current owners of our intention to commence a process towards acquisition of Prestwick airport. Following the agreement of its board earlier today in Shanghai, we are entering into negotiations with Infratil for the potential acquisition of Prestwick Aviation Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries.&quot; The airport&apos;s local MSP, John Scott, who is also one of Holyrood&apos;s deputy presiding officers, said he was pleased that ministers were stepping in, provided that the government aimed to sell it back into private hands once it became profitable again. &quot;I believe an opportunity now exists to return Prestwick airport to profitability, and ultimately to private ownership, as the upturn in the economy continues and passenger and freight volumes increase,&quot; he said. Alex Johnstone, the Scottish Tory transport spokesman, said ministers had to safeguard public money and be robust if they failed to make it viable. &quot;It is going to take an enormous effort to get the airport back into profit and make it sustainable for the future,&quot; he said. &quot;That will involve a significant level of restructuring and the Scottish government has to have the courage to do what&apos;s necessary rather than simply pouring money into something without accruing any benefit.&quot;", "tags": ["Scotland", "UK news", "Scottish politics", "Politics", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "Scottish National party (SNP)"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-08T17:31:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/09/tv-highlights-dan-snow-congo", "sentences": ["Tennis: Shanghai Masters7am, Sky Sports 1 Third day of play from Shanghai&apos;s Qi Zhing stadium.", "The Shanghai Masters was founded only in 2009, but has swiftly become a favourite of the players on the ATP World Masters Tour; it has been voted Tournament Of The Year in every year of its existence."], "title": "TV highlights 09/10/2013", "article": "Tennis: Shanghai Masters7am, Sky Sports 1 Third day of play from Shanghai&apos;s Qi Zhing stadium.

Andrew Mueller The Great British Year9pm, BBC1 This luxuriant celebration of Britain&apos;s seasons reaches spring \u2013 that annual frisson of blossoming optimism that, at its most miraculous, can seem like something more than a delusional interlude between a freezing, bone-soaking winter and a summer spent listening to coverage of rain-delayed Test matches. The photography is mesmerising, the soundtrack not obtrusive: those fortunate to possess gardens will look at them anew, and anticipate March even more fervently. AM Dan Snow&apos;s History Of\u00a0Congo9pm, BBC2 A vast country that&apos;s rich in resources, Congo should be a central African superpower. So why is it such a perennially troubled nation? Taking a similar approach to his documentary on Syria earlier this year, Dan Snow views the country&apos;s poverty and ongoing conflict that&apos;s already claimed the lives of millions through the prism of its past. It&apos;s a story encompassing slavery, Belgian colonisation, cold war politics and, in the Mobutu era, corruption on an epic scale represented by the dictator&apos;s vast and now ruined palace. Jonathan Wright Whitechapel9pm, ITV The final episode of this series wraps up last week&apos;s case of suspected cannibalism on the streets of Whitechapel. A girl is missing and Chandler&apos;s team endeavours to find her before she becomes a hot meal, while a vicar is the subject of a human sacrifice. But Miles is becoming increasingly distracted by his search for the weird old lady who appeared in episode one and has been freaking people out ever since. He&apos;s got some pretty wild theories about her, too. It all leads to a rather melodramatic denouement. Ben Arnold Fat For Cash9pm, Channel 5 One of those documentaries where the blurb says &quot;thought provoking&quot; and &quot;exploring a wide range of issues surrounding weight&quot; but is actually a prurient gawp at obese women who make money from parading their flesh on the internet. There&apos;s not much more to say and the women themselves are of the &quot;if they&apos;ll pay for it, I&apos;ll offer it&quot; school of thought. Stories featured include big pole-dancers, a woman from Boston who weighs herself on webcam, and a 40-stone woman who can barely move. Julia\u00a0Raeside Medieval Lives: Birth, Marriage, Death9pm, BBC4 The lives of medieval women have been much examined on TV this year, via the BBC dramatisation of Philippa Gregory&apos;s novel The White Queen and Gregory&apos;s own subsequent documentary. Dr Helen Castor&apos;s series picks up on three major points raised there, starting with birth \u2013 then without anaesthetic and supervised by religious, not medical, professionals. Castor presents a world that viewed women as a flawed version of man: their gaze made fruit die, tarnished mirrors, and even killed children. John Robinson Muhammad Ali&apos;s Greatest Fight9pm, Sky Atlantic Directed by Stephen Frears and featuring Christopher Plummer and Danny Glover, this is a dramatised look at the backroom wrangling among the Supreme Court judges which led to the overturning of Ali&apos;s conviction for refusing to be drafted on religious grounds. It was a close-run thing, however, with a 5-3 verdict that would have sent the champ to jail initially decided on, until a young clerk did some background digging. Ali is depicted only in archive footage but steals the show nonetheless. David Stubbs Devious Maids10pm, TLC The Plucky Strings Chamber Orchestra finds a new job after the demise of Desperate Housewives. This adaptation of a Mexican format sees Flora, a maid, stabbed in her cruel employer&apos;s study in the middle of a glitzy party. A new maid arrives in town but is she all she seems? The help are defiant, stoic and like the strings, really plucky; their snooty, unkind employers mere cyphers.

If the rehabilitation from the procedure on a disc in his back goes to plan, the world No3 will play alongside Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, Nicol\u00e1s Almagro and Richard Gasquet in the four-man exhibition tournament in the Caribbean which begins on 28 November. Murray first began struggling with a back problem during the 2012 clay-court season, and it flared up again on the same surface earlier this year. The 26-year-old missed the French Open but went unbeaten on grass as he became the first British man in 77 years to win the singles title at Wimbledon. It was clear, though, that the problem had not gone away, and he was unable to find his best form as his US Open title defence ended in a meek quarter-final defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka. Soon afterwards it was announced that Murray would undergo a minor back procedure in attempt to clear up the injury for the 2014 season. It is understood Murray&apos;s recovery is on schedule and he saw his surgeon on Monday for the first time since the operation. Provided he continues to make good progress, he is expected to travel to Miami for his winter training block in the middle of November, around a week earlier than usual. Murray&apos;s withdrawal is clearly a blow to the World Tour Finals, which has been a huge success since moving to London from Shanghai in 2009. The tournament director, Andre Silva, said: &quot;It&apos;s unfortunate that Andy will be unable to play in this year&apos;s tournament. &quot;He&apos;s had a historic year on the tour and of course he&apos;ll be missed.

This week, Too Much Johnson (1938), a forerunner to Citizen Kane, was screened where the director&apos;s &quot;lost&quot; silent film was found \u2013 in the Italian town of Pordenone. It coincided with the opening night of the London film festival, where the sparkling new restoration of The Lady from Shanghai (1947) will be unveiled. Welles screened The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) for his cast and crew prior to shooting The Lady from Shanghai. The madness pervading this expressionist silent classic is reflected in his delirious film noir, which one critic dubbed &quot;the weirdest great movie ever made&quot;. The Lady from Shanghai is as fascinating for what happened during its making as for what appeared on screen. The then president of Columbia Pictures, Harry Cohn, saved a financially troubled Welles from bankruptcy by paying him handsomely to be screenwriter, producer and director for the film. Cohn also insisted that Welles&apos;s estranged wife, Rita Hayworth, play the scheming femme fatale of the title. An added emotional resonance comes from the knowledge that the director and Hayworth \u2013 who reputedly said the only happiness she had known was with Welles \u2013 briefly lived together again during filming. Welles proceeded to shock the studio executives. With the approval of Hayworth, who wanted to break from the character she had become so identified with thanks to the huge hit Gilda (1946), he had his wife&apos;s locks shorn and her trademark red hair dyed blonde. The Lady of Shanghai&apos;s story concerns a sailor named Michael O&apos;Hara (Welles), an Irish adventurer and would-be novelist, and the murder plot he is inveigled into after falling in love with Elsa Bannister (Hayworth), the beautiful wife of his barrister employer. O&apos;Hara finds himself on the employer&apos;s yacht, much against his better judgment. Columbia sent a huge retinue by 1940s standards \u2013 40 technicians with more than six tons of equipment \u2013 to accompany Welles and co through the Mexican jungle to Acapulco. Key scenes were filmed aboard Errol Flynn&apos;s yacht in the adjoining bay. It was a fraught shoot, with what Welles&apos;s biographer Simon Callow described as &quot;the drunken, lascivious, racist [and] potentially violent&quot; yacht owner at the helm. Illness seriously disrupted filming, dysentery was rampant, Welles had histamine poisoning and Hayworth collapsed on set after the entourage moved to San Francisco, where a technicians&apos; strike caused further delays. Cohn even bugged his director&apos;s office at Columbia (when Welles became aware of what was happening he signed off each day with a greeting to Cohn). It soon became clear Welles wasn&apos;t going to be allowed to make the film in the way he desired. Although Welles would subsequently bemoan the fact that &quot;friends avoided me&quot; when the subject of the film came up, and Cohn and his cohorts were mystified by the fruits of the director&apos;s groundbreaking choice to shoot on location for an action movie, some of the bravura set pieces in The Lady from Shanghai \u2013 most famously, the hall of mirrors at the end \u2013 are a match for any in his body of work. Welles scholars estimate that 55 minutes, including a tour de force tracking shot when the lovers first meet in Central Park and the ending in the Crazy House, were excised from the first cut. But the surviving film still exhibits his trademark cinematic flourishes, most memorably in what survived from the Crazy House footage, but also in the brooding love scene in the aquarium and the picnic on the beach (during which Welles&apos; character makes his celebrated &quot;sharks speech&quot;).            Reading on mobile? Click here to view The Lady from Shanghai trailer Cohn famously remarked after an initial viewing that he would pay anyone in the room a thousand dollars if they could explain the labyrinthine story. Still, while the changes he ordered sadly robbed us of Welles&apos;s complete vision, some of the tinkering added to the heightened, bizarre quality its director was aiming for. Time and again \u2013 as in the ludicrously comic trial scene during which Everett Sloane (Arthur Bannister) as the barrister ends up cross-examining himself \u2013 the isolated pinup-style shots of Welles and Hayworth Cohn insisted on disorientate the viewer, denying the audience the normal grasp on the location of characters expected in a traditional Hollywood picture. There&apos;s a strikingly similar effect in the scene of Hayworth singing on the yacht Cohn told Welles to add. Welles&apos;s directorial grandstanding and the swirling confusion he wanted the audience to experience was his attempt to portray a febrile, chaotic world with, at its centre, a hero sleepwalking through the adaptation of a book entitled If I Wake Before I Die. The director&apos;s performance as O&apos;Hara \u2013 complete with cod Irish accent \u2013 overdoes the somnambulism, but Welles was admirably helped by Broadway actor Glenn Anders, who the director promised he would help win an Oscar for the role of Bannister&apos;s associate George Grisby. (He didn&apos;t.) Anders responded with a performance that captured the essence of the film, leering and smirking in equal measure while delivering his outrageous dialogue with demonic glee. The director could not have been happier. At the same time, he extracted revenge via the actor&apos;s thinly disguised portrait of Nelson Rockefeller, who crossed Welles in his days working at RKO Pictures. Grover Crisp, the executive vice-president of film restoration at Sony, the rerelease is the result of more than two decades of work. The camera negative for The Lady from Shanghai was in such a poor state that it was only thanks to recent developments in digital technology that they could successfully restore it. &quot;Although we do have the original camera negative for the film, it has just about everything wrong with it,&quot; said Crisp. &quot;Doing the work digitally means we have not had to compromise by using the substandard secondary film elements. We will be showing the restoration from a 4K digital cinema package, though we are planning to record out to a new negative for preservation purposes and a few prints. The film will also finally be released on Blu-ray shortly.&quot; Columbia released The Lady from Shanghai in the US without fanfare a year after Welles delivered his cut. However, the experience he gained filming the planned audacious opening for the movie \u2013 now sadly lost forever \u2013 was not completely wasted. When Welles returned to work for a major American studio 11 years later, he created arguably the most famous opening shot in cinema history: the curtain-raiser on his 1958 genuine noir masterpiece, Touch of Evil. \u2022\u00a0LFF: review of Stranger by the Lake\u2022\u00a0Video: why you should go to the LFF\u2022\u00a0The LFF&apos;s big squeeze", "tags": ["The Lady from Shanghai", "Orson Welles", "London Film festival 2013", "London film festival", "Film", "Festivals", "Culture", "London", "UK news", "Working Title"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-10T11:37:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/whistles-fashion-chain-menswear", "sentences": ["After a successful tie-up with department store Lane Crawford in Hong Kong, the brand will now move into mainland China with concessions in Beijing and Shanghai planned this autumn."], "title": "Whistles' test as fashion chain eyes menswear", "article": "Fashion chain Whistles is to move into menswear next year after swinging into the black for the first time since a buy-out led by former Topshop boss Jane Shepherdson in 2008.

Reducing climate change, preventing pandemics, and developing new energy sources are all challenges that require global solutions. Moreover, the science that will be the foundation of any technological fixes is increasingly collaborative, spanning different disciplines, institutions, and geographical locations. At the same time, science and technology are an essential component of national economic competitiveness and military power.  As a result, China and the US are collaborators as well as competitors for talent, new ideas, market share and prestige. Managing this paradox requires the US to maintain scientific strength at home and deepen ties to emerging science powers, while simultaneously pressuring China on its mercantilist technology policies and cyber espionage. The US is still the world leader in science and technology, but as a new Nesta report and others have noted, Chinese capabilities are developing rapidly. China is on track to pass the US in terms of spending on research and development (R&amp;D) in 10 years, and the share of scientific papers published by Chinese scientists in journals included in the prestigious Science Citation Index rose to 9.5% in 2011. China now boasts of a manned space programme and the world&apos;s fastest supercomputer, the Tian-he 2.  The Boston Consulting Group has named e-commerce firms Alibaba and Xiaomi Technology, a maker of mobile phone technology, as among the most innovative up-and-coming companies. The widely held view that Beijing is tilting the playing field to the advantage of Chinese companies has greatly compounded the unease in the US about China&apos;s rapid rise as a science power. Chinese policymakers are unhappy with the country being factory to the world and want to move from &quot;Made in China&quot; to &quot;Innovated in China.&quot;  Over the past five years, China has adopted a range of policies designed to create &quot;indigenous innovation&quot; and reduce dependence on the west for advanced technologies and on the US in particular. These policies include government procurement, competing technology standards, and requiring technology transfer from multinational corporations in return for market access. In a 2013 survey of American businesses operating in China, conducted by AmCham China, 37% of the respondents believed de facto requirements for technology transfer were increasing, up from 27% in 2012. In addition, China&apos;s failure to protect intellectual property rights leads to massive theft and piracy, and in turn improves the short-term competitiveness of Chinese firms. Add cyber and industrial espionage to the picture and Chinese ambitions in science and technology become even more menacing. Since Google announced that it was attacked by China-based hackers in January 2010, there has been a steady stream of revelations of other attacks on US technology companies, defence contractors, financial institutions, law firms, media companies, think tanks and universities.  In just one of the most recent cases of industrial spying, US prosecutors charged three Chinese scientists at New York University School of Medicine with illegally sharing research findings with a Shenzhen institute and a Shanghai medical technology company.  Speaking of the efforts to collect technology, William C Hannas, James Mulvenon and Anna B Puglisi, the authors of China&apos;s Industrial Espionage, claim China &quot;is in a different league altogether, exceeding the international norm not just in scale, the number and variety of transfer venues, the moral agnosticism of its practitioners, and the degree of government support.&quot; The US must press Beijing, but it also needs to get its own house in order. As a result of sequestration \u2013 the automatic cuts put in place by the 2011 Budget Control Act \u2013 federal funding for R&amp;D dropped to 0.8% of GDP, the lowest level in 40 years. The government&apos;s role in funding basic research has become even more important as business has shifted away from funding &quot;blue sky&quot; projects with uncertain immediate commercial use but with the promise of big breakthroughs. Innovation has traditionally been a bipartisan issue, but the battle between the White House and House Republicans over government closure and the fiscal crisis gives little confidence that R&amp;D investment will be increasing anytime soon. The US must continue to press China on indigenous innovation and other predatory policies. Raising it to the top of the agenda at bilateral summits is important, for it signals focus and attention. Multilateral pressure is especially important, and the US should work closely with the UK as well as Japan and the European Union. Beijing has in the past been willing to step back when several governments \u2013 and governments and the private sector \u2013 speak with one voice. A similar united front should be built for cyber espionage, though this will be much more difficult in the wake of Edward Snowden&apos;s revelations that the National Security Agency hacked into Chinese networks.  The US must not let legitimate concerns about Chinese policies and practices blind it to the opportunities present in the rise of the new science powers \u2013 China, and also India and Brazil. For the last 50 years, Washington has assumed the scientific dominance of the US. This assumption is now in question as scientific capabilities become more widely distributed. American society, with its vibrant technology sector, dynamic research universities, and large population of immigrant scientists and entrepreneurs, is well positioned to tap into these new sources of discovery.

In a sign of Downing Street&apos;s determination to reset relations with Beijing, which unofficially downgraded Britain&apos;s status after David Cameron met the Dalai Lama last year, the chancellor told an audience in the Chinese capital that no country in the west is more keen to attract Chinese investment than Britain. Osborne, who began a five-day trade mission to China at the weekend, told students at Beijing University: &quot;I don&apos;t want us to try to resist your economic progress, I want Britain to share in it. &quot;And I want, this week, us all to take the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China. Because more jobs and investment in China mean more jobs and investment in Britain. And that equals better lives for all.&quot; As a first step the chancellor announced Britain will make it easier for Chinese business leaders to visit the UK by introducing a 24-hour &quot;super priority&quot; visa service. In the biggest step, a separate pilot scheme will allow selected Chinese travel agents to apply for UK visas simply by submitting the application form used for the EU Schengen visa. The scheme is aimed specifically at the high-end tourism market, after figures showed that wealthy Chinese tourists are not bothering to apply for a UK visa after applying for a Schengen visa, which allows them to visit 22 out of the 28 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Ministers were understood to be alarmed when one study found that Chinese tourists were buying vastly higher numbers of expensive designer handbags in Paris than in London. The chancellor said: &quot;These changes will streamline and simplify the visa application process for Chinese visitors, while ensuring the system is strong and secure. This is good news for British business and tourism.&quot; The Foreign Office has no difficulty with the relaxed visa system, which will be administered through its embassy in Beijing and consulates in Shanghai and other high-growth cities. But concerns have been voiced to the chancellor and the prime minister from within the Foreign Office that Britain needs to tread with care in the light of China&apos;s human rights record and its aggressive cyber-attacks. Cameron is understood to have heard the Foreign Office&apos;s concerns with sympathy. But he is determined to open a new chapter in Britain&apos;s relations with China after declaring that the &quot;Bric&quot; countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 would be a priority. He has led two trade missions to India but has visited China only once as prime minister, three years ago. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, who has recently returned from Beijing, spoke of a &quot;massive Chinese investment&quot; worth tens of billions of pounds in nuclear power and other sources of energy in Britain. Davey told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 that there would also be major energy investments from Japan and South Korea. The China General Nuclear Power Group has been in talks with EDF Energy about taking a stake of up to 49% in the deal to build a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point. Osborne&apos;s trip \u2013 in which he is being accompanied in part by the London mayor, Boris Johnson, and four other government ministers \u2013 is designed to pave the way for a long-awaited trade mission to China by the prime minister. Cameron was forced to abandon a visit to China earlier this year when Beijing punished him for meeting the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, at St Paul&apos;s Cathedral in May 2012 with Nick Clegg. The prime minister abandoned tentative plans for a trip to China in April after Beijing indicated that he was unlikely to be granted meetings with senior figures. The UK government said no plans had been finalised and the new Chinese leadership, which only took over in March, needed time to bed down. The Osborne and Cameron trips, which have been pencilled in for the autumn for some months, have been the subject of intense negotiations in Whitehall. The chancellor is said by some ministerial sources to be adopting a gung-ho approach and is keen to explore every opportunity to boost trade links with China. &quot;With George it all comes to pounds, shillings and pence at the end of the day,&quot; said one ministerial source. Britain&apos;s nervousness about the Dalai Lama was highlighted when Johnson declined on five occasions on Sky News to say whether he would like to meet Tibet&apos;s spiritual leader. On the fifth occasion an exasperated mayor told Dermot Murnaghan: &quot;This is the fifth time, I&apos;m coming up for air again, Dermot, I&apos;m just repeating that it&apos;s not my job as mayor to insert myself into controversial areas of international dispute. My job is to promote the interests of the city.&quot; In his speech Osborne said: &quot;There are some in the west who see China growing and they are nervous. They think of the world as a cake \u2013 and the bigger the slice that China takes, the smaller the slice that they will get. I totally and utterly reject that pessimistic view. If we make the whole cake bigger, then all our peoples will benefit. That should be the basis of our relationship with China.&quot; In addition to Beijing Osborne will visit Shenzen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong.", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "George Osborne", "Politics", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Conservatives", "Liberal-Conservative coalition"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-13T03:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/14/boris-johnson-charm-offensive-china", "sentences": ["Boris Johnson has launched a pro-China charm offensive during a week-long trade mission to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, upstaging the chancellor, George Osborne, during a joint speech at one of the country&apos;s most prestigious universities and blasting through public appearances with a standup comic&apos;s delivery.", "He is scheduled to see the Forbidden City and ride the Beijing tube before departing for Shanghai on Wednesday."], "title": "Boris Johnson launches charm offensive in China", "article": "Boris Johnson has launched a pro-China charm offensive during a week-long trade mission to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, upstaging the chancellor, George Osborne, during a joint speech at one of the country&apos;s most prestigious universities and blasting through public appearances with a standup comic&apos;s delivery. Johnson marked a colourful contrast to Osborne while speaking to Peking University students on Monday morning, referencing James Bond and Harry Potter during a short speech about bolstering China-UK ties. He proffered Harry Potter as proof of &quot;cultural interpenetration&quot; between China and the UK. &quot;Who, according to JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter novels, was Harry Potter&apos;s first girlfriend? Who is the first person he kisses?

Saves time, I imagine.&quot; Johnson and Osborne arrived in China this weekend in an effort to improve China-UK relations, which took a hit last year after David Cameron infuriated Beijing by meeting the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. Johnson has refused to comment on the issue since he arrived in the Chinese capital on Sunday. Johnson has emerged as an unabashed champion of Chinese investment in London \u2013 &quot;it enables us to get on with building homes, building projects that would otherwise simply not happen,&quot; he said during his Monday morning speech. Chinese firms are currently underwriting a bevy of London developments including a \u00a3500m replica of the Crystal Palace, a \u00a3700m luxury hotel in Nine Elms, and a \u00a31bn Chinese business park in Royal Albert Dock, which Johnson has called &quot;a beacon for eastern investors looking west&quot;. Despite the mayor&apos;s lack of name recognition in China, his publicity events in Beijing have drawn capacity crowds of bemused onlookers. On Sunday he spoke briefly at a stylish art gallery, promoted British brands at a shopping mall, and posed for photos with Peking Opera stars; on Monday afternoon he bought graphic T-shirts on a traditional shopping street. He is scheduled to see the Forbidden City and ride the Beijing tube before departing for Shanghai on Wednesday. Speaking briefly at Beijing&apos;s chic 798 art district on Sunday, Johnson said more Chinese students studied abroad in London than in any other city. &quot;Now can I ask you a question,&quot; he said. &quot;Why is it that we&apos;re lucky to have so many Chinese students? Is it because of the weather? Is it because we have so many French restaurants? Is it because we have so many communist bicycles?&quot; The crowd laughed. &quot;I like him \u2013 he&apos;s trying to be a funny guy, so everybody will have good feelings for him,&quot; said Maggie Wang, a young attorney in the audience.

Osborne told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme from Beijing: &quot;There is a bit of a British attitude which treats China as a sort of sweat shop on the Pearl river. One of the things I am trying to do this week in China is to change British attitudes to China.

As George Osborne and Boris Johnson schlep from Shanghai to Shenzhen, they&apos;ll give the usual sales spiel about trade and investment and the global race. What they won&apos;t talk much about is Zhang Lintong. Yet the 16-year-old&apos;s story tells you more about the human collateral in the relationship between China and the west than any number of ministerial platitudes. In June 2011, Zhang and his teenage classmates were taken out of their family homes and dispatched to a factory making electronic gadgets. The pupils were away for a six-month internship at a giant Foxconn plant in the southern city of Shenzhen, a 20-hour train ride from their home in central China. He had no say in the matter, he told researchers. &quot;Unless we could present a medical report certified by the city hospital that we were very ill, we had to go immediately.&quot; As a first-year student at a secondary vocational school, it was illegal for Zhang (not his real name) to be sent on any kind of internship. And under Chinese law work-placements have to be directly related to a pupil&apos;s studies. Zhang was an arts major and a fan of the work of Russian realist painters. He was to spend half a year turning out iPhones and other consumer electronics. The only child of a peasant family in the Chinese countryside, Zhang&apos;s first experience of pitching up at a mega-factory was to be split up from his equally bewildered classmates. They were forced to sleep in different factory dormitories, among adult strangers. Given the same uniforms as the regular workers, the interns&apos; training was rudimentary. And then there was the work: Zhang performed one or two small tasks over and over again while standing for hours on end in a huge line turning out Apple products. &quot;It&apos;s tiring and boring,&quot; he told researchers outside work. &quot;I very much want to quit but I can&apos;t.&quot; Incredible as it sounds, Zhang&apos;s story is actually typical. As the number one supplier to Apple and manufacturer for a host of other consumer-electronics firms, Foxconn is one of the largest employers in China \u2013 and among the biggest users of student labour. In October 2010, the company estimated that, at times, up to 15% \u2013 or 150,000 \u2013 of its million-strong workforce were students. More than 28,000 were estimated to be interning for Apple alone. Last year, academics reported that 70% of the staff at a Honda gearbox factory were from secondary schools Nor is such exploitation merely the stuff of recent history: just last week, Foxconn admitted that it had broken the law by making schoolchildren work overtime and night shifts. More than a thousand of them had reportedly been building the soon-to-be released PlayStation 4 games consoles. Zhang&apos;s interview was one of 63 with student interns collected over two years in a forthcoming book by Jenny Chan, Pun Ngai and Mark Selden. The children&apos;s stories make upsetting reading. A 16-year-old girl suffers menstrual disorders in the middle of her internship. The pains continue for months, and she thinks they&apos;re caused by the night shifts and the stress of the factory: &quot;We don&apos;t have breaks whenever we&apos;re behind on the production targets.&quot; The stranded girl is understandably reluctant to discuss the issue with her male line manager, yet her parents are so far away they can only offer suggestions over the phone. Such tales aren&apos;t just a series of regrettable one-offs. Zhang and his classmates and the hundreds of thousands of teenagers like them are at the heart of one of the most powerful economic relationships at work today. They are part of a trading relationship in which Chinese children are forced into a manufacturing machine, with the connivance of both major employers and local government, to produce shiny things to be sold by billion-dollar multinationals to western consumers. What do I mean by the connivance of government? The summer before Zhang was packed off to a Foxconn plant, a city in his home province of Henan ordered all its vocational schools to send their students to a Foxconn factory in the same city of Shenzhen. Those who had placements elsewhere were to break them off and rush south. Chan and her colleagues believe this was to have a ready-trained workforce for the imminent opening of an iPhone plant in Henan. Far from being kept secret, the directive was press released and the provincial governor oversaw its implementation. Official recruitment targets were issued and the local government was offered a \u00a31.6m subsidy to get Foxconn the workers it needed. And teachers went with their classes, paid by Foxconn to make sure their children worked hard and don&apos;t leave. In one factory, the students complained about stomach aches, about choking \u2013 and they&apos;d ask about the safety of their workplace. How did their teacher respond? As he later told the researchers, he invoked the nuclear disaster at Fukushima: &quot;Take a moment to think about the selflessness of the scientists and the medical teams [at Fukushima] when Japan reported the tragic radiation leak. None of the Japanese withdrew from rescue work. So everyone of us should take responsibility for the good of humanity.&quot; Through this system western consumers get amazing new gadgets year after year. Apple will tell you that the inhumane conditions at its Chinese supplier factories are now safely in the past, even though it admits that some of the internships are still &quot;poorly run&quot;. It requires a convenient blindness to believe that. A report by Apple&apos;s auditors in May 2013 &quot;found no interns has been engaged at Chengdu [a city in mid-western China] since September 2011&quot;. Yet an HR official for Foxconn told Chan in September 2011 that more than 7,000 student interns were working in the Chengdu factory \u2013 over 10% of the entire staff.", "tags": ["Asia Pacific", "China", "Child labour", "World news", "Law", "Apple", "Computing", "Technology", "Foxconn", "iPhone", "PlayStation"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-14T21:26:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/15/guardian-weekly-sport-diary-jacob-steinberg", "sentences": ["Djokovic&apos;s Chinese thriller The only person who enjoys visiting south-east Asia more than gap-year students is Novak Djokovic, who followed winning the China Open last week with retaining his Shanghai Masters title.", "&quot;It was a great experience again in Shanghai with a thrilling performance from both my opponent and myself,&quot; said Djokovic, so thrilled that he found himself simultaneously ruffling Del Potro&apos;s hair and patting himself on the back."], "title": "India holds its breath as Sachin Tendulkar readies to rest his bat", "article": "India ground to a halt last week as Sachin Tendulkar announced that he is to retire from Test cricket after playing his 200th Test against West Indies next month.

Tony feels insufficiently reverential. What do people call you?  Tony. How was China? (1) Oh, I loved it. It was so different, so educational. In Singapore, for instance, as the plane lands they say: &quot;If you&apos;re coming into this country with any drugs, the penalty is death.&quot; That&apos;s a pretty stern warning. Well, I think it [legalising of drugs] should be done everywhere. It eliminates the underworld. If they had been legal in the 70s, would that have affected your experiences with drugs? (2) As a young boy I did a lot of foolish things. I made a lot of mistakes. And you live and learn. I&apos;m very content now. I&apos;m just being a normal human being. It&apos;s been 50 years since you won your first Grammy, for I Left My Heart in San Francisco. Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Charles were there at the ceremony \u2026 That was one of the first times the Grammys were on \u2013 since then I&apos;ve received 17 Grammys. I love it because it&apos;s the only time the music world has a convention, and you meet everyone that you know and love. You must have mixed with them all. I lived for 15 years in Los Angeles and I still can&apos;t believe that the handsomest man in the world, Cary Grant, and the greatest performer in the world, Fred Astaire, and Johnny Carson, one after another \u2013 they were all in my home at different times. I celebrated my 50th birthday with them. Unforgettable. Did any of them do anything in your home that you&apos;ve had to keep secret? No. But once Dean Martin was in his home, having this mad party, and he was trying to study his lines for a television show so he called up the police and said: &quot;I&apos;m Dean Martin&apos;s neighbour and there&apos;s too much noise coming from his house. Have the police come and slow down the party.&quot; And the police came and broke the party up and he got rid of everybody in the house. Someone once wrote: &quot;Sinatra was hip, but Tony was cool.&quot; I never heard that. I thought he was pretty cool. He was 10 years older than I was and he was my idol, and when he announced that I was his favourite singer, it made all of his fans come and check me out. I&apos;ve been sold out ever since. Were you nervous when you first met him? Yeah. I respected him so much. I respected Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. Those were my heroes, and they were 10 years older than I was. To this day, I can&apos;t believe I got to meet Ella personally. Nat Cole was a great friend, and Sinatra endorsed me throughout his whole life. In terms of the development of 20th-century music: Sinatra or Presley? You can&apos;t compare them. Presley is country music, white music. Jazz is black music \u2013 it was invented by the blacks in New Orleans. And I&apos;m really a jazz singer. I was impressed with Elvis \u2013 he was the handsomest guy I ever met in my life, and a very nice person, too. But the music doesn&apos;t impress me. How does Amy Winehouse (3) compare to the Ellas and Lena Hornes and Billie Holidays? You can&apos;t compare, but she was an authentic jazz singer, which is tremendous because jazz has been underrated. There&apos;s still so much bigotry. You were once invited to go and sing in Harlem with Billie Holiday, but didn&apos;t go ...  It was one night when she asked me to come up and sing with her and I was with a group of people at a table, and they looked at me as if to say: &quot;Don&apos;t go up to Harlem, it&apos;s not safe there.&quot; And it was very bigoted. I regret it to this day that I didn&apos;t go. Is it true you were so moved by Charlie Parker the first time you saw him play live, you threw up? Yeah, I regurgitated. It was so phenomenal, so emphatic \u2026 It was more music than I ever heard anyone play at one time. I just couldn&apos;t believe how great it was. Do you think subsequent generations might have had that response to Jimi Hendrix or Kurt Cobain? It&apos;s a different thing. You have to understand, Charlie Parker, that music lasts for ever. It&apos;s like Louis Armstrong \u2013 some of the records he made with different orchestras, the orchestras sound old-fashioned but Louis sounds like today, right now. Classical trumpet players in symphonic orchestras would listen to him and say, &quot;How did he do that?&quot; and try to learn how to play like him. Who else has had that effect? As an entertainer, I think Jimmy Durante  (4). He was better than anybody. He tried to make people feel good. I like that. I could have retired 20 years ago, but I didn&apos;t because I like to make people feel good. For a fun night out, Judy Garland or Lady Gaga? Both of them are good. Lady Gaga is the Picasso of the entertainment world. She&apos;s very intelligent. You&apos;re known as a natty dresser. But do you ever pop out in jeans and an old cardie? I was honoured last year as the Best Dressed Man in Britain (5). It was quite a compliment. I have relaxed clothes, but people don&apos;t see me in them. I&apos;m a painter, I have a studio and it can be messy so I wear a smock. If you went out for a pint of milk in that smock probably nobody would recognise you. I wouldn&apos;t do that. People who do that are ridiculous. My mum taught me as a child, even though we were very poor, she said: &quot;Put on a nice clean white shirt and nice black pants and you&apos;ll be OK.&quot; Which would be more painful to give up: singing or painting? Both of them. If something happened with me physically, I would still love to spend the rest of my life painting. I&apos;ve never worked a day in my life. People don&apos;t believe that, but it&apos;s true. I love what I&apos;m doing because I&apos;m doing the two things I love. I never felt in my whole life like, &quot;I don&apos;t feel like doing that today&quot;. I wake up and I can&apos;t wait to paint and I can&apos;t wait to learn something about music. How many presidents have you met? I think about 13. No, 10. I didn&apos;t sing for Nixon, I was in Europe at the time and had to pass on the invitation. Who was the most impressive? President Clinton. You could walk up to him with your hands in your pocket and say,:&quot;Hi, Bill.&quot; You don&apos;t say &quot;Mr President&quot;, you don&apos;t bow. He&apos;s a regular person. You once described your experience in the second world war as &quot;a front seat in hell&quot;. It&apos;s legalised murder. I&apos;m anti-war. Life is more beautiful than that. Guys who create wars should get their hands slapped. Did you have a difficult childhood? Yeah, we grew up during the Depression. My mother worked a penny a dress to put food on the table for her three children because my father died when I was very young. It was very tough. How do you keep up with your wife, by the way? I&apos;ve read that she&apos;s variously 33 and 40 years younger than you \u2026 (6) We get along beautifully. We started schools all over America, we now have 17 where we support the performing arts (7). She&apos;s a magnificent person and I love everything about her. She must keep you young. She can&apos;t!

Zhan Haite doesn&apos;t fit the mould. Last winter, Zhan, an ambitious 15-year-old middle-school student in Shanghai, became an unlikely crusader against the country&apos;s draconian residence registration system, the hukou, a bureaucratic knot tying hundreds of millions of migrant workers to their rural hometowns. Although Zhan attended primary and middle school in Shanghai \u2013 she moved there with her family in 2002 \u2013 she lacked a local hukou, precluding her from taking the city&apos;s high school entrance examination. Zhan was told she had two options: attend a vocational school, or return to her ancestral village, where opportunities are scarce. Instead, Zhan decided to speak out. She organised a protest in front of Shanghai&apos;s education bureau, and posted a flurry of dissenting messages online. At first, the backlash was severe. Her family was briefly evicted. Local authorities threw her father in jail. Yet Zhan&apos;s message was well-timed \u2013 hukou reform had recently risen to the top of the national agenda \u2013 and state-run media outlets began to take notice. Zhan was allowed to pen an op-ed in the China Daily newspaper, which ran under the headline Teen Girl Makes Case for Change. In an interview in December, Zhan listed her heroes as Martin Luther King, Aung San Suu Kyi and Hu Shi, a prominent Chinese essayist who died in 1962. &quot;Hu Shi once said that fighting for your rights is fighting for the nation&apos;s rights, and fighting for your freedom is fighting for the nation&apos;s freedom,&quot; she said. &quot;A free and democratic country cannot be made up of slaves.&quot; RaSia Khepra      RaSia Kephra, who campaigns against gun violence in Chicago. Photograph: YouTube    College freshman RaSia Khepra had always wanted to address the rampant violence plaguing his home city of Chicago \u2013 where more than 500 people were killed by guns in 2012 \u2013 but the death of his close friend is what motivated him to act. Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was killed at random by a gunman on Chicago&apos;s South Side, a week after she performed at Barack Obama&apos;s inauguration celebration in January. Khepra was familiar with the sounds of gunfire in his neighbourhood and knew several people who had been shot, but Pendleton&apos;s death inspired him to act. &quot;I don&apos;t think having somebody that close to you can ever leave your mind if they&apos;ve been taken in such a way,&quot; Khepra told the Huffington Post. &quot;I do, definitely, think about her every day because I&apos;m used to seeing her every day.&quot; Khepra and other Chicago teenagers created the anti-violence awareness campaign Project Orange Tree, which helps co-ordinate community activities to stimulate a conversation about the causes of gun violence and is supported by the rapper Lupe Fiasco. Khepra said gun violence was often written off as a gang problem, but the issue also affected members of the community not affiliated with gangs. &quot;I don&apos;t think a lot of the violence that&apos;s being labelled gang-related violence is as prevalent as it&apos;s being hyped up to be,&quot; he said. Kelvin Doe     Kelvin Doe, from Sierra Leone, has lectured to engineering students at Harvard. Photograph: YouTube    Kelvin Doe was born to a single mother when Sierra Leone was being torn apart by civil war. &quot;Her resilience and self-belief made it possible for me to be alive today,&quot; he once said. Kelvin was six when the diamond-funded conflict, notorious for the systematic amputation of victims&apos; limbs, finally drew to a close. Turning 17 this month, he is a personification of how the west African country is trying to rebuild and look forward. A short film about him has been viewed more than 5m times on YouTube. Doe is a self-taught engineer of astonishing precocity. At the age of 11, he rummaged in dustbins for scrap electronics parts that could fix local problems. At 13 he made his own battery by throwing together acid, soda and metal in a tin cup, waiting for the mixture to dry and wrapping tape around it. This proved a big financial saving on batteries. Frustrated by lack of a reliable electricity supply in his neighbourhood, Doe built a generator using parts that were home made or rescued from the rubbish. The generator also powered a community radio station that he built from recycled materials. He plays music under the name DJ Focus and employs his friends as journalists and station managers. &quot;They call me DJ Focus because I believe if you focus, you can do an invention perfectly,&quot; Doe said in the video on the Thnkr YouTube channel that proved a worldwide hit. He had never been more than 10 miles from his home in Freetown until he won a national schools innovation competition and was picked last year for a trip to America, where he spoke at the Meet the Young Makers panel at the World Maker Faire in New York. Doe became the youngest ever &quot;visiting practitioner&quot; with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) International Development Initiative. He presented his inventions to MIT students, took part in research and lectured to engineering students at Harvard College. He has been featured on CNN and NBC News and was a speaker at TEDxTeen. His mentor David Sengeh, a PhD student at the MIT media lab, said: &quot;The inspirational effects of the original Thinkr YouTube video have been remarkable. It has had a tremendous impact on Kelvin&apos;s life, on my life and on millions of people all over the world everywhere. In Sierra Leone, other young people suddenly feel they can be like Kelvin.&quot; Rene Silva     Rene Silva set up his first newspaper at 11 and live-tweeted a police raid on his favela. Photograph: Vimeo    While most Brazilian teenagers are interested in computer games, homework, football or baile funk, Rene Silva has dedicated himself to fighting negative stereotypes about his favela community. He set up his first newspaper at the age of 11, live-tweeted a police raid on his neighbourhood at 17 and has just completed his first book at the age of 19. The shanty towns of Rio de Janeiro were long seen as violent no-go zones run by armed drug gangs, But Silva has used social media to show a more sympathetic, complex and hopeful side. &quot;The important thing about being young and doing what I do in the favelas is to create new points of reference,&quot; he said. &quot;In the past, it was drug trafficking. Today, there is more recognition of the people who are trying to do good and change the reality of the place where they live.&quot; Conscious of the shortcoming of the mainstream media, one of his teachers asked him to set up a community newspaper in 2005. At first, his family were doubtful about what he could achieve. His mother would scold him for getting home late from school because he had spent so long reporting and writing for Voz das Comunidades (Voice of the Community). But he became the focus of every media organisation in the country five years later when he live-tweeted a huge military and police operation to &quot;pacify&quot; the Alem\u00e3o favela where he lived. Silva&apos;s microblog corrected mistakes made by TV reporters and raised warnings about a young boy who was caught in the crossfire between the police and gangsters. HIs followers jumped from a few hundred to tens of thousands and his newspaper - now largely online - secured sponsorship. Still not 20, Silva published a book this August, A Voz do Alem\u00e3o, about the residents of his favela, which he hopes will further change perceptions of Rio&apos;s shantytown communities and expose the problems they continue to face after pacification.

Photograph: Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images for Smithsonian Mag    Jack Andraka, 16, is the most recent grand prize winner of the Intel international science and engineering fair \u2013 where he unveiled an inexpensive way to detect pancreatic cancer. At the age of 14 the Maryland boy investigated the disease after it had killed a close family friend, and found that it spreads rapidly and is rarely detected in its early stages. It is estimated to be the 13th most common cancer in the world and the eighth most deadly. To try to fill the void of low-cost, quick, early-screening methods, Andraka emailed professors at nearby research institutions with a proposal and budget for research. Andraka said he contacted 200 researchers and one accepted the offer \u2013 Dr Anirban Maitra, professor of pathology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University. With Maitra, Andraka conducted research and devised his prize-winning, inexpensive diagnostic method that can efficiently detect a protein for the cancer with 90% accuracy. &quot;This was a big accomplishment for me. It fulfilled my biggest and wildest dreams,&quot; Andraka told the Baltimore Sun. &quot;But also, it means that I can actually get the word out about this deadly disease and this new test that I use to detect it.&quot; Zea Tongeman     Zea Tongeman designed an app with a friend that aims to get people recycling by turning the sometimes tiresome task into a game.

But when she realised, after a Little Miss Geek workshop in her school, St Saviour&apos;s and St Olave&apos;s in Elephant and Castle, that tech could be fun and a force for good, she changed her mind. With a friend, Jordan Stirbu, she designed an app called Jazzy Recycling that aims to get people recycling by turning the sometimes tiresome task into a game. &quot;As Mary Poppins says: &apos;You find the fun and it becomes a game,&apos; and that is exactly what our app does,&quot; she says. Jazzy Recycling helps users find places to recycle, tells them what they can recycle and then enables them to scan, share and get rewards for their efforts. Tapping into the teen mania for sharing even the most mundane titbits of daily life on social media, the game is then shared among friends. Now Zea has some celebrity backing. Raj Dhonota, business consultant and an angel investor, who appeared on the Apprentice, is helping the pair build the app and they hope to launch in 2014.

But the episode was soon overshadowed by the communist insurgency already raging on the mainland, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and eventually the outbreak of the second world war. The world moved on, the wreck of the Poseidon lay 30 metres beneath the sea, lost to history. Until now. A new book reveals that China secretly salvaged the submarine in 1972, perhaps to abet its then-incipient nuclear submarine programme. Steven Schwankert, an American author and diving-company owner in Beijing, spent six years obsessively piecing together the submarine&apos;s story; his book about the experience, Poseidon: China&apos;s Secret Salvage of Britain&apos;s Lost Submarine, was released this month. &quot;When you start something like this, you say I&apos;m going to start at point A and end at point B. Then suddenly you realise that point B doesn&apos;t exist, so you have to go to point C,&quot; said Schwankert. &quot;The challenge wasn&apos;t to find the submarine per se, but to prove that the story of the salvage was correct.&quot; Although Schwankert never found the exact reasons behind the salvage, he has a few guesses: perhaps fishing nets were getting caught on its periscope, or China, then deep into the Cultural Revolution, simply needed the scrap metal. Or perhaps the Chinese navy&apos;s underwater special forces salvaged the wreck as practice. &quot;In 1972, China&apos;s nuclear submarine programme was just getting started,&quot; he said. &quot;If you have that kind of a programme, one of the first things you need to know is: if we lose this thing, can we recover it?&quot; On 9 June 1931, HMS Poseidon \u2013 one of the Royal Navy&apos;s state-of-the-art submarines \u2013 was conducting routine drills near a leased British navy base off the coast of Shandong province when it collided with a Chinese cargo ship, tearing a hole in its starboard side. Although 31 of its crew members managed to scramble off before the submarine went down, 26 were trapped on board. Eight were stuck in the submarine&apos;s torpedo room, and over the next hour, they used a predecessor to modern scuba equipment to reach the surface \u2013 the first time submariners had used breathing apparatus to escape a stricken boat; until then, crew members had been taught to simply wait for help. Five of the men survived. The incident made the front page of the New York Times, inspired a feature film, and changed maritime practice \u2013 the Royal Navy began adding escape chambers to submarines and expanded its research into treatment of decompression. Schwankert first learned about the Poseidon while planning an underwater expedition to wrecks from the 1884-85 Sino-Japanese war. He was fascinated by the vague descriptions of the Poseidon and sepia photographs that he found online, and set out to learn more, believing that the wreck remained on the seabed near Weihai, a port city in Shandong province. After a year of investigating, he began to have his doubts. By combing through Chinese-language Google search results, Schwankert began to find online articles mentioning the salvage, including one on the website of the Shanghai salvage bureau. On one online forum, he found testimony from a man who allegedly saw the wreck being hauled on to the shore while swimming in the ocean. China&apos;s foreign ministry confirmed later that the submarine had been salvaged, but refused to provide any details. &quot;Some people have suggested that I go out there and look at the site anyway. I said how can you do that? How can you prove a negative?&quot; Schwankert said. &quot;Every indication is that they brought up the whole thing.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Royal Navy", "Military", "UK news", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-18T16:10:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/jeanine-miller-obituary", "sentences": ["Jeanine was born to French parents in Shanghai, where her father, Maurice Meunier, was the manager of a Franco-Chinese bank."], "title": "Jeanine Miller obituary", "article": "My friend Jeanine Miller, who has died aged 83, devoted many years of her life to the study of Sanskrit and of the Vedas \u2013 hymns of praise \u2013 in particular the Rgveda, one of the most ancient Indian scriptures and source of Hinduism, thought to have been written between 1500 and 1200BCE. She believed that the wisdom in these ancient texts, with their message of an underlying cosmic order, was of particular relevance today. Jeanine was able to convey the sheer scope and depth of some of these teachings through a brilliant synthesis of scholarship, spiritual insight and poetic vision that, combined with an understanding of myths and symbols, gave her writing a visionary dimension all of its own. She was inspired by the great orientalist and Indologist Jan Gonda, who wrote the foreword to Jeanine&apos;s first book, The Vedas: Harmony, Meditation and Fulfilment (1974). She found a kindred spirit in the Sanskrit scholar and Roman Catholic priest Raimon Panikkar, who wrote the foreword to her book The Vision of Cosmic Order in the Vedas (1985). Jeanine was born to French parents in Shanghai, where her father, Maurice Meunier, was the manager of a Franco-Chinese bank. He became a Gaullist resistance operator in the city during the second world war, smuggling out young men who wanted to join the British forces. These activities eventually forced the family to emigrate to Australia, where they changed their name to Miller. Jeanine was educated at a convent school in Sydney. After her father&apos;s death, she moved with her mother, Fernande, to London, joining her brother, the immunologist Jacques Miller, who was then doing postdoctoral research at the Chester Beatty Research Institute in South Kensington. Jeanine studied Sanskrit at Durham University, obtaining an MLitt, and worked as a researcher in the department of manuscripts at the British Library. Two Russian mystics were to have a great influence on Jeanine&apos;s life, the first being HP (Helena) Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society. Jeanine lectured extensively and taught meditation at the Theosophical Society&apos;s headquarters in London. In the 1960s Jeanine met the Russian Sufi teacher Irina Tweedie and became one of her first disciples, practising dhyana, the silent meditation of the heart, and gaining direct experience of the spiritual dimension of the ancient texts she was translating. Jeanine helped Tweedie with the editing of her journal, The Chasm of Fire. Jeanine&apos;s last book, The Blazing Dragon of Wisdom: The Esoteric Tradition as Enshrined in the Vedas and Beyond, was her magnum opus, in which her gift of combining scholarship with an encyclopedic knowledge of world myths and religions came into its own. In later life Jeanine moved to Languedoc-Roussillon with her partner Ron Wildego, an artist, and they married in 2011.", "tags": ["Hinduism", "Religion", "Books", "France", "Australia news"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-21T15:46:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/oct/22/border-crossings-international-theatre-dance", "sentences": ["When we performed Re-Orientations in Shanghai, we wondered whether we&apos;d run into the tormentors of Ai Weiwei \u2013 the show included references to the cultural revolution, the problems resulting from the single child policy, homosexuality and so on."], "title": "Arts head: Michael Walling, founder, Border Crossings", "article": "Hi Michael, can you tell me a little bit about Border Crossings and why you set it up? Border Crossings is an international theatre company based in the UK. We work in collaboration with artists from other cultures, often finding new ways of making theatre that fuses different performance styles from around the world. I founded the company after working in India. I directed The Tempest there and was fascinated by the way a play I thought I knew very well was completely altered by being refracted through another culture. And that became the aim of the company \u2013 to see ourselves that bit differently through the process of intercultural collaboration and dialogue. Dialogue is key to theatre as a form; it&apos;s about multiple viewpoints, including the viewpoint (or viewpoints) of the audience. What is it about intercultural work that you&apos;re drawn to? We live in a globalised space, in a post-colonial space, and in cyberspace, so intercultural communication is the reality of our daily lives in the 21st century. But all of these developments are also serious dangers to culture, because they are threatening to homogenise the ways we communicate and think, which of course leads to the loss of so much knowledge. It&apos;s estimated that 90% of the world&apos;s current languages will have died by 2050, and that&apos;s terrifying. So as part of the dominant culture, as native speakers of the dominant language, we have a responsibility to be open to people who think and live in other ways, and to show them that we value that. What kinds of challenges does working with different countries and cultures throw up? Language is often a big issue. We&apos;re constantly playing with ways of allowing people to speak their own languages on stage without having to surtitle everything. It&apos;s also very complex in rehearsals when not everybody is understanding everything that is said. I&apos;ve found over the years that the best translators are actually directors in their own right \u2013 people who have a sense of where an image or idea is coming from, and can translate emotion as well as sense. But I like the fact that it&apos;s complex and difficult. Far too much of what is thrown at us these days is really simple and reductive and just doesn&apos;t reflect the world as it is. With our productions I like to think you can see that it was hard work to get there, that it&apos;s been crafted and honed, that everyone has been completely engaged, and that we acknowledge difficulty and difference. In your work with Border Crossings, have you found theatre to be a universal language? Does it speak to all cultures and peoples in the same way? I don&apos;t think it&apos;s universal at all, any more than language is universal. The great joy of performance is that it happens in a specific time and place, that it is ephemeral, and that meaning is generated through the particular interaction of actors and audience. I&apos;ll give you an example. We did a play some years ago called Double Tongue, in response to the Kosovo conflict. Brian Woolland wrote it to be performed in English, Hungarian and Serbo-Croat. In England, the audience tended to identify with the English and American characters, and so the play was a very intense, very serious piece about the danger of intervention in foreign spaces. Then we took the piece to Hungary, and there were refugees from former Yugoslavia in the audience \u2013 so people were understanding all the languages, and were identifying with the characters from that part of Europe. And the play became a comedy. Even at the end, which was a bloodbath, they were laughing. It was like the horrid laughter of Jacobean tragedy \u2013 you could feel that society purging itself of the recent horror. And that&apos;s just within Europe, where there are plenty of cultural similarities. Steve Cox recently wrote that censorship is stifling Australia&apos;s artistic freedom of expression \u2013 what are your views on censorship of the arts? There&apos;s certainly a problem around the idea of something being &quot;offensive&quot; \u2013 it seems to have become synonymous with somebody, anybody, choosing to take offence, and we can&apos;t claim to be a mature society if we behave like that. But that&apos;s different from the sort of official censorship we deal with when we work in China or many African countries, where you have to submit scripts, even videos, in advance of any public performance. Sometimes, it can be quite an interesting, even a creative dialogue. When we performed Re-Orientations in Shanghai, we wondered whether we&apos;d run into the tormentors of Ai Weiwei \u2013 the show included references to the cultural revolution, the problems resulting from the single child policy, homosexuality and so on. But in fact the authorities were very happy to show these things. In a way, allowing an international production to touch on sensitive areas was seen as a way of their demonstrating positive liberal credentials. The one thing that bothered them was the positive depiction of traditional Chinese religion; the censors thought this might &quot;encourage superstition&quot;. We had to fight quite hard to keep that scene, but we managed it in the end, and I have never heard such laughter in the theatre. You&apos;re also director of Origins Festival of First Nations \u2013 can you tell me a bit about it? Origins is one of the most important things we do. I think it&apos;s really crucial that a theatre company with an intercultural remit doesn&apos;t just make its own performances, but also provides space for important work from cultures very different from our own. First Nations cultures, indigenous cultures, are particularly rich and resonant at the moment; they can teach us a huge amount about how to respect the planet, how to respect elders, how to educate rather than simply train our young people, how to place culture at the heart of political and social life, how to think for the long term, how to have a fully participatory democracy \u2013 all the things we&apos;re really bad at right now. What impact does globalisation have on the arts and what does the future hold in this respect? On one level, of course, globalisation offers great opportunities for artists like me. It&apos;s much easier to find out about what&apos;s going on culturally in other countries, and to email and Skype people \u2013 we&apos;ve even started conducting some workshops in two countries simultaneously using Skype. On the other hand, the big danger is that the arts will become bland, commercialised and anodyne. We&apos;re already seeing this with the big franchised musicals and international opera, where the same production happens in cities all over the planet, and it looks pretty much the same in all of them \u2013 as a result has next to nothing to say to any of them. Finally, what can we expect from this year&apos;s Origins Festival?  I&apos;m really excited that this year we have dance for the first time, and that we&apos;re working with The Place to present Copper Promises and Gudirr Gudirr. Indigenous cultures have always been sung and danced \u2013 and these are two pieces which take that great tradition of movement theatre and bring it right into our chaotic, globalised present, without in any way compromising on cultural integrity.

The Beijing municipal commission of education plans to reduce the English section of the all-important college admissions test, the Gaokao, from 150 points to 100 points in major cities by 2016, China&apos;s official newswire Xinhua reported. It will boost the value of the Chinese section from 150 to 180 points. Currently, the test weighs English, Chinese and maths equally. Officials have spun the proposal as both a practical decision and a matter of national pride. &quot;The change highlights the fundamental importance of mother tongue in the curriculum,&quot; a representative from the commission told Xinhua. Education authorities are also considering scrapping mandatory English lessons before the third grade. They currently begin on the first day of primary school. Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, as well as Shanghai, may remove English from the Gaokao entirely. Public consultation on the proposal began on Monday, Xinhua reported.

Downstream from the dam, the yellow water gushes down the spillway from China&apos;s third most powerful hydroelectric plant. It races on past the city of Xiangjiaba, on the border between the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, a featureless place with a maze of factories and chimneys built into the urban fabric. Its only claim to fame is the wall 200 metres high that now overshadows it. The structure, into which 14bn cubic metres of concrete have already been poured, is due to be completed next year. Fitted with an impressive boat lift, it will drive eight giant 800MW turbines, currently the largest in the world. Xiangjiaba is no match for the array of 32 turbines on the massive Three Gorges Dam, with installed capacity of 22,000MW. But it does confirm China&apos;s enthusiasm for hydroelectric facilities, including really big ones, regardless of the environmental cost \u2013 in climate disruption and landslides \u2013and the number of people displaced to make way for the work. According to official figures, the Xiangjiaba structure entailed the departure of more than 100,000 people. On 28 September a new invitation to tender was published, for 16 1,000MW turbines, though it is not known for which dam they are intended. No single structure has ever delivered so much power. Following the publication of China&apos;s 12th five-year plan (2011-15), the state council set a goal for energy policy, including ambitious hydropower targets. The challenge of boosting renewable energy to a 15% share of the country&apos;s primary energy consumption depends largely on hydropower. The prime concern is to reduce pollution from coal-fired power stations, which is poisoning the atmosphere of Chinese cities. At present coal accounts for a much larger share of the energy mix than solar, wind or even nuclear power. Just doubling hydropower (from 190,000MW to 380,000MW) would give renewables a 10% overall share. In theory, on completion of this titanic effort, just over 70% of China&apos;s total hydropower potential would be exploited, according to the International Hydropower Association&apos;s (IHA) annual report published in April. Further upstream on the Jinsha another wall is going up at Xiluodu. With 13,600MW nameplate capacity, it will be substantially larger than Xiangjiaba. &quot;Every year the Chinese increase their hydropower capacity by 15GW,&quot; says Yves Rannou, the head of the China division at Alstom, the French engineering firm, a figure the IHA confirms for 2012. This is an impressive achievement compared with new capacity being built in other parts of the world, apart from Asia: 1.9GW in North America, 1.8GW in South America, 0.5GW in Europe and 0.3GW in Africa. It should be borne in mind that France, for instance, has a total hydropower capacity of 25GW. Downstream from the Xiangjiaba dam, on its righthand side, a tunnel disappears into the rock face. It leads to a cavity like the nave of a cathedral, filled by a dull roar. Without waiting for the structure to be finished, the Jinsha is already driving four Alstom turbines and their generators. They were brought up the river on barges as far as a quay just below the dam. The four monsters, each weighing more than 2,000 tonnes, were manoeuvred into position by suitably gigantic cranes, mounted on tracks that run down to the riverside. On 17 September Alstom officially opened a new hydropower industrial site in Tianjin, north-east China. Airbus operates a large assembly unit on the same technology park. The engineering firm is keen to consolidate its position in this booming market. At the ceremony, CEO Patrick Kron predicted that between now and 2035 half of the world&apos;s new hydropower plants would be built in China, with south-east Asia accounting for 85% of the total. He added that hydropower was &quot;clean, renewable and particularly easy to store&quot;. Though hydropower represents a relatively small share of Alstom&apos;s revenue (10%), growth on this scale justifies the \u20ac100m ($130m) investment the firm has made in China, in the larger context of cutbacks. &quot;We need to streamline our operations. But we can do it, even in China, without adopting a strategy of retreat,&quot; Kron explained on the sidelines of the ceremony. The French firm is by no means the only one interested by the turbine and generator part of future hydropower plants. Its rivals Andritz and Voith, respectively from Austria and Germany, are also on the lookout for work. Voith markets integrated solutions comparable to Alstom&apos;s technology. It has a factory in Shanghai, originally built as part of a joint venture with Siemens and Shanghai Electric Corporation. Voith now owns an 80% share of the undertaking and is quick to point out that it equipped China&apos;s very first hydropower facility, at Shi Long Ba, in 1910. But foreign engineering firms have little room for manoeuvre. For example, Xiangjiaba&apos;s four other hydroelectric units have been produced in China. Two powerful firms, Harbin Electric and Dongfang Electric, which together claim a 40% share of Chinese-installed capacity (as against 20% for Alstom) have become serious competitors, after learning the trade from foreign partners. Asked to compare the strengths and weaknesses of Chinese and French suppliers, the head of the China Three Gorges Corporation, which is operating the Xiangjiaba dam, Nie Yuanlong, smiled politely before noting that Alstom&apos;s prices were &quot;slightly higher&quot;. Quality, a key selling point for both Voith and Alstom, may enable them to maintain a slight strategic lead over Harbin and Dongfang in the struggle to deliver increasingly powerful hydroelectric units. But with heavy industry in China plagued by surplus capacity, unlikely to improve if domestic growth slows, competition could well be increasingly fierce.

A Reuters reporter who visited an HTC factory at the company&apos;s former headquarters in Taoyuan, about an hour&apos;s drive from Taipei, saw loading docks shuttered and a sign on a locked lobby door that read: &quot;Lobby is temporarily closed for use. Thank you for your cooperation.&quot; HTC launched its latest version of the flagship One series handsets this year but has struggled to gain traction in a market dominated by larger rivals Apple and Samsung Electronics. The company, whose woes have been exacerbated by supply chain constraints and internal turmoil, reported its first quarterly loss in more than a decade this month, of 3.5bn Taiwanese dollars (\u00a373m) and its cash flow from operations dropped to a negative \u00a3440m as of the end of June, indicating that it was spending more than it was receiving. Despite lacklustre sales, HTC devices usually receive rave reviews, and it has in recent months expanded its range to include smaller and larger models of the One phone and hinted at further products, including a tablet and a wearable device. HTC initially denied it was shutting down any production, in Taiwan or elsewhere, and declined to comment on whether it was in discussions to outsource production. Update: in a filing to the Taiwanese stock exchange on Wednesday, the company said: &quot;HTC is not shutting down nor does it have plans to sell any of its factory\u00a0assets. HTC has a strong cash position and financial structure, and will\u00a0provide the latest financials in our upcoming earnings call to investors\u00a0and the broader community.&quot; That call will be on 5 November. The statement does not however contradict the sources&apos; suggestion that production at one of the lines has been halted. &apos;Strong balance sheet&apos; &quot;HTC is not shutting down nor has plans to sell any of its factory assets,&quot; the company said in an emailed response to queries from Reuters. &quot;HTC has a very strong balance sheet and will provide the latest financials in our upcoming earnings call to investors and the broader community.&quot; When asked about what Reuters had seen at the factory in a telephone interview, HTC chief marketing officer Ben Ho declined to give details, but said: &quot;Like any manufacturer, we do volume planning to optimize our lines, our manufacturing and production facilities. &quot;Whether we are operating those facilities depends on market demand and our own expectations. When you have less demand you work with less facilities to optimize your costs. When you have demand, or bigger growth, you definitely have to activate all these facilities.&quot; According to data from HTC and the research company IDC, HTC&apos;s quarterly phone shipments have dropped from a peak of 13.3m units in the third quarter of 2011 to around 6m units in the same period this year. Two of the four sources who spoke to Reuters said HTC had combined production from two lines at Taoyuan into one, which would reduce its potential capacity by about 1m phones per month, out of a total capacity of around 2.5m at the site and around 4.5m including operations elsewhere. Manufacturing has been halted since at least August on the line, housed in a facility called Building H, while production continued at a nearby plant known as TY5. Most of the assembly lines in HTC&apos;s Shanghai factory, which can produce 2m phones a month, were also out of production, one of the sources said, with only a small number of phones being produced for sale inside China. HTC was considering selling the out-of-use production lines in China and Taiwan, two of the sources said. &quot;HTC&apos;s cash flow is not doing well. It has to do something soon to generate cash,&quot; said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the manufacturing sale plan. Temporary handover HTC&apos; chief executive Peter Chou, the driving force behind its award-winning handsets, has temporarily handed some of his duties to the company&apos;s chairwoman in order to focus on innovation and product development, the Financial Times reported on Monday. Shares of HTC jumped following the report, on hopes that the change of duties among the top management will help it recapture the sparkle that saw it named Device Manufacturer of the Year at the World Mobile Congress in 2011, when its stock was flying high. The company&apos;s market value has roughly halved this year. HTC, which positions itself as a premium brand, will contract out some manufacturing to FIH Mobile Ltd International , a subsidiary of Taiwan&apos;s Hon Hai Precision Industry, because contract manufacturers have better component supply management and cost control. It is also in talks with Compal Communications and Wistron Corp, according to four sources. FIH and Hon Hai declined to comment. Spokesmen for Compal Communications and Wistron could not be reached for comment. HTC also declined to comment. One of the sources said HTC&apos;s top management had agreed to separate the design and manufacturing businesses, which would more closely resemble Apple&apos;s model of creating products in-house but then outsourcing to assemblers such as Hon Hai. By contrast Samsung Electronics both designs and manufacturers its smartphones. However, sources said even if HTC splits the two operations, it would likely hold onto some of its factory capacity initially as the split-up would be a slow process and HTC might explore the possibility of making phones for others. Chou aims for a doubling In a Town Hall meeting with staff on Tuesday, CEO Chou said HTC aimed to double its shares of the high-end smartphone market to 15% next year. When asked about separating out the manufacturing business, he said the company did not rule out the possibility. The comments were reported by local media and confirmed by Ho. At the end of June, HTC&apos;s cash position decreased to NT$48.1bn (\u00a31.02bn) from NT$55.5bn (\u00a31.18bn) a year earlier as cash flow turned negative. Its balance sheet also shows that bill payments increased while less money came in from customers. Receivables - the money owed to the business - increased by NT$7.9bn (\u00a3167m), but accounts payable - the money by the business to its suppliers - dropped NT$7.8bn (\u00a3165m). HTC&apos;s return on assets (ROA) - an indicator of how effectively a company uses its assets to generate earnings - is expected to turn negative this year at -0.69%, the first time since 1999, according to SmartEstimates. Its ROA last year was 8.1%. No potential bidders for the manufacturing space have surfaced so far, in part because the global smartphone and tablet PC supply chain is facing overcapacity, the sources said. As a result, HTC is also exploring other options to generate income by using its factories, sources said. Several analyst and media reports said HTC was in talks with Chinese peer Lenovo Group Ltd and US online retailer Amazon. There is also speculation that Hon Hai will use HTC&apos;s plant for its own production. Hon Hai said there was no plan to use HTC&apos;s production lines in Taoyuan now.

At least, Daan Roosegaarde says, it doesn&apos;t hurt to dream. With Beijing in mind, Roosegaarde has designed a system called Smog that can pull pollutants from the sky. Copper coils buried underground attract airborne particles by generating an electrostatic field, &quot;like a balloon that attracts your hair&quot;, he explains. The particles can then be collected and repurposed. An animated promotional video shows the smoggy sky above a park parting like the Red Sea, the blue sky visible through a perfectly round gap in the haze. &quot;We always had this notion of merging nature with technology,&quot; says Roosegaarde, who owns studios in the Netherlands and Shanghai. &quot;It&apos;s hacking the landscape, in a poetic way.&quot; Over the past week, a noxious cloud of smog has blanketed a broad swath of the the country&apos;s north-east. In the city of Harbin, levels of PM2.5 \u2013 particulate matter small enough to lodge itself deep within the lungs \u2013 soared to 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre, worse than Beijing&apos;s historic highs. Visibility dropped to 20 metres and authorities grounded flights and closed more than 2,000 schools. Air pollution has been a huge source of public outrage since last winter when Beijing was hit by a week of smog so noxious that central government had no choice but to respond. Environmental authorities, once reticent to even discuss the issue for fear that it could stoke social unrest, have begun seeking a dash of inspiration to buoy their long-haul anti-pollution measures. They have lent support to a bevy of innovative small-scale ideas. Roosegarde, already known for developing ambitious projects such as an internet-connected &quot;smart highway&quot; in the UK, conceived of the Smog system during a business trip to Beijing, as he watched the CCTV tower gradually disappear into a white-grey haze from his hotel window. The artist recently forged an agreement with Beijing&apos;s mayor to test the project in one of the city&apos;s public parks, having already run successful trials in a 25sq metre room. He says the project should be ready for launch within nine months. &quot;Right now it&apos;s just a question of getting funding for the pilot.&quot;     A woman wearing a face mask cycles in Beijing, which is preparing emergency measures such as traffic limits to kick in when pollution levels are high. Photograph: Andy Wong/AP    As part of a five-year plan released last month, Beijing will spend \u00a3102bn to significantly reduce air pollution levels by 2017. This week, the city announced it would enact a raft of emergency measures when pollution levels remain &quot;serious&quot; for three consecutive days \u2013 schools and factories would close and some private cars would be banned from entering the centre of the city. The measures are a step forward but Song Ranping, a Beijing-based climate and energy expert at the World Resources Institute, says there is still a long way to go. &quot;The system is so large, and there are so many conflicting interests between different parties,&quot; he says. Polluting factories are simply moving to parts of the country that are not as economically developed, he says. &quot;In Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the air quality should be getting better pretty soon, given all the things the government is doing. But for Harbin, I don&apos;t know \u2013 I don&apos;t have too much reason to be optimistic there.&quot; Many of Beijing&apos;s air pollution-related design projects lend themselves more to inspiration than sustainable change. One Beijing-based artist, Matt Hope, has developed a prototype for an air-purifying bicycle out of a mesh rubbish bun, a fighter-pilot mask, a moped helmet and a pedal-powered wind generator. Xiaowei Wang, a recent graduate of Harvard&apos;s Graduate School of Design, has developed a work of performance art using air quality-indicating LED lights affixed to kites. &quot;The goal was to raise awareness about air-quality issues in Beijing through the poetic, participatory act of kite flying,&quot; Wang says. Her project, called Float, consists of two parts: workshops in which Beijing residents affix small air quality-reading modules to homemade kites, and night-time kite-flying sessions in a local park. LED lights on the modules flash different colours according to their readings, creating a &quot;constellation&quot; of pollution-indicating lights in the sky. Wang organised the project in August 2012, before the Beijing smog crisis. State security agents initially approached her about the project, fearing that the data could harm the city&apos;s image, but eventually deemed her unthreatening enough to proceed. Wang says she is amazed by how dramatically China&apos;s attitudes towards air quality has changed since that summer. &quot;I feel like I&apos;m getting an email once a month from someone heading to China to do an air-quality monitoring project,&quot; she says. &quot;And this is all very official \u2013 it&apos;s just become not a problem, and that&apos;s been astonishing to me.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Pollution", "Environment", "Netherlands", "Europe", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-24T11:58:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice/2013/oct/24/china-airpocalypse-harbin-air-pollution-cancer", "sentences": ["While in Shanghai it was reported that the number of cases of tumors had risen."], "title": "China hit by another airpocalypse as air pollution cancer link confirmed | Jennifer Duggan", "article": "Cityscapes shrouded in thick smog have become a common scene in China.

It said that exposure has increased significantly particularly in &quot;rapidly industrial countries with large populations&quot; such as China.  &quot;The air we breath has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances&quot;, Dr Kurt Straif, Head of the IARC Monographs Section said in a press released. &quot;We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths.&quot; These findings, while they show the gravity of China&apos;s air pollution problem, do not come as a shock to Chinese residents. Increasingly the health implications of pollution have been discussed online in local media.  On the Chinese social media site Weibo, many users complained about the pollution in Harbin and shared their concerns. One user, Wei Bang Zhu, wrote on Tuesday &quot;someone should take responsibility for the smog\u2026the price of pursuing high-speed development is that people end up being fed with smog. To venture out in an environment like this would be equivalent to teasing about one&apos;s own health and life.&quot;  References to &quot;feed people with smog&quot; have become popular on Weibo and is a sarcastic play on the expression &quot;serve the people&quot; as the two have a similar pronunciation. Another, Justop88, said: &quot;Too horrible, it&apos;s like the end of the world in American movies.&quot; China&apos;s smog has already been widely linked to respiratory illnesses and according to the state news agency Xinhua, medical experts warned that there will be an increase in the number of people needing treatment after the high levels in Harbin. &quot;The impact of air pollution on people will be gradual. There won&apos;t be a sudden outbreak of symptoms, but normally three to five days after the smoggy weather occurs, there is a peak in the number of people seeing doctors,&quot; Deng Ying, a doctor at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University was quoted as saying. Earlier this year it was announced that cancer is the leading cause of death in the capital Beijing. While in Shanghai it was reported that the number of cases of tumors had risen. According to figures from the Health and Family Planning Commission 36,000 people in the city die of cancer a year.  But it is not just China&apos;s big cities that are affected by pollution-linked health problems. Earlier this year a report by the Ministry of Environmental Protection linked pollution in rivers to cancer in some villages located close to factories or heavy industry. These are often referred to as &apos;cancer villages&apos;  and it is thought this is the first time they had been officially recognised.  In late September, Xinhua reported on a village in Henan where the groundwater has been badly polluted. The news agency said that locals claimed the deaths of 48 villagers from cancer are linked to the pollution.  Research carried out by Yang Gonghuan, a professor of public health at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has also linked high rates of cancer to polluted river water in Henan, Anhui and Shangdong provinces.

But they are now sweeping to victory in a new field, where sharp eyes are equally crucial. &quot;When we began entering darts competitions, people would say: &apos;How can you guys play? We thought you lived in gers [felt tents] and rode horses; do you even have buildings?&apos;&quot; said Erdene Mandakh, president of the Mongolian Amateur Darts Federation. &quot;Now they have stopped asking; they just see us as competitors. But this is only the start.&quot; Britain&apos;s own manly sport takes little room, uses cheap equipment and is suited to Mongolia&apos;s fierce winters, when temperatures can drop to -40C. &quot;In China ping-pong is pretty much the national sport. We want to bring darts to that level,&quot; said Odbileg Khayankhyarvaa, who co-founded the federation in 2009. The two men were among the earliest to discover the game, in the early 1990s. &quot;My generation of Mongolian darts players didn&apos;t know anyone other than John Lowe, Eric Bristow and Dennis Priestley,&quot; Erdene said. These days, novices can watch their fill of matches via the internet. &quot;But back then,&quot; said the 35-year-old, &quot;you would get one video that someone brought back from Russia, maybe. That would be a huge deal. There was no colour TV and hardly anyone had a video player. You would finally find a machine and everyone would gather and you would sit and watch it all night.&quot; In those days dartboards were usually found in markets, with people betting on the outcome. Baatar Tsend tried her hand one day and discovered she was a natural. Soon it became an obsession. &quot;There is nothing bad about darts,&quot; said the 49-year-old, twice national women&apos;s champion. &quot;I am in love with darts.&quot; Her passion is such that she played on even when a nearby stove set fire to her fur coat. On the verge of going into labour, she persuaded friends to smuggle her a dartboard through a hospital window so she could train. Last year she insisted on competing one day after an appendectomy, despite being unable to stand up straight to throw. Darts in hand at an Ulaanbaatar leisure centre, she analysed the roots of her devotion. &quot;Since ancient times our people have been practising archery and ankle bone shooting,&quot; she said. &quot;They&apos;ve got great aim, so maybe this is in our genes or something: our special Mongolian genes.&quot;     Darts champions Erdene Mandakh (right) and Baatar Tsend. Photograph: Dan Chung    History does not record whether Genghis Khan cried when he realised there were no more worlds to conquer. But Baatar wept with joy when she saw her friend Erdenechimeg Dondou, 38, clinch the women&apos;s gold medal at the darts world cup in Shanghai this August. &quot;I was so joyful and excited I didn&apos;t even realise I was jumping up and down on the podium,&quot; recalled Erdenechimeg, who trains before and after her work at a power plant. A few months earlier she and Erdene took gold in the mixed doubles at the Asian darts tournament. &quot;My dream is that, in the near future, I&apos;ll\u00a0go to the birthplace of darts and compete against British players,&quot; she added. The players offer numerous explanations for the game&apos;s appeal: it teaches calmness and focus, improves your mental arithmetic, suits all ages and statures and even boosts your health. &quot;They say that with billiards, you walk 5km in an hour. In darts, you do probably more; 10km,&quot; Odbileg claimed.     Darts champion Erdenechimeg Dondov (foreground) at the oche. Photograph: Dan Chung    That seems a generous estimate. But the players are certainly less than portly, perhaps because they have shunned beer for soft drinks in the hope of winning government backing. China is another darts latecomer, but it already has a specialist school. The Mongolian players are also seeking commercial support and new ways of wooing potential players to supplement the 2,000 already converted. They have promoted the game at the annual Mongolian scout jamboree and at outdoor events in the snow; through companies and government departments; and most of all, to their nearest and dearest. Erdene&apos;s wife and two elder sons are enthusiasts, and even his toddler has his own set of darts. &quot;Inside my home it&apos;s darts \u2013 and outside the home it&apos;s darts \u2026 my life is all about darts,&quot; said Erdene. &quot;Of course, our dream is to play against English people and beat them. Our dream is to become the world champions.&quot;", "tags": ["Mongolia", "World news", "Darts", "Sport", "Wrestling"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-25T08:49:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/26/china-corruption-nanjing-ji-jianye-mayor", "sentences": ["For much of the week, few locals in Nanjing knew what to say to a group of foreign journalists on an exchange visit organised to show a western audience life in a part of booming China that was neither Beijing or Shanghai."], "title": "China, corruption and the court intrigues of Nanjing | David Hearst", "article": "For much of the week, few locals in Nanjing knew what to say to a group of foreign journalists on an exchange visit organised to show a western audience life in a part of booming China that was neither Beijing or Shanghai. The historians talked up the city&apos;s glorious past, the six dynasties it lived through as the pre-communist capital of China. Software engineers pointed to a glorious future as a clean new Silicon Valley, a city with two top-class universities and an abundant supply of graduates. It has to be said the smog was pretty persistent. Together they waxed lyrical with a combination of genuine local pride at a city with modern infrastructure and confected party rhetoric. Brilliant achievements, social development and, that ubiquitous word, harmony featured large in their presentations. There was just one elephant in the room. The day we arrived, Beijing announced Nanjing&apos;s mayor had been fired. The city&apos;s boss had become the latest target of President Xi Jinping&apos;s anti-corruption crusade. It was too late to cancel the visit. Everyone froze. To have called the sacked mayor, Ji Jianye, a Mr Big was something of an understatement. In a city with a population the size of London and in a province with more people than Britain, the former mayor had a finger in every pie. The trouble started when he began ripping up the city&apos;s beloved plane trees to build the underground. Two lines have been completed, seven more are under construction and four of them will be completed by next year. The breakneck pace of construction earned Ji the title of &quot;the digger&quot;, and prompted a silent march of 3,000 people. Then there were the motorways, the railway station (the biggest reportedly in Asia), the tower blocks bearing 82,000 flats. They sprout like mushrooms in the once-rural hinterland of the lush Yangtze delta. Every day the cranes swing and bulldozers clear another footprint for a high-rise block. Even by China&apos;s standards, the construction boom in this once sleepy walled city is frenetic. So when the organisation department of the central committee of the Communist party of China announced that Ji had been fired for &quot;suspected serious disciplinary violations&quot;, and when the People&apos;s Daily put the figure for the sum that Ji had allegedly embezzled by passing construction contracts to friends at 20m yuan ($3.3m), many here greeted the news with a wry grin. That could only have been a fraction of the sum involved. The CPC, they concluded, was once again sheltering one of its own. News of Ji&apos;s removal triggered a wave of rumour on the internet: Ji had been arrogant; he had run city hall from a luxury hotel suite; he had a bad temper and hit his aides round the head with their briefing papers. The pall cast over a man who had still to face any charges, let alone defend himself in a court of law, spread by osmosis to the projects he promoted. A dodgy venture to separate rainwater from sewage water, into which millions of yuan had been poured, was suspended. But then people started asking other questions. Was Ji a rotten apple, was he different from the rest of the party elite, or had he simply lost political cover? The People&apos;s Daily said that investigations into Ji were connected to a parallel probe into the richest man in Suzhou in Jiangsu province, Zhu Xingliang. His construction company received many of Ji&apos;s contracts. Ji worked for eight years as mayor and party secretary in Yangzhou, which was Jiang Zemin&apos;s hometown. The former president and head of the party often used to return for a visit and Ji became one of Jiang&apos;s proteges. Not long ago Jiang emerged from the shadows of his retirement praising Xi Jinping as an &quot;extraordinarily capable and wise leader&quot;. Observers were at the time perplexed by Jiang&apos;s lavish praise for the princeling who had displaced him. They speculated that one motive for doing so was to shield Jiang&apos;s supporters from Xi&apos;s anti-corruption drive. If Ji does indeed belong to that group, we now know that Jiang&apos;s efforts were in vain. The silence about Ji&apos;s fate was broken by his former boss, Nanjing party secretary Yang Weize. To the foreign journalists, it was clear that Yang was a man on the rise. He compared his own city to Boston, where his daughter and grandchildren live. He was unabashed by the comparison. He spoke with ease about the failings of the man who just one week ago had the same relationship to him as a prime minister has to a president. Ji was responsible for the city budget and yet ,according to Yang, removing Ji was like removing a tumour from your body. At the time, the operation hurts, the cool party secretary explained, but then the body recovers and leads a healthy life: &quot;The root of Mr Ji&apos;s corruption was that he let his personal interests prevail against the people&apos;s interests. We needed to remove this person from his position, which has been done.&quot; The legacy of Ji&apos;s removal was a good one: &quot;The rule of law has been established. Anyone who violates the law will be punished. This case will help improve the legal environment of the city. In the past, the fairness and justice of the market was affected by corruption, but now we will be able to build a fairer and better market governed by the rules of competition.&quot; Yang dismissed any talk of a political coup. Political trials belonged, the city&apos;s party secretary maintained, to the era of the cultural revolution. But today that path &quot;had been corrected&quot;. The party had its own disciplines and procedures and anyone who violated them knew what to expect. Yang did not talk like a man who had anything to hide. He embellished the party line with his own metaphors and rhetorical swirls. Whatever battle had been waged behind the scenes in some luxury hotel where Ji was forced to write his confession, it was clear that Yang now represented the winning side. The people of Nanjing may never know what went on way over their heads. Their jobs, contracts, flats and, ultimately, freedom depends on keeping as far away from these court intrigues as they can.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-26T10:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/26/hollywood-struggles-to-halt-film-exodus", "sentences": ["&quot;If you want to see a friend the first question you ask is are you in town.&quot; Outside jobs were dwindling because crews from Shanghai to Baton Rouge had learned from visiting Hollywood masters."], "title": "Hollywood struggles to halt an exodus of film-makers", "article": "Among the tourist hordes on the &quot;walk of fame&quot; last week, you could feel Hollywood casting its spell. They genuflected at the names of actors and film-makers embedded in pink stars in the pavement. Gloria Swanson. John Wayne. Will Smith. Francis Ford Coppola. Quentin Tarantino. Generations of glamour and talent, ringed in brass and close enough to touch. Open-air vans and double-decker buses packed with camera-toting passengers swayed past palm trees and the Chinese Theatre en route to celebrity home tours \u2013 which are in truth celebrity hedge tours, because you seldom glimpse the mansions behind the shrubbery. No matter, the tours are extremely popular: there are now about 40 operators, up from just a handful a few years ago. With an azure sky and balmy sunshine, the only way to detect autumn was in the billboards for Captain Phillips, 12 Years a Slave and Gravity: serious fodder, after summer bubblegum, for Oscar season. After a record-breaking summer box office, and critical acclaim for best picture contenders, how apt that the famous 45ft letters on Mount Lee have been stripped, smeared with primer and repainted with 255 gallons of high-reflective white paint. Hollywood, quite literally, gleaming. Appearances deceive. Los Angeles is haemorrhaging film production. Feature films and TV dramas are fleeing California. Other US states, and other countries, are using aggressive tax breaks to siphon off and claim their own bit of La-la-land, turning the world&apos;s entertainment capital into a cinematic husk. &quot;The tourists still come but what they&apos;re looking at is the past. It&apos;s an illusion,&quot; said Michele Burke, a two-time Oscar-winning makeup artist. &quot;The big films are not being made here. Everything has changed.&quot; The exodus has been given a name: runaway production. Adrian McDonald, a research analyst at FilmLA, a non-profit organisation that arranges filming permits, called the flight &quot;staggering&quot;. Of the 50 top-grossing movies this year, just four were filmed in California. In 1996, 20 of the top 50 were. On-location movie production in LA has plummeted 60% in 15 years. Not even Battle Los Angeles, an alien invasion romp, was filmed here. Recent releases confirm the trend. Iron Man 3, shot in North Carolina; The Lone Ranger, New Mexico; The Great Gatsby, Australia; Gravity, England. England will also host Disney&apos;s reboot of the Star Wars franchise. Vancouver and Hawaii hosted Warner Bros/Legendary&apos;s coming Godzilla blockbuster. Even worse for local actors, musicians and technicians, TV dramas, which generate steadier work than films, are now bypassing Hollywood. Breaking Bad was due to be set and shot in Riverside, outside LA, before being lured to New Mexico. Only two of last autumn&apos;s 23 new dramas were shot in LA County. In 2010, half of TV dramas were shot here. In 2005, the proportion was 80%. The city abounds with abandoned sound stages. LA has retained half-hour comedy and reality shows but they provide lower-paid, scantier work. A California Film Commission report bewailed the industry&apos;s &quot;pronounced erosion&quot;. LA&apos;s new mayor, Eric Garcetti, has declared the phenomenon a &quot;civic emergency&quot;. In a statement to the Observer, he added: &quot;Entertainment is LA&apos;s signature industry, and we can&apos;t afford to lose it. It&apos;s about more than just Hollywood actors and stars \u2013 it&apos;s an industry of over 500,000 good-paying, middle-class jobs like electricians, carpenters and caterers, and I&apos;m committed to doing everything I can to keep filming here in LA.&quot; Garcetti says California must offer better tax breaks and credits to compete with rivals, including Canada and the UK. For a big production these inducements can mean tens of millions of dollars. Disney&apos;s Iron Man 3, which has grossed more than $1bn, paid no tax to its host, North Carolina, because it was deemed a &quot;temporary business entity&quot;. Legislators in California&apos;s state capital, Sacramento, including governor Jerry Brown, have rejected Hollywood&apos;s pleas. They say the state already grants about $100m of annual film credits, while schools are underfunded. Many think the studios have little interest in restoring LA&apos;s glory and prefer to play rival locations against each other to extract greater tax concessions. The mayor has appointed Tom Sherak, a former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, to head a new entertainment industry and production office. Sherak said he would fight to bring back jobs. &quot;We have all the infrastructure here. We have heat, snow, beaches, mountains and studio back lots that look like New York.&quot; If studios tried moving their headquarters out of LA he would move his &quot;Bolshevik army to the border&quot; to stop them, he vowed. There is a Potemkin village feel where studio executives fill shiny offices, behind which languish empty or underused lots. Some, such as Universal Studios, have converted lots into theme parks, with film-inspired rides. It is not too late to revive the industry, said Sherak. &quot;It&apos;s never too late. Hollywood is not dead. If there&apos;s one thing we know how to do out here it&apos;s make movies. No one can take away our past.&quot; That past includes Nathanael West&apos;s 1939 novel The Day of the Locust, where doomed souls struggle to make it in Hollywood. The unemployed technicians, builders and caterers besieging his office for help would not share the same fate as the novel&apos;s characters, said Sherak. &quot;I would have to wipe away my tears if it were true. That&apos;s not my vision of Los Angeles. I want this to be the place where that girl from Kansas comes to be the next Julia Roberts.&quot; Struggling actors console themselves with the story of how Brad Pitt dressed as a giant chicken for the restaurant chain El Pollo Loco before his breakthrough role in Thelma &amp; Louise. Those who wait tables inject drama into menu descriptions if they suspect diners are producers or casting agents. All sectors are battling, said Keith McNutt, western region director of charity the Actors Fund. &quot;People are scared. You see people with long-established careers struggling to make ends meet. You see income levels dropping by a third, a half, two-thirds.&quot; Colleagues are losing houses and marriages, said Andr\u00e9 Bustanoby, a visual effects veteran with MFX. &quot;It&apos;s the rule of the wild and it&apos;s going to get uglier. We struggle with it every day. It sickens me.&quot; Burke said a good gig invariably meant a stint outside LA. &quot;If you want to see a friend the first question you ask is are you in town.&quot; Outside jobs were dwindling because crews from Shanghai to Baton Rouge had learned from visiting Hollywood masters. &quot;We&apos;ve trained them so they don&apos;t need us.&quot; Many colleagues had permanently left LA. &quot;You no longer need to be here.&quot; Var\u00e8se Sarabande, the world&apos;s largest producer of film scores, recorded just 20 scores in LA last year, compared with more than 100 five years ago. The loss to LA is largely Britain&apos;s gain. The lure is not just lower tax but a willingness to forfeit secondary market residuals on future video sales and broadcasts. &quot;In London, you have a buyout option, select your rate and the recording is yours. There are no further tariffs. In LA you have a never-ending [payment] stream,&quot; said Robert Townson, the company&apos;s vice-president. Hollywood&apos;s hollowing remains largely invisible to outsiders. When LA company Rhythm &amp; Hues won the best visual effects Oscar for Life of Pi, few knew that it had already filed for bankruptcy. Outside the ceremony hundreds of visual-effects artists protested, but they were kept away from the red carpet.

Guthrie had led since midway through the opening day at Lake Malaren and was four shots clear overnight, but a third round of 72 meant he was caught at the top of the leaderboard by Spain&apos;s Rafael Cabrera-Bello, who carded a 67, the joint-lowest round of the day, to finish alongside Guthrie on eight under par, with fellow Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano a shot behind after his own 67.

They recorded a fifth-wicket stand of 197 before they were parted just before tea when part-time spinner Dean Elgar snared Misbah 12 short of a century.

The home side, FC Seoul, were still stuck in traffic 45 minutes before kick-off along with a fair amount of the 55,500 fans set to watch the showpiece game. Frantic Asian Football Confederation officials had phones in one hand and half-blank team-sheets in the other, the South Korean players were still tweeting from the bus when they should have been halfway through their routine and there was the unmistakable white-haired 2006 World Cup-winning manager, sharing a joke with the Chinese members of his coaching staff. Communication may not be smooth but Lippi, aiming to become the first manager to win the premier club competitions of both Uefa and the AFC, has plenty to smile about \u2013 not least that at \u20ac10m (\u00a38.5m) a year he earns 64 times more than his Seoul counterpart Choi Yong-soo. The first Chinese word the Italian learned after his appointment in May 2012 was ashtray. His habit has endeared him to a press pack that, even in the chain-smoking world of Asian football journalists, take puffing to a whole different level, as the majority of the 70-plus who made the journey across the Yellow Sea demonstrated. They also love Lippi for the winning habit that is taking Guangzhou to the next level \u2013 from the biggest club on the world&apos;s biggest continent to becoming the first Asian &quot;superclub&quot;. The Reds are oft-called the Manchester United of Asia but while there is no continental rival in terms of stature and profile, their rise has been Manchester City-esque. Large injections of money from Evergrande, a real estate company, took the club from nowhere \u2013 in this case the Chinese second division in 2010 \u2013 to glory. Success at home is now a given and a third successive Super League title clinched recently went almost unnoticed as a first Asian final approached. Beating Seoul would not only provide kudos on the continent but also offer access to Fifa&apos;s Club World Cup and more besides. The first leg, 2-2 draw was a solid step. About 12,000 fans descended on the South Korean capital clad in red behind a massive &quot;We Are Canton&quot; banner. Chinese supporters have watched over the years as their east Asian neighbours dominated the club scene. The Middle Kingdom&apos;s sole title came in 1990. South Korea, with less than a 20th of the population, has won 10. English television viewers sometimes become exasperated when watching Premier League teams in Europe as commentators assume the whole country wants Manchester United, Arsenal or Chelsea to win. In Guangzhou&apos;s case it is largely true. According to a poll on Weibo, China&apos;s Twitter, 94% of the population was cheering them on. Chinese students in South Korea were given tickets and told to support their country&apos;s representative. In Asia, too, Evergrande are big news. Viewing figures have not yet been released for the first leg but sources say it will easily be the highest-rated Asian Champions League game ever. Perhaps it was all a bit much for a team rarely tested. Despite breezing their way to the final with 19 goals scored and only three conceded in six knockout stage games, Guangzhou did not click in South Korea. Dejan Damjanovic continued the good form he showed for Montenegro in trying to qualify for the 2014 World Cup with a deserved equaliser for Seoul. Lippi stood motionless as he had done for 90 minutes apart from a failed volleyed backheel attempt to return a high ball into play but he said after the game that his team have two away goals, the second leg on 9 November, another gear and 50,000 home fans in their favour. They are still odds-on to win. In a continent full of South American imports of varying quality, Guangzhou have the best. Argentina&apos;s Dario Conca \u2013 brilliant on the field if difficult off it, according to the club chairman \u2013 was, when he arrived in July 2011, reportedly the third highest-paid player in the world. The playmaker has been outstanding, backed by the Brazilians Elkeson and Muriqui. So dominant have the Reds become in China that other clubs asked them to go easy when hoovering up domestic talent. They did, a little, but still possess much of the Chinese national team and had to play a league game in October without eight of their players away on international duty. That is one reason why Guangzhou are pushing the FA to relax the limit (currently four non-Asians are allowed) on signing foreign players. Gangzhou are not the only Chinese team to spend big but they did it best, certainly better than Shanghai Shenhua with their ill-fated Anelka-Drogba adventure. Others have followed, such as Guangzhou R&amp;F who are coached by Sven-Goran Eriksson, Lippi&apos;s regular dining partner at a local Italian restaurant, but they are way behind. All this investment is partly the result of a political desire to see the Chinese game first cleansed of corruption and then improved to become Asia&apos;s best. Businesses have been happy to spend, at least in part, to please officials at the local, regional and national level. The new president of China, Xi Jinping, is a big fan.

Fei is speaking in the echoing marble-clad foyer of this 65,000 sq m space as front-of-house staff prepare the 2,000-seat auditorium for this evening&apos;s performance of Thoroughly Modern Millie. Tonight is the second performance of a two-day run. The show, says Fei, has sold well \u2013 ticket prices have been kept low because it&apos;s a production by students at the Shanghai Theatre Academy. In December, Fei&apos;s theatre will host a rather more illustrious company, when the official Asia Pacific tour of The Phantom of the Opera plays its only Chinese dates in Shanghai. It&apos;s been 10 years since Phantom was last performed in China and Fei is delighted to see its return. But while a lot of progress has been made in terms of building a following for musicals in China over the intervening decade, they&apos;re still a surprisingly difficult sell, says the director. Phantom has a big following in Shanghai, but will only be doing 60 performances there this winter. Long runs like those enjoyed by western musicals in Japan and Korea are simply unsustainable, he says. There&apos;s an appetite out there for the type of work he programmes, says Fei, but the mainly young people to whom musicals appeal don&apos;t have the disposable income to sustain a theatre habit. With average annual income for a family in the city only 29,000 renminbi (\u00a33,000), few of its 23 million inhabitants can afford to pay the minimum 250 yuan (\u00a325) for a large-scale musical theatre production at the SCS. The situation in China&apos;s so-called &apos;second-tier&apos; cities, where wages are lower and the locals less worldly, is even more challenging. Outside of &apos;first-tier&apos; cities Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, it&apos;s rare for a show to run for more than a handful of performances. This makes the economics of touring very complex indeed. Fei would like to lower ticket prices at SCS but says that running costs are too high to enable him to do so. The theatre was built with 1.3 billion yuan (\u00a3133m) of government money and is state-funded to the tune of 50 million yuan (\u00a35m) but receives no other subsidy. Fei explains too that there are no significant tax breaks for the culture sector in China. This despite the fact that the 12th Five-Year Plan of the Communist Party of China, published in 2011, called for the cultural industry to grow from less than 2.5% of GDP to at least 5% of GDP by 2015. In financial terms, says Fei, a theatre is essentially &quot;the same as any other commercial organisation&quot;. Pricing isn&apos;t the only issue. The older demographic, those with the means of buying musical theatre tickets, aren&apos;t interested in doing so. &quot;In China we don&apos;t have a custom of going to the theatre,&quot; Fei explains. &quot;In your country, or in America, people go see a show, it&apos;s a part of life. But in China, during the Cultural Revolution, [the period between 1966 and 1976 when all forms of cultural activity were vigorously suppressed], the custom of going to the theatre stopped.&quot; Younger generations of Chinese, says Fei, &quot;are very good at trying new things&quot;, even if they haven&apos;t been exposed to much culture while growing up. To attract older audiences, however, SCS must employ different tactics: &quot;Maybe we do some old shows like Beijing opera. They don&apos;t know musicals, but they know opera. We say it&apos;s a good way for sons and daughters to treat their fathers and mothers.&quot; Another way that producers are seeking to widen the reach of musicals in China is through Mandarin productions of western shows. Following the launch of Mamma Mia! in 2011, a Chinese version of Cats opened in Shanghai in 2012. There&apos;s a Mandarin production of Avenue Q currently running in the city and Fei says he hopes to bring a Chinese Phantom to SCS in the not too distant future. Translations are probably more attractive to audiences than their original versions, says the director, but only if the price is right; the average theatregoer can no more afford a ticket to a major musical sung in Mandarin than they can one sung in English with surtitles. There is also a question of quality. Musical theatre training in China is still in its infancy and this is sometimes apparent in the end product, says Fei: &quot;On the visual side, it&apos;s almost the same. But the singing is not as good as in the originals.&quot; Fortunately, with dozens of students graduating each year from musical theatre courses at respected institutions like the Shanghai Conservatory of Music (where Fei himself completed a master&apos;s degree in musical theatre and musicology), this is unlikely to be a long-term problem. When it comes to producing western musicals in China, whether in translation or not, censorship is an additional hoop to jump through. It&apos;s a delicate balance, says Fei: make a show too conservative and no one will go see it; put in too much sex or violence or religion or politics and the government might not approve it. Context is crucial. You might think that Les Miserables, a show that features a student revolution being bloodily put down by the authorities, would raise eyebrows in the censor&apos;s office. Yet Les Mis was the first western show to tour China, back in 2002. Fei explains that Victor Hugo&apos;s novel is so well loved there that these unsavoury elements of the story can be overlooked; in any case, it&apos;s the romance that&apos;s the focus. The same wouldn&apos;t be true, he says, for Miss Saigon: &quot;It&apos;s not a famous novel, it&apos;s American soldiers invading a socialist country and after that a girl in a socialist country wanting to send her son to America and even killing herself. Not very...&quot; He tails off \u2013 I get the picture. All that said, Fei declares that the climate around censorship is &quot;more open&quot; now than ever before. &quot;I think that the officials are more and more compromised to a lot of things, as long as you are not anti-government.&quot; There are challenges to overcome but Fei is positive about the future. It will take time: another 10 years perhaps before the market achieves maturity, he suggests. For now, the director is committed to bringing a big western musical to SCS every year and hopes the theatre will begin producing its own work within the next three years. And as China&apos;s cultural industry gains strength, he says, we&apos;ll see &quot;more audiences, lower ticket prices, better quality&quot;. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Hordes of people walk in all directions. Dotting the landscape, skyscrapers pierce the sky. For this group of uninitiated travellers, Shanghai is a surreal sight. Its frenetic pulse mesmerises, providing an intoxicating departure from normality. In mid-October, a Perth Indigenous female basketball team journeyed to the Chinese megacity as part of the Friendship Games \u2013 the fledgling Western Australia-China sports tournament. Included in that number was 15-year-old Johalia Davey hails from One Arm Point, a remote Aboriginal community north of Broome with a population of around 300 people. A stark contrast to Shanghai, the largest city in the world, with an estimated population close 20 million. Johalia says she relished her initiation outside of Australia after believing she would \u201cnever travel to another country\u201d. \u201cI was very nervous and frightened because I had never travelled that far before,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter a few days I got used to how different everything was and started to like being there. It is a completely different country and so far from Australia. \u201cI think many people there had never seen an aboriginal person before because they were taking a lot of photos of our team.\u201d Johalia and her team-mates \u2013 students from Clontarf Girls Academy and Perth College \u2013 comprised the basketball team. Inevitably, the inexperienced team, consisting of players mainly aged 13 and 14, were overwhelmed in all three of their matches against Chinese university sides. \u201cThe average height of our team is about 163cm and we were playing against teams with players close to 2m,\u201d coach Desiree Delcoure explains. However, results are trivial in the Games, which also feature swimming, and track and field. The event aims to strengthen relationship between WA and China, using sport as a tool to transcend cultural boundaries. The Friendship Games provides youth with an opportunity to embrace another culture, with many of the participants from backgrounds where venturing abroad is merely a pipedream. None of the basketball team\u2019s 10 players had travelled overseas previously, with most not possessing a passport until their Shanghai invitation.\u00a0 The girls did not only shoot hoops in Shanghai. They also savoured the local flavour through numerous cultural activities, including dragon boat racing. Delcoure believes positive transformation had consumed the girls in the trip\u2019s aftermath. \u201cWe had teachers at Clontarf comment on how the girls seem more confident and talkative since Shanghai,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an invaluable opportunity for the girls to visit another country and experience a different culture. I think it has broadened their horizons and will help shape them. It was an eye-opening experience, with some of the girls from very small communities.\u201d Life lessons were learned both on the court and in the street, says Johalia. \u201cI learned a lot about being on a team, trusting other people, and doing things I\u2019ve never done before,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was hard being away from my family but I managed to get through it.\u201d Now that the travel bug has left its indelible mark, Johalia hopes to travel to the United States one day. Four-time Olympian and former Perth Wildcats championship captain Andrew Vlahov helped found the Friendship Games. The basketballer-turned-businessman has ambitious plans to propel the event to new heights. Vlahov\u2019s vision is to transform the Games into the southern hemisphere\u2019s biggest youth festival by 2015. The event would be held in Perth every two years and include athletes and students from not only China but other Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. \u201cI am a firm believer that WA needs to integrate with Asia and sport&apos;s a great platform to build relationships,\u201d Vlahov says. \u201cWA has the opportunity to build a strong and unique relationship with Asia. The event would be a fusion of sport and the arts, with displays of music and art to help with the cultural understanding.\u201d Vlahov says the concept for the revamped Games has \u201cpopular support\u201d but concedes significant financial backing is needed for the project to be realised. \u201cWe need financial assistance from government and the private sector for this expansion of the event,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have made enquiries and discussions are taking place. The initial feedback has been really positive.\u201d Vlahov says the inspiration behind expanding the event is to \u201ccapture as many young people\u201d, particularly those enduring hardships. \u201cIt is an opportunity to give kids an opportunity they may not otherwise have,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to provide an inclusive policy, including possible participation from foster kids and those in the juvenile justice system. \u201cIt is brilliant seeing kids growing as people after experiencing another culture. It&apos;s important for our kids to understand different cultures.\u201d If Vlahov\u2019s dream materialises, WA\u2019s relationship with Asia will be stronger. Perhaps, more importantly, communities within WA will strengthen too.\u00a0", "tags": ["Australia sport", "Sport", "Basketball"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-29T01:40:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2013/oct/29/international-school-students-cultural-identity", "sentences": ["Ask which part of England I&apos;m from, and I&apos;ll be forced to explain that I spent most of my childhood and part of my adolescence flitting around Asia: Taipei, Shanghai, Singapore, Beijing."], "title": "International school students: rootless and without a home?", "article": "Remy Shea is a sixth-form student at my international school in Beijing. When I ask her where she is from, she says: &quot;I&apos;m Canadian-Chinese but, at the same time, I&apos;m neither.&quot; Most students at my school aren&apos;t from one particular place. Sure, our passports might say we&apos;re British or Malaysian, but it&apos;s more complicated than that. Where you&apos;re &quot;from&quot; is less about birthplace and more about cultural identity; as an expat student your cultural identity ends up being difficult to categorise. If you ask me where I&apos;m from, I&apos;ll tell you I&apos;m English. Press me, and I&apos;ll say that I&apos;m also half Taiwanese. Ask which part of England I&apos;m from, and I&apos;ll be forced to explain that I spent most of my childhood and part of my adolescence flitting around Asia: Taipei, Shanghai, Singapore, Beijing. Though I was born in Guisborough in Yorkshire, I honestly couldn&apos;t point it out on a map or tell you anything about the place. Students like me are uniquely rootless; we don&apos;t belong anywhere and we can&apos;t describe ourselves as any one thing. Some find that they make their home wherever their family is. Some just accept the inherent loneliness that comes with the lack of concrete ties to any single place. Exir Kamalabadi, a year 13 student at my school, sums it up perfectly: &quot;I&apos;ll never be Chinese, no matter what I do.&quot; Replace &quot;Chinese&quot; with any other country, and you can understand the conflict within many &quot;third culture kids&quot;, as we&apos;ve been dubbed by the media. For me, I&apos;ll never be Taiwanese, no matter what I do. And, despite my predominantly English-influenced upbringing, I will never feel fully at home there either. I feel like a foreigner everywhere I go, a sentiment echoed by other students at international schools like mine. Mixed-race students who travel a lot while growing up can lack a cultural identity and also have to struggle with the fact that they don&apos;t have a history \u2013 or not one that&apos;s easily explained. Kamalabadi says: &quot;I very much feel like a cyber-age person, with bits and pieces of my background stuck together like a montage from the things I read, movies I watch and places I&apos;ve been.&quot; For me, a cultural identity is something I have to cultivate and maintain, not something that falls into place naturally. I&apos;ve heard my accent becoming progressively more American over the last five years. This is jarring because my vaguely British accent was the last real reminder of where I was born. Without it, how am I supposed to tell people I&apos;m from the UK? I&apos;ve had to make a concerted effort to retain my nondescript, regionally ambiguous &quot;English&quot; accent because without it, I don&apos;t have any proof that I was from the UK at all. My passport might as well have been Taiwanese. This lack of definition means that I&apos;ve ended up in a murky haze of different cultures, with bits and pieces from everywhere I&apos;ve lived and everyone I&apos;ve met. I count with my fingers the way they do in Taiwan and I grew up eating roti in Singaporean food courts and goose fat noodles at my grandmother&apos;s house in Kaohsiung. My accent is tinged with my friends&apos; American inflections, but I still spell colour with a &apos;u&apos; and lament the lack of Gregg&apos;s in China. I&apos;m incredibly grateful to have experienced all these aspects of different countries.

What follows is very funny, but as much as it is a modern political situation (it&apos;s set in &quot;Tazbekistan&quot;, a former Soviet republic) with some amusing satirical points (bribes for contracts, royal faux pas), this is basically Mark and Jez in suits, performing some effective but ultimately traditional comedy. John Robinson Mercury Prize Live9.30pm, More4 You&apos;ve got to feel for Lauren Laverne and Nick Grimshaw, tasked with making a rather uninspiring Mercury Prize shortlist sound like something worth caring about for the best part of an hour.

Within the first few minutes Bea has discovered that Jacs was behind daughter Debbie&apos;s death from a heroin overdose, courtesy of Brayden, Jacs&apos;s son on the outside.

I just spent the last two months doing exactly that \u2013 and the answer might surprise you. Since 2008, the emergence of legal highs has wrong-footed policymakers, parents and police. These drugs imitate the effects of cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA and cannabis. They are popular, legal to take and supply, and their use is growing. Barely a week goes by without a press or TV report of a death, or major psychological consequences, as a result of using them. These reports often claim that it is a trivial task to take a banned drug and, with a little molecular trickery, get a Chinese lab to produce a new, legal version. Most stories about legal and illegal drugs in the mass media are at best hysterical and inaccurate, and at worst simply untrue, so I decided to put this particular claim to the test. The market in legal highs is growing. In 2009, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction&apos;s early warning system discovered 24 new drugs. In 2010, it found another 41; in 2011, another 49; and in 2012, there were 73 more. By October 2013, a further 56 new compounds had already been identified: a total of 243 new drugs in just four years. Or rather, make that 244, because as part of a two-month investigation for the online science and technology publisher Matter, I just devised a new, legal drug, had it synthesised in China, and delivered to a PO Box in central London. It is a close chemical cousin of a substance that was well-loved by some of the world&apos;s most famous musicians, and, it&apos;s rumoured, by John F Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Truman Capote \u2013 but was banned decades ago. There&apos;s a bag of it sat in its courier packaging on my desk as I write. There&apos;s also a sample at Cardiff University, where Andrew Westwell, a brilliant chemist at the WEDINOS project, a Welsh government-funded initiative that tracks and identifies new drugs. He has analysed it and proved its authenticity and guessed at its likely effects if taken: a stimulant. All it took me was a few dozen phone calls to Shanghai, a gmail account, a bank transfer, a PO Box set up in a false name, a few emails to contacts on web forums that gave me the synthesis and the modification and the name of a friendly laboratory, and a bit of reading. Job done. In its latest World Drug Report, the United Nations acknowledges (pdf): &quot;While new harmful substances have been emerging with unfailing regularity on the drug scene, the international drug control system is floundering, for the first time, under the speed and creativity of the phenomenon.&quot; There are now more legal drugs on sale than were even dreamed of when the first global drug laws were written: the 1961 and 1971 UN drug conventions proscribe just 234. They were written when the Beatles were still performing, in an age when the internet did not exist. As Australian medic David Caldicott told me, &quot;If you treated any illness with the same antibiotic for 50 years, medical people would be stunned if resistance hadn&apos;t developed.&quot; New strains and mutations call for new medicines. So if new drugs are the problem, what is the answer? The response of UK governments, of all stripes, has been wholly inadequate. The Conservative/Lib Dem coalition introduced Temporary Class Drug Orders (TCDO) in November 2011, which allow drugs to be temporarily controlled for a year and then banned once the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) has pondered their harms. This law has done nothing to slow down chemical innovation. Since the NBOME-series of hallucinogenic drugs was banned this summer under a TCDO, a new family of equipotent hallucinogens \u2013 about which we know even less \u2013 has come to market, known as the NBOH-series of drugs. When 6-APB, an ecstasy-like drug was banned, 5-EAPB came to market. After methoxetamine \u2013 a ketamine derivative \u2013 was banned, a distant, inbred cousin from a far-flung branch of the chemical family tree, diphenidine, has come on sale. For every synthetic cannabinoid the authorities have banned, a half-dozen more have popped up, all of which are less understood by doctors than cannabis. There is simply no let-up. In the time it took to write my last story about legal highs, five new drugs came on the market. Each of them will be banned, as will the legal high that I have just commissioned. A new modification will fill the gap within days. It is not an especially simple or trivial matter to untangle the UK&apos;s drug laws and find a drug that can be sold legally, but it can be done with a little effort, as my investigation showed. It can, however, be a hugely profitable affair. Who cares about the consequences for users&apos; health? Certainly not the vendors of these drugs, who dodge the law by saying they are not for human consumption. The real issue is this: we are confusing cause and effect. The reason so many new drugs are appearing is precisely because we keep banning them. That approach worked in the 1960s and 1970s, and even perhaps until the 1980s. But in the internet era, it is impossible to control this market. More laws equals more drugs. If I, a journalist who until recently knew nothing of chemistry, can commission a new drug in a matter of weeks, so can many more people. And they will. Policymakers&apos; prime concern should not be which drugs are legal or illegal, but which are the most harmful. Their next problem is how to regulate the market in psychoactive chemicals. That will be more complicated than anyone \u2013 even those who advocate radical new approaches, including decriminalisation \u2013 dare consider. \u2022 You can read Uncontrolled Substances, Mike Power&apos;s investigation into the past, present and future of the designer drugs scene, for $0.99 (60 pence) on the science and technology site MATTER", "tags": ["Drugs", "Chemistry", "Science", "Drugs", "Society", "Drugs policy", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-31T13:10:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/02/chen-yongzhou-weibo-china-struggles-media", "sentences": ["Referring to its banner headlines, the newspaper&apos;s statement read: &quot;After the incident, our newspaper took improper actions, seriously damaging the credibility of the media and this is a profound lesson for us.&quot; Chen&apos;s fate divided his Chinese colleagues in Nanjing who participated in a week-long exchange programme with foreign journalists organised by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London and the Shanghai Jiao Tong University."], "title": "From Chen Yongzhou to Weibo, China struggles to keep a lid on stories | David Hearst", "article": "It&apos;s known in China by a term used to describe a shot in table tennis.

The charge under which the investigative reporter was being held was &quot;suspicion of damaging commercial reputation&quot;. Instead of disowning its cub reporter, his newspaper, the Guangzhou-based New Express, stuck by him \u2013 at least initially. They ran a front-page story under a banner headline &quot;Please release him&quot; and repeated that with another front page call: &quot;Again, please release him&quot;. A senior executive for the New Express denied Zoomlion&apos;s accusation that Chen&apos;s reports were fabricated. He said: &quot;We did not discover Chen did anything that was against professional ethics and laws.&quot; The reaction to Chen&apos;s arrest was unprecedented. For a while, the third largest newspaper in the province and a significant number of journalists openly challenged the actions of the police, an important local employer, and by extension the actions of the provincial authorities. The All-China Journalists Association urged local authorities to provide a convincing explanation of Chen&apos;s detention. Further, it was claimed on the internet that the company was well connected, politically. According to reports, Zhan Chunxin, the chairman of the board of Zoomlion is the son of the former director of Hunan provincial high court, and his wife, Wan Ziaoli, is the daughter of the former second party secretary of Hunan province. The riposte came swiftly. Chen appeared last weekend, his head shaven to denote guilt, in a nationally televised confession. In his confession, he stated he had been bribed by a commercial rival to Zoomlion and said he did not even read some of the reports that were written in his name. This struck colleagues as a curious extra detail, because Chen was known as a compulsive checker of his facts. Was he trying to indicate that his confession was forced out of him, in return for a more lenient sentence? Within hours of Chen&apos;s confession, his newspaper New Express retracted, apologising for failing to check Chen&apos;s reports. Referring to its banner headlines, the newspaper&apos;s statement read: &quot;After the incident, our newspaper took improper actions, seriously damaging the credibility of the media and this is a profound lesson for us.&quot; Chen&apos;s fate divided his Chinese colleagues in Nanjing who participated in a week-long exchange programme with foreign journalists organised by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London and the Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Some believed what Chen had originally written and concluded he had been thrown to the wolves. The majority, however, thought his confession was genuine and that he had accepted bribes by a rival firm to write stories that would benefit it commercially. It happens all the time, one said. The internet is full of lies. All, however, accepted that in their own professional lives they worked under very specific constraints. They survived by observing the red lines that people like Chen, innocently or not, had crossed. These red lines were plain for all to see. The day that foreign journalists arrived, Beijing announced that Nanjing&apos;s mayor had been arrested on corruption charges. Before this scandal, the Nanjing Daily would carry a full 800-word report a day on its front page about something the hyperactive and ever-present mayor said or did. As the cloud moved over his head, the mayor was relegated to page two. During the whole of the week following his arrest, the city&apos;s main paper only devoted a small 250-word story on the man who had only too recently dominated their pages. The ex-mayor had not only become a non-person. He had become non-news too. &quot;It&apos;s a shame for the city. People don&apos;t want to talk about it, not because they are frightened. They just want to keep away from the issue. There is a culture or tradition here of avoiding talking about issues like this,&quot; one journalist said. So little trust in placed in official media, and even newspapers with private funding, that Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, has assumed an inordinate role in the life of the average Chinese internet user. Of the country&apos;s 500 million internet users, 300 million of them have Weibo accounts. There is however an essential difference between Twitter and Weibo. One has been shaped by the traditional media, and is an extension of it. Weibo, on the other hand, fills the gap between the official account of things on the mainstream media in China and what actually happens on the ground. Within three days of a high-speed train crash in Wenzhou in eastern China&apos;s Zhejiang province, the Weibo account for the crash had 10 million users online. The authorities recognise this and attempt to use microblogging to hone their government communications. In 2009 there was a problem about rural pupils attending school. Using microblogging they found that the problem was that pupils could not afford the school meal. The answer was to launch a nutrition project for rural schools. The speed with which Weibo reacts to the news undermines efforts to maintain a consistent official line. An unexplained absence by the president-elect Xi Jinping last year sparked rumours on the microblogging sites which were deleted by the state censors. Chinese microbloggers got around the problem by using English words which evaded the digital dragnet, but conveyed the same meaning in Chinese: &quot;Where&apos;s he?&quot; The arrests of microbloggers on Weibo are only one part of an increasingly active tug-of-war between the Chinese Communist party and China&apos;s market-driven and increasingly questioning media. Even if those challenges are happening at the fringes, they are still happening and more frequently than before. Chen Yongzhou has been declared guilty before any case has been heard in court. The clean-up on the internet has already begun. The links in the South China Morning Post that deal with his original allegations and the front-page pleas by his newspaper are already unobtainable. All that remains are his confessions of guilt. The record may be wiped clean, but the challenge that he and others posed remains. It is one that the authorities will find it increasing hard to answer.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Press freedom", "Newspapers & magazines", "Newspapers", "Media", "Social media", "Digital media", "Censorship"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-02T10:00:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/03/sport-news-in-brief", "sentences": ["PA Golf: Poulter has a chance   Dustin Johnson gave the chasing pack some hope with a double-bogey on the last to reduce his lead to three shots after the third round of the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai."], "title": "Sport news in brief", "article": "Rugby Union: Wade wades in to serve reminder to Lancaster Wasps director of rugby David Young praised winger Christian Wade after his side ran out 32-30 winners in the Aviva Premiership match at Gloucester.

As UK readers know best, easy access to the sea allows economies to trade and to grow. Shanghai, New York, Hong Kong, London, Sydney, Mumbai, the Hansa, Tokyo, San Francisco and Cape Town demonstrate the economic advantages of a good harbour. Conversely, landlocked countries (such as Kyrgyzstan and the Central African Republic) are poor and falling behind. Cities with deep water ports are the most fertile soil on which we can cultivate businesses, the incubators of innovation and economic growth. We have long been told that these cities, our strongest economic and political units, are at risk from rising sea levels. Until fairly recently, hydrogeologists and climate scientists have forecast increases in sea levels by one metre by 2050. Such estimates have worried leaders in the Maldives, but the rest of us have largely ignored sea-level changes as an important economic issue in Europe or North America. The Dutch can build bigger dams, and the Thames can be curtained off. Bloomberg has been busy redesigning the coast of New York City since Hurricane Sandy. We have assumed we could adapt. So it is with some surprise that we read recently that these estimates have been too conservative, and that scores of cities are at far greater risk than we may have believed. Ben Strauss from Climate Central has published a paper (PDF) in which he looks at rising sea-level predictions and matches them to the elevation of US cities. His paper is unique in that he has combined city-level data (population and elevation) with research by Anders Levermann, a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the rate at which sea levels are rising (2.3 metres per degree Celsius). He predicts that unless we significantly change our projected carbon emissions, 315 US cities are under threat. &quot;By the end of this century, if global climate emissions continue to increase, that may lock in 23 feet of sea-level rise.&quot; The critical term here is, of course, &quot;lock in&quot;. Forecast levels of CO2 emissions will generate enough warming to raise the oceans seven metres. The greenhouse gases already emitted will eventually result in a rise of 1.3 metres. Strauss&apos; analysis only looks at the likelihood coastal cities will be under water. Strauss forecasts the impact of rising seas without storms. He doesn&apos;t forecast the likelihood that calamitous weather events like Hurricane Sandy will cause far greater damage when the oceans have risen closer to the level of the cities, overwhelming roads, sewers, underground trains, and water systems. We can now imagine a day when storms do not merely damage coastal cities but destroy them. He contends that by 2100, more than 25% of Boston, Miami, New Orleans, and Atlantic City could be under water. The same forecast (23 ft or 7m by 2100) can be plugged into a global map of elevations and sea levels here. Such a calculation is even more alarming. Most of the globe&apos;s economic activity is funneled through cities that will be fighting to stay above water. Imagine a world without Shanghai, Mumbai and Boston, a world in which London and New York are risky settings for markets. A very thorough set of estimates of the impact of rising sea levels on the economies of coastal cities, Future flood losses in major coastal cities, has appeared as an advance online publication in Nature Climate Change. This study uses 20cm and 40cm increases to generate scenarios for anticipated flood losses in large coastal cities. Here&apos;s the central message: Average global flood losses in 2005 are estimated to be approximately US$6\u2009billion per year [in 136 coastal cities], increasing to US$52\u2009billion by 2050 with projected socio-economic change alone. With climate change and subsidence, present protection will need to be upgraded to avoid unacceptable losses of US$1\u2009trillion or more per year. The enormously cautious IPCC has forecast of a best case of 20cm and a worst case of 100cm of sea level rise by 2100. If alarmists are estimating seven metres of sea level rise, and the most cautious scientists are estimating 20-100 cm, there is a considerable likelihood that the US$1 trillion estimate of average annual losses due to flooding in coastal cities is not too high. Given the enormous populations migrating to coastal cities, their oversize economic impact, and their anchoring of global prosperity in the businesses, markets and universities, the eventual drowning of coastal cities is an economic, social and even moral issue of the highest importance. We need the business acumen of cities like Mumbai, Guangzhou, Miami and Ho Chi Minh City to generate the innovations and the capital necessary to resolve the world&apos;s critical problems. We cannot afford to lose their economies and societies. Last year, we saw Wall Street under water. Climate change risks turning the globe&apos;s centres of economic growth into Atlantis. If we want prosperity, we must save our coastal cities. Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

The South African launched an epic tirade against the set-up at Wentworth, his long-time home course, during the 2012 PGA Championship. &quot;Really, I am pissed off&quot; was among Els&apos;s more tame sentiments at that time. Later last year, Els claimed advances in equipment are responsible for relative parity in top-level golf. &quot;I look around now and see guys winning, guys who could never have done so 20 years ago,&quot; he said. On Sunday, Els was at it again. This time his target was those behind the European Tour&apos;s schedule and, specifically, this year&apos;s inaugural Final Series which encompasses two tournaments in China, with one each in Turkey and Dubai. Els has pulled out of the DP World Championship event in Dubai, the lucrative finale of the European Tour season, to emphasise his disquiet. Competitors must play in at least two of the three events preceding Dubai to be eligible for a spot in the Emirate state&apos;s 60-man field. &quot;I don&apos;t think they really care,&quot; Els said when asked how the Tour had reacted to the news that he would not feature in Dubai. &quot;Why would they make a decision like that and expect guys to play? It&apos;s farcical. In my view it&apos;s an absolute joke.&quot; Els, 44, is neither inexperienced nor loose with his tongue. He will be well aware of the impact of whatever he says and would presumably have the backing of Joost Luiten, who went through the farcical scenario of playing just a single shot at the BMW Masters in Shanghai before withdrawing because of a shoulder injury. By hitting that one drive, Luiten protected his chances of reaching Dubai. Luke Donald, on Twitter, promptly stated &quot;Can&apos;t blame Joost \u2013 new rule forced his hand&quot;. Ian Poulter, who is based in Florida, offered a similar if softer view to Els, also during the BMW Masters. Poulter said: &quot;For me it&apos;s too far to go home for a week and so I&apos;m away for a month now, missing the kids, finding it difficult and people are trying to make it more difficult. &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love playing here and around the world, and I have a global business. But you do need to pick and choose your events carefully so you can do yourself justice and it&apos;s not getting any easier when it gets to the end of a season and people are telling you where you&apos;ve got to play.&quot; Els and Poulter, like so many at the upper echelon, find themselves with the increasing difficulty of featuring on the more high-profile and wealthy PGA Tour in the United States while maintaining a presence in Europe. The European Tour has recently added an incentive for players to participate in tournaments in their home continent but 13 is the minimum figure for members to retain their card. Co-sanctioned events such as the four World Championships make that figure attainable but there is clearly increasing disquiet over what some players view as unreasonable demands on their time. By Monday lunchtime, the European Tour launched its response to Els. Keith Waters, chief operating officer and director of international policy, said: &quot;The Final Series is a concept which was initiated through discussions with the membership of the European Tour and their input will continue to be important as the Final Series evolves and moves forward, details of which the chief executive George O&apos;Grady will look to unveil on the final Sunday of this year&apos;s DP World Tour Championship. &quot;The current Race to Dubai is building to a thrilling conclusion and with two huge prize funds still to contest, there are over 60 players still with the opportunity of finishing No1 for the 2013 season. &quot;Top-five finishes from Ian Poulter, Graeme McDowell and Justin Rose last week in China saw them all close the gap on Henrik Stenson and we now look ahead to the penultimate tournament of the Final Series this week in Turkey and the season finale next week in Dubai.&quot; In basic terms, the European Tour has to be proactive to fight the continuing talent drain caused by players moving to the United States. Part-replication of the PGA Tour&apos;s FedEx series is at least a start in that regard. The $30m (\u00a319m) on offer in prize monies throughout China, Turkey and Dubai should be a pretty strong incentive to any player. The Tour has had to move away from traditional venues such as Spain because of economic circumstances; it has not only done that, but to impressive financial effect. The European Tour also needs at least some guarantee of player appearances before any tournament can be properly marketed. If scheduling was left completely loose, with the key attractions such as Poulter and Rory McIlroy able to turn up on a whim, sponsors would cite uncertainty as a reason not to be involved. Golfers are not exempt from the burn-out that impedes other sportspeople. Tiger Woods, who will play for a considerable appearance fee in Turkey this week, hinted at concerns over playing pressures at the culmination of the FedEx series. O&apos;Grady&apos;s Dubai address will be intriguing, not only in the sense of what further amendments are made to his Tour&apos;s schedule for 2014, but in how the chief executive responds to discord such as that so vehemently stated by Els.", "tags": ["European Tour", "Ernie Els", "Golf", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-04T16:34:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/05/guardian-weekly-sports-diary-oneill-keane-ashes", "sentences": ["Johnson a major force Dustin \u2013 what a name \u2013 Johnson won the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai, taking the title off the defending champion, Ian Poulter."], "title": "O'Neill keen on second-in-command", "article": "Martin O&apos;Neill, who is close to becoming the Republic of Ireland&apos;s new manager, has decided his Woody Allen impression needs a bad cop and has reportedly identified the perfect calming presence as his No 2: Roy Keane, whose last involvement with the national side saw him storming out of the 2002 World Cup, telling Mick McCarthy to &quot;stick it up his bollocks&quot;.

As dangerously high levels of pollution persist in many areas, the message is clear: national action is more urgent than ever. In September, China&apos;s central government announced its latest major initiative to curb air pollution. The Air Pollution Control Action Plan targets a 25% reduction in particulate matter in the North China Plain and a 65% reduction of coal&apos;s share of the national energy mix by 2017. That plan&apos;s largest mandate prohibits new coal-fired power plants in the three most important metropolitan areas around Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Among the plan&apos;s proposed alternative energy sources are cleaner-burning natural gas plants, including synthetic natural gas (SNG) converted from coal. While SNG can mitigate particulate air pollution, it prompts several other types of concerns. A recent analysis from the World Resources Institute (WRI) assessed SNG&apos;s potential risks. It found that the fuel poses serious implications for China&apos;s water security, livelihoods and climate. Water stress and production WRI overlaid the locations of government-approved SNG plans on the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. As of September 2013, 18 SNG plants were slated for construction, with 75.1bn cubic metres of natural-gas production capacity per year. Our analysis shows that a whopping 75% of the proposed SNG plants will be located in highly water-stressed areas. Each of those locations, therefore, either competes with many other users for limited available water supplies or has very little water available. That is worrying, because the coal-to-natural gas conversion process requires uniquely high volumes of water: six to 10 litres for every cubic metre of SNG. For comparison&apos;s sake, SNG&apos;s water consumption is, on average, 18 times higher than coal. In total, China&apos;s proposed SNG plants, located in arid and semi-arid regions in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, could consume 500m to 700m cubic metres of freshwater annually at full operating capacity. That&apos;s almost 20% of the region&apos;s 2011 industrial water use. Eleven of those 18 thirsty plants will also have to contend with medium-to-high or high seasonal variability risk, or inconsistent water supplies between wet and dry seasons. Adding to the risks, each of those plants is located in catchments that lack major reservoirs. Without a stable supply source in the dry season, these SNG plants might be forced to reduce production capacity or face temporary outages. Consequences of competition SNG&apos;s high overall water consumption, high competition for limited resources, and vulnerability to seasonal supply changes also pose implications for other water users. Inner Mongolia provides an illustrative example. Beijing will be the first city powered by SNG, using at least 4bn cubic metres of gas annually produced in Inner Mongolia under a memorandum of understanding with the government. That much gas would require more than 32bn litres of freshwater to produce, enough to meet the domestic needs of one million Inner Mongolians for an entire year. SNG plants, once constructed, might therefore limit water supplies for herders, farmers, homes and other industrial users around the plants. Fewer particulates, more greenhouse gasses  There are concerns beyond water when it comes to SNG, too. SNG&apos;s total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are substantially higher than other fossil fuels, including coal and oil. Looking across cooking, heating, and power generation, natural gas created from coal produces 36\u2013108% more CO2 emissions than coal(PDF). Rapidly deploying SNG projects might, therefore, be a step backward for China&apos;s low-carbon energy strategy. Collaborative solutions While there is no doubt that China must keep pursuing significant measures to reduce its particulate pollution, the government should be mindful of any solution&apos;s long-term implications. SNG development poses clear water and climate related risks. China&apos;s government would be wise to involve more stakeholders in its energy planning processes, such as its ministries of water and environmental protection. Involving these experts could help put safeguards in place to ensure that air pollution standards don&apos;t come at the expense of water security and low-carbon development. For example, water authorities have valuable policy options at their disposal, such as targeting high-risk areas with stricter local environmental standards and tightening limits on industrial water-withdrawal and pollutant discharge. China is caught in a tricky position, and needs to balance its natural resource constraints with its economic growth. That means staying away from shorter-term, more narrowly focused solutions like SNG. Rather, China should look toward long-term strategies \u2013 such as pursuing more environmentally friendly measures in the Air Pollution Control Action Plan like industrial restructuring and energy efficiency measures. Both can proactively reduce energy demand while avoiding water-intensive projects. After all, water and energy security are critical components of long-term economic growth.

Undercover filming by China Labour Watch and DanWatch reveals a number of apparent breaches of Chinese labour laws at Dell subcontractor Mingshuo Computers, which operates a 156,000m2 factory in Jiangsu province, south of Shanghai. The investigators entered and worked in Factory 6 at Minshuou, which builds computer motherboards for Dell, but the company also supplies other electronics brands including ASUS, Samsung, and Microsoft. Dell is the third biggest PC supplier in the world according to research companies IDC and Gartner, shipping about 9.5m PCs in the most recent quarter. It has recently gone private as it struggles to cope with falling margins in its core markets. The report claims that \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of underage workers are employed by Pegatron, Mingshuo\u2019s parent company, and that over a third of the workers on the floor where the investigator worked were between the ages of 16 and 18. \u201cThey are mostly hired through schools and recruiting agencies. In order to get into the factory, each young person must pay an agency fee between 100 and 500 RMB ($16 and $82). The youngest of the workers had just reached the age of 16 before working. \u201cStudent workers are another source of labor for Pegatron\u2026 [they] enter the factory under the\u00a0auspices of an internship, for which they sign an intern agreement. No social insurance is purchased for student workers for the duration of the internship. Their intern wages are distributed in the same way as other workers\u2019 wages. Student workers usually work 10.5 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a week.\u201d Working 30 days a month The work is segmented into an 8 hour working day, \u201cwith another 2.5 hours of overtime. In the non-peak season, they work 6 days a week and 26 days a month, while in the peak season it is 7 days a week and 30 days a month.\u201d For that, workers are paid 1,370 RMB (\u00a3140) in their first month, rising to 1,520 RMB (\u00a3155) from then on. \u201cOvertime is 11.8 RMB/hour (\u00a31.21) on weekdays and 15.75 RMB/hour (\u00a31.61) on weekends.\u201d But those salaries do not take into account deductions, such as for social insurance \u2013 51.34 RMB (\u00a35.23) a month, even in the first month when employees are unable to claim on the insurance \u2013\u00a0meal deductions (2 RMB or 20p), shuttle bus fares (1 RMB or 10p), and punishments for workplace infractions such as lateness. \u201cBeing 15 minutes late is recorded as an absence, which is penalized by deducting one day\u2019s salary.\u201d As for working conditions, \u201cif the work position requires workers to be sitting, workers are not allowed to stand up. If the position requires workers to be standing, they must stand for\u00a0the entire day. There is no break. If one wants to go to the bathroom or have some water, she needs to find a substitute and cannot leave without a permit. A worker cannot spend more than ten minutes in the bathroom. The group leader will scold workers if they spend too\u00a0much time in the bathroom.\u201d Dell said that it was \u201calready in the process of auditing the suppliers referenced in the report\u201d when it was contacted by DanWatch. \u201cWe share concern about issues in the supply chain and at Dell, we recognize our responsibility, as a global citizen, to build a responsible supply chain,\u201d the company continued. \u201cDell employs high standards for workplace conditions and safety in our facilities and we expect our supplier partners to employ the same high standards. It is also our policy to thoroughly investigate and take appropriate action regarding any reports of poor working conditions in our supply chain. \u201cDell is committed to a responsible supply chain. As with all industries, issues are found during audits and we work with our suppliers to correct these issues.

Mayors are direct democracy. They are cool. They do things and have to account for them. Mayoralty is the perfect outlet for a couple of old fogeys moaning on television that voting isn&apos;t what it used to be. New York has now ended 20 years of Republican mayors and voted in Bill de Blasio. He is not just a Democrat but the sort of Democrat most Europeans thought extinct, a leftwing liberal one. Married to a black former lesbian, he wants to attack homelessness, curb land profiteering and end the police obsession with &quot;stop and frisk&quot;. US mayors have always been populists, reflecting the character and changing moods of their cities. De Blasio follows the charismatic chaos of David Dinkins, the law-and-order discipline of Rudi Giuliani, and Michael Bloomberg&apos;s super-managerialism. New Yorkers remember them and see in them mirrors of themselves. Londoners too have come to appreciate Britain&apos;s limited experiment in such direct democracy: the agitprop mayoralty of Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson&apos;s jokey spin on his grim skyscraperism. Neither has been a particularly good chief executive. They have pandered to London&apos;s financial monoculture and its grand-project lobbyists, neglecting the dull grind of dealing with failures in transport, police and housing. The particular inefficiency of London&apos;s housing market has been left to ministers to tackle, with predictably ham-fisted results. In Bristol, one of the few provincial cities to go for an elected mayor, the incoming George Ferguson found more Bristolians could name London&apos;s mayor than any civic leader of their own, a parody of local democracy. With his red trousers and flamboyance, Ferguson has changed that. The saddest thing about other British cities is that the one thing they seem to crave is an extravagant new train to London to plead for money. Cities are the polities of the future. For the first time more people live in them than outside them. London and New York, after decades of shrinkage, are again growing to a size not seen for half a century. These places are engines of economic growth and social mobility. They are capitals of culture and melting pots of migration. They must grow and mutate or they ossify. To the American urbanist Benjamin Barber, the metropolis is where &quot;creativity is unleashed, community solidified, citizenship realised&quot;. In his new book, If Mayors Ruled the World, he portrays nation states as dysfunctional and increasingly obsolete. He quotes Bloomberg as boasting that modern mayors must be &quot;pragmatists and problem-solvers, not partisans. They get things done after national governments fall short.&quot; Today&apos;s New York has no need of Washington, the Pentagon or state department. It is a de facto city state. British politicians and civil servants love freebies to the US &quot;to see how they do things&quot;. An American friend of mine spent much of his time showing British officials around New York&apos;s police department after its recent success in cutting crime. The one message they never took home was that this was the outcome of a determined mayor with local autonomy. New York could experiment and make its own mistakes. Last week alone, ministers at Westminster found themselves answering to parliament for a hospital&apos;s cancer records, a missing tagged suspect and a free school&apos;s curriculum. They read out answers. No one in New York blames the federal government for hospital emergency departments or rising crime or falling school standards. Distant accountability is no accountability at all. Local services should be the responsibility of someone citizens can see and hear, and can string up from the electoral lamp post every four years. London and half a dozen other British cities have made a halting first step down the road to civic autonomy. Both Tony Blair and David Cameron professed in opposition \u2013 and initially in power \u2013 an enthusiasm for elected mayors. But London&apos;s very success in dynamising its civic politics made reactionary party groups elsewhere turn against the idea. Cameron and his local government minister, Eric Pickles, have proved to be born-again centralists. Yet mayoralty has shown it can galvanise local democracy. Livingstone and Johnson have ushered in an authentic, accessible, populist politics, with a style that seems beyond the imagination of Westminster. Like New Jersey&apos;s Chris Christie, Johnson teeters on the edge of a national political stage, while senior politicians are lining up to succeed him. It is inconceivable that Londoners will want to return to being ruled by a &quot;minister for London&quot;. Barber sees a wider future in which global mayors form a &quot;world parliament&quot; of their own, a security council of New York, London, Moscow, Shanghai, Mumbai and others. To him they would be bolder, more creative and less hidebound than their hinterland states. He wants to release &quot;the polis tucked into the core of the cosmo-polis&quot;. I am not sure this is wise. Cities could be as self-interested as nations. They are successful in part because they are pacifist entities shorn of statist responsibilities. National rulers have traditionally seen their domestic cities as boisterous, corrupt and undisciplined. The diverse coalition of comers and goers, rich and poor, makes them unpredictable and hard to control. That is precisely why they are so pluralistic and vibrant. Modern cities feast on direct election and a mandate distinct from central government. They are ideally suited to the likes of Paxman and Brand.", "tags": ["Mayoral elections", "New York", "US news", "World news", "Society", "Local government", "UK news", "Local politics", "Politics", "Russell Brand", "Culture", "Jeremy Paxman", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-07T19:31:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/08/a-league-what-to-look-out-for-this-weekend", "sentences": ["Last year\u2019s champions Central Coast haven\u2019t been drawing our attention quite like the Western Sydney Wanderers and Melbourne Victory, but they\u2019re undefeated and ticking along quite nicely, especially when you consider they\u2019ve been playing without last season\u2019s A-League golden boot, Daniel McBreen, who\u2019s been out on loan with Shanghai SIPG in the Chinese Super League."], "title": "A-League: what to look out for this weekend", "article": "The Big Blue I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been but until this week I always thought \u2018The Big Blue\u2019 only referred to the 1988 Luc Besson movie about a free diver who, when facing the prospect of spending the rest of his life with Rosanna Arquette, decides a better option would be to swim down to the dark punishing depths of the ocean and never come back. Anyway, turns out The Big Blue also refers to the Sydney FC v Melbourne Victory rivalry, the latest incarnation of which will be held on Saturday in Sydney. But they\u2019re not so different, the movie and the match. Like the movie this week\u2019s game has \u2018performance under pressure\u2019 as a central theme, and that&apos;s particularly applicable for coach Frank Farina and his Sky Blues who are on a three-game losing streak and, at times, playing with all the structure of kids engaged in a lolly scramble. Their challenge will not only be to overcome their own recent frailties but also a slick Victory side who are in wonderful nick and not short of form players in Mitch Nichols, Adama Traore, James Troisi and Kosta Barbarouses. And you\u2019d think Archie Thompson will have his head up after breaking his goal drought last week. But maybe, just maybe, the challenge of their big rivals might be the catalyst that turns Sydney\u2019s season around and, at least for a while, scatters the vultures currently describing slow circles above Farina\u2019s head. Alessandro Del Piero should make a difference on his return and the crowd\u2019s keenness to get one over the Melburnians should also provide the local team impetus. It could be closer than the form guide suggests. Will McBreen have sheen? Last year\u2019s champions Central Coast haven\u2019t been drawing our attention quite like the Western Sydney Wanderers and Melbourne Victory, but they\u2019re undefeated and ticking along quite nicely, especially when you consider they\u2019ve been playing without last season\u2019s A-League golden boot, Daniel McBreen, who\u2019s been out on loan with Shanghai SIPG in the Chinese Super League. But in good news for the Mariners \u2014news which goes some way to counter this week\u2019s absence of Storm Roux and Michael McGlinchey who are in camp with New Zealand ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against Mexico\u2014 McBreen is back and in Graham Arnold\u2019s 18-man squad for their juicy Sunday match-up against the Brisbane Roar. Considering he has Mitchell Duke, Matt Simon and Marcos Flores at his disposal, Arnold may just give McBreen a cameo but it will be interesting to see how sharp he looks (or, conversely, how tired\u2026 McBreen hasn\u2019t had an off-season) and if there are any signs the 36-year-old might be capable of matching his exploits last year, which took many by surprise. Aside from having McBreen in his quiver, Arnold will be hoping for a better start from his team. Twice in the past three matches they\u2019ve found themselves down 2-0. They fought back for 2-2 draws on both occasions but Brisbane, you feel, are not the sort of side to blow such a cushion. Adelaide\u2019s long and winding road It\u2019s hard to comprehend how big a job it is to impart a new style or system on a football team. Many would think all it takes is half a dozen training sessions, some whiteboard tutorials and the judicious meting out of rewards, like sardines and tummy rubs, when players get things right (well, it works for dolphins, and they\u2019re smarter than many footballers). But as Adelaide\u2019s Bruce Djite pointed out on Fox Sports on the weekend, it\u2019s a much bigger job than that. New Adelaide coach Josep Gombau, he said, began his regime in pre-season by taking the team back to basics. And not just tactically, said Djite, who\u2019s close to first team action after a serious ankle injury. Gombau was instructing them on real basics, like how to pass, how to position the body for a header, and so on. This speaks of a meticulous approach at the same time it indicates just how much work Gombau believes is involved. So Adelaide fans impatiently waiting for their team to turn into Barcelona (or at least Swansea) should keep that in mind. That said, Saturday\u2019s home match against Newcastle \u2014who\u2019ve named Emile Heskey\u2014 provides United a great opportunity to break their run of successive losses (albeit by one-goal margins against last season\u2019s grand finalists) and collect a second win of the year. If Marcelo Carrusca carries through last week\u2019s form and finds that the likes of Isaias and Jeronimo are in step, you\u2019d have to tip a win for United. All eyes on the referees\u2026 and Polenz While it doesn\u2019t change the consequences of the officiating mistakes that were made on the weekend it was pleasing to see the public confession from A-League referees director Ben Wilson on Monday. In an attempt at transparency, and possibly a pre-emptive strike in the event any Sydney fans were at Bunnings sourcing pitchforks ahead of a march on the FFA, Wilson conceded four errors were made by his referees, one of which may have ongoing ramifications for Western Sydney. The Wanderers\u2019 full-back, Jerome Polenz, he said, should have been given a second yellow (and thus sent off) for his eye-watering challenge on Adelaide midfielder Awer Mabil on Friday night. For that matter, Wilson suggested, Polenz should have been sent off the previous week too for a similarly unsavoury tackle on Sydney\u2019s Richard Garcia. Sure, Tony Popovich did the expected and came out in support of Polenz saying the full-back was not that kind of player (I can\u2019t be sure but I think the \u201cit\u2019s not his go\u201d defence was first uttered by supporters of Attila the Hun back in the 400s and has been in constant employment ever since), but now you\u2019d have to figure Polenz\u2019s card is marked. And when that happens there\u2019s always the chance that human nature takes over and referees start to judge him on reputation as much as anything else. So against the Heart on Friday Polenz should ensure his headband is not on too tight and to keep his studs to himself. The referees, meantime, will be striving to get through the weekend without having the word \u201chowler\u201d attached to their adjudications. Who\u2019s feeling lucky? It was widely opined that strugglers Melbourne Heart were a little unlucky last weekend for taking it to Brisbane away from home, fashioning chances, yet still coming away 3-0 losers. But how much did luck, or an absence of it, have to do with the loss? Was it just bad luck that caused the Heart to get only three of their 14 shots on target (whereas Brisbane managed seven of 11), or allowed Henrique to cushion Luke Brattan\u2019s cute cross on his chest, fire the ball home for Roar\u2019s first, then pen a letter, longhand, to his great aunt in Sao Paulo, before finally being sighted by the Heart defenders? As encouraging as he was about his team\u2019s performance (taking positive thinking to a whole new level, Heart coach John Aloisi said he was \u201creally happy with the boys\u201d) Aloisi will know his team lost because they wasted good field position and scoring chances and failed to shut down the Roar\u2019s midfield. Now they have to deal with a Wanderers team exuding confidence and menace, and buoyed by the return of talisman Youssouf Hersi on the right flank. The Heart, meantime, will again be without central defender Patrick Kisnorbo, whose absence was telling against the Roar. They\u2019ll also have to do without Harry Kewell who\u2019s so adept at getting injured he didn\u2019t even have to wait until his next match to do it. But all is not lost for the Heart. They\u2019re at home. Considering their away record they can count themselves lucky.

Since 2003, Tennis Australia has been marketing the major as the Grand Slam of the Asia-Pacific in a bid to grow its popularity in the region and increase profitability. But as uptake of tennis in China snowballs and the nation\u2019s economic and political power swells, calls for a Grand Slam of its own are strengthening. The Grand Slam of Asia-Pacific tagline aims to keep the Australian Open relevant in a global context but a growing school of thought believes Asia has the right, not to mention the funds and facilities, to host the Asia-Pacific major. \u201cI know [The Australian Open] markets itself as the Grand Slam of the Asia-Pacific, but I don\u2019t really get the Asia part,\u201d says Michael Luevano, tournament director of the Shanghai Rolex Masters. \u201cAre you really Asia? You\u2019re Australia. You are your own entity.\u201d Commercially the stance makes perfect sense for Tennis Australia. More than half the Australian Open\u2019s global media value is now generated in Asia, and 55% of the total global broadcast audience now hails from the Asia-Pacific. While spectators from Asia still only made up 15% of the Open\u2019s total visitors in 2012, the numbers have more than doubled since 2004.\u00a0It\u2019s therefore in Australia\u2019s interest to promote the tournament in the People\u2019s Republic and support the sport\u2019s growth. As such, these efforts are intensifying. Last month Tennis Australia conducted its third annual trophy tour of Asia, showcasing Australian tennis stars and their Australian Open trophies in seven major cities in China, as well as Seoul and Singapore. \u201cThe key [goal] is to build participation. Growing the sport of tennis, increasing participation and really trying to build an Asian champion,\u201d Australian doubles legend Todd Woodbridge told The Guardian during the trophy tour\u2019s stopover in Mong Kok, Hong Kong.\u00a0\u201cObviously we want Australians to win the Australian Open, but we recognise how important it is for the tournament to be successful as well.\u201d Once a bastion of western tradition, tennis is now China\u2019s newest sporting obsession, both at amateur and professional levels. The nation\u2019s interest in the sport has been growing exponentially since tennis became an Olympic sport at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. But the biggest acceleration came when Li Na triumphed at the 2011 French Open to become the first Asian to win a Grand Slam. \u201cTo have a homegrown local really changed the whole game,\u201d says Woodbridge, who played in the era of American-born Chinese Michael Chang. \u201cIf you look at the commercial value of what Chang achieved compared to Na, it\u2019s another stratosphere.\u201d     Novak Djokovic of Serbia at the Shanghai Rolex Masters. Photograph: XI YA/EPA    While tennis currently ranks as the seventh most popular participation sport in the People\u2019s Republic, it\u2019s the number one \u201caspiration sport\u201d, according to research from The Shanghai Rolex Masters.\u00a0Aspiration is now the hallmark of China\u2019s newly affluent, swelling middle class. The long-standing tradition associated with tennis, the upstanding profiles of its super-star players, and the exceedingly large winners\u2019 purses all feed its reputation as a sport of the elite. \u201cYoung professionals, if they play a sport, are going to choose an upwardly mobile sport like tennis,\u201d said Luevano. For a population that leads the world in other racquet sports, tennis is also the natural next step. The Chinese boast the best table tennis and badminton players in the world, so it\u2019s foreseeable the country might one day be a powerhouse of top 10 tennis players, despite the fact that there is still no Chinese male in the top 50. Furthermore, tennis has fast become \u201cthe sport of the government\u201d, says Luevano. All China\u2019s key officials now play, and this support is evidenced on a grander stage by hundreds of millions of dollars worth of government investment in tennis facilities and development programs around the country. While the Chinese Tennis Association would not share its own statistics, the WTA tour estimates there are more than 30,000 tennis courts around China, almost all of which have been built in the last decade. The majority of new housing complexes in tier one and tier two cities now include tennis courts as standard, and China\u2019s state television service CCTV reports tennis is the third most watched sport, after football and basketball. Tennis was officially added to the public school system two years ago \u2013 a direct initiative to boost China\u2019s aptitude for tennis at an amateur level. But investment at a professional level has been astronomical. Shanghai\u2019s bid for the Masters Cup in 2004 was predicated by the city\u2019s pledge to building the world\u2019s foremost venue to host the event. The resulting Qizhong Stadium cost the Chinese government upwards of US$300m in infrastructure and facilities. The China Open launched in Beijing in 2004 with a similarly spectacular facility. The China National Tennis Center features 11 courts, a 15,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof, \u201cspace-age\u201d air-cooling technology according to the WTA tour and, in 2006, became the first tournament outside the United States to implement Hawk-Eye electronic line calling. Its prize money totals US$7.5 million this year - seven times the 2004 offer. Last year&apos;s event lured 270,464 spectators, which is well shy of the Australian Open\u2019s 685,00, but phenomenal growth considering the tournament has only existed for nine years. It\u2019s no great surprise then that China\u2019s tournaments are winning praise from the world\u2019s top seeds. The Shanghai Rolex Masters, for example, was voted by players as the ATP Masters 1000 Tournament of the Year in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. \u201cWe started from zero and installed a mentality of being as hospitable as a hotel,\u201d said Luevano. \u201cWe were service-oriented, and what the Chinese know how to do extremely well is host people. \u201cOur philosophy is that if you are going to make this trip to Asia you have to be made comfortable and have absolutely everything you could possibly want at the venue, and I think we\u2019ve achieved that.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt that the nation is doing everything in its power to become the centre of Asian tennis. It has even begun cannibalising surrounding tournaments. The Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Japan, which celebrated its 30th edition this year, has been struck from the calendar to make room for what will be a fifth Chinese tournament in Wuhan in 2014. As China assumes an increasingly central place in world affairs, government and corporate funding of tennis soars, and it produces more players in the top 50, it\u2019s foreseeable the Dragon will seek to claim logical ownership of the \u2018Asia-Pacific\u2019 major.     Li Na celebrates her victory over Caroline Wozniacki at the Australian Open. Photograph: Petar Kujundzic/Reuters    Back in 2008 China\u2019s current tennis idol Li declared the January Grand Slam should be moved to Shanghai, citing better climate. Woodbridge thinks that\u2019s off the cards. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he told The Guardian. \u201cThe government has invested heavily in the sport and the precinct of Melbourne Park to make sure the Australian Open stays. In 2014 and 2015 we\u2019ll have three courts with roofs on them. Asia though, by 2030 they\u2019ll be putting pressure on.\u201d While Woodbridge believes it\u2019s unlikely the fourth Grand Slam will shift north, China is certainly pushing to host a fifth.\u00a0\u201cYou cannot buy into tradition, you cannot buy a Wimbledon,\u201d said Luevano. \u201cBut I think we [China] can be the fifth major, no question. Shanghai is headed in that direction to become a fifth major event.\u201d China Open tournament director Alfred Zhang also openly declared that the Beijing tournament aimed to one day become the fifth Grand Slam when it debuted in 2004.\u00a0&quot;It might be an unrealistic goal in the near future, but it should be the direction we are supposed to go,&quot; Zhang recently told the China Daily. It\u2019s possible that a Chinese Grand Slam might bolster interest in the sport more generally throughout the region, enhancing the relevance of the Australian Open.\u00a0But would the global tennis and corporate community really support two Asia-Pacific majors? A Chinese major may foreseeably wipe the gloss off, and swipe sponsorship dollars from, its competitor down under. How this situation plays out in years to come is anyone\u2019s guess. Perhaps clever marketing will succeed in differentiating the events to the extent that two regional majors can prosper. Perhaps tradition will buckle to economic brawn. One thing is certain. As China and Australia each vie to be the tennis champion of the Asia-Pacific, the geo-political game is sure to get as heated as the one on the court.\u00a0", "tags": ["Australian Open", "Tennis", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-08T03:53:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/08/allan-mcnish-world-endurance-championship", "sentences": ["Britain&apos;s Allan McNish qualified in fourth position before the penultimate round of the World Endurance Championship (WEC) in Shanghai on Friday and, although the driver was disappointed, he knows it is the exact position he must claim in the race in order to secure the drivers&apos; championship in China on Saturday.", "It is only the second time the Toyota drivers and team have been on pole this season, having claimed the top spot at the season opener at Silverstone, although they have form at the Shanghai International Circuit, with Wurz and Lapierre taking pole and winning here last year.", "&quot;It was a tough day and we have a fight on our hands,&quot; said McNish who finished second at Shanghai last year.", "In second practice our car didn&apos;t run at full capacity and that possibly affected our performance in qualifying.&quot; The Shanghai International Circuit is hard on tyres on the prototype cars and degradation is likely to be high, suggesting that strategy as well as raw pace may be key to his attempt to become world champion on Saturday."], "title": "Allan McNish on track to win World Endurance Championship", "article": "Britain&apos;s Allan McNish qualified in fourth position before the penultimate round of the World Endurance Championship (WEC) in Shanghai on Friday and, although the driver was disappointed, he knows it is the exact position he must claim in the race in order to secure the drivers&apos; championship in China on Saturday. If he does so, he will be the first British sportscar world champion since Derek Warwick won the title in 1992. Pole was taken by the No7 Toyota of Alex Wurz and Nicolas Lapierre, who set the fastest four-lap average time of 1min 48.013sec. The No2 Audi of McNish, Tom Kristensen and Lo\u00efc Duval had set the quickest time in first practice in the morning and the sister No1 car of Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler dominated the second session, although their fastest time was ultimately disallowed. But when it counted neither could match the time set by the No7 car at this truncated race weekend that is taking place over two days. It is only the second time the Toyota drivers and team have been on pole this season, having claimed the top spot at the season opener at Silverstone, although they have form at the Shanghai International Circuit, with Wurz and Lapierre taking pole and winning here last year. They were quicker than F\u00e4ssler and Tr\u00e9luyer by only eight hundredths of a second, with Tr\u00e9luyer heading out at the end in an attempt to bag pole that was not quite enough.

But the Chinese public will not know what the future holds until their leaders&apos; closed-door meeting concludes on Tuesday. In truth, they may not really find out for years, say experts. The conclave which begins in a Beijing hotel on Saturday \u2013 the third gathering of the Communist party&apos;s top brass since Xi Jinping took power almost a year ago \u2013 will establish the direction for the world&apos;s second largest economy. Yu Zhengsheng, a senior leader, has pledged that the meeting of the central committee will set out &quot;unprecedented&quot; reforms. State news agency Xinhua said it would &quot;unleash China&apos;s new round of reform, which is expected to steer the country into an historic turning point&quot;. Such talk has encouraged speculation about substantial economic and financial reforms and even comparisons with the third plenum of 1978 \u2013 when Deng Xiaoping closed the door on Maoism and set China on its current course. Ever since, third plenums have been regarded as particularly significant. Another of the meetings, in 1993, ushered in major reforms to state owned enterprises (SOEs). On Tuesday, Xinhua will issue a dispatch as the meeting closes, giving the first indication of the leadership&apos;s plans. &quot;What&apos;s going to come out is a political communique that does not have significant details about how they are going to implement it,&quot; said Damien Ma, a fellow at the Paulson Institute. Rather, it is designed to set out a clear direction and create some momentum, wrote Barry Naughton of the University of California, San Diego on the Asia Society&apos;s China File website. Few doubt the need for drastic changes. While China&apos;s economic boom has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, few believe the current course of development is sustainable. Growth is slowing, inequality has soared and issues such as pollution and corruption have led to increasing resentment. Reformers hope that the plenum will signal progress not only on financial liberalisation, but also on land reform, changes to the household registration system that limits the welfare rights of rural migrants living in cities, and possibly the curbing of powerful SOEs. The problem is that implementation will be challenged by those who have prospered in the current system, noted Feng Chongyi, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Technology, Sydney. &quot;The Chinese know that the current system is &apos;power-elite capitalism&apos; or &apos;party-state capitalism&apos;. They talk about good things, but good reforms will be disturbed to serve the interests of that narrow interest group,&quot; he warned. &quot;Financial reforms are relatively easy ... [issues like curbing SOEs] are very difficult even within the party,&quot; said Tao Ran, director of the Centre for Economics and Governance at Renmin University. But Ma noted: &quot;You have to combine the communique with what is expected [in terms of] a more comprehensive plan on tackling corruption. I think its an open secret that those are intimately linked.&quot; The clean-up campaign &quot;is a way to get rid of what everyone talks about: these vague, abstract &apos;vested interests&apos;&quot;, he said. He suggested that references to 1978 were germane because it suggested using pilot schemes to incubate reforms, as in the eighties. The recent low-key launch of the Shanghai free-trade zone makes some sceptical about how much energy the leadership will put behind such initiatives. While it was initially lauded as a major development, details remain unclear and premier Li Keqiang did not attend the opening ceremony. Kerry Brown, executive director of the China Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, noted that while 1978 is now universally recognised as a turning point, many of the early changes were incremental and began at the grassroots. &quot;The problem with this kind of plenum is that it&apos;s not seen as being historically important until years after it has happened,&quot; he argued. Cheng Li and Ryan McElveen of the Brookings Institution wrote this week that pessimism was sensible but argued that the leadership had a real sense of urgency and a collective understanding of the need for &quot;big, bold and broad&quot; reforms to gain public support. &quot;Will President Xi and his team prove the pessimists wrong at the Third Plenum?

On the evidence of her new novel, the attempt\u00a0didn&apos;t last. The book has\u00a0not just one problematic mother-daughter configuration, but three, each\u00a0one marked by her other recurring themes: Chinese-American identity; the Chinese oppression of women; abandonment and the search for love.\u00a0For fans of Tan&apos;s early works, this may be a welcome reprise. For others, it might sometimes feel like a\u00a0revisiting too far. Amy Tan is an American writer of Chinese origin. The larger relationship between China and the US\u00a0is an emotional one that seems to oscillate between mutual demonising and mutual romanticising, with an underside of reciprocal racial and cultural prejudice. If it is like that between two\u00a0huge nations, Tan leaves us in no doubt that the effects at\u00a0an individual level are no less\u00a0complicated. The heroine of The Valley of Amazement, Violet, is the daughter of\u00a0an American madam and a painter. As\u00a0a child in her mother&apos;s upmarket Shanghai brothel in the early years of\u00a0the 20th century, Violet assumes herself to be American, a status she considers superior to the courtesans and servants who surround her. It\u00a0comes as a shock, therefore, to discover that her absent father is Chinese. When her mother later sails to\u00a0the US in search of a lost son, she is\u00a0tricked into leaving Violet behind. It\u00a0comes as no surprise to find our heroine has in turn been sold into the\u00a0life of\u00a0a\u00a0courtesan. Tan&apos;s favoured locations of California and Shanghai are revisited here. Shanghai itself is a hybrid city \u2013 a\u00a0foreign enclave in China. There is a side trip two-thirds of the way through the novel to a\u00a0village 300 miles inland, an excursion into undiluted China, but it is more a\u00a0nightmare to escape from than a location to remember. The bulk of the narrative is divided between the\u00a0west coast of the US and east coast of China, two geographies and two cultures between which the characters travel in search of themselves, and the missing parts of their own biographies. Lucia, Violet&apos;s mother, had set up her cross-cultural courtesan house after she was abandoned by her Chinese lover, whom she met in California and followed to China. Once in Shanghai she found, as she had been forewarned, that a pregnant American woman was not considered a possible bride for the eldest son of a traditional Chinese family. True to Tan&apos;s customary themes, Lucia and Violet&apos;s relationship is fraught, though not as fraught as Lucia&apos;s relationship with her own mother had\u00a0been. Both Lucia and Violet rely heavily on the support of a\u00a0Chinese female friend who interprets the local culture and teaches each in\u00a0turn how to do business in it. In Violet&apos;s case, the close companion is Magic Gourd, who was a courtesan in\u00a0Lucia&apos;s establishment until she was\u00a0dismissed, in one of the novel&apos;s minor\u00a0quirks, because of her close relationship with\u00a0a dead poet. Female friendships have room to thrive here, not least because of the high mortality rate among the men. The reader learns about the life of a\u00a0courtesan in Shanghai in the early 20th\u00a0century, largely through a long monologue in which Magic Gourd lays out what awaits the 14-year-old Violet, and plans how the two of them can maximise the returns on what will, by\u00a0its nature, be a short career. Tan has used the implausibly long monologue before, as a means of delivering necessary information or laying out a\u00a0plotline. This one is not without interesting detail, though readers of Arthur Golden&apos;s 1997 novel, Memoirs of\u00a0a Geisha, which was set in Japan&apos;s courtesan culture, will find some of it\u00a0familiar. The disadvantage of this technique is that it does little to sustain the reader&apos;s engagement with the character. Indeed, the characters in this novel retain a certain detachment from each other, and from the reader. Many are in\u00a0search of what one calls &quot;pure self being&quot;, without necessarily convincing the reader that the quest will be fruitful. Violet&apos;s narrative tells us as much as we need to know about the conflict of identities she embodies, also played out in different forms through other characters. As a young courtesan, she assumes a Chinese identity and her early clients are Chinese; she marries an American, but\u00a0is as unacceptable to his family as her mother had been to her Chinese lover&apos;s\u00a0family. The novel&apos;s title is taken from a series of paintings produced by Violet&apos;s artist father and serves as the imagined place of fulfilment for both mother and daughter. Each has to learn that the image is an illusion and be reconciled to the difficulties of seeking, maintaining and losing love instead. At times Tan skates perilously close to the thin emotional ice of a Mills &amp; Boon, with the narrative of lost love and\u00a0lost children, but she is too astute a\u00a0writer to fall through entirely. She is\u00a0a\u00a0brisk storyteller, and despite its flaws, The Valley of Amazement packs in enough drama to keep her readers going to the end.", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-09T09:00:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/09/world-endurance-championship", "sentences": ["After a storming season in the World Endurance Championship, with three wins and three second places from six races, blotting the copy book with a third here in Shanghai will matter not one jot to Audi&apos;s Allan McNish and fellow drivers Tom Kristensen and Lo\u00efc Duval.", "Yet, when the serious business on track here at the Shanghai International Circuit began, the early race-pace of the Toyotas suggested that neither his Audi nor Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler in the sister No1 car would be able to challenge for either of the two top spots."], "title": "Allan McNish and Audi claim World Endurance Championship in Shanghai", "article": "After a storming season in the World Endurance Championship, with three wins and three second places from six races, blotting the copy book with a third here in Shanghai will matter not one jot to Audi&apos;s Allan McNish and fellow drivers Tom Kristensen and Lo\u00efc Duval.

However, as is often the case over the course of a six-hour race, nothing can be assured until the chequered flag is waved. Indeed, by the end it was last year&apos;s drivers&apos; champions in the No1 car that took the win. With the track coming to the Audi R18 on fresher rubber, they had enough extra pace in the last 30 minutes to pass the leading No7 Toyota of Alex Wurz and Nicolas Lapierre, who had lost time due to a puncture, and claim victory by just under 16 seconds after 190 laps. It was a magnificent comeback drive after the Audi had been forced to pit early when debris also caused a puncture early in the race. A possible three-way fight to the finish was denied the 28,000 Chinese fans in attendance when the second Toyota of Anthony Davidson, St\u00e9phane Sarrazin and S\u00e9bastien Buemi, who, with 90 minutes to go were leading, suffered suspension damage putting them out on lap 143, allowing McNish to bring the Audi home one lap behind the leaders to clinch third and the title. &quot;We came here with a very clear job to do and did what we had to do,&quot; he said, while acknowledging that they had played the percentages to ensure the win. &quot;We were totally risk adverse today, just to gain the position we needed to put it in the bag.

There were victories in the opener at Silverstone and in Texas at the Circuit of the Americas but most importantly there was also a win at Le Mans, where McNish, as Warwick did in 1992, won the sport&apos;s blue riband event the same year as taking the title. All three drivers were understandable jubilant, but while with Duval the junior partner of the three, it was of most import to McNish and Kristensen. Neither the British driver, who has won Le Mans on three occasions, nor Kristensen, who has won racing&apos;s ultimate test an extraordinary nine times, have held a world title, although both have been at the top of sportscar racing for over a decade. &quot;Crossing the line was very emotional,&quot; said McNish, who drove the final stint and was still taking in his achievement in the immediate aftermath of the race. &quot;It is the cherry on the top of the career cake.&quot;", "tags": ["Motor sport", "World Endurance Championship", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-09T23:17:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/10/sport-in-brief", "sentences": ["McNish champion at last after podium finish A third-place finish in Shanghai will matter not one jot to Audi&apos;s Allan McNish and fellow drivers Tom Kristensen and Lo\u00efc Duval, since it was still enough for them to claim the drivers&apos; the World Endurance Championship with one race to go."], "title": "Sports news in brief", "article": "McNish champion at last after podium finish A third-place finish in Shanghai will matter not one jot to Audi&apos;s Allan McNish and fellow drivers Tom Kristensen and Lo\u00efc Duval, since it was still enough for them to claim the drivers&apos; the World Endurance Championship with one race to go. &quot;I have been waiting to win a world championship since 1985,&quot; said McNish after a storming season with three wins and three second places from six races. &quot;I&apos;ve had three cracks at a world title \u2013 in karting I finished third at Le Mans, that hurt because it was very close, but then in Formula One there wasn&apos;t really an opportunity, to crack it, so it&apos;s third time lucky.

Her bestselling debut novel, 1989&apos;s The Joy Luck Club (made into a film by Wayne Wang), was based on the stories of her mother, Daisy, and her circle of Chinese immigrant friends. Tan has written five novels including The Kitchen God&apos;s Wife and The Bonesetter&apos;s Daughter, a memoir and two children&apos;s books. Set in Shanghai in 1905, her new novel, The Valley of Amazement, is her first book in eight years. Why did the new book take so long? I had started another book but then I came across a photograph of my grandmother and it was quite a shocking revelation. I went to an exhibition at San Francisco&apos;s Asian Art Museum about Shanghai, about how courtesans had been influential in bringing western culture to Shanghai. I bought a book and in it saw this striking group of women in a photograph called The Ten Beauties of Shanghai. They were all wearing an outfit identical to the one my grandmother wears in my favourite photo of her. The fashion detail of the costume was specific to courtesans. And so I began imagining what if it was true? How would she have made her way in this world? What circumstances shaped my grandmother&apos;s life, her attitudes, her beliefs? What did she pass on to my mother, which she then passed on to me? You&apos;d already written The Bonesetter&apos;s Daughter to give a voice to your grandmother, who was forced into concubinage as a young widow and committed suicide. Was this the final part of the jigsaw? There were inconsistencies in my grandmother&apos;s story that I missed at the time. But now I see contradictions as clues. And I had to laugh because I thought I&apos;d used everything out there. But I&apos;ve found that wherever there is ambiguity in my life, a story lies. Writing this book I&apos;ve realised how much abandonment and betrayal happens in immigrant families. My mother left behind three daughters when she went to America and started a new life. I certainly felt abandoned when my father died of a brain tumour; I felt he had abandoned me to this terrible, volatile mother and I had no protection. Today I understand why my mother might have been raised to despise condescension. I too have a very sensitive radar for people who are being &quot;nice&quot; in a false way. I recognise why I have such a strong inability to forgive certain people who betray me. It&apos;s chiselled in, like a name on a tomb stone. You compare the top courtesans to rock\u00a0stars\u2026 I admired the way they developed the skills to negotiate for their own lives. They were imaginative about making themselves stand out in terms of fashion and furnishings. The equivalent today would be someone like Lady Gaga who needs continually to come up with something new. Young girls would be swooning over the fashions and want to copy them. There&apos;s a phrase from that time, Yankee ingenuity, and they had Shanghai ingenuity. Today you see women in Shanghai forging ahead with billion-dollar companies. My friends and I laugh and say we are descended from incredibly fierce women. And yet the stories of courtesans often include kidnapping, or being sold by poor families? That freedom was short-lived once they became a concubine; or if they lost their looks. Some of the most celebrated courtesans ended up as streetwalkers. At the same time I was imagining the lives of girls today. Sex slavery is among the top five of the world&apos;s greatest problems, along with poverty, lack of education and global warming. How did you immerse yourself in 1905 China? I read academic books on courtesan culture at the turn-of-the century in Shanghai such as Gail Hershatter&apos;s The Gender of Memory. The diaries were mostly in the form of letters from courtesans to a lover who had disappeared, or taken their savings. You knew they were going to lead horrible, terrible lives because they had lost whatever money was going into their retirement or would pay for new dresses to keep them desirable. In the second half of the book, your heroine, Violet, is tricked into leaving the courtesan house for the desolate Moon Pond village. Is it based on a real location? I went to two places for that setting \u2013 one was one of the poorest, most remote villages in China, high in the mountains: a 12-hour van ride over terrible roads.

The low-price fashion retailer posted a return to the black with half-year profits to the end of September of \u00a313.8m, compared with a loss of \u00a313.6m a year ago. The company said it added more fashionable products, reduced discounting and tempted shoppers to buy more expensive items. A 78.8% rise in online sales helped deliver a 6% increase in revenues to \u00a3753.2m with underlying sales in the UK up 2.6%. The company said fur-lined parkas, oversized &quot;boyfriend&quot; coats and boots of all kinds were currently driving sales. But Anders Kristiansen, New Look&apos;s chief executive, said trading had been difficult since September as the benefits of the economic recovery were not being fed through to customers. A warm autumn was also hitting sales. &quot;It&apos;s pretty tough out there,&quot; he said. In that environment, Kristiansen said New Look would not seek to raise money via the stock market for at least a year, despite a new appetite for retail stocks. Bonmarch\u00e9 and Poundland are expected to follow the example of Wine Rack owner Conviviality Retail with London listings in the next few months. &quot;At the moment we are focused on executing our strategy and we need to continue to deliver that.

This is billionaires having fun. Art, essentially, has become the accepted elevating hobby of the super-rich. It&apos;s a lot more sophisticated than a yacht.&quot; On Tuesday, Three Studies of Lucian Freud, a 1969 triptych by Francis Bacon, sold at Christie&apos;s after a furious six-minute bidding war for $142.4m, some $20m more than the previous record for a work of art at auction, achieved by Edvard Munch&apos;s The Scream at Sotheby&apos;s last year. The same sale saw a Jeff Koons sculpture, Balloon Dog, change hands for $58.4m \u2013 $20m more than anyone has ever paid before at auction for a work by a living artist \u2013 and set further world auction records for another eight artists, including Willem de Kooning and Lucio Fontana. In all, three works sold for more than $50m, 16 for more than $10m and 56 for more than $1m. On Wednesday, Sotheby&apos;s set new world auction records for seven more artists, including Cy Twombly and Andy Warhol, whose 1963 painting Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), consisting of two panels depicting the aftermath of a car crash, fetched $105m, smashing the previous auction record for a Warhol \u2013 set in 2007 \u2013 by more than $30m. Gerlis said the prices being paid for top works were being driven largely by new and generally anonymous buyers, particularly from Asia, the Middle East and Russia. These, said Gerlis, were &quot;the top 1% of the top 1%, for whom austerity has clearly never hit. But this has no rational investment basis whatsoever. Other assets are just a bit boring&quot;. Some more traditional artworld members plainly do not appreciate the avalanche of new money. &quot;I&apos;m an art collector,&quot; the former Hollywood agent turned Silicon Valley dealmaker Michael Ovitz said after the Sotheby&apos;s sale. &quot;This is not about collecting. For a moment last night I thought I was in the commodities market.&quot; Although the buyers of some works, such as the Bacon triptych, were identified as New York galleries, Gerlis said it would &quot;not be them paying with their own money. Goodness knows who the actual buyer is&quot;. In the auction house reports, buyers are described as &quot;international trade&quot;, &quot;anonymous&quot;, &quot;Asian trade&quot; or simply &quot;US private&quot;. Dealers and market insiders have also said that, besides billionaires trophy-hunting for their private vanity museums, a rash of new and often state-backed museums across China and the Gulf states \u2013 particularly Qatar \u2013 have contributed to the surge. Matthew Paton at Christie&apos;s insisted it was not just the very top end of the market that was booming. Sales of all works at the 250-year-old auction house surged by 10% last year to nearly $6.3bn, helped by nearly 700 works that fetched more than $1m and 50 that went for more than $10m. This year&apos;s figures are 9% up on last year. &quot;It is the monster, ginormous sales that make all the headlines,&quot; Paton said. &quot;And it is extraordinary when you think about it: there were six people bidding more than $100m for the Bacon on Tuesday night. We&apos;ve also seen an enormous increase in the depth of people wanting to buy at above $20m.&quot; According to Paton, Christie&apos;s is seeing a growing global demand for art at all price levels. The market is expanding geographically: auctions are being hosted for the first time in Shanghai and Mumbai, and the number of Asian buyers soared by 15% last year. But new, more modest buyers are also making their presence felt at the traditional venues. At recent auctions of works under $100,000, Paton said, more than 50% of purchasers were first-time buyers, while online-only auctions also attract more than 40% novices.", "tags": ["Art", "The art market", "Francis Bacon", "Lucian Freud", "Andy Warhol", "Investments", "Money", "Rich lists"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-14T18:26:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/15/angry-birds-promotes-china-rovio-executive", "sentences": ["We are one of the biggest exporters and promoters of Chinese culture on the planet.&quot; Rovio&apos;s first office outside its Finnish headquarters in Helsinki was in Shanghai, and China now accounts for &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; of downloads, Vesterbacka said."], "title": "Angry Birds' eyes fixed on China, says Rovio exec", "article": "The company behind the hit game Angry Birds has criticised &quot;insulting&quot; attempts by western companies to crack the Chinese market by using the cliches of &quot;kung fu and pandas&quot;.

The decision means that only 22 countries in the world now recognise Taiwan, which China regards as part of its territory. They are mostly small and struggling economies in Latin America, the Caribbean and the south Pacific. Gambia&apos;s surprise move was apparently a personal decision by President Yahya Jammeh, one of Africa&apos;s most autocratic and idiosyncratic rulers, who last month also announced that Gambia had quit the Commonwealth. Jammeh&apos;s office said: &quot;This decision has been taken in our strategic national interest. We are proud that we have been a very strong and reliable partner of the Republic of China [Taiwan] for the past 18 years, the results of which are there for every Taiwanese to see.&quot; The statement added: &quot;Despite the end of diplomatic ties with Taiwan, we will still remain friends with the people of Taiwan.&quot; Taiwan expressed dismay at the announcement. &quot;Our government express shock and regret that Gambian president Yahya Jammeh sent a letter to our embassy in Gambia on 14 November to inform us [of] the immediate termination of ties,&quot; THE vice-foreign minister, Simon Ko, said in Taipei. &quot;We think this is Jammeh&apos;s personal decision.&quot; China&apos;s foreign ministry said it had no contact with authorities in Gambia and declined to say if it had now established formal ties with the west African state. Spokesman Hong Lei told a press conference: &quot;We learned about this from the foreign media. China has had no contact with Gambia ahead of this.&quot; China and Taiwan have been governed separately since the communists won China&apos;s civil war in 1949. The nationalists fled across a 110 mile-wide strait to Taiwan. The two sides then competed hard to win diplomatic allies, frequently offering monetary incentives. China still insists that Taiwan has no right to recognition but there has been an unofficial diplomatic truce since the signing of trade and economic agreements in 2008. Most African countries recognised the Taipei government initially but their number has steadily shrunk and the continent has seen massive Chinese investment. Five years ago, Malawi announced that it had switched allegiance to Beijing, reportedly after being offered several billions dollars in aid as an incentive. Since then Chinese contractors have built Malawi&apos;s parliament building, national conference centre, presidential villas, school and university buildings, a five-star hotel and miles of road. Swaziland, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and Burkina Faso are Taiwan&apos;s only remaining diplomatic allies in Africa. But S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe announced this week that China planned to open a trade mission to promote projects there, though they did not indicate whether this would affect diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Swaziland, however, continues to hold out despite the potential cost to its desperately weak economy. A recent report by the UK&apos;s Chatham House commented: &quot;Swaziland&apos;s long-standing ties with Taiwan are likely to continue, preventing the emergence of closer relations with China and the investment this could bring.&quot; Other countries maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan include the tiny Pacific island states of Nauru and Palau, as well as the Vatican City, Paraguay, Panama, Haiti, Nicaragua and Belize. Zhang Zhexin, who studies Taiwan policy at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said Beijing would deal with Gambia in a low-key way to avoid upsetting Taiwan. &quot;We won&apos;t take the initiative to spread this news around,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;This has nothing to do with cross-strait ties.

Each took off one glove and threw it at my feet. They then picked them up and ran away waving and giggling. They had each &apos;thrown down the gauntlet&apos;. In their first term at an English university, these students were beginning to understand Shakespearean English. The previous day I had taught them ways of understanding English idioms and metaphors, including the casting off of a single &apos;gauntlet&apos;. Practical demonstrations, I have discovered, work well when explaining unfamiliar phrases. Overseas students face a number of challenges when they arrive in the UK, not least in the understanding of English idioms. In particular, the prevalence of continual assessment and student presentations can put them under considerable pressure to perform as well as native speakers. They have all undergone tests to assess their capabilities prior to arrival, and most receive additional help with the language after they arrive, but sometimes the language \u2013 just like the environment \u2013 can be very specialised and new to them. A little extra encouragement and tailored assistance on our part, as lecturers, can go a long way. Students coming to the UK to study English literature are, of course, only a small number of those who arrive in the country. But the question of how best to assist overseas students in their learning experience, how to teach them alongside native speakers, is both an important and a timely one. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency&apos;s most recent figures, international students are steadily on the rise in the UK: numbering 435,230 in 2011-12 (an increase of 2% on the previous year). In 2012, China topped the 10 non EU countries sending the highest number of students to the UK, with 78,715 students studying at British universities at graduate and postgraduate level (compared with India, in second place, sending 29,900 students). By far the most popular subjects studied by international students in the UK are business and administrative studies (36% of total student numbers) and engineering and technology (32%). The overall increase in numbers can be seen on both sides of the Atlantic. Over the past few years I have been researching at Harvard University and noticed the increase in students arriving from China. My time here has enabled me to discuss pedagogy with non-UK lecturers, including those from other countries outside of North America. Understanding how students are taught prior to their arrival in the UK has proved invaluable and enabled me to see more clearly the teaching methods and culturally-grounded modes of discussion with which they are familiar. Prof Huiawei Kan is a visiting fellow at Harvard, from Shanghai University, where she teaches English. Our mutual teaching interests have led to some fruitful discussions about pedagogical approaches to teaching students for whom English is a second language. &quot;When I teach undergraduates in China (including those preparing for study abroad), we usually learn from textbooks with different components reflecting different styles of written English (formal and informal),&quot; says Huiawei Kan. &quot;They also get to read periodicals, newspapers, magazines, and even some novels and poetry.&quot; Kan adds: &quot;For listening and speaking, by way of example, I encourage them to listen to the BBC, and to record themselves speaking the same words, in order to compare their version with the original and, ultimately, to improve their pronunciation and intonation.&quot; She also lays great emphasis on conversational discussion in class: &quot;They will inevitably have to discuss their work with English-speaking peers during their time abroad. It is essential that they have both the tools and the confidence to do this.&quot; Our research shows how confidence can falter on arrival, since, until that moment, speaking English has been little more than an academic exercise. Suddenly it is their entire world. It is vital that lecturers help in this transition period. Teaching students for whom English is a second language can be a highly rewarding experience, resulting in a cultural learning exchange. Harvard is able to pick students whose abilities are at the very apex of applicants, but not all universities can attract students of such a high linguistic and academic caliber. Some students will need more help with the linguistic challenges faced during their degree, particularly during their first year. As a consequence, lecturers need support also, to ensure that they are aware of potential problems and how to identify them. In the UK, help needs to be highlighted as available both to students and lecturers. As numbers of international students increase, so should the access to \u2013 and emphasis upon \u2013 such resources. Many universities already offer staff development courses on teaching overseas students, and attendance should be encouraged. It is also important that lecturers are encouraged to provide feedback on their experiences, in the knowledge that their observations are listened to, acted upon, and examples of good practice promoted. It is only when both students and university staff are fully supported that we can enable international students to flourish within our higher education system.

So in March 2012, the 40-year-old deputy editor of Caixin, a prestigious Chinese magazine, went to Beijing&apos;s Anding hospital, the country&apos;s top mental health facility, for treatment. Zhang&apos;s months-long battle with depression took him through three failed antidepressant prescriptions and two doctors \u2013 he ditched the first after he recommended electroshock therapy. At one point, he grappled with thoughts of suicide. But eventually, things began to improve. He mustered up the energy to check his text messages; he rediscovered his appetite. Now he&apos;s back at work, taking a delicate combination of six antidepressants. It&apos;s not a perfect arrangement, but it reduces the risk that he&apos;ll relapse. &quot;In the past, nobody [in China] knew what to do about depression,&quot; said Zhang, who recorded his experience in a blogpost. &quot;And now, people might not know what to do immediately, but there are so many more channels for them to learn \u2013 friends, the internet. More and more people need antidepressants, and more and more people know what they are.&quot; Although China does not publicise official statistics on mental health, most evidence suggests that its depression rate is on the rise. Contemporary China is a psychologically taxing place \u2013 as living standards improve, social competition has become fierce; for many, buying an apartment, finding a spouse, and supporting a family feel like insurmountable tasks. Awareness of the disorder, once stigmatised as a mark of weakness, is rising. Depression-related websites are proliferating, and antidepressant sales have risen sharply. Yet according to experts, the country&apos;s public health system is struggling to keep up with the demand. &quot;Looking at the international incidence of the disorder \u2013 the percentage of people who have depression \u2013 China has very, very few psychiatrists,&quot; said Jian Lili, a psychological counsellor in Beijing. Many Chinese people find psychotherapy prohibitively expensive, Jian said, so they turn to eastern remedies such as acupuncture and herbs; some refuse treatment entirely. They&apos;re also turning to drugs. China may be home to more than 30 million depression patients, according to a 2012 report by the market data company Research and Markets, and the country&apos;s antidepressant market is booming. About \u00a3326m of the drugs were sold in 2012 \u2013 a small portion of China&apos;s pharmaceuticals market as a whole, but growing quickly, with a 22.6% increase  on 2011. Wang Gang, the director of Anding hospital&apos;s depression treatment centre, said that when the centre was founded seven years ago, it sold only a few thousand packs of antidepressants monthly; now it sells about 30,000. &quot;I can&apos;t say whether there&apos;s been an increase in the number of people who suffer from depression,&quot; he said. &quot;But Chinese hospitals have improved their diagnoses and the number of patients in the centre has increased.&quot; Most people in China don&apos;t have easy access to qualified specialists, especially outside cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Between 2001 and 2005, 88% of China&apos;s patients with mental disorders did not receive professional treatment, according to a 2009 survey by the Shanghai Mental Health Centre. Among depression sufferers who had received professional help, fewer than half had received any treatment within the past six months. Depression costs China about \u00a35.2bn annually in lost work days and other financial burdens, Caixin reported last year. Last spring, a depressed college student in Nanjing posted a suicide note to Weibo, China&apos;s most popular microblog, and took her life soon afterwards. &quot;I am depressed and I have chosen death,&quot; wrote the girl, under the handle Zou Fan. &quot;There&apos;s no good reason. Please don&apos;t get serious about this.&quot; The note was forwarded more than 80,000 times and received more than 100,000 comments; according to Jian, the counsellor, it was a watershed moment for public discussion of the disorder. Even in small cities and towns, antidepressant use appears to be rising. &quot;It might be because the internet is getting more and more popular, and people from smaller cities are starting to have more information,&quot; Jian said. Or, the reason could be simpler: &quot;Because medicine actually works.&quot; Additional reporting by Cecily Huang", "tags": ["World news", "Society", "Mental health", "China"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-20T17:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/21/vivan-las-antipodas-review", "sentences": ["Stunning, Nasa-precise photography maps out the similarities and differences: there's a clear mismatch between rural Argentina and rapidly developing Shanghai, but shared agricultural interests unite Chilean Patagonia with Russia's Lake Baikal, and Kossakovsky finds one lovely visual rhyme between Hawaii's volcanic terrain and the hides of Botswanan elephants."], "title": "!Vivan las Antipodas! \u2013 review", "article": "The phrase is \"digging to China\", but in fact there are several points where one might theoretically pass through the Earth's core and emerge on land the other side.

Among the slew of books marking the 50th anniversary of JFK&apos;s assassination is The Letters of John F Kennedy, edited by Martin W Sandler, which, argued Simon Schama in the FT, &quot;although padded with some anodyne stuff \u2013 writers wanting to know if his teeth were false \u2013 manages to reveal some sides of JFK we either never knew or had forgotten \u2026 he sends letters of wry, gently rib-poking fun to the many children who write to the White House \u2026 Reading Sandler&apos;s selection is to realise, wistfully, in an age where the form is all but extinct, how much this president enjoyed writing letters.&quot; For Gerard DeGroot in the Daily Telegraph, however, the book is evidence that the &quot;desire to sanitise the Kennedy image remains strong \u2026 It&apos;s interesting and beautifully presented, but the correspondence is censored. Sandler did not include the lurid notes the young Kennedy wrote to his friends, boasting of sexual conquests.&quot; Jane Shilling in the Daily Mail enjoyed Anjelica Huston&apos;s memoir A\u00a0Story Lately Told: &quot;Her dry wit, eloquent understatement and her vivid memory for the places, people and feelings of her childhood and early adulthood make this one of those very rare celebrity memoirs that you&apos;ll want to read and re-read for the sheer beauty of its writing.&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t let young girls read this book \u2013 they might just die of envy&quot;, wrote Lynn Barber in the Sunday Times: &quot;Anjelica Huston, the daughter of the film director John Huston, grew up in a grand house \u2026 She learnt to ride at an early age \u2026 As a teenager, she moved with her mother to Swinging London where she had all the fun of bunking off school (Holland Park comprehensive) to go shoplifting at Biba, before moving to New York to become a model.

It made me think and laugh. I also love Dave Eggers&apos; The Circle (Hamish Hamilton), which is a sharp-eyed and funny satire about the obsession with &quot;sharing&quot; our lives through technology. It&apos;s convincing and a little creepy. William Boyd     Breakfast with Lucien Photograph: PA    By strange coincidence two of the most intriguing art books I read this year had the word &quot;Breakfast&quot; in their titles. They were Breakfast with Lucian by Geordie Greig (Jonathan Cape) and Breakfast at Sotheby&apos;s by Philip Hook (Particular). Greig&apos;s fascinating, intimate biography of Lucian Freud was a revelation. Every question I had about Freud \u2013 from the aesthetic to the\u00a0intrusively gossipy \u2013 was answered with great candour and judiciousness. Hook&apos;s view of the art world is that of the professional auctioneer. In an A-Z format, it is an entire art education contained in under 350 pages. Wry, dry\u00a0and completely beguiling. Bill Bryson The Compatibility Gene by Daniel M\u00a0Davis (Allen Lane) is an elegantly written, unexpectedly gripping account of how scientists painstakingly unravelled the way in which a small group of genes (known as MHC genes) crucially influence, and unexpectedly interconnect, various aspects of our lives, from how well we fight off infection to how skilfully we find a mate. Lab work has rarely been made to seem more interesting or heroic. But my absolute book of the year is Philip Davies&apos;s hefty, gorgeous London: Hidden Interiors (English Heritage/Atlantic Publishing), which explores 180 fabulous London interior spaces that most people know nothing about, from George Gilbert Scott&apos;s wondrous chapel at King&apos;s College to L Manze&apos;s eel, pie and mash shop in Walthamstow. It is beautifully illustrated with photographs by Derek Randall and worth every penny of its \u00a340 price. Eleanor Catton  My discovery of the year was Eimear McBride&apos;s debut novel A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing (Galley Beggar Press): in style, very similar to Faulkner&apos;s The Sound and the Fury, but the broken ellipses never feel like a gimmick or a game. I\u00a0was utterly devastated by Colin McAdam&apos;s A Beautiful Truth (Granta), and utterly delighted by Elizabeth Knox&apos;s sly and ingenious Mortal Fire (Farrar Straus Giroux). My favourite novel for children published this year was the marvellously funny and inventive Heap House (Hot Key), written and illustrated by Edward Carey. Shami Chakrabarti     Return of a King    Helping to judge this year&apos;s Samuel Johnson prize meant getting stuck into some serious non-fiction. The six books that made the shortlist \u2013 Empires of the Dead (David Crane, William Collins), Return of a King (William Dalrymple, Bloomsbury), A Sting in the Tale (Dave Goulson, Jonathan Cape), Under Another Sky (Charlotte Higgins, Jonathan Cape), The Pike (Lucy Hughes-Hallett, Fourth Estate) and Margaret Thatcher (Charles Moore, Allen Lane) \u2013 are among my favourites from 2013. Dalrymple&apos;s masterful retelling of the first Afghan war had an eerie modern-day relevance, while Hughes-Hallett&apos;s portrayal of the fascist poet Gabriele D&apos;Annunzio was a sombre reminder of the perils of political extremism. On a completely contrary note, Goulson&apos;s case for the importance of bumblebees will live long in my memory for its sheer passion and scientific detail. Sarah Churchwell Janet Malcolm&apos;s Forty-One False Starts (Granta) provides a masterclass on the art of the essay from one of its most formidable living practitioners \u2013 often, as with the title essay, by sharing object lessons in failure. These occasional pieces offer glimpses into the creative process, the writer&apos;s constant search for structure, order and consonance. Even when individual essays did not live up to Malcolm&apos;s rigorous standards, the collection as a whole shows how connections emerge from the workings of one memorably searching, restless, ruthless mind. Jim Crace     Birds & People    The four non-fiction books I most valued this year have an unusual strength and depth in common; the single themes they profess to focus on\u00a0are also the Trojan horses through which their writers smuggle in a whole wide world of instruction, knowledge and contemporary significance. They are: Spillover, David Quammen&apos;s investigation of animal-to-human viruses (Vintage); Falling Upwards (Harper Collins), Richard Holmes&apos;s history of ballooning; The Searchers (Bloomsbury), Glenn Frankel&apos;s account of the 1836 abduction by Comanches of Cynthia Ann Parker and its unending aftermath; and Mark Cocker&apos;s loving and magisterial Birds and People (Jonathan Cape). Roddy Doyle George Saunders&apos;s collection of stories, Tenth of December (Bloomsbury), is spectacularly good. The stories are clever and moving, and the title story is the best piece of fiction I&apos;ve read this year. The Searchers, by Glenn Frankel, is about the stories behind the story that became the classic John Ford film. It&apos;s a history of America, an exploration of racial intolerance, an account of how, and why, real events can become legends. It&apos;s also hugely entertaining \u2013 as well as huge. My favourite book this year is Paul Morley&apos;s The North (And Almost Everything in It) (Bloomsbury). History told backwards, a memoir, a\u00a0love letter to Liverpool, several to Manchester; the book pushed me to go\u00a0to the Lowry exhibition at the Tate and made me listen again to George Formby and the Buzzcocks. The book filled my head. It was much too long and occasionally irritating, but when I\u00a0got to the end I wished there&apos;d been more of it. Richard Ford James Salter&apos;s novel All That Is (Picador). Not in my (admittedly failing) memory have I read a novel that, at its crucialest moment, made me just stand straight up out of my chair and have to\u00a0walk around the room for several minutes. Laid into the customary Salterish verbal exquisiteness and vivid intelligence is such remarkable audacity and dark-hued verve about us poor humans. It&apos;s a great novel. Jonathan Franzen     Command and Control    My vote is for Eric Schlosser&apos;s Command and Control (Allen Lane). Do\u00a0you really want to read about the thermonuclear warheads that are still aimed at the city where you live? Do you really need to know about the appalling security issues that have dogged nuclear weapons in the 70 years since their invention? Yes, you do. Schlosser&apos;s book reads like a thriller, but it&apos;s masterfully even-handed, well researched, and well organised. Either he&apos;s a natural genius at integrating massive amounts of complex information, or he worked like a dog to write this book. You wouldn&apos;t think the prospect of nuclear apocalypse would make for a reading treat, but in Schlosser&apos;s hands it does. Antonia Fraser The Poets&apos; Daughters by Katie Waldegrave (Hutchinson) is an engrossing study of Dora Wordsworth and Sara Coleridge. A double biography is an intricate pattern to achieve, but Waldegrave brings it off triumphantly: she also brings compassion as well as scholarship to her aid, so that at times the story is almost unbearably moving. After reading this book, I went right back to the paternal poetry and read it\u00a0with fresh eyes. Olivier by Philip Ziegler (MacLehose Press), published appropriately enough as the National Theatre celebrates its 50th anniversary, is another narrative that sweeps you along. While in no sense a hagiography \u2013 there is plenty of discreet criticism when necessary \u2013 it enriched my sense of this amazing multi-faceted, multi-talented man. When I watch Henry\u00a0V, for the umpteenth time, I shall gaze into those brilliant enigmatic eyes with even more awe, and a certain amount of apprehension. Stephen Frears Best read of the year was Into the Silence (Vintage), Wade Davis&apos;s account of the three unsuccessful Everest expeditions, through the back door of\u00a0Tibet, culminating in the death of George Mallory in 1924. Men from the first world war showing endurance and a capacity for suffering beyond my comprehension. Maybe the prime minister should read it before he makes an idiot of himself. Oh and Love, Nina by Nina Stibbe (Viking). But I would say that since it&apos;s about my ex\u2011wife and\u00a0our children. Letters from their Leicester nanny. Very funny and sharp. Malcolm Gladwell      Charles Belfoure Photograph: pa    I read so many books this year that I loved \u2013 Jeremy Adelman&apos;s biography of\u00a0Albert O Hirschman, Worldly Philosopher (Princeton University Press), David Epstein&apos;s The Sports Gene\u00a0(Yellow Jersey), and Jonathan Dee&apos;s magnificent A Thousand Pardons (Corsair) \u2013 but my favourite was a novel I\u00a0picked up entirely randomly, in an airport bookstore: The Paris Architect by Charles Belfoure (Sourcebooks Landmark). It is a beautiful and elegant\u00a0account of an ordinary man&apos;s unexpected and reluctant descent into heroism during the second world war. I\u00a0have no idea who Belfoure is, but he needs to write another book, now! John Gray Adam Phillips&apos; One Way and Another: New and Selected Essays (Hamish Hamilton). Writing of Ford Madox Ford&apos;s hero Tietjens in Parade&apos;s End, who in the middle of a conversation suddenly wondered if he was in fact the father of his child but &quot;proved his reputation for sanity&quot; by going on talking without any sign of distress, Phillips comments: &quot;As though sanity for this Englishman was about being apparently undisturbed by\u00a0one&apos;s most disturbing thoughts.&quot; Witty and somehow liberating, it&apos;s a comment that could only come from Phillips. Covering a wide variety of topics \u2013 &quot;On Being Bored&quot;, &quot;First Hates&quot;, &quot;On Success&quot; and &quot;The Uses of Forgetting&quot; are just a few \u2013 these short pieces from the psychotherapist and critic will confirm him as the best living essayist writing in English. Mark Haddon The Great War edited by Mark Holborn, text by Hilary Roberts (Jonathan Cape). A collection of photographs from the vast holdings of the Imperial War Museums. I have never seen or read anything that brings the first world war\u00a0quite so vividly alive. Some of the events of 1914-1918 have been told and retold so many times that the whole conflict has, for many people, acquired an obscuring antique patina. This book strips it all away. It will make me seem a fool, perhaps, but I kept turning pages and thinking, my God, these are real people. These things actually happened. Mohsin Hamid     Basti    Those unfamiliar with the American short-form master George Saunders should go out immediately and pick up\u00a0a copy of his latest story collection, Tenth of December. Wow. Sharp and fun. Also, we should all be grateful for the New York Review Books Classics series, which this year has brought us Frances Pritchett&apos;s English translation of Intizar Husain&apos;s famous Urdu novel, Basti. Husain was nominated for the 2013 Man Booker International prize, and this, his best\u2011known work, deserves a UK publisher. Robert Harris In 1983, the 50-year lease on a safe deposit box on the island of Mallorca expired. It was opened and found to contain tens of thousands of pages of the diary of a minor German aristocrat, Count Harry Kessler (1868-1937), covering the years from 1880 to 1918. These have now been meticulously translated and edited by Laird M Easton, and the result is Journey to the\u00a0Abyss (Vintage), a 900-page marvel. Kessler, an aesthete and\u00a0amateur diplomat, travelled relentlessly between Paris, Berlin and\u00a0London before the first world war\u00a0and the list\u00a0of his friends and acquaintances, each vividly described, is staggering: Bonnard, Cocteau, Nijinsky, Stravinsky, Diaghilev, Ravel, Rodin, Renoir, Gide, Monet, Mahler, Matissee, William Morris, Richard Strauss, Strindberg, Rilke, Verlaine, George Bernard Shaw, Hofmannsthal, Gordon Craig, Munch, Sarah Bernhardt, Max Reinhardt, George Grosz, Nietzsche (whose death mask he helps make), Walter Rathenau, Gustav Stresemann, HG Wells, Augustus John \u2026 And then comes August 1914\u00a0and Kessler \u2013 hitherto the most cultured companion \u2013 joins the Kaiser&apos;s army and briefly becomes a swaggering German nationalist. An important, underappreciated, unforgettable book. Max Hastings      Hanns and Rudolf    Thomas Harding&apos;s Hanns and Rudolf (William Heinemann) tells the story of how a young German Jewish refugee serving in the British army \u2013 the author&apos;s uncle \u2013 was responsible in 1945 for tracking down and arresting Rudolf H\u00f6ss, commandant of Auschwitz and\u00a0one of the most dreadful mass murderers of all time. Harding sketches the parallel lives of the SS officer with notable skill. The book is a moving reminder of what an extraordinary amount Britain gained by the Jewish flight from Europe in the 1930s \u2013 it could have been still more had we offered a warmer welcome to a host of German scientists who moved on to the US. Philip Hensher Volume one of Charles Moore&apos;s Margaret Thatcher (Allen Lane) is an\u00a0extraordinary reconstruction of a political way of life now completely vanished, written with a clear eye and full of incidental pleasures. (Not least about the surprising number of adoring gay men surrounding her at all stages.) The novel I enjoyed most was Richard House&apos;s sensational pile-driver, The Kills (Picador). Catching-up reading brought me Tapan Raychaudhuri&apos;s superb memoir, The World in Our Time (HarperCollins India), not yet published in the UK, but full of the tumultuous life of the Bengal delta \u2013 a masterpiece. Simon Hoggart An Officer and a Spy by Robert Harris (Hutchinson). Hard to imagine a thriller where you know the ending before you pick up the book, but Harris&apos;s retelling of the Dreyfus case is as taut and exciting as anything by Forsyth or Follett. The tale is told through the eyes of Col Picquart, the\u00a0head of &quot;the statistical section&quot; within the French secret service, who witnessed Dreyfus&apos;s degradation but gradually came to realise that another officer was the traitor. The story of how\u00a0he went over the heads of his superiors, none of whom wanted to rock the ship of state, is gripping, the evocation of turn-of-the-century France appealing, and the ending is magnificently downbeat, a terrific anticlimax \u2013 if that&apos;s possible. AM Homes Woody Guthrie&apos;s Wardy Forty: Greystone Park State Hospital Revisited by Phillip Buehler (Woody Guthrie Publications, Inc) is a hauntingly beautiful book about the five years the\u00a0American folk legend, songwriter and activist spent as a patient at the Greystone Park State Hospital in New Jersey. Guthrie, who had Huntington&apos;s disease, lived among the mental patients on ward 40. It was here that he was introduced to the 19-year-old Bob Dylan. Photographer Phillip Buehler, who has made a career of exploring 20th-century ruins, first climbed into Greystone through a window. The beauty of the decaying building, thick curls of paint peeling off\u00a0the walls, light seeping into long empty narrow patient rooms like cells, spurred his curiosity. He located Guthrie&apos;s files and, working with archivists and the Guthrie family, was\u00a0able to put together a portrait of a\u00a0man, a place and a point in American history when large state hospitals were\u00a0all too often warehouses for humanity. There are notes from doctors indicating they had no idea who Guthrie was; or they saw him as a\u00a0wanderer a vagrant, and thought his\u00a0claims about songwriting were delusions of grandeur. A particular quote from Woody&apos;s son Arlo stayed with me \u2013 a patient tells Woody that he loved his book Bound for Glory. &quot;You read my book?&quot; Woody asks. &quot;No, I ate your book,&quot; the patient says. Barbara Kingsolver     The Golem and the Djinni    I love surprise finds, so I&apos;ll recommend two debut novels that swept me away. The Golem and the Djinni by Helene Wecker (Blue Door), has the detailed realism of historical fiction, the haunting feel of a folk tale, and is one\u00a0of only two novels I&apos;ve ever loved whose main characters are not human. (The other was The White Bone by Barbara Gowdy.) And Susan Nussbaum&apos;s Good Kings, Bad Kings (out\u00a0in March 2014 from Oneworld Publications) is a ferociously honest, funny, completely unstoppable trip through an institutionally corrupt home for disabled teenagers. I had no intention of going where they took me.\u00a0That&apos;s the thrill of fiction. David Kynaston Kenneth Roy&apos;s The Invisible Spirit: A Life\u00a0of Postwar Scotland 1945-75 (ICS) is\u00a0by someone who lived through the period but is admirably unsentimental. Well-informed, highly readable, slightly prickly, often opinionated \u2013 not least about the seriously flawed Scottish establishment \u2013 this feels like something that needed to be written. Ian Nairn: Words in Place (Five Leaves) by Gillian Darley and David McKie \u2013 I am far from alone in having the awkward, melancholic architectural writer and broadcaster as one of my heroes: partly for his deep conviction that the built environment mattered, partly for his insistence \u2013 in defiance of modernist orthodoxy \u2013 that people mattered more. One day no doubt Nairn will get a heavy-duty biography, but for the time\u00a0being this elegant, rather slighter treatment does the job with charm and just the right degree of critical affection. John Lanchester Nina Stibbe&apos;s Love, Nina, a collection of letters to her sister from the period in the mid-80s when she was working as a nanny, is funny and sharp and has a distinctive streak of wildness: no book this year made me laugh more. Also funny and sharp, though in a darker vein, is ASA Harrison&apos;s he-said, she-said psychological thriller, The Silent Wife (Headline). Finally, the last entry in the funny-sharp stakes are the novels of Penelope Fitzgerald, which I&apos;ve been reading thanks to Hermione Lee&apos;s biography, Penelope Fitzgerald: A Life (Chatto &amp; Windus). The odd thing is that Lee&apos;s book has had more influence on my reading than anything else this year, even though I&apos;m not going to read the biography itself until I&apos;ve finished the novels. That&apos;s because I don&apos;t want prematurely to spoil the mystery of how Fitzgerald could have known so much about so many worlds, from pre-revolutionary Moscow to 60s theatre-school London to German Romanticism. (I think I can guess how she knew so much about houseboats and bookshops.) Last recommendation: Thomas Nagel&apos;s Mind and Cosmos: Why\u00a0the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature Is Almost Certainly False (OUP USA), an extraordinary and very controversial intervention in the current ructions about science and religion, from one of the world&apos;s most respected philosophers. Mark Lawson On either side of the Atlantic, two octogenarian grand masters of espionage fiction were on high form: John le Carr\u00e9&apos;s A Delicate Truth (Viking) and Charles McCarry&apos;s The Shanghai Factor (Head of Zeus) dramatise the cumulative consequences of decades of spying and lying by the victors of the second world war. Drawing on a lifetime of learning, and defying several life-threatening conditions, Clive James translated Dante: The Divine Comedy (Picador) into punchy, theologically serious and frequently funny verse. Julian Barnes reformed the conventional autobiography in Levels of Life (Jonathan Cape), combining essay, fiction and memoir in reflecting on the death of love, while Hermione Lee rethought the conventions of biography in a compelling account of the life and work (and overlaps between) of the until now underrated writer Penelope Fitzgerald. And, as readers migrate to the ebook, two lavishly produced volumes made the case for the physical book: a new edition (including the Olympic Flame bowl) of Thomas Heatherwick&apos;s thrilling design compendium Making (Thames &amp; Hudson) and JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst&apos;s S. (Canongate): an astonishing interactive project that encloses secret books and secret readers within what seems to be a 1949 library book. Penelope Lively Hermione Lee&apos;s Penelope Fitzgerald: A Life is literary biography at its best \u2013 a masterly discussion of the work of that fine novelist and an illuminating account of the life of a complex and elusive person. I thought I knew both the work and the writer pretty well but have learned much \u2013 new insights into the novels, aspects of her life of which I knew nothing. Nobody does elderly men better than Jane Gardam. Last Friends (Little, Brown) is the concluding volume in her trilogy about the legal pack \u2013 Feathers, Veneering, Fiscal-Smith \u2013 that began with Old Filth. Throughout the series Jane Gardam has switched viewpoints with extraordinary dexterity. Elegant, funny, unexpected \u2013 Last Friends ties things up. I am a long-time fan of Adam Thorpe. His versatility is remarkable \u2013 historical novels, shrewd forays into contemporary life. And now a thriller, Flight (Vintage). It zips from the Middle East to the Outer Hebrides \u2013 brilliant plotting, a mesmerising read. Robert Macfarlane Never a man to take a straight line where a diversion was possible, Patrick Leigh Fermor spent almost 50 years not-quite-finishing the final book of his trilogy describing his walk across Europe in the 1930s. It appeared this autumn as The Broken Road (John Murray), two years after his death, brought to publication by Artemis Cooper and Colin Thubron. I opened it expecting disappointment \u2013 how could it be as good as its sibling volumes? \u2013 and ended it amazed. I read Eleanor Catton&apos;s The Luminaries (Granta) three times in my capacity as Man Booker judge, and each time round it yielded new riches. It is a vastly complex novel about investment and return, gift and theft, value and worth, which \u2013 in performance of its own ethics \u2013 gives far more than it appears to possess. Finally, in minimalist contrast to Catton&apos;s maximalist novel, I loved Wolfhou by Autumn Richardson and Richard Skelton, another exquisitely produced pamphlet of place-poetry from Corbel Stone Press, who work out of a cottage in the western Lake District. Hilary Mantel      Penelope Fitzgerald Photograph: PA    Indulge in a big and richly satisfying literary biography, from an artist in the\u00a0form: Hermione Lee&apos;s Penelope Fitzgerald: A Life. It will send you back\u00a0to the subject&apos;s own piquant and\u00a0elusive novels. But perhaps a book of the year should be a mirror of the times? If so, feed righteous indignation on Damian McBride&apos;s Power Trip: A\u00a0Decade of Policy, Plots and Spin (Backbite). Bankrupt of morals and bankrupt of style, it is a nonpareil of peevishness, and self-delusion shines from it like a Christmas star. Pankaj Mishra The most remarkable discovery for me\u00a0this year was Kirill Medvedev&apos;s It&apos;s No Good (Ugly Duckling Presse), a\u00a0collection\u00a0of poems and essays, a brilliant artistic and political response to\u00a0the depredations of the Yeltsin and Putin era. Italo Calvino&apos;s Letters: 1941-1985 (Princeton Press) and Collection of\u00a0Sand: Essays (Penguin Modern Classics) remind us of a type of writerly mind almost extinct in Anglo-America: worldly, invariably curious, quietly passionate and elegant. Julia Lovell&apos;s translations of Zhu Wen&apos;s stories in The\u00a0Matchmaker, the Apprentice and the\u00a0Football Fan (Columbia) yet again affirm him as one of the most interesting Chinese writers today. This\u00a0was a particularly rich and exciting year in\u00a0literary translations from Indian languages; the stories in Ajay Navaria&apos;s\u00a0Unclaimed Terrain (Navayana Publications), and the novels by Sachin Kundalkar (Cobalt Blue, Hamish Hamilton) and Shamsur Rahman Faruqi\u00a0(The Mirror of Beauty, Hamish Hamilton) hint at the yet unrevealed depth and diversity of Indian literatures. Blake Morrison     The Pike    Adelle Waldman&apos;s first novel The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P (William Heinemann) is memorable for its Austen-like wit, humour, social astuteness and scarily accurate insights into men. Rather than condemn the protagonist (a young New Yorker) as\u00a0misogynistic and self-obsessed, Waldman sends him up, to devastating effect. Lucy Hughes-Hallett adopts a similar strategy in her terrific biography of the poet, seducer and fascist Gabriele D&apos;Annunzio, The Pike. The pace is hectic, as befits D&apos;Annunzio&apos;s life, and I\u00a0enjoyed the quote from the ex-lover who said his ideal would be an octopus with a hundred women&apos;s legs \u2013 but no head. Helen Mort&apos;s Division Street (Chatto &amp; Windus) is an excellent first\u00a0poetry collection \u2013 lucid, intelligent, politically aware, and loyal\u00a0to the northern landscapes that inspired it. Dave Eggers&apos;s The Circle, about the abolition of privacy in the age\u00a0of social media, is a must-read dystopian novel \u2013 the future it envisages has all but arrived. Andrew Motion Tim Dee&apos;s Four Fields (Jonathan Cape) belongs in the tradition of &quot;nature writing&quot;, but works with it too \u2013 putting its beautifully written sentences in the service of description and evocation, but using them to frame a serious conversation about environmental preservation and its opposites; it&apos;s a\u00a0deeply attractive book and also an important one. Inside the Rainbow (Redstone Press), edited by Julian Rothenstein and Olga Budashevskaya, is a survey of Russian children&apos;s literature from 1920-35, and the subtitle tells us what to expect: &quot;Beautiful books, terrible times&quot;. Indeed. But brilliantly clever, seditious, amusing, brave and delightful books as well; their illustrations and jackets are all reproduced here to wonderful effect. JO Morgan&apos;s long poem At Maldon (CB Editions) is a riff on the Old English poem, and owes something to Christopher Logue&apos;s War Music and Alice Oswald&apos;s Memorial \u2013 but it is its own thing too: inventive, striking and memorable. And a reminder that Morgan is one of the most original poets around. Edna O&apos;Brien La Folie Baudelaire by Roberto Calasso (Allen Lane) is a brilliant kaleidoscopic rendering of the tormented poet, his\u00a0times and the city of Paris that &quot;breathes&quot; in his prose and poetry. We\u00a0meet Baudelaire the dandy, his indecorous mistress Jeanne, both muse and vampire, his mother Caroline and his hated stepfather General Aupick, who, in the bloodshed of 1848, Baudelaire asked one of the insurgents to shoot. It is one of the most satisfying biographies I have ever read. Sylvia Plath: Drawings (Faber), lovingly compiled by her daughter Frieda Hughes, shows Plath&apos;s observation of everyday things \u2013 a thistle, a horse chestnut, the willows near Grantchester. It is also salutary to\u00a0compare the austerity of her poetry with the rapture in her letters to her husband (included here), in which she envisages his presence &quot;come day, come night, come hurricane and holocaust \u2026&quot; Dear Boy by Emily Berry (Faber): from the evidence here, this poet&apos;s imagination is rich, playful and restless, with the occasional note of anguish, which Plath would surely approve of, like a glimpse of the first crocus. Last, but by no means least, Donal Ryan&apos;s The Spinning Heart (Doubleday Ireland) is funny, moving and beautifully written. Susie Orbach Alan Rusbridger&apos;s Play It Again: An Amateur Against the Impossible  is a wonderful account of trying to learn a complex piano piece while running the Guardian at the time of WikiLeaks and phone hacking. I had to skip some of\u00a0the accounts of the fingering he is learning but he eloquently expresses the struggle to take up the playing of this piece \u2013 the Chopin Ballade No 1 \u2013 and segues into fascinating accounts of\u00a0different historic pianos and the idiosyncratic manner individual musicians use them, and his various &quot;teachers&quot;, who mostly sound very strict, alongside the emergencies from the office. A parallel story of how newspapers can move forward in the digital age runs along the narrative. I am always curious about people&apos;s daily lives and their curiosities. This book gives both in abundance. Ian Rankin Kate Atkinson&apos;s Life After Life (Doubleday) is her most challenging, complex and compelling novel yet. A woman has the chance to live life over and over again in often surprising ways. No Booker listing: no justice. Louise Doughty&apos;s Apple Tree Yard (Faber) is ostensibly a courtroom drama that asks how its sensible, intelligent middle-class heroine ended up in the dock in a murder case \u2013 beguilingly written, steely and plausible and occasionally shocking. Niccol\u00f2 Ammaniti was a new name to me. Let the Games Begin (Canongate) is a wild ride with the fevered quality of Pynchon and Vonnegut as a party to end all parties sees the various characters vying to survive a grotesque uprising. It&apos;s a satire on contemporary culture, Italian politics and the writing profession itself. Funny, sharp, and really quite rude. In a similar vein, John Niven&apos;s Straight White Male (William Heinemann) is the story of a hugely successful Irish screenwriter and his gloriously incorrect behaviour. There are laughs aplenty, but Niven adds growing poignancy as his hero becomes self-aware. It is Niven&apos;s best book, and the protagonist is easily the match of John Self in Martin Amis&apos;s Money. Ruth Rendell     Stoner    My choice isn&apos;t a new book, but it was reissued this year. I&apos;m ashamed that I\u00a0had never heard of Stoner by John Williams (Vintage) until I found it in a\u00a0bookshop three months ago. I was stunned by it, it&apos;s so good. And yet very little happens in it except joy and pain and sorrow in the American midwest, love and passion and the mistakes everyone makes. It&apos;s beautifully written in simple but brilliant prose, a\u00a0novel of an ordinary life, an examination of a quiet tragedy, the work of a great but little-known writer. Lionel Shriver Three novels stand out for me in 2013:\u00a0Visitation Street by Ivy Pochoda (Sceptre), set in Red Hook, Brooklyn; two girls venture out on a pink inflatable raft into the filthy East River and only one comes back. Great writing, great setting, beautifully rendered characters. The Son by Phillipp Meyer (Simon &amp; Schuster): an\u00a0epic set in Texas that uses, among other things, that white-man-raised-by-Indians routine, and yet incredibly it doesn&apos;t feel tired. Totally engrossing. Lastly, Claire Messud&apos;s The Woman Upstairs (Virago), which teems with fury, and tells a tale of breathtaking betrayal. It&apos;s a great study as well in the (possibly?) unreliable narrator. You keep puzzling over whether this woman is completely off her head. Helen Simpson Hermione Lee&apos;s fascinating biography of Penelope Fitzgerald charts a life that travelled the full 360 degrees on the wheel of fortune \u2013 from early promise and privilege down to dramatic middle-aged doldrums then back up to a late-blooming two decades of literary productivity and success. I&apos;m now reading Fitzgerald&apos;s last four novels, which are every bit as breathtaking as Lee&apos;s concluding chapters describe. I read Nikolai Leskov&apos;s The Enchanted Wanderer for the first time this year in a vigorous new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. Admired by Chekhov, Gorky and Tolstoy, these stories seethe with picaresque unpredictability, outlandish but touching monologues and recklessly impulsive characters like the country girl turned femme fatale in Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. Tom Stoppard This is the time of year when I try in vain to remember what I was reading up to 12 months ago, and end up choosing three books I&apos;ve enjoyed in the last 12 weeks. In the present case, these are Nature&apos;s Oracle by Ullica Segerstrale (OUP), a biography of WD\u00a0(Bill) Hamilton, the evolutionary biologist whose insight into the operation of kin selection at gene level suggested how altruism might have emerged from natural selection; a hugely enjoyable novel, Bleeding Edge by Thomas Pynchon (Jonathan Cape), who, when he&apos;s in his hardboiled vein, writes the most entertaining dialogue in any year; and The New York Times Book of Mathematics, which is what it sounds like: a century of news from maths written up for a general readership, and nobody does it better. Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn     Titian Photograph: PA    Titian: His Life by Sheila Hale (HarperPress) manages an intimate and careful study of Titian&apos;s body of work, plus an intricate knowledge of politics and art in 16th-century Venice and in the Europe from which Titian received his commissions. She captures Titian&apos;s vast ambition and does justice to his achievement, but also creates a portrait of an age. Reiner Stach&apos;s Kafka: The Decisive Years and Kafka: The Years of Insight (Princeton University Press) are\u00a0the second and third volumes of a three-volume biography. Stach reads the work and the life with minute care\u00a0and sympathy. He has a deep understanding of the world that Kafka came from and the personalities who touched his life, and this is matched by an intelligence and tact about the impulse behind the work itself. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 November 2013.

The Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) is the first group to claim responsibility for the attack on 28 October, when a four-wheel drive vehicle ploughed through a group of pedestrians near the iconic square in central Beijing, crashed into a stone bridge and caught fire, killing five people and injuring dozens. Chinese authorities quickly identified the driver as Uighur, a Muslim ethnic minority hailing from Xinjiang, a sparsely populated, restive region in the country&apos;s far north-west. &quot;O Chinese unbelievers, know that you have been fooling East Turkistan for the last sixty years, but now they have awakened,&quot; the organisation&apos;s leader Abdullah Mansour said in the clip, which was posted online this weekend by the Search for International Terrorist Entities Institute (SITE), a Bethesda, Maryland-based website which monitors jihadist forums. Uighur separatists call the region East Turkistan. Mansour warned of future attacks by Uighur fighters, including one targeting the Great Hall of the People, a granite edifice flanking Tiananmen Square where the ruling Communist party holds many of its highest-level meetings. &quot;The people have learned who is the real enemy and they returned to their religion,&quot; he said. &quot;They learned the lesson.&quot; Chinese authorities have blamed the Tiananmen Square attack on the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a shadowy Xinjiang-based group with ostensible ties to al-Qaida. On Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said ETIM was the same as the TIP, and said the government would &quot;continue the assault&quot; on the group. &quot;This lays bare the terrorist essence of this organisation and it also allows those people who recently suspected the nature of the incident to clearly see the truth,&quot; Qin told a regular press briefing. But many Xinjiang experts responded with scepticism. They say that the attack was probably motivated by China&apos;s hardline regional policies, which place severe restrictions on religious practice. Some doubt that ETIM is organised enough to carry out a sophisticated terrorist attack. Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, said that ETIM has reformed as the TIP in recent years; in 2012, its leader was killed by a CIA drone strike in Pakistan. The US department of state labelled ETIM a terrorist organisation in 2002, he said, and the Chinese government continues to use the appellation to lend international credibility to its anti-terrorism programme. The TIP has claimed responsibility for bus bombings in the Chinese cities Kunming and Shanghai, and threatened attacks on the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. &quot;The problem is that their credibility is dodgy at best,&quot; Bequelin said in an interview earlier this month. &quot;It&apos;s not clear whether they are a real outfit that is actively planning things, or just a bunch of people who are sort of agitating.&quot; On Monday, the state-controlled magazine Oriental Outlook reported that Xinjiang experienced 190 &quot;violent terrorist&quot; incidents in 2012 \u2013 a &quot;substantial&quot; increase over 2011, it said, citing Xinjiang public security statistics. Because authorities severely restrict the flow of information in Xinjiang, the details of most cases remain murky. The TIP&apos;s statement may allow the authorities to &quot;point to the international community and say yes, we have a serious jihadist problem in Xinjiang&quot;, said Michael Clarke, a Xinjiang expert at Griffith University in Australia. They could use it &quot;as an attempt to justify China&apos;s hard line&quot; in the region.", "tags": ["China", "Al-Qaida", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Xinjiang"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-25T12:03:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/26/pisa-international-student-tests-oecd", "sentences": ["Shanghai, in 2003, was mediocre."], "title": "The OECD's Pisa delivery man | Peter Wilby", "article": "It&apos;s normally parents, teachers and pupils who anxiously await exam results. But now it&apos;s the turn of education ministers to bite their nails. On 3 December, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) releases the results of its latest triennial tests, carried out in 2012 on 510,000 15-year-olds in 66 countries. They will tell us which countries perform best in reading, maths and science. The previous tests, carried out in 2009, placed England 25th, 27th and 16th respectively, hardly a stellar performance. Paradoxically, Michael Gove, the education secretary, probably won&apos;t jump for joy if there&apos;s a dramatic improvement. The cohort that took last year&apos;s tests had received all but the latest two years of their schooling under Labour. If they did well, parents and teachers may ask, why does he need to reform schools, curriculum and exams so drastically? The man marking the papers is Andreas Schleicher, an intense, white-haired, 49-year-old German, who speaks perfect English at bewildering speed. At the OECD, where he is special adviser on education policy, he invented and still runs the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa), as the international testing of 15-year-olds is called. Another of his babies, the first international survey of adult skills, has already delivered bad news for the English: their young adults, aged 16 to 24, rank among the lowest in the industrialised world for literacy and numeracy. He doesn&apos;t mince his words. &quot;Deficiencies in the UK&apos;s school systems,&quot; he wrote last year, will lead to \u00a34.5tn in lost economic output over a lifetime, &quot;the equivalent of a permanent recession&quot;. America&apos;s Atlantic magazine calls him &quot;the world&apos;s schoolmaster&quot;, while Gove has described him as &quot;the most important man in English education&quot; and &quot;the father of more revolutions than any German since Karl Marx&quot;. By some estimates, half the countries that have taken Pisa tests since they started in 2000 have reformed their education systems in light of the results. Germany&apos;s poor performance in the first tests shocked the country to its core. All but one state introduced an academic school-leaving exam, several abandoned the traditional German school half-day and others modified the stratified secondary schooling system. The US embarked on a nationwide development of &quot;common core standards&quot;. Even Japan, generally a high performer, called crisis talks when it slipped somewhat in 2009. Schleicher has no qualms about the influence he wields. He believes, with a passion, that hard evidence can improve education for all children. &quot;Our statistical model,&quot; he told me when we met at the OECD&apos;s headquarters in Paris, &quot;accounts for 85% of the performance variation between schools in the countries we study.&quot; He recently started a series of reports on individual countries, issues frequent bulletins on what works and what doesn&apos;t (&quot;the disciplinary climate in schools is strongly related to student performance,&quot; he states sternly but unsurprisingly) and plans next year to offer schools a test that allows them to measure themselves against others across the world. His catchphrase, displayed in a continuously rolling ticker as he ends his lectures, is &quot;without data, you are just another person with an opinion&quot;. But does Pisa have sufficiently robust data to justify its growing weight? Many critics think not. For one thing, the tests don&apos;t work as people think they work. You would expect all pupils to answer the same questions. In fact, according to an analysis by Copenhagen University in Denmark, only 10% of those who took part in Pisa 2006 were tested on all 28 reading questions, and about half weren&apos;t tested on reading at all. The OECD feeds real scores into a statistical device called the Rasch model so that it can work out &quot;plausible values&quot; for children who weren&apos;t tested. Schleicher says: &quot;We want to test lots of different things but we have limited time. So we give the students different tests with overlapping content.&quot; He says it&apos;s a long-established statistical technique, enhanced by modern technology. But some statisticians insist it can&apos;t work for Pisa, because different test items work differently in different countries. Pisa&apos;s league tables, they say, are almost meaningless. In 2006, the UK could have finished anywhere between 14th and 30th on reading, Canada anywhere between second and 25th, Japan anywhere between eighth and 40th. Schleicher says margins of error are shown with the league tables. &quot;The most plausible inference from the 2009 results was that the UK had dropped, but there was too much uncertainty to say for sure.&quot; That wasn&apos;t how Gove put it, I said. Under Labour, Pisa scores had gone &quot;down, down, down&quot;, he told MPs. Given that politicians and journalists never pay attention to the caveats, shouldn&apos;t the OECD stop publishing the tables? &quot;We publish 800 to 1,000 pages of analysis and just 10 pages of tables,&quot; Schleicher replies. &quot;We don&apos;t attach that much importance to them, but people want to see comparisons. If we don&apos;t know which school systems are doing best, how can we learn from them?&quot; A second objection to Pisa is that it can&apos;t take account of social, economic and cultural differences. Can it make sense to compare, say, Peru, which has high levels of child labour and limited internet access, with western European countries? Can UK schools really learn anything from east Asian countries, with their deeply ingrained respect for authority? Or from Finland (top of nearly all international league tables for educational performance) where, in living memory, people could not in effect marry without passing a literacy test set by the Lutheran church? Aren&apos;t high levels of economic inequality the biggest obstacle for many schools in the UK and the US? &quot;Sure, culture makes a difference,&quot; Schleicher says. &quot;But look at Poland. In 2000, its performance was average to below-average. Now, it does very well. They didn&apos;t change the culture, they changed what they did in education. They had vocational schools which were dumping grounds. They got rid of them and, surprise, the low-performing pupils did better. Even bigger surprise, the high-performing ones did better as well. Shanghai, in 2003, was mediocre. They didn&apos;t change the culture. They changed teachers&apos; career paths so that, to get promotion, they had to work in tough, low-performing schools. In Finland, the Lutheran church has existed for a long time. But our survey of adult skills showed that, in complete contrast to the UK, their young people greatly outperformed older people.&quot; As for economic inequality, Schleicher says it&apos;s too easy an excuse. &quot;Some countries are very good at moderating the effects of inequality. Others, such as France, exacerbate the effects.&quot; Schleicher is a pacifist \u2013 &quot;we should construct the world, not destroy it,&quot; he says \u2013 who, against his parents&apos; strong opposition, refused military service and opted instead for social service, teaching handicapped children. That was his only experience of teaching, but much of his passion for improving schools is influenced by his own experiences. His father was a professor of education and his mother a doctor, but Schleicher did so badly during his early schooling in Hamburg that he didn&apos;t even make it to grammar school. Only when he went to a private school, and then only in the last year, did he become a high performer, winning a national science prize. &quot;Some teachers really engaged me, which hadn&apos;t been the case before,&quot; he says. He went on to Hamburg University to take a physics degree, followed by an MSc in maths at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. His first job was in the medical industry, researching the applications of nuclear magnetic resonance. But his interest in educational research had been aroused by a British professor at Hamburg, Neville Postlethwaite, one of whose lectures he attended by chance. He moved to the Institute for Educational Research in Holland to work on the initial design of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (Timms), which unlike Pisa \u2013 largely a measure of 15-year-olds&apos; ability to solve real-world problems \u2013 tests straightforward subject knowledge. He moved to the OECD in 1994. At that time, it measured inputs, such as spending on schools, but not outputs. Schleicher persuaded the OECD to seek more rigorous data. Many education ministers were reluctant, but were told that, if they didn&apos;t monitor the knowledge and skills of the next generation, their economic competitiveness would suffer. The biggest sceptic was probably Schleicher&apos;s father, who believed education should be about human qualities, not things you could measure. The first Pisa results caused a sensation in several countries, particularly the US which found itself below neighbouring Canada. Yet Schleicher, who lives in Paris with his Italian wife, also an educational researcher, reserves his most dismissive comments for the school system to which he entrusts his own children, aged 17, 15 and 11. Is he satisfied with the French state schools they attend, I ask. &quot;No,&quot; he replies. &quot;It is one of the most backward school systems. It is very much rote learning.&quot; He says he kept his children in the system because he didn&apos;t want to isolate them. Despite his enthusiasm for hard data, I suspect Schleicher is, in educational terms, a bit of a trendy, at least in his views on curriculum and teaching styles, if not on school governance. I asked how many marks out of 10 he would award to Gove. He predictably avoided a direct answer but, while praising the education secretary for &quot;giving schools more levels of responsibility&quot;, said &quot;students need to apply knowledge and some areas of the curriculum have gone in the other direction, making it more focused on facts and figures&quot;. He has also, in the past, opposed performance-related pay, reported that private schools do no better than state schools when social background is taken into account, and argued that &quot;the future is about user-generated wisdom \u2026 and personalising educational experiences&quot;. But none of that is likely to mollify Pisa&apos;s critics. As they see it, Schleicher&apos;s work threatens a global standardisation of education, wiping out school systems that were embedded in diverse local cultures, values and traditions. &quot;The very meaning of public education is being recast,&quot; write the American academics Heinz-Dieter Meyer and Aaron Benavot, editors of Pisa, Power and Policy, a collection of learned papers published this year, &quot;from a project aimed at forming national citizens and nurturing social solidarity to a project driven by economic demands.&quot; Schools, they argue, are increasingly &quot;subject to the imperatives of efficiency, calculability, predictability and control&quot;. Until recently, almost nobody questioned the merits of Pisa and its league tables, only their interpretation. Now, as the world&apos;s schoolmaster announces the latest planetary exam results, we can expect the political arguments to intensify.", "tags": ["Schools", "Exams", "Teaching", "Pupil behaviour", "OECD", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-26T07:40:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/28/games-xbox-battelfield-mirrors-edge-star-wars", "sentences": ["Battlefield 4  \u2013 the siege of Shanghai level    You&apos;ve obviously had some major stability issues with the PS4 version of Battlefield."], "title": "Battlefield, Mirrors Edge, Star Wars: Patrick S\u00f6derlund on EA Dice", "article": "It has been another busy year for EA Dice. The Stockholm-based studio, founded 20 years ago by a bunch of ex-demo scene coders, is now one of the prize assets in the Electronic Arts armoury, its Battlefield series providing the only serious military shooter competition to the Call of Duty behemoth.  But while development on Battlefield 4 was rumbling on, the team announced two exciting new projects: a sequel to its innovative 2008 adventure, Mirror&apos;s Edge, and a re-boot of Star Wars: Battlefront \u2013 the multiplayer shooter set in the vaguely familiar sci-fi movie universe.  To find out more about these projects, we spoke to Patrick S\u00f6derlund, once CEO of Dice, and now executive vice president of EA Studios. We wanted to find out about the difficulties of creating super-connected games in the modern era, but also the potential of the PS4 and Xbox one going forwards... So Battlefield 4 is now out on both current and &quot;next generation&quot; consoles \u2013 what were the challenges of working on a cross-generational title? Any team trying to launch a game on five platforms is going to have a tough time \u2013 especially with two platforms that are, to some extent, unknown. There are two ways to handle this - you can go with current gen and then up-res as best you can, or you lead on the next-gen, try and get as much as possible out of those platforms and then then downsize the game so that it fits on a PS3 or Xbox 360.  The first way is probably the easier approach \u2013 you try to scale up as much as you have time to do. I think that&apos;s probably how many of our competitors looked at it. We took the other approach with this game - and with Need for Speed for that matter: both lead on next-gen and then pushed the current gen machines. That caused some development challenges, but I think it&apos;s going to give EA a stronger line-up on next-gen consoles. I hope it&apos;s going to pay off. You never know!     Battlefield 4  \u2013 the siege of Shanghai level    You&apos;ve obviously had some major stability issues with the PS4 version of Battlefield. Are you happy those are being sorted out now? Listen, we have to do a better job of getting games into the market that are as bug-free as possible. What I would say is, games are becoming more and more complex \u2013 even though we&apos;ll run a beta and we&apos;ll do massive amounts of testing, there are certain things, especially in an online-focused environment, that you won&apos;t catch. I wish I could day that we will, but I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll ever catch everything. I think we&apos;ve got better at it, but I certainly think we&apos;re not where we need to be in terms of getting games to market that offer a friction-free experience.  What we need to do, and what we are doing is, when we launch a game, we have to work very quickly to work course-correct to fix issues and then to get fixes into the hands of the consumers. I have to say that gamers have been good with us \u2013 they realise that we work hard, I think we&apos;ve had eight or nine server updates since the launch of the PC side. We try and do an update every second day to improve the game experience, and there are patches in the works for the PS3 and Xbox 360. I bet we&apos;ll have to do the same thing on the next-gen machines. But our commitment to making the best gameplay experience on a continual basis is there. We devote a lot of time and effort toward making the game better as we go. But I think we need to do a better job as a company in making sure that what comes to market is in as good a shape as it possibly can be. We saw a lot of controversy and anger of over the troubled launch of GTA Online recently, too. Do you think developers need to communicate to gamers how complex it is to bring an online experience to millions of users? It is very difficult to be honest \u2013 even for the best coders in the world who have been building operating systems for years. Look at Apple \u2013 I don&apos;t know how many updates I&apos;ve downloaded for Maverick so far. It works, but there have been some problems with it. I don&apos;t blame Apple - we live in a world where consistently updating is part of the norm. Look how often all the apps update on your phone. I think consumers are fine with that, but the problem comes when you put something into the market that doesn&apos;t work at all. And you know what? That should be a problem. We should be criticised for that. Fortunately, that hasn&apos;t been the case with Battlefield \u2013 there have been some issues and I think we&apos;ve done a good job rectifying some of them and we&apos;ll work around the clock do do the rest. If you look at GTA though, that was a game that had done tremendously well for Rockstar, so there was a very large installed base waiting to go online; when they switched it on, I still think they were surprised by the sheer load.  And I bet you they tested everything, I bet they were nervous but felt pretty confident, but then scale does so much to your systems. The number one reason for things going wrong is scale. We do a lot of testing and load balancing, we do everything we can, but my personal experience tells me there&apos;s no such thing, at this point at least, that can emulate real physical load. It&apos;s so hard to simulate that because there are so many different user cases that you can&apos;t simulate in a test environment. So should players be patient and allow us to update games when they come out? Yes. Should players expect base functionality for something they&apos;ve purchased? Absolutely. I think if there are two people screaming at you out of a thousand, you can ask for patience, but if there are 500 out of 1,000, you&apos;ve got to change something, right? You&apos;ve got a problem.  Does Dice see any intriguing new design possibilities in the next-gen hardware? The machines actually offer up more differences than people may think. The first thing you&apos;ll notice is obviously the better graphics - that&apos;s an easy thing to understand. But I think as people get their hands on the consoles, they&apos;ll realise that the Xbox 360 and PS3 were designed when the world looked very different; there was no such thing as Facebook or Twitter or Instagram. People&apos;s consumption behaviour around entertainment was entirely different too.  So the new machines are more prepared for today&apos;s world - they&apos;re much more about social, viral experiences. The PS4&apos;s Share button, when you start using it, you understand the power of it, the ability to express yourself via a console \u2013 that&apos;s going to be very important. Xbox One has the Upload studio where you can capture and comment on material \u2013 it fits more with how people want to express themselves.  The second thing is the peripherals that come with the machines, the updated Kinect, the PlayStation Eye \u2013 they will allow games to detect finger movements! Before, Kinect saw you as a big lump maybe with arms and in the best case scenario with two legs. The fidelity of the new camera is so much better - you&apos;ll see very different gameplay experiences and applications around movement that you haven&apos;t seen before. You and I don&apos;t know what they are yet, but that will offer up some interesting possibilities.  And voice commands is something that is beginning to become real. When you talk to the Xbox One and it does the things you want it to - that&apos;s really cool. It&apos;s like migrating over to the iPhone 5s. This whole fingerprint thing - I thought why would I ever need that? Until I started using it. Now I can&apos;t use my iPad because it doesn&apos;t have that feature. I want all my devices to have it. I would say the new consoles are really exciting. We&apos;re entering into an age of persistent worlds and seamless interchange between single and multiplayer. Can a legacy title like Battlefield exist in that era?I would say that we probably have to modernise the experience to some extent. But listen, if you try the multiplayer today on PS4 or Xbox One you&apos;ll find it&apos;s a very different Battlefield game than what you would have played on Xbox 360 a few years ago. Not only does it run at a higher frame rate, you see things you haven&apos;t seen before. You have the dynamic battlefields, the dynamic maps \u2013 people may say that Levolution is a gimmick, but it isn&apos;t at all, it adds an extra layer to the gameplay. Those elements are on the current generation consoles but the experience is multiplied on next-gen.  And look at the work we&apos;ve done on extending the experience to tablets and phones. It&apos;s starting to feel like a different experience. When I play on PS4, I find it hard if I don&apos;t have my tablet next to the screen displaying the mini-map. I can drag my squads around with my finger. I never thought I&apos;d use a second screen in that way. And with the Commander app I can sit on a bus and play against my friends who are playing multiplayer live on their PCs or consoles \u2013 and the fact that I can also talk to them via VoIP on my iPad is just crazy.  So the game has evolved immensely. But the mantra at Dice is, let&apos;s not do anything with these technologies just because we can. What are the meaningful gameplay extensions? If we&apos;re going to do a Commander app that works on a tablet, let&apos;s make sure it works the way we want it to work. And if it doesn&apos;t let&apos;s not do it at all. That&apos;s how we need to look at everything on the next-gen machines - they offer up a bunch of possibilities, but doing stuff just because we can, to fill up the back of a box, then we&apos;re in a world of hurt. But if we can push ourselves and look for meaningful innovation, then I think there will be rewards. As a veteran Battlefield fan, I can definitely see the possibilities of very large persistent environments. For me the game has always been about freedom and scale - I think having a cloud-based map supporting hundreds of players in seamless skirmishes \u2026 that&apos;s very exciting. To us as developers \u2026 we have to look at ourselves, every version we do of something, we have to say to ourselves, okay, if we make another one \u2013 and the big word there is &apos;if&apos; \u2013 we&apos;d better make sure it has an impact, that it changes and feels like a meaningful evolution of the brand. If you stagnate, you&apos;re better off moving to something else. I sit the floor above the Battlefield development team and there is no lack of ideas down there! It&apos;s just a matter of, how many of them are feasible and how many can we do.  There are thousands of ideas, liked the one you just described. One of the things I think is cool in Battlefield 4 is the geo-leaderboard - you can find out who in your neighbourhood is, say, the best best assault player. That&apos;s cool. And so let&apos;s take that a step further and say, what if we had servers where it pulls in just things as simple as weather and day time from the local area. If the server is in Stockholm and it&apos;s sunny, what if the map is sunny, too? What if it&apos;s snowing and dark in Moscow? Okay, let&apos;s have the servers there playing snowy and dark maps. You look at the possibilities and realise you can do so many more things in the cloud-enabled world than we couldn&apos;t do before. That&apos;s frankly one dumb idea from me, but it&apos;s kind of cool! You&apos;re right, though, you have to keep evolving.      Mirror's Edge is one of the few games to feature a strong female protagonist    I know you won&apos;t say much about Mirror&apos;s Edge 2, but let&apos;s cover it briefly. When the original came out, I really loved that game, and wrote a blog post attacking other critics for not understanding the concept of innovation. Do you think the world is more ready for it now? Mirror&apos;s Edge is something that&apos;s very close to my heart - I was extensively involved in the first one. I think it&apos;s fair to say the game was unique, it was innovative in so many ways \u2013 even today, there&apos;s no game that looks like it. It is very distinctive in look and feel \u2013 you only have to see a single screenshot to know exactly what game it is. I also think we managed to create an iconic heroine that people really like.  But let&apos;s be honest - some of the execution around the movement was not up to the standards that it should have been. In essence, I think you&apos;re right, I think we should have been more rewarded for innovation. At the same time, I look at some of the criticism that was around back then and say, yes you&apos;re right, we should have polished it further, we should have figured out some of these problems around falling all the time. It had a lot of promise and we delivered on 75% of it. And that&apos;s why it&apos;s taken us quite a while to get to a concept that we really like. Once we started to think about Mirror&apos;s Edge on a next-gen platform, we were thinking about correcting the problems we had the first time, but also going back to the roots of what Mirror&apos;s Edge actually was and what we wanted to do with it. During that search, we found a concept that we liked. So is this the time right for Mirror&apos;s Edge now? Absolutely. Do I think we&apos;ll come out with a game that keeps the innovation but redefines what the game should have been? For sure. We have a very talented group of people working on it, it&apos;s one of the games I&apos;m most excited about in our portfolio. I can&apos;t wait to show people what we&apos;re doing with it. And you had one of the great female game characters of the last console generation. Is it frustrating that Faith is still in a very small minority of women game avatars who aren&apos;t overtly sexualised? Do you think the industry can grow out of that in the coming generation? I really hope so. For the sake of humanity, we have to, right? The way Faith was designed it was a very deliberate decision. We wanted to create a character who felt powerful, who was agile, lethal, but yet had a look that people would be attracted to. I think the team did very well; it was about respect for women. There are too many bad examples in our industry of women displayed in a video game with certain body parts that are ... over-tuned and very small clothes. That doesn&apos;t represent anything that I want to be involved with or that EA wants to be involved with. I think the time has come for more characters like Faith. And if you see the fan following we have, we have people who have tattooed themselves to look like her. I didn&apos;t really realise how powerful she was until I saw that reaction from everyone. I didn&apos;t realise she was an icon. It doesn&apos;t matter whether it was \u2013 Sweden, the UK, Japan or the US \u2013 people gravitated toward her. They had a connection with Faith. That was cool.  And now, what the team has been able to do with the evolved version of Faith is keep that integrity but yet make her feel even more interesting. It feels like there is more depth to her now. And once people see the story and see what we&apos;ve done with her, they&apos;re going to be really interested. They&apos;ll want to know more.      And very quickly - Star Wars: Battlefront. Now that EA Dice has begun development, has an exciting prospect suddenly turned into a hugely daunting one? Star Wars has quite a few &quot;keen&quot; admirers\u2026 We need to be humble! The idea of doing it is really cool, but then, it&apos;s &quot;uh-oh, how do we do this?&quot; We have to treat the brand with respect but then put our personal flavour on it. That&apos;s the only way that makes sense to us. I think we&apos;re there now; the team knows exactly what it&apos;s doing, and I can tell you that some of the things you&apos;ll see \u2026 they&apos;re mind-blowing. But it took a while, it was almost as though we did have to sit down and say, oh shit, how do we treat this with the respect that it deserves \u2013 and to be very blunt, how do we not screw it up? How did you get past that? Once you get familiar with that thought, you quickly have to move on and think, okay, how do we make this awesome? How are we going to make people love what we&apos;ve done? That&apos;s where we are right now. Another good thing is, we didn&apos;t really know what it would be like to work with Disney and LucasFilm \u2013 Dice has never worked with a licensor before in that sense, we&apos;ve always developed our own IPs. We didn&apos;t know what to expect! But now we know them, we know they share our passion, they share a lot of the same views as we do \u2013 it has become a lot easier.  Now, we&apos;re over the honeymoon period when everyone is nice to each other, we&apos;re into production, but the relationship is getting stronger. The same aspiration is there to make something unique and not to follow some of the previous attempts to make great games from a movie license - attempts that failed. We think, how do we become what Warner Bros did with Batman? How do we become that iconic computer game that respects the license, that brings it forward? If we can do that we&apos;ll be fine.  And it really has to be Dice&apos;s version of Star Wars, right? Just as GoldenEye was Rare&apos;s version of James Bond and Arkham Asylum is Rocksteady&apos;s vision of Batman\u2026 Yes, and I can tell you that&apos;s been the spirit of the collaboration from day one. When Disney understood that Dice was going to develop this, they were like, &quot;cool, do what you think, stay in touch.&quot; So far it&apos;s been very good. I&apos;m very happy with how the team is working. And from outside of Dice, from EA&apos;s other studios, what&apos;s coming that interests you? Fifa 14, which is very good on next-gen, and Need For Speed: Rivals, which may surprise some people. The system they&apos;ve introduced \u2013 All Drive \u2013 which seamlessly connects multiplayer and single-player and allows player worlds to interact - it&apos;s a really exciting idea. It took them a while to get it to work, with a lot of UI tweaks \u2013 how do you make sure you&apos;re only interrupted by a friend if you want to be? But once they got their heads around that, they created something that feels very different. Going from single to multiplayer is a very seamless experience. And again, I do wonder if we&apos;ll see that seamlessness coming in to the Battlefield universe? I certainly hope so. \u2022 PlayStation 4 hands-on review and Xbox One comparison - video", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Xbox", "Xbox One", "PlayStation", "PlayStation 4", "PC", "Battlefield", "Games consoles", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-28T11:53:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/28/spike-jonze-her-interview-scarlett-johansson-joaquin-phoenix-jackass", "sentences": ["But also a Spike Jonze love story, meaning it&apos;s set in a very near, slightly off-kilter future, in a squeaky-clean but still recognisable Los Angeles (complete with an unlikely fully functional public-transit system), which is augmented with shots filmed in other Pacific-rim capitals such as Shanghai and Tokyo."], "title": "Spike Jonze on Jackass, Scarlett Johansson's erotic voice and techno love", "article": "      Spike Jonze is looking to the future. &quot;I kinda think, as I look around, that everything is slowly getting a little bit nicer. You can go on Nike&apos;s website and choose exactly what fabrics and colours and shapes you want your sneakers to come in. Everything in LA is; it&apos;s just an easy place to live in. The houses are nice, the backyards are nice, you got the ocean right there and the mountains behind you, there&apos;s an idealised easiness to the way you live and the whole environment.  &quot;There&apos;s more good food here than ever before, better restaurants. In some parts of the world, like right here, you can feel the future coming toward you and a lot of it, in terms of things like convenience, availability, accessibility, beautiful design, ease of use, is getting better all the time.&quot; There&apos;s a slightly dreamy, wistful note to his words, as he lounges on a black couch in a back office, here in his present-tense Hollywood Hills post-production suite.     Joaquin Phoenix in Her    Jonze&apos;s new movie Her \u2013 his first as both sole writer and director (after his splendidly mind-boggling collaborations with Charlie Kaufman on Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, and with Dave Eggers and Maurice Sendak on Where The Wild Things Are) \u2013 is being sold as &quot;A Spike Jonze Love Story.&quot;  And that&apos;s what it is: a love story, surprisingly sincere and heartfelt and affecting. But also a Spike Jonze love story, meaning it&apos;s set in a very near, slightly off-kilter future, in a squeaky-clean but still recognisable Los Angeles (complete with an unlikely fully functional public-transit system), which is augmented with shots filmed in other Pacific-rim capitals such as Shanghai and Tokyo. Says Jonze: &quot;We wanted a kind of clean, calm, warm utopian future that has the same struggles and longings to connect that you find everywhere; feelings of isolation and loneliness. I wanted to tap into that a bit.&quot; This love story \u2013 and here&apos;s the Spike part \u2013 concerns Theodore Twombly, a depressed writer played by Joaquin Phoenix (Jonze-ily enough, his job is writing heartfelt letters) who falls in love with &quot;Samantha&quot;, his new computer and smartphone operating system, played, in voice only, by Scarlett Johansson. They have a rich, gratifying and fulfilling relationship. Until they don&apos;t. Just like a real relationship.     Jonze and Phoenix on the set of Her. Photograph: Sam Zhu    Ridiculous, right? You&apos;d be surprised. It&apos;s late September and I&apos;ve just watched the movie, minus a couple of CGI digital inserts, at a majestic suburban house in the hills above the Sunset Strip which is functioning as the post-production set-up for films backed by Annapurna Pictures. The company&apos;s head honcho, producer and Oracle Corporation heiress Megan Ellison, lives in an even more sumptuous mansion right next door. The views of the city, all the way to the silver thread of the Pacific coastline, are million-dollar breathtaking. The others at the screening are the production and editing teams: they lock picture tonight after nearly a year in post-production.     Jonze and Scarlett Johansson at the Rome film festival premiere of Her. Photograph: Camilla Morandi/REX    Spike wants to know if I like it \u2013 he has a slight dazed look I&apos;ve seen before in other directors at this stage of post-production: he&apos;s been editing so long he wonders if he can tell the wood from the trees any more. I loved it, I say. I&apos;ve seen love stories between real human beings with bodies and bedrooms, and felt none of the rich emotions prompted in me by Her. I ask where the idea came from. &quot;The very tiniest seed came about 10 years ago when I saw this article online that said you can interact live with an artificial intelligence. So I went to the website, and I IM-ed this address, and I was like, &apos;Hi, how are you?&apos; and I got responses like, &apos;Great, how are you?&apos; And you can talk to it and tease it \u2013 not a him or her, it&apos;s just typing \u2013 and get a little banter going, getting mocked and so on. I got this sort of buzz thinking: this thing&apos;s actually keeping up with me. And then after a couple of minutes you start to notice the cracks and the flaws. Oh, this is a very cleverly written program, I thought in the end, but for those couple of minutes I got a very distinctive, tingly kind of buzz from the experience. The movie has a lot of large conceptual ideas holding it up, but most of all, I always wanted to make it a moving relationship movie \u2013 that was what I was most interested in.&quot; It might have turned out very differently, though. On the set, Phoenix interacted live with Samantha Morton as digi-Samantha. &quot;Samantha was a big part of it, and we&apos;ve been friends for a long time. What happened in post was that we edited the movie for ages and finally realised that what Samantha and I had done together wasn&apos;t working the right way. It was a really hard realisation to come to, and it was really, really hard to tell her about it. So we brought Scarlett in during post-production, and we somehow got it to work.&quot; Johansson was working on Broadway in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at the time, and Jonze grabbed her for rehearsals at any odd moment. At one point, Johansson said recently: &quot;We were even rehearsing on Maggie the Cat&apos;s bed on stage.&quot;      Jonze on set. Photograph: Sam Zhu    Blessed with a naturally deep, expressive and erotic voice, Johansson turned in an extraordinarily deft and beautiful, yet totally disembodied, performance that won her the best actress award at the Rome film festival and has some critics calling for Oscar plaudits (though the Golden Globes have already excluded her from contention). We&apos;re slumped on couches in one of the back rooms, and I&apos;m gratified how agreeable and open Jonze is. He&apos;s kind of scruffily dressed in apres-skate attire, including an uncomfortably jaggy-looking pair of trousers that seem to be made from flour sacks. I know he has pranked a few journos in his time. He once asked an interviewer to join him on an urgent visit to someone difficult he had to deal with, and took him to Johnny Knoxville&apos;s house, who \u2013 pre-scripted by Spike \u2013 promptly declared violent rhetorical war on the stunned hack. Another interview on YouTube shows Spike at the wheel of his car in downtown LA traffic. Suddenly he goes all green, steps out of the car and emits a stupendous fountain of orange vomit, then sheepishly wobbles back into the driver&apos;s seat.             This is, after all, the man behind the Jackass TV show and movies. In fact, even as he is readying Her for lock-down, he&apos;s simultaneously dipping in and out of the production for the Jackass spin-off, Bad Grandpa, starring Knoxville as a fake 86-year-old granddad with a huge capacity for giving offence. Still, no pranks for me, not so much as a whoopee cushion. I tell him that what I like about his movies is that they don&apos;t live in relation to other movies, as so much homage-heavy film-school product often does. They feel organic and hand-made, like carefully wrought, gleaming objects \u2013 for all their CGI interventions. But the Jackass movies have something in common with the earliest, oldest kinds of cinema, in which a camera was simply set up, and insane things were enacted before it. &quot;No doubt. We watched a lot of Keaton and Chaplin \u2013 and we stole everything from them we could. Abbott and Costello, the Three Stooges. To do a live-action Tom and Jerry cartoon was a big part of what we wanted. If you watch Jackass again you&apos;ll kinda see how much we plagiarised from Tom and Jerry \u2013 it&apos;s pathetic!&quot;     Cameron Diaz and John Cusack in Being John Malkovich    But the Jackass approach \u2013 and, in a way, his whole approach to directing \u2013 also derives from Spike&apos;s teenage skating exploits with his friends back in Maryland. &quot;We were the very first generation of teenage boys to have access to cheap, good, portable video cameras. That was just part of skating and hanging out, and the camera in that situation is an absolute inspiration \u2013 it just forces you to use it. You know, it could be for some epic ride \u2013 attach it to the board, maybe, or just goofing off and doin&apos; pranks, like, hey, there&apos;s a shopping cart, climb on in and we&apos;ll push ya down this steep hill and into that big bush, and film it! It was just a part of skate culture to make videos like that.&quot;     Jonze at the Rome film festival in November 2013. Photograph: Ernesto Ruscio/Getty Images    Jackass just came about. One day they were sitting around bullshitting, next thing they knew, MTV had picked them up. &quot;We thought, we have 20 minutes on national TV to do whatever the hell we want, as long as the lawyers approve it. We got no notes from them whatsoever, and we just made whatever we wanted. But then it came out finally, we had no idea ... Johnny Knoxville went from struggling to pay his rent to being on the cover of Rolling Stone in the course of like a month. It was like wow, what did we stumble upon here?&quot; Skateboarding cast a deep influence on Jonze&apos;s teenage aesthetics, but so did DIY punk rock and old school hip-hop. &quot;I loved Fugazi, the DC hardcore band, because they always did everything themselves. They had their own label, and the CDs always cost nine dollars, the T-shirts always cost eight dollars, the shows always cost five dollars, no major label. Mainly I was loving their music, but also the idea of doing it yourself and not giving power and control over to big companies.&quot;           This conviction was deepened by his long collaboration with the Beastie Boys, for whom he made numerous music videos. &quot;One of the amazing things they did when they got their advance for their second album on Capitol, Check Your Head, was they took their whole advance and a lot of time to build their own studio, Grand Royal, out in a neighbourhood called Atwater Village, really a little sleepy, 1950s small-town vibe to it. It was a kind of exploration of what it was like to make a record again, literally reinventing themselves for the third album in a row. They were always gonna make exactly the thing they wanted, even from the earliest videos I made with them, the label didn&apos;t get to have a say. It was all going to go through their filter first and last, and all be under their control.&quot; It&apos;s five years since his last movie, Where The Wild Things Are, and he says it&apos;s likely he&apos;ll now do again what he did after that movie, which itself took five years to complete: cleanse his palate. &quot;I took a year where creatively I wanted to just have an idea and go make it right away. I don&apos;t have to be making a movie just to be making one. I like to get to the point where I need to make a particular movie. In between times I make small movies, some animations \u2013 I did one in stop-motion felt back then. For a while I want to make things that are more like pencil sketches, while movies are more like large oil paintings. For a while I&apos;m gonna think small.&quot; The kid has quite a future.

In leagues from Italy to Turkey and from Finland to Germany scores of arrests have been made as hundreds of matches have fallen under suspicion. The scale of the threat to the soul of the game, not to mention the commercial implications, has slowly dawned on sports governing bodies around the world. Last month the president of La Liga warned that at least eight matches per season were fixed in the top two divisions in Spain. In Turkey two of its most famous clubs \u2013 Fenerbahce and Besiktas \u2013 are serving European bans due to match-fixing. And yet there was still a frisson of shock at the first arrests on these shores, which linked the illegal and unregulated betting markets in Asia to matches being played on bumpy pitches on freezing Saturday afternoons in the upper echelons of the non-league pyramid considered the lifeblood of the English game. How big is the problem?  Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, spoke on Thursday of fears that the six arrests could be the &quot;tip of an iceberg&quot;. But it is not as though the alarm bells have not been clanging. Earlier this year, in a self-aggrandising press conference, Europol announced it was probing 380 suspicious matches, including a Champions League tie at Anfield, as part of a Europe-wide crackdown. Fifa and Uefa have separately warned that match-fixing is the biggest threat facing the game and the former has begun issuing lifetime bans to those involved. The fixer caught on camera by the Telegraph&apos;s investigation reeled off a list of countries in which he said he could influence results: &quot;I do Australia, Scotland, Ireland, Europe, World Cup, World Cup qualifier.&quot; Closer to home UK bookmakers earlier this year stopped taking bets on a number of non-league teams amid fears about suspicious betting patterns. And the FA, which like other governing bodies uses a monitoring service to track betting activity in the legal market, issued a warning in March to clubs saying it had become &quot;aware of suspicious betting activity on a number of matches played in the Football Conference South&quot;. How do the fixers operate?  Other recent cases in England, such as that involving Accrington Stanley players in 2009, have been clumsy attempts to place bets on matches in which they were taking part. The arrests made this week are significant because they are the first in which police have gathered enough evidence to link players in England to the huge illegal and unregulated Asian betting markets. Interpol has estimated the size of those illicit markets at $500bn. Once the fixer has gained the trust of a player or group of players, or even a referee, he will direct them to ensure a specific outcome \u2013 such as making sure a minimum number of goals are scored in a particular match. The fixer&apos;s main contact on the pitch will deliver a pre-arranged signal, such as getting booked in the opening five minutes, to show the fix is on. Why do bookmakers accept these bets? If the fixer is feeding back information to associates in the Far East, it may be that the sheer liquidity of the market will hide any suspicion over bets being placed. Monitoring firms have claimed that millions of pounds can be wagered on nondescript non-league football matches, or indeed county cricket games. Inside information is more likely to be used by illegal bookmakers rather than against legal ones, giving them the opportunity to make a killing by offering attractive prices on outcomes they know will not happen. If there was a spike in unusual bets placed with a legitimate bookmaker in this country, he would be obliged to report it to the Gambling Commission under the terms of their licence and it should theoretically be picked up by the monitoring services employed by sports governing bodies. Why are players tempted? Hundreds of documented cases across the world have shown that players earning a relatively low wage can be tempted by what is painted as a low-risk opportunity to earn a huge bonus. As the unnamed Singaporean in the Telegraph undercover investigation, who claims to work for the now notorious fixer Wilson Raj Perumal, says: &quot;The players usually earn around \u00a35,000 a month. So for 90 minutes I pay them \u00a37,000. For two hours, definitely they take.&quot; In recent years that has been true for players, referees and football federations around the world. Although Fifa has now promised to invest \u20ac20m (\u00a316.6m) in Interpol to crack down on the problem, given that its own record is not unblemished when it comes to allegations of corruption and bribery, world football&apos;s governing body is often perceived as conflicted. Who is Wilson Raj Perumal? Why is Singapore the centre of global football match-fixing? In the unravelling web of global fixing, still only partially understood, many roads lead to Singapore. The names of Perumal, a Singaporean of Tamil origin who fixed games on an industrial scale across the world for over a decade and ended up living in Wembley before he was jailed in Finland, and Dan Tan loom large. Some say they are kingpins, others that they are no more than mid-ranking criminals in a much wider network. Singaporean authorities, following criticism over their inaction, finally arrested Tan and 13 others in September. Italian investigators claimed Tan had been involved in fixing 680 local, league and international matches in countless countries between 2008 and 2011. Perumal has been blowing the whistle on some of his former associates as international investigators attempt to piece together the way in which a sophisticated, if sometimes sloppy, network operated to drive profits for illegal bookmaking syndicates in south-east Asia. But those battling international organised crime say the threat is not confined to that area and exists wherever sophisticated criminal gangs are looking for a means to make or launder money. Are the top two divisions in England immune?  Some will look at the fact those players arrested this week are non-league footballers and shrug. They may wonder whether players in the upper echelons of the game earning anything up to \u00a3300,000 a week could ever be tempted. But look at other cases around the world. Look, too, at the fact the Sporting Chance clinic has warned that problem gambling is the unseen epidemic facing the game and at the financial difficulties faced by a significant minority of current and former players. Then consider the lengths that some of those players might be tempted to go to if desperate for money, and the company that they may keep. English football prides itself on its sense of fair play and air of incorruptibility. This week&apos;s arrests will have shaken those comfortable assumptions. The key figures Chann Sankaran Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan  Both men were on Thursday night charged with conspiracy to defraud. Sankaran, 33, a Singapore national, and Ganeshan, 43, who has dual UK and Singapore nationality, are alleged to be members of an illegal betting syndicate that has infiltrated English football, and conspiring to defraud bookmakers by influencing the course of matches Dan Tan Allegedly the ringleader of a global match-fixing network, Tan was arrested in Singapore in September along with 13 others. His network was allegedly responsible for rigging hundreds of matches worldwide, although he may not face trial. Interpol described him as &quot;mastermind and leader of the world&apos;s most notorious fixing syndicate&quot; Wilson Raj Perumal  A convicted match-fixer, Raj Perumal is understood to have rigged a series of fixtures over the past 30 years. He fled to England from Singapore after skipping bail in 2009 on charges of running over a police officer and spent a year in a Finnish prison after being convicted of bribing 11 players in 2011. The fixer at the centre of the recent allegations described him as &quot;the king, my boss&quot; Chris Eaton The former head of security at Fifa, Eaton claims fixing is &quot;endemic&quot; in the game and has spent a number of years trying to highlight the issue.

I was about to dispatch my second when a greying, pot-bellied man appeared next to me at the bar. I froze. He no longer looked anything like the powerful Brazilian striker who had torn defences to shreds in the 1970 World Cup, one of the stars of the greatest football team of all time. But there was little doubt who he was. &quot;Is that Jairzinho?&quot; I mouthed to the barman. He nodded with a smile. A member of the glorious, beautiful team that lit up the World Cup like none since, Jairzinho was its unstoppable goal machine \u2013 the &quot;Hurricane&quot;, the only player in history to score in every round of the tournament, a feat not even Pel\u00e9, his teammate, got close to. And there he was \u2013 no longer looking much like a hurricane \u2013 but standing next to me at the bar. Starstruck, I blurted out the first thing that came into my head: &quot;Hi! You&apos;re a legend!&quot; &quot;Yeah, I know that,&quot; he replied, as if it was the most obvious thing he&apos;d heard all day. I composed myself enough to offer him a beer (he had one, but paid for his own) and ask him about the football coaching programmes he runs in the city&apos;s favelas, but inside I was aglow. (If you&apos;re not a football fan, this was like having a chat with Jean-Paul Sartre over a pastis in a Parisian cafe.) I was looking forward to many things on my four-day walk across Rio de Janeiro. Thanks to its unique topography and gobsmacking natural beauty, it offers a city walk like nowhere else on earth, taking in a lake, mountains, two of the world&apos;s most famous beaches and some of Brazil&apos;s last remaining virgin Atlantic rainforest, not to mention colonial villages and the biggest favela in Latin America \u2013 all within the city limits. But I&apos;d never dreamed of sharing a beer with a living legend in a scruffy little bar in the arse end of Copacabana. I&apos;d begun my walk eight hours earlier in the spot where Brazil itself had started, or at least came of age and shook off its colonial past. In 1889, at the Imperial Palace in Pra\u00e7a XV, the heart of old Rio, a group of army officers delivered a letter to Dom Pedro II, the Emperor of Brazil descended from Portuguese royalty, with words to the effect: &quot;You know what, mate, I think we can manage our own country on our own from now on. Pack your bags and head back to Europe.&quot; Some of Rio&apos;s most impressive architecture can still be found in and around Pra\u00e7a XV, but it has been throttled by modernity, its colonial charm obliterated by a concrete flyover, now black and decrepit, built directly over the top of it. In the morning rush hour, I got off a bus in a tunnel underneath the square with dozens of commuters, and within seconds was engulfed by thousands more pouring off the ferries from Niteroi, the satellite city across Guanabara Bay, as planes coming in to land at the domestic airport nearby grazed the tops of the boats in the harbour.      The only person I saw not rushing to work was a homeless man standing next to a old disused fountain in the middle of the square. When I asked him about the fountain&apos;s history, he said: &quot;It&apos;s never worked; it&apos;s just for tourists to come and take pictures.&quot; But there were no tourists around and the palace was yet to open, so instead I ducked under an arch, Arco do Teles, to a narrow cobblestone street, where, as a child, Carmen Miranda lived at number 13. If I were true to the spirit of this series of megacity walks \u2013 which has included Mexico City, Shanghai and Tokyo \u2013 I should have headed north from here, through the endless gritty suburbs and poor favelas that are homes to millions in the urbanised and industrial stretch of Rio. (Actually, scratch that. If I were true to this series, I wouldn&apos;t be here at all; I&apos;d be 270 miles away in S\u00e3o Paulo, South America&apos;s largest, most dynamic city \u2013 twice the size of Rio, but not nearly half as much fun.)  Which is why I headed south, through old Rio, towards the natural playgrounds of Copacabana and Ipanema, P\u00e3o de A\u00e7ucar, Corcovado, Cristo and other places that slip off the tongue like a silky bossa nova melody. I had to battle through the morning commuters, but one boy, asleep on the pavement outside a bank, was completely oblivious as passers-by stepped over him. &quot;Is he dead?&quot; one guy asked. A hefty nudge from the bank&apos;s security guard reassured him he wasn&apos;t. The air was already thick with the meaty, garlicky whiff of simmering feij\u00e3o (black beans), the staple that would feed the army of office workers at lunchtime. And by 10am, it was soupy with humidity, too, so I headed for the cool and calm of the Metropolitan Cathedral. From the outside, it looks like an enormous upturned concrete bucket, an example of graceless 70s architecture. But this just made the spectacular interior, of stained-glass windows ascending to the heavens, all the more breathtaking. An effect as awe-inspiring as the grand medieval cathedrals of Europe. Slipping out through the back door, I felt as though I&apos;d walked into in a different city. The office workers had vanished, and the empty, ramshackle streets of Lapa, Rio&apos;s bohemian quarter, were still asleep in the late morning.     Gavin on the Escaderia Selar\u00f3n     Lapa has been the home of Brazilian artists for two centuries, but no one has contributed more to the area than Chilean-born Jorge Selar\u00f3n, whose one-man project, the Escadaria Selar\u00f3n, a flight of 215 mosaic steps, has become a focal point of the neighbourhood. The artist covered every inch of the steps in front of his house in tiles, ceramics and mirrors \u2013 originally in the green, yellow, blue and white of the Brazilian flag, later adding tiles in other colours brought by visitors. At the top of the steps, I turned left and headed to Santa Teresa, a sleepy hillside village of cobblestone streets, colonial houses and artists&apos; studios that feels cut off from the rest of the city. This was the first of several occasions on the walk when I didn&apos;t feel I was in a big city at all. Heading back down the hill, I got my first &quot;wow&quot; moment as I gazed at Botafogo beach on the edge of Guanabara Bay, with Sugarloaf mountain beyond, like a granite spaceship ready for lift-off. This is where the Portuguese fleet arrived on 1 January 1502, hence Rio de Janeiro, (January River) \u2013 they mistook the huge bay for a river delta. Even laced with roads and buildings, it&apos;s a jaw-dropping vista, but I tried to picture what it looked like 500 years ago, the mountains swathed in emerald forest, the beaches ringing to nothing but the sounds of the jungle. It must have been like sailing into Eden. Five minutes later, all notions of tropical paradise vanished as I was confronted by a mash-up of flyovers, tunnels, deafening traffic and pollution \u2013 a natural bottleneck resulting from the granite morros that shoot into the sky all over Rio. There&apos;s no easy way to walk from Botafogo to Zona Sul, the area of Rio with all the famous bits. Until the early 20th century, Rio ended here; Copacabana was an isolated Atlantic fishing village. But once the T\u00fanel Engenheiro Coelho Cintra opened in 1906, the Brazilian middle class started moving south, followed by the rich and famous, who turned the Copacabana Palace into one of the world&apos;s most glamorous hotels. I took the narrow footpath through the six-lane tunnel and saw Copacabana beach beckoning at the other end, but I opted for that cooling beer with Jairzinho rather than a swim. I made my way to the beach afterwards, exhausted but ecstatic, my head full of beer and Brazilian football, and practically danced the two miles back to my hotel, cooling my sore feet in the crashing waves.     Copacabana\u2019s famous wave mosaic motif on the mosa 'Portuguese' pavement. Photograph: Jeremy Walker/Getty Images    Copacabana&apos;s star has long since faded; it is now one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the world, tightly packed high-rise blocks squeezed between the mountains and the sea, beer-bellied blokes drinking their pensions away and women with small dogs and bad facelifts. Yet the 4km arc of beach still has an irresistible shimmer, a crescent of white sand 100m deep from the water&apos;s edge to the famous wave motif on the black-and-white mosaic pavement. And it&apos;s still where Brazil shows off to the world. When Usain Bolt ran an exhibition race earlier this year, when the Rolling Stones played a free gig, and the new Pope addressed the city, they did it on this beach in front of millions. My hotel, the Sofitel, was at the far, western end of Copacabana, in front of the neighbourhood&apos;s tiny fishing community, a vestige of when this was an isolated hamlet rather than the most famous beach in the world. The next morning, I walked round the corner to the city&apos;s second most famous beach, Ipanema, which was grey and moody, the pointed peaks of the Dois Irm\u00e3os mountains looming over the far end of the beach, shrouded in heavy cloud. (I went back with friends a few days later, when the sun was out, and Rio was at its sultry best. Hundreds of people were meditating \u2013 legs crossed, eyes closed \u2013 on the rocks at Arpoador, at the eastern end of the beach. On the pavement nearby, a busker was playing the saxophone, his hat containing a not inconsiderable amount of cash. This might sound like an everyday scene for a hip city beach, but when I lived in Brazil 20 years ago, people in Rio seemed almost scared to blink lest their bags were snatched from their hands; and the busker&apos;s hat would have been nicked by hoodlums, along with his sax. It&apos;s still not the safest city in the world \u2013 I was warned to stay away from Copacabana and Santa Teresa at night \u2013 but, boosted by the booming economy and double feelgood factor of hosting the World Cup Finals and the Olympics \u2013 Rio feels a far happier, more confident place. Admittedly, I was there before this summer&apos;s riots, but I would argue that the demonstrations were a positive sign of a population confident enough to express its frustration.)     The hillside colonial 'village' of Santa Teresa. Photograph: Luiz Grillo/Getty Images/Flickr RF    But I still had half the city to walk, so I tore myself away from watching locals playing the incredibly skilful hybrid of footvollei on Ipanema, and headed down Rua Vinicius de Moraes, named after the lyricist and bossa nova composer. On the left is Garota de Ipanema (the Girl from Ipanema), the bar where de Moraes wrote the classic song with Tom Jobim in 1962. Despite changing its name (it used to be called Bar Veloso) and being just one block back from the beach, the bar still attracts locals as well as visitors, and does a great steak (go for the picanha, rump cap: it&apos;s the most expensive thing on the menu \u2013 around \u00a325 \u2013 but will serve two or three people). Down the end of the street is the Lagoa, simply &quot;the Lake&quot;, which will host the rowing in the 2016 Olympics. It seems unfair for a city with so many fantastic beaches to be blessed with a beautiful lake too, especially one ringed with imposing black mountains. From the tallest, the 710m Corcovado, straight ahead of me the statue of Christ the Redeemer surveyed the city. After a mile, I turned west through the pleasant but uneventful middle-class suburbs of Leblon and G\u00e1vea. It was a quiet, easy day&apos;s stroll which I cut short to plan the most challenging section of this walk, through Rocinha, one of the biggest favelas in Latin America. Many of the city&apos;s favelas have been &quot;pacified&quot; in recent years and small companies have sprung up offering tours. But when I rang a couple to ask if they had a guide for for a whole day, to take me up the long and winding road through Rocinha, they reacted as if I was slightly mad. So I asked for help at the community centre on the main road at the bottom of the favela. There Dilmar Borges called her grandson Rog\u00e9rio, who came to meet me and agreed to be my guide the following day. So, on day three, I started at sea level and walked back up to where I&apos;d stopped the day before. &quot;A favela is like a mountain: you need to climb it from the bottom,&quot; said Rog\u00e9rio. At the more desirable bottom of the favela, a two-bedroom house can go for R$80,000 (around \u00a322,000). At first it felt like any other working-class Brazilian street, full of nail bars and mobile phone shops, banks and restaurants.     In Rocinha with guide for the day Rog\u00e9rio (in the blue glasses) and some of his friends. The favela is home to between 200,000 and 400,000 people. Photograph: Nadia Nightingale; Stuart Dee/Getty Images    But as soon as we hit the dank alleyways off the main drag, the place felt Dickensian. Every thoroughfare was overhung with a black plastic spaghetti of hundreds of internet, telephone and electricity cables. This is how at least 12 million Brazilians live, most in far poorer favelas than Rocinha. It felt otherworldly, but also welcoming and completely safe. This was partly thanks to Rog\u00e9rio, who seemed to know everyone we met on the long, slow climb to the top of the favela. Young children he knew came to say hello and insisted on having their pictures taken with us. Two policemen armed with huge machine guns also said hello, but declined the photo opportunity. The only time I felt in danger was when I was stung by a bee. &quot;See, I told you favelas can be dangerous,&quot; smiled Rog\u00e9rio. He proudly showed me the new, sadly underused, ecological park, and a pristine clay tennis court funded, with little fanfare, by Novak Djokovic. At the top of the morro, we had a drink at Laje Carlinhos (terracetourist.com), a bar on the roof of a small house, with a sweeping view of the whole favela \u2013 a mountain dotted with tens of thousands of tiny houses made of cheap red bricks. Beyond lay the Atlantic, to the right was Pedra da G\u00e1vea, the imposing mountain I was planning to climb the following day. Up a floor, from another improvised rooftop, we looked in the opposite direction to where the Tijuca rainforest climbs up the hillside in a carpet of dark velvety green. From here, the Cristo \u2013 who had watched over my entire walk \u2013 looks down over the city. These views are just as exhilarating as those from the top of Sugarloaf and Corcovado, but free \u2013 and more rewarding given the long slog it took to get here. And, instead of swarms of tourists, the only other person here was the friendly bar owner Senhor Carlinhos, on hand to point out the sights and crack open another cold beer. I said farewell to Rog\u00e9rio at the summit of Rocinha, and in less than five minutes I was walking back down through Alto G\u00e1vea, Rio&apos;s most salubrious suburb. Within touching distance of the favela is the Escola Americana, the most expensive school in town, landscaped into the hillside. Standing on top of a favela full of people living in poverty looking down on a school that charges day fees of over \u00a32,000 a month, it felt like a mad world, but my God, what a beautiful one. On the final day of my walk, I climbed another mountain, but unlike Rocinha, where every crevasse is crammed with humanity, the 844m Pedra da G\u00e1vea, two miles to the west, is stark, empty and covered in some of Brazil&apos;s last remaining Atlantic rainforest, inside the Tijuca national park. I was accompanied by Rob, a Scottish friend who has lived in Rio for nearly 20 years. He says misses the Highlands but I reckon having mountains like this on your doorstep \u2013 which you can climb in the morning and then be back down on the beach in the afternoon \u2013 is ample compensation.     End of the road \u2026 on top of  Pedra da G\u00e1vea, looking back over Rio. Photograph: Paul Edmondson/Getty Images    There are dozens of hiking trails in Rio but only in recent years, as a result of greater affluence and expanding horizons, have locals really started taking advantage of them. The ranger at the start of the trail told us, with some pride, that 200 people had come through already that day. Perhaps because it&apos;s so close to the city, many were woefully unprepared for the hike, wearing cheap trainers and even flip-flops. The near-vertical rock faces were far more challening than I was expecting and \u2013 though it pains me to say it \u2013 I wouldn&apos;t have made it to the top without Rob there to chivvy me along. Luckily the mountain was covered in mist for much of the assent, protecting us from the sun. But as we reached the summit the clouds lifted, revealing the city below bathed in sunlight. To the west was the modern suburb of Barra da Tijuca, Rio&apos;s future, full of shopping malls and Florida-style condos \u2013 and home to many of the venues for the 2016 Olympics \u2013 fringed with sand and sparkling blue sea. To the east, I looked back to the city I&apos;d spent the last four days walking across: the white apartment blocks and favelas seemed tiny and insignificant next to the vast sweep of Copacabana, the ocean and the towering mountains swathed in tropical rainforest. There might be a megacity of 13 million people down there but, from up here at least, it seems that man, despite his best efforts, has barely made a dent on this incredible landscape. \u2022 The trip was provided by British Airways Holidays (0844 493 0787,  ba.com), which offers direct flights from Heathrow and five nights at Sofitel Rio de Janeiro on Copacabana from \u00a31,449, or seven nights from \u00a31,739", "tags": ["Rio de Janeiro holidays", "Walking holidays", "Brazil holidays", "City breaks", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-29T21:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/dec/01/xi-jinping-china-leader", "sentences": ["Then came a transfer to Zhejiang province, a mecca for manufacturers and entrepreneurs; in 2007, he was handed the reins in Shanghai after a corruption scandal."], "title": "Xi Jinping: Chinese ruler who's a riddle to the world | Observer profile", "article": "In early November, China&apos;s most powerful man, Xi Jinping, stepped into a rustic farmhouse while on an inspection tour in far-flung Hunan province.

Shi Pazhuan, the family matriarch, was confused. &quot;What should I call you?&quot; she asked \u2013 in\u00a0Chinese, a cordial way of asking who he was. Xi shrugged off the unintended slight. He asked for the woman&apos;s age, heard that she was 64, and grasped her hand. &quot;You are an elder sister to me,&quot; he said. State media immediately reported the encounter \u2013 it seemed perfectly to capture the 60-year-old Chinese president&apos;s down-to-earth leadership style, his warm personality and his affection for the rural poor. Three weeks later, China suddenly and unilaterally declared administrative control over a swath of airspace in the contested East China Sea, sparking an international crisis. Japan, South Korea and the US defied the rising superpower by spontaneously sending aircraft into its newly formed &quot;air defence identification zone&quot;; China scrambled fighter jets in retaliation. Tensions are still simmering. Analysts say that Xi himself, also head of the country&apos;s military, was almost certainly behind the move. When David Cameron arrives in China with the UK&apos;s largest trade delegation tomorrow, he&apos;ll meet a man who&apos;s defined by such contradictions \u2013 a hardline reformer, a cosmopolitan nationalist, a pious egalitarian with zero tolerance for dissent. Since Xi was anointed as the Communist party&apos;s general secretary last November, he has pledged to liberalise markets while maintaining state control; he has trumpeted Chinese benevolence abroad while infuriating regional neighbours; he has promised fairness and transparency while cracking down on civil society groups. State-controlled media call Xi a man of the people; analysts call him calculating and ruthless, China&apos;s most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping. Before Xi took China&apos;s top job, he was perceived as a political chameleon, defined more often by others&apos; projections than observable truths. Optimists called him a possible &quot;closet reformer&quot;; a US State Department cable released by WikiLeaks called him &quot;redder than red&quot;. One year on, the truth probably lies somewhere in between. Despite Xi&apos;s calls for transparency and rule of law, he has launched draconian crackdowns on dissent and freedom of speech. He has tightened controls over the country&apos;s media and internet and ruthlessly suppressed the New Citizens&apos; Movement, a group of activists campaigning for government transparency. He is overseeing massive surveillance and forced relocation programmes in the ethnically divided regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, where tensions show no signs of dissipating. Since last November, Xi has also embodied the Chinese leadership&apos;s effort to improve its image abroad. He has professed a fondness for NBA basketball and Hollywood films; he smiles in public, marking a stark contrast to his robotic predecessor, Hu Jintao. He is no stranger to life abroad; according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, he has an elder sister living in Canada. His daughter, Xi Mingze, enrolled at Harvard in 2010 under an alias. He first visited the US as a low-level official in 1985 and stayed with a family in Iowa. Western leaders have called him &quot;open&quot; and &quot;affable&quot;. Xi&apos;s wife, People&apos;s Liberation Army singer Peng Liyuan, has been described as a &quot;Chinese Carla Bruni-Sarkozy&quot;; for decades, she was more famous than he was. In March, photographs posted online showing her wearing attire by the Guangzhou-based label Exception triggered a run on the label&apos;s online store, causing its website to crash. Xi&apos;s rise to power was detailed in a video called How to Make a Leader, which was posted to Chinese microblogs in mid-October. Its lack of irony, coupled with its mysterious provenance \u2013 it was made by an unknown production company called On the Road to Revival \u2013 led analysts to assume that officials produced it to court the country&apos;s well-connected youth. Xi &quot;experienced 16 major job transfers&quot;, said the video, which showed an animated Xi bouncing\u00a0on floating platforms, as if in an early video game. He began his career at a &quot;primary-level office&quot; before assuming control of a county, then a city,\u00a0then a series of coastal provinces. This is true meritocracy, the video seemed to shout, &quot;one of the secrets of the China miracle&quot;. Yet analysts say that some of Xi&apos;s success comes from his vaunted lineage. Xi is a &quot;princeling&quot;, a child of the Communist party elite, born on 15 June 1953 to a prominent guerrilla fighter during the party&apos;s famed long march. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was anointed vice-premier in 1959, granting the family a home in Zhongnanhai, a central leadership compound in Beijing. Yet Xi Zhongxun fell foul of Mao Zedong in 1962, and a few years later his family was consigned to manual labour in Liangjiahe village, a ramshackle town in northern Shaanxi province. Xi spent seven years in Liangjiahe under the same conditions as his neighbours \u2013 he lived in a cave home, subsisted on rice gruel, hauled buckets of water from a nearby well. &quot;There was nothing flashy about him,&quot; a friend from Xi&apos;s youth told the LA Times. &quot;It was as though he always had a sense of mission about him.&quot; Xi later earned a spot at prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing, joined the Communist party in January 1974 and spent the following decades blasting through two- to three-year posts. He began his career as an aide to the powerful military leader Geng Biao, his father&apos;s former subordinate \u2013 &quot;a job that deepened his affection for the army&quot;, reported Xinhua, China&apos;s official newswire. Later, he connected with rural farmers as a party secretary in Hebei, a flat, dusty province surrounding Beijing. In 1985, he was transferred to Fujian, where he climbed the ranks for more than a decade before becoming its governor. Then came a transfer to Zhejiang province, a mecca for manufacturers and entrepreneurs; in 2007, he was handed the reins in Shanghai after a corruption scandal. Within a year, he was promoted to the country&apos;s highest decision-making body, the politburo standing committee. Xi&apos;s father was known for his moderation and outspokenness. In 1978, after Mao&apos;s death, Deng Xiaoping appointed him as governor of southern China&apos;s Guangdong province, where he helped implement the nation&apos;s first special economic zone. The elder Xi often ran counter to party orthodoxy: he was a staunch supporter of former party secretary Hu Yaobang, a purged reformer whose death sparked the Tiananmen Square protests; he wore an expensive watch given to him in the 1950s by the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader now reviled by Beijing. Xi seems to have inherited his father&apos;s appetite for reform, if not his liberalism. In November, top leaders gathered in Beijing for the third plenum, a conclave that leaders have historically used as a launching point for dramatic reforms. The results lived up to expectations. According to a plenum report published in state media, by 2020, China will relax its one-child policy, abolish a controversial &quot;re-education through labour&quot; penal system and revise an outmoded residence registration system that denies basic social benefits to rural-urban migrants in their adopted homes. The government has pledged to give the market a &quot;decisive&quot; role in the country&apos;s economy, which it is hoped will make it easier for the poor to claw their way into the middle class. Perhaps Xi&apos;s most high-profile campaign has been his frugality and anti-corruption drive, intended to target top party &quot;tigers&quot; and rank-and-file &quot;flies&quot;. While the campaign has far from ended corruption in China, it has netted 11 ministerial and provincial-level leaders and changed the way that officials operate. Yet critics say that Xi has used the campaign to undercut his rivals, while his message of frugality has simply driven corruption underground. One of Xi&apos;s greatest challenges has been dispatching Bo Xilai, a former rival who fell from grace last year following revelations that his wife had murdered a British businessman. In September, a court in Shandong province sentenced Bo to life in prison for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. Critics say that Xi has been whittling away Bo&apos;s power base ever since. According to Bo Zhiyue, an expert on Chinese politics at the National University of Singapore, Xi is adept at wearing many hats; while he has a flare for Maoist rhetoric, his predilection for combining strong political control with liberal economics makes him more like Deng Xiaoping. &quot;Chinese political leaders usually give us a lot of surprises,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m still trying to understand who Xi Jinping really is.&quot;", "tags": ["Xi Jinping", "China", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T00:05:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/01/michael-gove-labour-international-league-table", "sentences": ["Hunt said the quality of teachers and training in China&apos;s high-tech Shanghai corridor contrasted with the government&apos;s efforts to allow unqualified teachers in English classrooms.", "&quot;In Shanghai all teachers have a teaching qualification and undergo 240 hours of professional development within the first five years of their career,&quot; Hunt said."], "title": "Michael Gove blames Labour for international league table performance", "article": "Michael Gove has pointed to &quot;children educated almost entirely under Labour&quot; to explain England&apos;s lacklustre performance in international education league tables to be published later this week. The relative positions of England, Scotland and Wales are expected to be little changed when the OECD releases its latest Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) on Tuesday, setting off another political battle over the direction of England&apos;s state schools. &quot;The results due out this week are a verdict on the last government. These tests were taken in 2012 by children who had been educated almost entirely under Labour and before most of our reforms had even been introduced,&quot; said the education secretary. &quot;The real test of our reforms will be how we do in a decade&apos;s time.&quot; But Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, fired the first shots with a commentary piece in the Sunday Times arguing that Gove&apos;s reforms were not helping. &quot;All his frenetic attention-seeking changes of the past three years \u2013 structural reforms, curriculum rewrites, multiplying assessment criteria \u2013 have not delivered the step change in standards we need,&quot; Hunt said. Reports over the weekend said the UK had &quot;stagnated&quot; in the latest tests, following the fall in the OECD league table it suffered in the 2009 edition of Pisa. England sits near the Pisa average in terms of performance, but Hunt said the country needed to emulate the successful education systems of China, Singapore and South Korea, which have climbed to the top of the OECD rankings. Hunt said the quality of teachers and training in China&apos;s high-tech Shanghai corridor contrasted with the government&apos;s efforts to allow unqualified teachers in English classrooms. &quot;In Shanghai all teachers have a teaching qualification and undergo 240 hours of professional development within the first five years of their career,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;Contrast this with Gove&apos;s attack on the status of teaching in England \u2026 In England the South Leeds academy can advertise for &apos;an unqualified maths teacher&apos; with four GCSEs. How is that going to help us win the global race?&quot; Hunt said, referring to a secondary school in Yorkshire that recently posted that job ad. Whitehall sources pointed out that the 12,000 English 15-year-olds who sat the OECD&apos;s tests at the end of 2012 would have had eight years in school under a Labour government, and just two years under the current Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. &quot;In the past, these tests have shown that, despite constantly rising exam results, our performance stagnated as others raced ahead,&quot; Gove said on Sunday. &quot;Our reforms are rooting out grade inflation, restoring rigour to the curriculum, giving headteachers more freedom, improving the quality of teachers and ensuring young people leave school with the skills they need to compete.&quot; The triennial survey of reading, maths and science attainment by 15-year-olds in 66 countries has been criticised for its complex methods, and for the standardised tests it uses to judge reading and mathematical ability across countries as diverse as Qatar, Macau and Russia. Around the world governments are preparing for good and bad news. New Zealand has seen its rankings slip substantially since the 2009 tests, when it was among the leaders, according to comments by the country&apos;s education minister Hekia Parata last week.", "tags": ["Michael Gove", "Education policy", "Education", "Politics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T17:32:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/02/david-cameron-my-visit-to-china", "sentences": ["This includes cutting corporation tax to 20%, the lowest in the G20, and improving our visa arrangements with a new mobile visa service up and running in Beijing and Shanghai and a new 24-hour visa service on offer from next summer."], "title": "David Cameron: My visit can begin a relationship to benefit China, Britain and the world", "article": "This week I make my second visit to China as Britain&apos;s prime minister. I come with a clear ambition: to build a lasting friendship that can become a blueprint for future co-operation between our countries: a partnership for growth and reform that can help to deliver the Chinese dream \u2013 and long-term prosperity for Britain too. China&apos;s transformation is one of the defining facts of our lifetime. Last year China became the world&apos;s largest trading nation. Next year China is set to become the world&apos;s largest importer of goods and later this century it will become the world&apos;s biggest economy. We should be clear that there is a genuine choice for every country over how to respond to this growing openness and success. They can choose to see China&apos;s rise as a threat or an opportunity. They can protect their markets from China or open their markets to China. They can try and shut China out \u2013 or welcome China as a partner at the top table of global affairs. Britain&apos;s answer is clear. We want to see China succeed. Whether it is welcoming China&apos;s investment in our nuclear energy sector, or creating a western hub for the Renminbi in the city of London, we believe that the right way forward is openness, dialogue, trade and investment; working together for mutual benefit not against each other in a zero-sum game. But in making this second visit to China, my argument goes deeper. China is at a defining moment. It has just announced bold reforms that show real ambition to free its markets and open them up to foreign participation. There is no greater advocate of that economic openness than Britain and no better partner for China as it opens to the world. Put simply, there is no country in the western world more open to Chinese investment, more able to meet the demands of Chinese consumers or more willing to make the case for economic openness in the G8, the G20 and the European Union. And there is no country more ready to forge a dialogue of mutual respect and understanding that can address issues of concern and advance our shared interests in the world. So let me set out the three ways in which I believe an open Britain can be an essential partner for an opening China, for the benefit of all our peoples. First, we must continue to develop our bilateral trade and commercial relationship. We are now making fast progress. Chinese investment in the UK has almost doubled in one year, making us the most popular investment destination in Europe with more investment than the next four most popular EU destinations combined. Britain&apos;s exports of goods have also increased by almost a fifth in the first half of this year. But there is huge potential to grow this further and to expand our co-operation across new sectors. As Chinese cities expand dramatically and Chinese people become more prosperous, Britain has the world-class goods and services they need: from healthcare and education to premier luxury brands like Burberry and Paul Smith; from high end manufacturing to our great creative and sporting exports, like the Premier League, James Bond and Downton Abbey. At the same time we are working to make Britain even more open to Chinese investment. This includes cutting corporation tax to 20%, the lowest in the G20, and improving our visa arrangements with a new mobile visa service up and running in Beijing and Shanghai and a new 24-hour visa service on offer from next summer. Second, Britain and China can be great partners in making the case for economic openness and free trade across the world. At the World Trade Organisation conference in Bali this week, we can together fight protectionism and push for an ambitious deal on trade facilitation, cutting red tape at borders, and worth $100 billion a year to the global economy. We can work together in the fight against poverty by developing trade in Africa. This week I will launch a new UK-China initiative to help developing African nations improve their trade performance. This will be alongside a new UK-China Africa Infrastructure Forum to support the efficient delivery of infrastructure and a new agreement with the China Development Bank on promoting investment, growth and the fight against poverty in Africa. Britain is also uniquely placed to make the case for deepening the European Union&apos;s trade and investment relationship with China. Building on the recent launch of EU-China negotiations on investment, and on China&apos;s continued commitment to economic reform, I now want to set a new long-term goal of an ambitious and comprehensive EU-China Free Trade Agreement. And as I have on the EU-US deal, so I will put my full political weight behind such a deal that could be worth tens of billions of dollars every year. Third, as permanent members of the Security Council and economic powers with global reach, both Britain and China have a responsibility through our ongoing dialogue to work together on a range of wider international issues \u2013 from negotiations with Iran, to counter-terrorism and climate change. We should recognise that China&apos;s economic transformation is happening at 100 times the scale and 10 times the speed of Britain&apos;s own urbanisation two centuries ago. In the last 30 years, China has made unprecedented social and economic achievements. The recent meeting of China&apos;s leaders \u2013 the Third Plenum \u2013 has now set a clear goal: comprehensive reform, including issues such as governance and the judicial protection of human rights, and recognising that all types of reform are inextricably linked. The promise is of an economy with a more predictable legal environment and with stricter enforcement of protection for intellectual property rights. I welcome this vision. The fact is that businesses thrive in a stable, secure and corruption-free environment that limits the risk of shock, provides certainty of dispute resolution and offers protection of capital and intellectual assets. These conditions are good for growth in China, the UK and right across the world. That&apos;s why I want to deepen our dialogue on comprehensive reform. And that&apos;s why I hope that China&apos;s economic progress will be accompanied by steadily greater political opening \u2013 because I am convinced that the best guarantee of prosperity and stability is for economic and political progress to go together. And I believe that discussing these challenges should remain a part of our partnership of mutual respect and understanding. There is a Chinese saying that one generation plants the trees in whose shade another generation rests. I hope that by advancing and extending our bilateral trade, by working together on the global issues that affect us all, and by maintaining an honest and open dialogue, my visit to China can plant the seeds of a long-term relationship that will benefit China, Britain and the world for generations to come. \u2022 This is a version of an article that appeared in the Chinese magazine Caixin ", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-02T00:04:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/productivity-commission-auto-industry-inquiry-begins", "sentences": ["He was further peeved when the Shanghai-based regional chief of General Motors, Stefen Jacoby, made his first visit to Australia earlier in November and did not meet him, despite the fate of the company being up for grabs."], "title": "Car industry inquiry is likely to present Tony Abbott with a stark choice", "article": "The Abbott government&apos;s inquiry into the Australian car industry kicks off today in what might be the last hurrah for a much-loved Australian brand \u2013 Holden. Holden was once immortalised in song for being as dinky di Aussie as kangaroos, football and meat pies, despite being wholly owned by General Motors of the US since 1931. But the fate of the carmaker now rests on the Productivity Commission&apos;s inquiry into the shrinking Australian car industry and the response of the government to that inquiry. The company has not yet reached the end of the road, but the commission has to hand over an interim report by 20 December and a final report by the end of March 2014. Holden&apos;s historic rival, Ford, has already announced it will stop making cars locally by October 2016, leaving only Holden and Toyota Australia. If Holden decides to stop making cars here, Toyota is likely to follow because the crucial component supply chain would lack the critical mass to survive. The Abbott government has indicated that it is open to interim funding but this is missing the point. Both Holden and Toyota need long-term taxpayer assistance and industry policy for the next decade, in order to attract investment from their parent companies needed to build new models. Like everyone else, the car industry could see that the Coalition was poised to win the 2013 election. They tried to engage beforehand with the combative shadow industry minister, Sophie Mirabella, over a policy pledge to cut $500m from the main industry assistance program by 2015 while setting long-term funding after studying the report by the Productivity Commission. They got nowhere with Mirabella, and complained of being lectured, even hectored. Along with others, the car industry quietly rejoiced when Mirabella was defeated by an independent candidate at the election, The new industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, previously held the portfolio during the Howard government and is a rare Australian politician who has worked with his hands, being able to do a spot of welding if required. He likes the industry, visiting a new car plant in Italy out of personal interest a few years back, and even having a Holden cap autographed by the late racing driver Peter Brock. Macfarlane has so far lacked support among federal Coalition MPs on continued industry assistance, although the mood is different in the key automotive states of Victoria and South Australia. Macfarlane was disappointed that the managing director of Holden, Mike Devereux, was promoted to a new international job with General Motors, based in Singapore. Devereux is a good talker and is undoubtedly pushing for Holden to stay, but he is now splitting his attention and the company is not expected to get a new full-time boss until early next year. He was further peeved when the Shanghai-based regional chief of General Motors, Stefen Jacoby, made his first visit to Australia earlier in November and did not meet him, despite the fate of the company being up for grabs. Behind the scenes, key government figures are spinning the line that Holden has already decided to go and that no realistic package would keep. In public, the treasurer, Joe Hockey, has even tried to blame Labor for any eventual closures in the car industry. But this is incorrect, Holden and Toyota were prepared to stay under Labor&apos;s policy settings. If the industry shuts now, it is due to decisions taken, or not taken fast enough, by the Coalition. The automotive sector is deeply worried by the sceptical stance of the two main economic ministers, Hockey and finance minister Mathias Cormann, and the relative silence so far of the prime minister, Tony Abbott. But the rejection of the bid for Graincorp showed that the Coalition are by no means free-market purists. Abbott and his advisers will be keenly aware of the political and economic fallout from the collapse of an industry which directly employs some 45,000 workers.     Holden's Mike Devereux, industry minister Ian Macfarlane and South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill at Holden's Elizabeth plant in Adelaide on October 2. Photograph: AAP/Tim Dornin    Holden has its corporate headquarters and an engine plant in Melbourne, but its assembly plant in Adelaide is a mainstay of the South Australian economy. South Australia has a state election in mid-March 2014, about a fortnight after the Productivity Commission is scheduled to deliver its final report on the car industry, but the fate of Holden is likely to be clear before polling day. This leaves the state Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, in a tricky position, given that his federal colleagues will see him as only one of many voices. South Australia\u2019s Labour premier, Jay Weatherill, is vigorously arguing for continued support to Holden. If that does not work, Weatherill will blame the Coalition, a political tactic that will not fill the economic void. The other major automotive state, Victoria, has its own election in November 2014. One of the first witnesses to give evidence to the Productivity Commission on Monday will be the South Australian premier, who has argued that the cost of industry assistance is dwarfed by not having to pay out some $21.5 billion in future welfare payments if Holden closed its assembly plant at Elizabeth in Adelaide&apos;s northern suburbs. Indeed, the City of Playford, where the Holden plant is located, already has an unemployment rate of 15.5%. The South Australian government&apos;s submission to the inquiry maps out the Australian automotive supply chain as having: \u2022 A total of 33 so-called \u201cTier-1 companies\u201d directly supply Holden, Toyota and Ford and employing more than 3,700 workers \u2022\u00a0Another 719 companies employing 28,000 to 32,000 people supply the Tier 1 companies \u2022\u00a0Only a quarter of the Tier-1 companies were diversified enough to survive if local car making ended and all 719 indirect suppliers would be vulnerable. The tricky thing about this supply chain is that thousands of jobs are located in supposedly non-automotive states like New South Wales and Queensland. Indeed, a company called Australian Arrow manages a high-volume plant in Samoa which produces electrical wire harnesses that are supplied to Toyota Australia. The Samoa plant has more than 800 workers, making it the nation&apos;s biggest employer outside of the public service. It accounts for about two-thirds of Samoa&apos;s manufacturing sector and of its exports in 2012. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union rallied outside the commission\u2019s hearings on Monday and its state secretary, John Camillo, has argued more is at stake than the 7,700 direct automotive jobs linked to Holden. &quot;The Productivity Commission must understand this the isn\u2019t just about economics, it\u2019s about families and communities right here in South Australia,\u201d Camillo said. The state&apos;s main employer lobby, Business SA, disagrees with unions about some of the solutions but it has warned that the last year was &quot;extremely tough&quot; with the local economy contracting by $145 million. &quot;The immediate impact of losing Holden would be akin to several years of similar economic malaise,&quot; it says. For their part, Holden and Toyota argue that Australia&apos;s support for the automotive industry is moderate in global terms and is far outweighed by the economic activity generated. Holden reckons to have received $1.8 billion in federal funding over between 2001 and 2012 while generating $32.7 billion of economic activity. \u201cIf Holden did not manufacture in Australia, the economic activity derived from the foreign investment by GM would not go elsewhere in Australia,\u201d the company&apos;s submission says. \u201cIn fact, it would be invested by GM in another country.\u201d Both Toyota and Holden play down the benefits of the Abbott government scrapping the carbon tax. Toyota&apos;s submission says that the impact of the tax per locally made vehicle has been widely reported to be $400 per car, but it only $115 and this had been absorbed by the company and not passed on to consumers. Holden says the carbon tax added about $45 to the cost of each locally made car, but this was not passed on. Toyota is due to give evidence to the commission\u2019s inquiry on Tuesday.

An EU threat of punitive duties prompted China to threaten sanctions on German cars and French wine. EU and Chinese leaders launched negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty at the 16th EU-China summit in Beijing last month to increase bilateral trade from about $580bn (\u00a3350bn) in 2012 to $1tn by 2020. But there is deep scepticism in Brussels at the idea of an EU-China free trade deal amid fears that China would use it to flood the market with cheap goods. The EU is China&apos;s biggest export market, while China is the EU&apos;s second-biggest export market. In his article for Caixin, Cameron swept aside recent EU concerns over Chinese rules that mean Europeans must work with a Chinese joint venture partner and hand over sensitive technology. The European commission highlighted concerns over China in May when it said it was prepared to launch an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into Huawei, the world&apos;s second-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer. The prime minister, who said an EU-China free trade agreement would be worth \u00a31.8bn a year to the UK alone, wrote: &quot;China&apos;s transformation is one of the defining facts of our lifetime. Last year China became the world&apos;s largest trading nation. Next year China is set to become the world&apos;s largest importer of goods and later this century it will become the world&apos;s biggest economy. &quot;We should be clear that there is a genuine choice for every country over how to respond to this growing openness and success. They can choose to see China&apos;s rise as a threat or an opportunity. They can protect their markets from China or open their markets to China. They can try and shut China out \u2013 or welcome China as a partner at the top table of global affairs.&quot; On the proposed free trade agreement, he wrote: &quot;Britain is uniquely placed to make the case for deepening the European Union&apos;s trade and investment relationship with China. Building on the recent launch of EU-China negotiations on investment, and on China&apos;s continued commitment to economic reform, I now want to set a new long-term goal of an ambitious and comprehensive EU-China free trade agreement. And as I have on the EU-US deal, so I will put my full political weight behind such a deal, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars every year.&quot; The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, is to warn that there is no point in trying to compete with China on low wages. Talking to staff at the VW National Training Centre in Milton Keynes he will say: &quot;David Cameron needs to understand a simple truth: we&apos;re not going to win a race with China by winning a race to the bottom, by competing on low pay and low skills. And, if we try, it will be the people of Britain who lose.&quot; He will say the UK should &quot;compete on the basis of high-skill, hi-tech, high-wage economy \u2013 encouraging small businesses who want to grow, helping young people like you who want to get on and businesses like these which want to train, backing the real wealth creators in our country&quot;.

The prime minister told students in Shanghai: &quot;We think we have a lot to learn from China because of the success of your high-speed rail. I said to your president and prime minister yesterday that just as we welcome Chinese investment into nuclear power, into other infrastructure so there will be very open competition to provide the infrastructure for our network.

Speaking in the Great Hall of the People, the Chinese premier said: &quot;The two sides have agreed to push for breakthroughs and progress in the co-operation between our enterprises on nuclear power and high-speed rail. The Chinese side is willing to not only participate in but also purchase equities and stocks in UK power projects. Just like the high-speed train, we need to grow this relationship at a higher speed.&quot; Cameron told the students in Shanghai that building high-speed rail in Britain is a more complex process. He said: &quot;The problem in a small country like the UK is that infrastructure decisions are very controversial because we are a small and relatively crowded island so the use of space for infrastructure is always controversial, whether we are trying to build airports, whether we are trying to build railway lines or whether we are trying to build new roads. My government has taken a very clear view that the countries that will succeed in the future are the countries with the most modern infrastructure.&quot; George Osborne announced during his visit to China in October that Beijing would invest in the next generation of civil nuclear power plants in Britain. In his Q&amp;A with students, Cameron joked that prime minister&apos;s questions in the Commons was like a &quot;form of torture&quot; because he has no idea of the questions that will raised. &quot;It is easily the worst half an hour of the prime minister&apos;s week because you can be asked about any subject under the sun,&quot; he said. But the prime minister added: &quot;There are two good things about this form of torture that we have in the UK. First of all it puts the prime minister on their mettle. It puts them a little bit to the test because it is very important to be able to demonstrate that you can answer about health or housing or foreign policy or the economy. The public can see if you&apos;re not doing well or they can see if you&apos;re doing OK. &quot;The second thing that is a benefit is that it means on Wednesday \u2013 and in the runup to Wednesday \u2013 I have to check my government; I have to check every single part of my government to see what is going on\u00a0\u2026 It makes the government accountable. It means that the whole of the mass of the government has to account through that one person, the prime minister. So this torture has its purpose.&quot; The prime minister also joked that his old Oxford politics tutor Vernon Bogdanor still criticises him in emails. &quot;Even though I left 25 years ago he still sends me emails criticising my work, which is very good of him. He sometimes says I have done something well. But he often emails the other way.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "HS2", "Rail transport", "UK news", "David Cameron", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T09:47:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2013/dec/03/pisa-results-schools-policy-better-teachers", "sentences": ["I know from our links with schools in Shanghai and Finland that culture matters.", "I also know that teachers from Shanghai frequently come to visit us."], "title": "Forget Pisa results, let's concentrate on what really matters to schools", "article": "Once again we find ourselves on the international naughty step. Like naughty boys from an after-school detention, the Pisa rankings are finally out and, yet again, we in the UK are not marching confidently in the company of the global big boys. In fact, it appears that we have fallen further behind. In my case it&apos;s especially humiliating. I spent a couple of hours over the weekend with a TOTALLY TOP SECRET advance copy of the international league tables and, several hours on, and despite trying to sharpen my concentration with wine sourced from various middle-ranking jurisdictions, I still couldn&apos;t make head nor tail of them. I&apos;m not sure what the Finnish word for &apos;dunce&apos; is or the Cantonese for &apos;blob&apos; but I accept that my quizzical response to the Pisa party will brand me an enemy of promise. The Pisa pantomime got underway over the weekend with leaks, speculation and a whiff of acrimony. The secretary of state, Michael Gove said our poor performance was the fault of the previous administration while Labour&apos;s shadow minister said it&apos;s an indictment of current policy. So, with depressing predictability, we are reminded of the defining feature of our education system: politicians can&apos;t leave it alone. I remember listening to David Laws speaking before the last election. He promised that education would have an independent commission and that any new curriculum would be subject to a 10-year moratorium. Never such innocence again. As a headteacher of 11 years, never has it been so difficult for me to concentrate on what brought me into the profession and what matters most: the quality of teaching. That tells you a lot. I am unconvinced that the plethora of reforms will help us to develop more great teachers, and nor will the constant sniping at the profession do much to motivate us to keep improving. This isn&apos;t complacency, by the way. Of course we need to do better. But let&apos;s compare like with like. I know from our links with schools in Shanghai and Finland that culture matters. The deep and driven culture of parental aspiration that we see, for example, in the Chinese schools we visit is extraordinary. There&apos;s an almost palpable sense of every young person wanting to achieve more than their parents. I also know that teachers from Shanghai frequently come to visit us. They admire our innovation. They praise the quality of our A-levels. They crave our students&apos; creativity and our emphasis on extra-curricular learning. They appreciate that we see great schools as about building character. So I&apos;m not going to beat myself into a pulp of psychological unhappiness because we aren&apos;t top of the Pisa pops. Instead I just hope that these results might serve as a marker. It&apos;s now time to stop the media-pleasing gimmicks of educational policy, the tinkering with structures, and instead to focus on the only two things that matter: higher aspirations in the earliest years of a child&apos;s life and doing everything to develop ever-better teachers \u2013 people who are proud to be part of a great profession on a serious mission to improve the life-chances and attainment of our young people. They do that elsewhere. It&apos;s time to do it here. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. Looking for your next role?

The latest edition of the programme for international student achievement (Pisa) from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), published today, shows the UK&apos;s position virtually unchanged from the last exercise in 2009, with slight improvements in the reading and maths scores of the nation&apos;s 15 year-olds offset by a minor drop in science.     OECD_RANKING_CHART_0312.png    The UK slipped back four places in science, to rank 20th out of 65 countries and regions taking part in exams administered by the OECD; in maths and reading the UK gained two places to reach 26th and 23rd overall, with results comparable to France&apos;s. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD&apos;s deputy director for education and skills and co-ordinator of the Pisa programme, said anyone looking for the impact of the education reforms introduced in England since the 2010 election was &quot;three years early&quot;. &quot;You are not going to see great surprises about the UK in this data,&quot; Schleicher said, announcing the results at a briefing in London.     OECD_LITERACY_CHART_0212.png    But Tristram Hunt, Labour shadow education secretary, seized on the improved performance by Britain&apos;s Asian economic rivals \u2013 including China&apos;s Shanghai region, Taiwan and South Korea \u2013 to accuse David Cameron of failing to confront the international challenge. &quot;The Pisa report is a big wake-up call,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;Eastern dominance centres on the importance that these high-performing education systems place on the quality and status of the teaching profession as the central lever for driving up standards.&quot; &quot;This report exposes the failings of this government&apos;s schools policy \u2013 a policy that has sent unqualified teachers into the classroom and prevented effective collaboration between schools.&quot; In maths, the UK&apos;s 26th place was similar to the positions of France, Ireland and New Zealand, as well as an an advance on its 2009 ranking of 28th. In reading, UK students 23rd position overall was comparable to those of France, Germany and the US. Professor Robert Coe, of Durham University, said: &quot;It is interesting that Pisa test results for the UK show little difference in maths, English and science for recent years. This seems to underline the view that improvements in GCSEs and some other examinations have had more to do with grade inflation than real, sustained improvement over time.&quot; The picture was slightly different when the UK&apos;s home nations were listed individually. While 15 year-olds in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland all showed almost identical performances to their previous scores, Wales lagged further behind in all three subject areas. The OECD&apos;s analysis showed that the UK had relatively good results in terms of the attainment of immigrants, and a smaller gender gap than many other countries. However, its high proportion of low-acheiving students, and their performance compared with those of their counterparts in other countries, held it back from appearing higher in the rankings. Sir Peter Lampl, chair of the Sutton Trust, which seeks to promote the interests of non-privileged students, said improving the performance of teachers in England&apos;s schools was the key. &quot;We need a relentless focus on improving the quality of existing teachers within the classroom, through better appraisal, professional development and leadership,&quot; Lampl said. &quot;Sutton Trust research has shown that English schools could improve their low position in international league tables in reading and mathematics and become one of the top five education performers in the world within 10 years, if the performance of the country&apos;s least effective teachers were brought up to the national average.&quot; Christine Blower of the National Union of Teachers said any debate over the Pisa rankings should take into account different economic and social situations. &quot;It is regrettable but a plain fact that child poverty is the biggest factor limiting children&apos;s potential. Life outside of the classroom does impact on the ability to learn and is an issue that this and future governments must address,&quot; Blower said. The OECD analysis said that, while the UK spends more on education than most OECD member states, that expenditure did not translate into improved education. Schleicher said there was little difference between the UK&apos;s state and independent schools in terms of their quality of education, according to Pisa&apos;s findings. &quot;Our data doesn&apos;t show much of a performance difference between public and private schools, once you account for socio-economic background,&quot; he said. &quot;Much of the advantage that comes from private schooling is confirmed by the social-economic context, not necessarily in value added.&quot;", "tags": ["Schools", "OECD", "Education", "Primary schools", "Tristram Hunt", "Secondary schools", "Politics", "Global economy", "Business", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T10:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/03/pisa-education-uk-copying-china", "sentences": ["I was in Shanghai last month, fascinated to see how China had moved on from a century of war and mass starvation to implement the highest-performing education system in the world, according to Pisa.", "While the proportion of English teenagers gaining five good GCSEs has gone from 46% in 2007 to 59% in 2012, it was expected that in this Shanghai school, over 95% of young people would meet national minimum standards.", "This change has happened throughout Shanghai, with incredibly low between-school variability, thanks to some clear policies and government focus, but most importantly through excellent, well-supported teachers and school leaders.", "Shanghai is not perfect.", "What the highest-performing systems have in common with Shanghai and elsewhere are a few clear things: high expectations of their pupils, regardless of their background; excellent quality teachers and school leadership; constant and high-quality training for the professionals in schools; and excellent parental involvement."], "title": "What Britain can learn from the OECD's Pisa education rankings", "article": "When we were setting up Teach First there was one particular school in a low-income community in London that I will always remember. In it, there was a general sense of chaos, underlined by the headteacher telling me that his goal for the school was simply &quot;to keep the children off the street&quot;. Fast-forward 10 years and the same school is one of many across London that is now succeeding at an extraordinarily high level, thanks to great leadership and outstanding teaching. This success was driven home to me by a child from a low-income family in this school who was planning to study maths at the University of Manchester. His older brother had attended the same school seven years earlier, had dropped out at 16, been unemployed and was now in prison for a petty crime. It was a shame, he confided in me, as his older brother was actually the smart one in the family but had just never seen the point of school. That one family&apos;s story of personal tragedy and triumph is writ large by today&apos;s Pisa results, which highlights the power of great teaching and school leadership in dozens of countries around the world. Unlike in previous generations, there are few good employment opportunities left for poorly educated young people. The countries that understand this shift and manage to run education systems preparing all of their young people for this future \u2013 such as China, Singapore, South Korea, Finland, Netherlands and Canada - will win the global economic race. More importantly, they will have fewer human casualties left behind. I was in Shanghai last month, fascinated to see how China had moved on from a century of war and mass starvation to implement the highest-performing education system in the world, according to Pisa.     OECD_RANKING_CHART_0312.png    Despite my expectation that all I would see was a room of robots, the classes I saw, which were made up of pupils largely from low-income communities, were dense, interesting and interactive. While the proportion of English teenagers gaining five good GCSEs has gone from 46% in 2007 to 59% in 2012, it was expected that in this Shanghai school, over 95% of young people would meet national minimum standards. Those who were failing would stay after school to get extra support, with teachers staying in regular contact with the children&apos;s parents. This change has happened throughout Shanghai, with incredibly low between-school variability, thanks to some clear policies and government focus, but most importantly through excellent, well-supported teachers and school leaders. Only the best teachers get promoted and all of them have personal development plans made up of mentoring and observations to help them improve throughout their careers. Shanghai is not perfect. There is a lack of individualism that does not fit our British strengths and many of these policies are forced on schools, children and parents through a totalitarian political system ensuring compliance of a kind we would find inappropriate. Still, my greatest worry is that we look at Asian countries at the top of the Pisa rankings - punctuated by the likes of Switzerland or Liechtenstein - and think that only these different systems have any hope of succeeding. That would be a shame. The results of countries with similar cultural backgrounds and economies to ours \u2013 such as Canada, which scores above the global average \u2013 show what is possible. Similarly, the changes in London over the last five years, where passes in GCSE results have gone from around 40% to over 60%, show that change is possible even closer to home. What the highest-performing systems have in common with Shanghai and elsewhere are a few clear things: high expectations of their pupils, regardless of their background; excellent quality teachers and school leadership; constant and high-quality training for the professionals in schools; and excellent parental involvement. Where we&apos;ve seen systemic change, long-term political consensus on educational goals has been critical. Not simple to achieve, but not impossible either.

Elsewhere, Pisa results were a further disappointment for the US, which saw its maths rank fall to 36th place overall, worse than its 2009 performance, which President Obama dubbed a &quot;Sputnik moment&quot; for American education. In reading, the US fell seven places, to 24th, and in science the country came in 28th, down five. Australia saw a precipitous fall in its maths ranking, from 15th in 2009 to 19th in 2012, as it was overtaken by Poland and the new entrant, Vietnam, which appears in the OECD tables for the first time. Australia&apos;s reading score was little changed but its performance in science slipped from 10th to 16th, tied with Macao. Finland was the highest placed European country, with a top-five performance in science, while Ireland was sixth-equal with Taiwan in reading. In maths, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and the Netherlands were the only European entrants in the top 10.

It ranked 20th overall for science, 26th for maths and 23rd for reading \u2013 on a par with France and the US, and close to the OECD average for reading and maths. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD&apos;s deputy director for education and skills and co-ordinator of the Pisa programme, said the success of education systems such as Shanghai&apos;s was the result of an emphasis on selecting teachers, as well as prioritising investment in teacher training and development. Shanghai&apos;s lead was so clear that the results were the equivalent of its students having had three additional years of schooling, the OECD estimates. Outside Asia, Brazil, Germany and Mexico have all shown consistent improvement, with Germany, Mexico and Turkey winning praise for improving the performance of their weakest performing students, many of whom were from disadvantaged backgrounds. David Spieghalter, the Winton professor of the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said: &quot;Pisa explores many factors associated with country performance but occasionally seem hasty in assigning reasons for change \u2013 we can&apos;t decide causality from this study, and we should be very cautious in the lessons to be learned.&quot; Spieghalter added: &quot;If Pisa measures anything, it is the ability to do Pisa tests. Aligning policy along a single performance indicator can be damaging. We need to look at the whole picture.&quot; The OECD administered the standardised tests at the end of last year in 34 countries and a total of 64 regions, to 500,000 15-year-olds. According to the findings, girls performed worse than boys in maths exams in 37 regions and countries, although in the majority of cases the gap was small. In most countries the gender gap favoured girls in reading, while in science there was little difference. Schleicher said that the OECD found no evidence from its international analysis that competition between private, state or charter-style schools \u2013 free schools, in the UK \u2013 had any impact on raising standards. &quot;You would expect that systems with greater choice would come out better because you expect competition to raise performance of the high performers and lower performers, and put out of the market schools and systems that do not succeed. But in fact, you don&apos;t see a correlation,&quot; Schleicher said. &quot;Competition alone is not a predictor for better outcomes. And the UK is a good example: a highly competitive school system but still only an average performer.&quot; Instead, Schleicher said parents had higher priorities in choosing schools than simply academic results, according to the OECD&apos;s surveys of parental opinion. &quot;The most important thing for parents is not the performance of the school but what they call a safe school environment.

The US and UK languished in the middle. Analysts say that China has a historical tradition of respect for education. Parents care deeply about their children&apos;s schooling, shunting them through expensive cram courses on nights and weekends. Teachers receive constant training and peer review; they spend up to 30% of their time each year on professional development. As China&apos;s financial capital, Shanghai lies at the forefront of an ambitious national reform agenda \u2013 education authorities grant schools an unusual degree of curricular autonomy. While critics say China&apos;s education system prioritises test-taking ability over creativity and critical thinking, the city is trying to buck the trend by introducing electives courses and phasing out multiple-choice tests. Yet Shanghai&apos;s superiority reflects China&apos;s ambition more than its reality. Its population is less than 2% of the country&apos;s total, and its per capita GDP is more than twice the national average. According to Tom Loveless, an expert on education policy at Harvard University, 84% of its high school graduates enrol in college, compared with 24% nationwide.

But this should neither dominate bilateral ties nor overshadow the momentum for co-operation.&quot; The original piece said: &quot;The Cameron administration should acknowledge that the UK is not a big power in the eyes of the Chinese. It is just an old European country apt for travel and study. This has gradually become the habitual thought of the Chinese people.&quot; The prime minister said he was not bothered by the description of Britain. Speaking in Shanghai on the second day of his visit to China, he said: &quot;I would just prefer to go on the figures. This is a visit that has delivered almost \u00a36bn worth of deals. It is a visit that comes on the back of an 18-month period where we have seen more Chinese investment into Britain than in the previous 30 years. And also it is a visit where we have seen very good, high-level, substantial discussions both with the premier and with the president \u2013 the premier who described the partnership as indispensable. So I will stick with the facts and the figures.&quot; The highlight for the prime minister in Shanghai on Tuesday was a lunch attended by 600 people in the cavernous hall of the Shanghai Exhibition Centre, designed by Soviet architects in the 1950s. Cameron said there was an audible gasp when the National Theatre&apos;s War Horse appeared in the hall. The prime minister said: &quot;When War Horse arrived in that banquet today there was an audible gasp of people \u2013 they just couldn&apos;t believe what they were seeing.&quot; Cameron said people in Britain understood the need to engage with China. He said: &quot;I think the British public have a very good understanding of what I describe as the long-term plan. They know that Britain, having had some very difficult years, having suffered badly in the crisis, is on a mission to rebuild. That means sorting out your finances at home and getting the deficit under control. But it means making your way in the world and it means recognising that we can&apos;t just rely on European markets. We have to go further afield and we have to play to our strengths and win. I think people have a very good understanding of that. &quot;You don&apos;t have to know all the facts and figures about China to know that China&apos;s economic rise is going to play a huge role in the world and Britain should be in there pitching for business, pitching for investment, pitching for deals, securing jobs at home.

His comments came at the start of a week-long trip that will be dominated by rising tensions between China and Japan over a territorial dispute. Biden, who will visit Japan, China and South Korea, is seeking to avoid escalation in the dispute, which intensified late last month when Beijing imposed an air defence identification zone (Adiz)] in an area of the East China Sea that includes the Senkaku islands \u2013 known as the Diaoyu islands in China \u2013 which Japan and China both lay claim to. Washington has been downplaying reports of disagreements between the US and Japan over the issue; a senior administration official travelling with Biden insisted there was &quot;no daylight&quot; between the two countries. Earlier in the day, Biden told reporters in Tokyo that the US-Japanese security arrangement was &quot;the cornerstone of security not merely in the Pacific basic but the cornerstone upon which our security is built for the next 20 years or more&quot;. Biden is accompanied on the Japanese-leg of the trip by Caroline Kennedy, the newly appointed US ambassador. A second senior official said the US intended to call on China to &quot;exercise restraint&quot; and &quot;avoid any other destabilising actions&quot;, including a new declarations of air defence zones. However, Biden and officials travelling with him have stopped short of calling on Beijing to &quot;rescind&quot; its declaration \u2013 a demand made by the state department on Monday. Speaking in Tokyo at the start of a visit that was supposed to have focused on strengthening economic ties between the US and the region, Biden said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about China&apos;s abrupt imposition of the zone, saying it would raise regional tensions and increase the risk of accidents and miscalculation. Biden said he would raise US concerns with &quot;great specificity&quot; when he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing later this week. He stopped short of calling on Beijing to scrap the zone, calling for better communication between Japan and China, whose leaders have not held official talks since taking office. But he said China&apos;s move had &quot;raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation&quot;. China insisted it would not rescind the procedures governing the air defence zone, despite US calls for it to do so. &quot;The fact that China&apos;s announcement has caused confusion and increased the risk of accidents only further underscores the validity of concerns and the need for China to rescind the procedures,&quot; Jen Psaki, the chief spokeswoman for the state department, said on Monday. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, described the Chinese announcement of the zone nine days ago as &quot;a provocative attempt to unilaterally change the status quo&quot; that increased the risk of\u00a0inadvertent confrontation. While many countries \u2013 including the US and Japan \u2013 have similar zones, China&apos;s is controversial because it includes airspace over the disputed islands. But on Tuesday the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, told reporters: &quot;It is not China that has escalated the regional tensions. It is that some countries keep playing on the issue for their selfish gains, and China is firmly opposed to them doing that.&quot;\u00a0 Hong urged other countries to respect China&apos;s actions, which he described as &quot;justifiable and lawful&quot;. He added: &quot;China established it [the zone] to safeguard sovereignty and the freedom and order of flight in the related airspace.&quot; Concerns have grown of an accidental confrontation that could escalate. China said last week it had scrambled jets to monitor flights in the airspace by the US and Japan. But Shen Dingli, an expert at Fudan University in Shanghai on US-China relations, said: &quot;The US has not sent armed aircraft \u2026 China in turn does not send its fighters to fly towards B-52s.&quot; He added: &quot;There is no need to resolve the dispute: the dispute does not exist.\u00a0The US is messing around by not observing China&apos;s unilateral action. But in a similar way, China will soon be in a position to reciprocate by not observing [the US] Adiz.&quot; China&apos;s defence ministry said in a statement posted on its website on Tuesday that countries whose aircraft were not reporting their flight plans to China were &quot;irresponsible&quot;. But it added\u00a0that China considered the zone to be one of co-operation rather than confrontation. The zone covers more than 600 miles from north to south, above international waters separating China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. China says all aircraft entering the zone must notify the Chinese authorities beforehand or face unspecified &quot;emergency defensive measures&quot;. The rules apply to all aircraft passing through the zone, not just those heading towards Chinese airspace. Japan and the US believe the zone is an attempt by China to assert control over the islands. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he and Biden had &quot;confirmed we should not tolerate any attempt by China to change the status quo unilaterally by force&quot;. Biden flew into Tokyo late on Monday faced with the delicate task of avoiding provoking China while demonstrating support for Japan, its main ally in a region already nervous about Chinese naval aggression and North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. Behind US pleas for Japan and China to reduce tensions lie fears that an accident or miscalculation could quickly escalate into armed conflict. The US raised hackles in Tokyo when it emerged that three US civilian airlines, acting on government advice, were complying with Chinese regulations and identifying their aircraft before flying through the zone. US officials insisted, however, that the move did &quot;not indicate US government acceptance of China&apos;s requirements&quot;. To underline Washington&apos;s opposition, two B-52 bombers flew into the area last week without notifying Chinese authorities. Japanese and South Korean military jets also flew through the zone in defiance of Chinese regulations. But the decision to advise US civilian airlines to comply was less than the unequivocal show of support that Japan had hoped for. Japan, by contrast, has urged Japanese airlines to ignore China&apos;s demands to submit flight plans in advance. &quot;China&apos;s declaration of an air defence identification zone is an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo, which can invite unexpected situations and is an extremely dangerous act,&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters before Biden&apos;s meeting with Abe. &quot;Japan and the United States share the position that China&apos;s Adiz is unacceptable \u2026 I think [Biden] will head to China to discuss various issues, including this, with his understanding of Japan&apos;s position.&quot; On Monday, Chinese officials attempted to exploit divergences in the approaches of Washington and Tokyo. Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing the US had showed a &quot;constructive attitude&quot; but dismissed Japan&apos;s &quot;erroneous actions&quot;. In an editorial, the Global Times, a tabloid published by the Chinese Communist party&apos;s official People&apos;s Daily, cautioned Biden against offering unrestrained support for Japan&apos;s position on the air defence zone. &quot;The only choice he has if he wants a successful trip [to China] is not to go too far in his words over there,&quot; it said. &quot;If he openly supports Tokyo and wants to &apos;send an expedition to punish&apos; Beijing, the Chinese people won&apos;t accept it.&quot;\u00a0 Washington has refused to take sides in the simmering dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, a strategically important archipelago surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially large gas and mineral deposits. But the US recognises Japan&apos;s administrative control over the territories \u2013 reinforced just over a year ago, when Japan&apos;s government effectively nationalised the islands \u2013 and is obliged by its bilateral security treaty with Japan to defend its ally, should the diplomatic row escalate.", "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Japan", "China", "US news", "Joe Biden", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T14:54:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/dec/03/ten-things-teachers-need-to-know-pisa-results", "sentences": ["More than 20% of students in Kazakhstan, Shanghai-China, Finland, Colombia, the Netherlands, Brazil, Korea and Tunisia attend schools where learning is hindered by students intimidating or bullying others to some extent or a lot."], "title": "10 things teachers need to know about the Pisa results", "article": "An excellent education requires more than just moneyBeyond a certain level of expenditure per student, it is the way in which resources are allocated that matters. While the UK spends more on education than most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member states, it does not make the top 20 for maths, reading or science. Among high-income countries, those who pay teachers more tend to perform betterResults from the study show that best-performing countries tend to pay teachers higher salaries (relative to their per capita GDP). While paying teachers well is only part of the equation, the reports says, &quot;higher salaries can help school systems attract the best candidates to the teaching profession.&quot; Well-being is more important to parents than exam resultsAcross OECD countries, if offered a choice of schools for their child, parents tend to consider &quot;a safe school environment&quot; and &quot;a school&apos;s good reputation&quot; more important than &quot;high academic achievement of students in the school.&quot; Handing power to teachers can boost performanceSystems that provide schools with greater discretion in deciding student-assessment policies, the courses offered, the content of those courses and the textbooks used achieve higher attainment levels. Such autonomy is most effective when an accountability system is used and greater teacher-principal collaboration takes place. Giving schools more responsibility over managing funding appears to be unrelated to a school&apos;s success. Highly-stratified systems do not lead to better resultsIn general, school systems that cater to different students&apos; needs by separating young people into different institutions, grade levels and classes have not succeeded in producing superior overall attainment. In such systems, the influence a student&apos;s socio-economic status bears on their academic performance is far stronger and young people tend to be less motivated. Teacher-student relations matter \u2013 and they&apos;re improvingAmong students with equal performance and similar socio-economic status, those who attend schools with better teacher-student relations report a stronger sense of belonging and greater intrinsic motivation to learn. Teacher-student relations improved between 2003 and 2012 in all but one country, Tunisia, where they remained stable.  Most heads believe morale is high91% of students attend schools whose principals agree that the morale of their teachers is high, while 94% of students attend schools whose principals agree that teachers work with enthusiasm.  Excellent teaching is vitalCountries that have improved their performance in Pisa \u2013 such as Estonia, Poland, Brazil, Colombia, Japan and Israel \u2013 have created policies aimed at enhancing the quality of their teaching staff. This includes making it harder to earn a teaching license, providing incentives for high-achieving students to enter the profession, increasing salaries, and offering incentives for teachers to engage in in-service teacher-training programmes. More school systems are prioritising performance dataThe percentage of students who attended schools that use assessment data to compare themselves to other schools increased from 40% in 2003 to 52% in 2012. The use of student-assessment data to compare against national or regional benchmarks or with other schools increased most notably in Brazil, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal, and declined only in Finland during the same period. Most UK heads say behaviour is not a major disruption to classesSome 89% of students are in schools whose principals report that learning is not at all or very little hindered by students intimidating or bullying other students. Some 95% of students or more in Montenegro, Indonesia, Albania, the Slovak Republic, Latvia, the United Kingdom, Romania, Spain, Japan, Singapore, Lithuania and Iceland attend such schools. More than 20% of students in Kazakhstan, Shanghai-China, Finland, Colombia, the Netherlands, Brazil, Korea and Tunisia attend schools where learning is hindered by students intimidating or bullying others to some extent or a lot.

Or &quot;unpleasant whiff of eugenics,&quot; as Tris loftily described the London mayor&apos;s analysis of Britain&apos;s 2% super-elite and 16% layer of also-rans. Apart from that, petty point-scoring was all the rage as Michael Gove unveiled the OECD&apos;s verdict on the four home countries. They&apos;re all a bit average (Labour-run Wales is especially average) and must do better if they are ever to catch up with elite Asian education systems like those of Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai and (nowadays) Eton. Closer to home Tuesday&apos;s results sounded a bit like the European Championship \u2013 England beaten at home by Poland as well as Germany, Wales struggling, all weak on vital subjects such as maths, physics and penalty shoot-outs. In his cocky 2% way the education secretary means well and tries to be good. In rare reflective moments he knows that no one country has all the answers and that humility is best. After all, as Hunt was even keener to mention than von Boris&apos;s gaffe, Sweden \u2013 Gove&apos;s 2008 free schools pin-up \u2013 has since gone straight down the OECD tubes. It is now the Wales of Scandinavia while England is saddled with free school mania, last year&apos;s fad. But Gove just can&apos;t resist putting the petty-pointed boot in. He does so with the confident patter of a door-to-door annuity salesman. Labour&apos;s 13 wasted years are to blame for our indifferent showing in the worldwide study known as &quot;Pisa tests&quot; he kept telling the customers. He was especially harsh on Labour&apos;s craven subservience to swivel-eyed teachers&apos; unions, the people who condemn kids to work down coal mines which have closed. Hard to believe that Gove was once a union militant himself. Strange to report too, Labour deserves no credit on Planet Gove for what the minister called &quot;the best generation of young teachers ever in our schools.&quot; Even Hunt, a blond demigod of good 2% family who would be spared in any Boris euthanasia plan, spotted that one. Jolly unfair, he said. &quot;The secretary of state cannot have it both ways.&quot; Oh yes he could, and did. So did knuckle-dragging Tory fundamentalists, some of whose families have not seen the inside of a state school for generations. Hunt got a riff going about the Lib Dems joining Labour to stop the scandalous hire of unqualified teachers. He conjured up an updated vision of Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Llanabba school (yes, it&apos;s in Wales), run by a dodgy Dr Fagan, awash with paedophile teachers and innocent, unqualified Paul Pennyfeather, a victim of Bullingdon Club bullies, probably led by von Boris. It was a good try but Gove kept insisting there are fewer Paul Pennyfeathers in our schools than in 2010, just more of them in free schools. He also had fun urging Labour MPs who he identified as Blairites, such as Luciana Berger, to stick to their fallen leader&apos;s vision for academic excellence, which Brownite counter-revolutionaries had overthrown. Labour Wales is an object lesson in what not to do, said the ex-militant Scot. It was shameless, but enjoyable. Being Gove he sidestepped suggestions that, after almost four years in office, he might bear some responsibility for our disappointing Pisa. The OECD says it&apos;s far too soon, he explained. That&apos;s not what you told me after four years in your job, said David Blunkett. But nothing stops Gove for long. When Tory Peter Bone quoted a headteacher saying the secretary of state &quot;is a dreadful person and absolutely hopeless&quot; but has the right policies, he took it as a compliment.

Overall, the UK was 21st for science, 23rd for reading and 26th for maths \u2013 a slight improvement in maths and reading offset by a decline in its world ranking in science, having been 16th in 2009. The previous rankings saw a sharp fall in the UK&apos;s overall standings, but this time its position was static, according to the OECD&apos;s Pisa co-ordinator, Andreas Schleicher: &quot;In essence you can say that the UK stands where it stood in 2009.&quot; &quot;UK schools are treading water when we know that matching the very best could boost the growth rate by one percentage point every year,&quot; said Katja Hall, the CBI&apos;s chief policy director. The top five places in maths were taken by the emerging economies of east Asia, with China&apos;s Shanghai region comfortably at the top, followed by Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. In Shanghai \u2013 a region of 20 million people \u2013 55% of students who took the maths test finished in the top two grades, compared with just 12% in the UK. Will Paxton, head of education for Save the Children, said: &quot;Looking at the countries which have started to leap ahead, one lesson stands out: they focus on ensuring no child falls behind in their education. &quot;We will never catch up with other countries without better early action when children are in primary school to make sure the poorest do not fall behind, particularly in key skills like maths and reading.&quot; Gove told parliament that it was too soon to see improvements as a result of changes introduced since 2010, but maintained that his reforms would improve England&apos;s standing. &quot;There is a strong correlation in these league tables between freedom for heads and improved results,&quot; Gove said. &quot;That is why we have dramatically increased the number of academies and free schools, and given heads more control over teacher training, continuous professional development and the improvement of under-performing schools.&quot; But Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, said Gove&apos;s determination that free schools and academies could hire untrained teachers was a recipe for further decline. Describing the Pisa result as &quot;a wake-up call,&quot; Hunt said Asia&apos;s top-performing regions employed highly qualified teachers and used strong networks of co-operation between schools. &quot;The lesson from Pisa is clear, that you have freedom with accountability, autonomy with minimum standards, or else you end up with the secretary of state&apos;s Al-Madinah school,&quot; Hunt said, referring to a controversial free school in Derby which has had its management replaced by the Department for Education. The education department said the maths results meant that 15-year-olds in the UK were three years behind their peers in Shanghai and two years behind those in Singapore, as well as a year behind those in the Netherlands. The government has recently approved a much tougher maths course at GCSE level in England, described by Mark Dawe, head of the OCR examination board, as &quot;a once in a generation opportunity to reduce the tidal wave of people moving into adult life without the skills to reach their full potential&quot;. Switzerland, the Netherlands and Finland were among the leading European nations, with Poland and Germany boasting improved results from previous years. But Sweden \u2013 previously held up as a model by Gove for its adoption of free schools, many run by for-profit companies \u2013 was shown to have suffered a swift decline, sparking a political debate within Sweden about the role of free schools. In recent months several free school chains in Sweden have been closed or collapsed. When the results for the UK were broken down by nation, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland showed results that were very similar. But Wales dipped further down, dropping from the equivalent of 20th in science to 36th and from 27th in reading to 41st. The weak results from Wales allowed Gove to claim that the Labour government in Cardiff &quot;acts almost as a control sample,&quot; saying: &quot;It is an object lesson in what happens when you abandon reform.&quot; Huw Lewis, education minister in the Welsh government, said: &quot;Everybody working in and around the Welsh education sector needs to take a long hard look in the mirror this week. The Pisa results are stark and the message is very clear, we must improve educational attainment and standards right across the board.&quot; Lewis said that reforms \u2013 including new reading and numeracy tests, secondary school banding, and extra funding for new schools \u2013 had been introduced since 2009. &quot;There are signs of some progress in reading, but significant improvement was never likely at this stage,&quot; he said. The US had the humiliation of seeing its performance in reading, maths and science surpassed by Vietnam, which entered Pisa for the first time. American students scored below average in maths and average for reading and science, with US education secretary Arne Duncan describing the results as a &quot;picture of educational stagnation&quot;. The Pisa tests Pisa is based on a set of exams in reading, maths and science administered to a representative sample of 15-year-olds in countries that pay to take part. In 2012 some 510,000 pupils in 65 countries and regions took the paper-based exams, each two hours long and asking a mixture of multiple-choice questions and written responses. The questions are divided into six levels of difficulty and are designed to test problem-solving rather than knowledge. Nine of the world&apos;s 20 largest countries did not take part in Pisa 2012, including India and Bangladesh, while Tunisia was the only African country to take part. Although the government of China holds the exam in multiple provinces, it only releases the results from Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macao. Pisa was first launched in 2000.

Li said Beijing was prepared to discuss the issue. Cameron&apos;s move came after a Commons committee raised concerns about Britain&apos;s decision to license \u00a3600m in cryptographic equipment to China. The committee said: &quot;China is a one-party state, where there is no clear boundary between the Communist party and the private sector. It would seem highly likely that there is a real risk that some cryptographic exports that may be going into the private sector initially end up being utilised by security services in China.&quot; The prime minister&apos;s decision to raise the issue of cyber-security came on the first day of his visit to China in Beijing on Monday.

Cameron said there was a gasp when the National Theatre&apos;s War Horse appeared in the hall. It is understood that Cameron raised the issue of cyber-security during a formal plenary session with his counterpart in Beijing on Monday.

It is an issue of mutual concern and one that we should be discussing.&quot; Cameron said he was confident that Britain was doing enough to protect itself against cyber-attacks. The government&apos;s strategic defence and security review identified cyber-security as one of the main challenges of the 21st century. Government sources made clear at the time that they regarded China as the greatest threat. Cameron said: &quot;What we need to do is to up our investment in cyber-security and cyber-defence and that is exactly what GCHQ is doing. I launched with them a partnership with British industry to make sure that we properly protect ourselves. &quot;There is an enormous amount of work to be done. But I am content that if you look at the ambition in the strategic defence and security review that we have put in the resources. I think we directed something like \u00a3600m from memory into this area and I am content that good work is being done.&quot; The prime minister asked Li to agree to a more structured dialogue on cyber-security along the lines of three other areas \u2013 economic and financial, people to people and human rights. A government official said: &quot;The focus is about how do we make the internet to drive our economy without undermining security. Li basically came back and said yes, we need to have a dialogue on the issues. We will now need to go into official level and work out how we take that forward.&quot;           There were conflicting signals over Beijing&apos;s attitude to the prime minister. The Global Times, which is owned by the official Communist party People&apos;s Daily newspaper, described Britain as &quot;just an old European country apt for travel and study&quot;. It then backtracked in a later article and said that differences between Britain and China should not be allowed to harm the moves to strengthen ties. The prime minister, who angrily rejected claims that he did not raise human rights with his Chinese hosts, raised the case of Peter Humphrey and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, who run a risk advisory service.

In a sign that he is prepared to challenge the chancellor, who is highly sceptical of the allowance, the prime minister said he would like to extend the measure. Osborne will outline in the autumn statement how he will pay for the \u00a3600m costs of the \u00a31,000 allowance for basic-rate taxpayers, of whom one spouse or civil partner must be earning below the personal allowance of \u00a310,000. The chancellor believes the allowance sends an unhelpful, socially conservative message. But he accepts he must support Cameron, who went out of his way on Tuesday to talk about the way in which he works &quot;hand in glove&quot; with Osborne. Speaking in Shanghai, the prime minister dashed the hopes of Tories on the right who want him to offer hope for middle-income earners drawn over the 40p tax threshold as a result of inflation, a process known as &quot;fiscal drag&quot;. He said he would focus instead on building up marriage tax allowance and raising the personal tax allowance for low-income earners. &quot;We will be making this change to back marriage in the tax system,&quot; Cameron said. &quot;It&apos;s something I have long wanted to do, so I am pleased we will be achieving it. I believe in marriage, I believe marriage should be recognised in the tax system. I see this as, yes, a start of something I would like to extend further.&quot; Cameron indicated that he might be prepared to outflank Nick Clegg, who has called for the personal allowance to be increased to \u00a310,500 by April 2015. There are suggestions that Cameron may be prepared to see this rise to \u00a310,750 by then. The prime minister said: &quot;Lifting the income tax threshold benefits all but the richest because it does benefit people on middle and even higher levels of pay. By next April it will be worth around \u00a3705 to the typical taxpayer, so I think it&apos;s been a very good way of trying to help families with their finances at a difficult time, but recognising that there should be a benefit as we keep the costs of government down and pay down the deficit.&quot; Cameron said that, in an ideal world, he would cut taxes. But he dashed the hopes of the Free Enterprise Group who have been calling for tax cuts for middle-income earners when he said that he had to prioritise the elimination of the structural budget deficit. &quot;I&apos;m a low-tax Tory, I believe in allowing people to keep more of their own money to spend as they choose; that&apos;s a very important part of my political views, always has been and always will be. But I&apos;m also a fiscal conservative, I believe the first duty of government is to safeguard our economy, and the economy isn&apos;t safeguarded properly until you deal with your deficit and make sure that you&apos;re in a position where future problems that could come down the road, you&apos;re able to absorb them.&quot; The prime minister went out of his way to say he works closely with the chancellor. He said: &quot;I have a very, very strong relationship with the chancellor. We work together hand in glove. &quot;I often ponder how I simply don&apos;t understand how government could have functioned when the relationship did between Blair and Brown got as bad as it did. It&apos;s only when you&apos;re prime minister that you see how impossible that must have been. &quot;It&apos;s an extremely good relationship \u2013 we work very, very closely together.

Significant achievement gaps remain in Australia based on gender, Indigenous status, location and wealth. The difference between students from the highest and lowest socio-economic categories is equivalent to two-and-a-half years of schooling, according to an analysis conducted by the Australian council for educational research (ACER). Australia\u2019s biggest decline in the OECD\u2019s programme for international student assessment was in the mathematics section, in a finding immediately seized on by the Abbott government as evidence more money for schools did not improve results. The government also portrayed the figures as a repudiation of the long-running education union policy to reduce class sizes. But Labor and the Greens argued the results were a \u201cwake up call\u201d showing the importance of fully implementing the needs-based funding system outlined by David Gonski\u2019s review, ensuring the aim was not undermined by freedom for states to cut their contributions. The education minister, Christopher Pyne, said Australia\u2019s international ranking in mathematical literacy had dropped from 15th in 2009 to 19th in 2012, while its ranking in scientific literacy fell from 10th to 16th, and its placing in reading literacy decreased from 9th to 14th. These ranking are based on the raw mean scores. But taking into account statistically insignificant differences between countries and economies, Australia performed equal 17th in mathematics, equal 8th in science and equal 10th in reading, according to analysis conducted by ACER. Asian nations and economies again dominated the results, with Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei, Korea, Macao and Japan leading the pack in mathematical literacy. Australia was also outperformed by Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Netherlands, Estonia, Finland, Canada, Poland, Belgium and Germany. PISA testing of 15-year-old students occurs every three years. The director of educational monitoring and research at ACER, Sue Thomson, said Australia\u2019s slip backwards in mathematics and reading skills over the past decade was cause for concern. She said the mean mathematical literacy performance declined between 2003 and 2012 by the equivalent of more than half a year of schooling. \u201cWhile the maths and reading skills of Australian students have been declining, countries such as Poland and Ireland have improved their performance, enabling them to leapfrog over Australia. Poland has been steadily improving since 2000 and is now ahead of Australia in maths, while Ireland has successfully reversed its own downward trend and now outperforms Australia in reading,\u201d she said in a statement. Thomson said Australia\u2019s mathematical literacy performance declined more for girls than it did for boys. \u201cWhile the overall PISA mathematics score for Australia is still higher than the OECD average, the score for girls has dropped so it is equal to the OECD average. Further, student questionnaire responses collected as part of PISA reveal that Australian girls hold much more negative beliefs than Australian boys about mathematics and learning mathematics.\u201d Days after he found an extra $1.2bn for school funding, restoring the original $2.8bn four-year commitment, Pyne said the results showed more funding did not equate to better outcomes. Pyne said results were declining despite big increases in education spending over the past decade, including on laptops and school halls. He argued teacher quality was critical to lifting student outcomes. He was concerned Australia\u2019s high performing students were not doing as well as students from other countries and its low performing students were struggling. \u201cWe must take note of the decline in our international performance. PISA shows us that our education system is high-equity where socio-economic status matters less when compared to other OECD countries, but there is a large variation in individual schools between high performing and low performing students,\u201d Pyne said in a statement. The education minister later took a swipe at the political Left for being \u201cmesmerised\u201d by teacher-student ratios, saying Australia\u2019s class sizes were below the OECD average yet had not stopped the decline in outcomes. But he told reporters he would leave it up to the states, territories and non-government school sector to decide their own policies on class sizes. The Greens argued the results should place act as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the Abbott government over the need to fully implement the needs-based school funding reforms in every state and territory. The party\u2019s spokeswoman on schools, Penny Wright, said Australia had a large gap between the highest and lowest performing students. \u201cBy ditching the Gonski model in favour of no-strings-attached funding for Queensland, the Northern Territory and Queensland, Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne are ensuring disadvantage will continue, holding back Australia\u2019s global performance,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt is deplorable that in the 21st century, indigenous students are two and a half years behind non-indigenous students, and that kids in remote areas are as much as 18 months behind children in the city.\u201d The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the government should not conclude from the results that the answer was not to increase school funding. He said Labor had done its \u201chomework\u201d by commissioning the Gonski review and demanded it be implemented in full. \u201cNow if you&apos;re going to change something as big as the educational ship of state and make it steer in a different direction you can&apos;t do that overnight,\u201d Shorten said.

The campaign, which was a roaring success, has trained 96,000 blind masseurs who are now working at 13,735 massage parlours. It is a matter of debate whether this is an example of social enterprise but it is evidence that social benefit through business has potential in the world&apos;s most populous country. As a wealthy middle class has emerged in the past 20 years in China, charity donations have risen too, only to be set back by corruption scandals. Charities have struggled and it has been argued the social enterprise model is perhaps better suited to the Chinese culture and industrious spirit. &quot;There is a strong entrepreneurial culture and social expectation that the wealthy must give back to society,&quot; says David Hayward Evans, head of philanthropy and values-based investing for the Asia Pacific at investment bank UBS. Edwards also edited the English version of a recently published report on social enterprise in China. The report found that social enterprise is &quot;nascent&quot; in China and already there are many notable and successful programmes such as Aba Qiang Embroidery Support. The social enterprise was one of the more hopeful stories to come out of the 2008 earthquake. It encourages disaster-affected women to produce traditional Qiang embroidery, this helps protect their cultural heritage as well as providing employment. There are now 14 stores across China allowing rural women to earn money without having to leave home (the migration of adults to work in urban factories is a challenge for rural communities). A precedent for Chinese social enterprises was set in 1949 in the form of welfare enterprises - these organisations received tax breaks for employing a certain percentage of disabled people. However since a peak in 1995, welfare enterprises have declined in number. &quot;The tax refund used to be quite attractive and now the amount of money is not that attractive at all,&quot; says Ding Li, vice-president of Not-Profit Incubator (NPI) in Shanghai, which was set up in 2005 to support third sector growth in China. &quot;The tax refund has very rigid conditions, 25% of your workforce have to be disabled and have a local registration card (a houkou) to get the benefits. And the amount of money you get back is not that much.&quot; The UBS report recommends that the government increases subsidies and tax benefits towards welfare enterprises again, and extends preferential treatment to social enterprises as they are clearly successful. Social enterprise in China received a boost in 2009 when the British Council started its Skills for Social Entrepreneurs project. To date the programme has trained 1,200 social entrepreneurs and in 2010, a homegrown project began when NPI and the Shanghai civil affairs bureau opened the first social enterprise incubator in the country, called The Nest. &quot;The programme provides intensive capacity building for NGOs, trains social entrepreneurs, offers on-site job training and employment opportunities to disabled people,&quot; says Leigh-Anne Russell, project director of The Nest. The Nest supported 30 organisations creating 180 jobs for disabled people at its previous location. &quot;After the first phase of leasing we have reached 40% capacity with 20 organisations signed up and 13 physically on site,&quot; says Russell. &quot;These are a mixture of social enterprises, NGOs and community organisations.&quot; After initial support from the Shanghai local government, The Nest now has six months to become financially self-sufficient. &quot;This financial responsibility is a new situation and is currently The Nest program&apos;s main challenge: how to shift strategy and develop new business models to ensure sustainability,&quot; says Russell. The Chinese entrepreneurial spirit, combined with an ingrained belief in contributing to a social good, suggests a positive future for social enterprise in the world&apos;s second largest economy. &quot;The government sees the need for these new approaches to create more diverse and effective social resources,&quot; says Hayward Evans. &quot;There are domestic sources of capital available and an expectation that business will make a social contribution. For the first time, there are increasing numbers of young graduates looking at alternative career paths, and an opportunity to make a difference.

This weekend it is French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault talking nuclear power. Next week there will be Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop. Welcome to Beijing, the must-visit destination for world leaders who need cash or clout. Rarely a week goes by without some leading dignitary passing through. African leaders come seeking investment or offering land deals. Europeans swing by eager for access to Chinese markets (Angela Merkel is almost a regular in Beijing, and Vladimir Putin&apos;s first overseas visit after his return to the presidency last year was Beijing). The principal reason is obvious: the world&apos;s second-largest economy is primed to invest abroad, and western nations are in no position to wave it away. But the promised land has a dark side \u2013 for many western leaders, China&apos;s economic allure has eclipsed its unscrupulous politics. They know that criticising China&apos;s treatment of dissidents, its repressive ethnic policies and its increasing aggression abroad will carry an economic price. They&apos;re afraid of getting burned. &quot;I think China obviously uses its growing economic power to send a clear message, or signal, to foreign leaders,&quot; said Jingdong Yuan, an expert in international affairs at Sydney university&apos;s centre for international security studies. &quot;The Chinese government might close some doors, or make things more difficult if they see foreign leaders deliberately challenge their interests.&quot; Analysts have criticised Cameron&apos;s three-day trip to Beijing, which ended on Wednesday, as little more than an extended apology for meeting the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in 2012, causing Beijing to freeze inter-ministerial Sino-UK ties. During the trip, he played table tennis with Chinese schoolchildren, traipsed along Shanghai&apos;s Bund with a prominent entrepreneur, and opened an account on Sina Weibo, China&apos;s most popular microblog. Yet what Cameron neglected to do is arguably more significant. He did not criticise China for its recent unilateral declaration of administrative control over a swath of airspace in the east China sea, bringing territorial disputes with Japan to a boil. He did not mention China&apos;s human rights record, its environmental degradation, nor the Dalai Lama. Biden, who left Beijing on Thursday night, did tackle a few tough issues: in meetings with China&apos;s president Xi Jinping and premier Li Keqiang, he emphasised that Washington has a &quot;firm position and expectations&quot; on the country&apos;s behaviour in the east China sea. He strongly criticised China for withholding visas from foreign journalists as retaliation for critical coverage, and encouraged a group of US visa applicants to &quot;challenge the government&quot;, espousing the rejection of orthodoxy as a traditional American value. Minxin Pei, an expert on Chinese politics at Claremont McKenna College in California, said: &quot;The Americans still say what they want, regarding human rights in China and Tibet, but western European leaders have been quite effectively intimidated \u2013 China has succeeded in teaching them a so-called lesson. No leader who dares to have a meeting with the Dalai Lama can escape punishment by Beijing.&quot; Cameron arrived in China with more than 130 businesspeople, the UK&apos;s largest trade delegation, and signed a raft of deals. He pushed for an EU-China free trade agreement and Chinese investment in a British high-speed rail project. He signed a \u00a345m deal to export pig semen to China, to improve the quality of the country&apos;s pork. Yet the outcomes of such vaunted trade deals are often unclear, said Pei \u2013 on official visits, both sides&apos; top priorities are ultimately image-related. European leaders want to prove that they&apos;re leveraging China&apos;s economic resources for benefits at home. Chinese leaders wants to show domestic audiences that they occupy the high ground over western, democratic societies. &quot;I think Chinese leaders are smart enough to know that they&apos;re not going to change the suspicion, the ideological hostility towards China in the West,&quot; said Pei. &quot;But they&apos;re going to squeeze every bit of PR out of these visits that they can.&quot; Jonathan Holslag, a research fellow at the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China Studies, said that since president Xi and premier Li took the reins last autumn, they have proved far more straightforward than their predecessors. Western politicians have been cowed. &quot;I think the Chinese have learned to play the game very well \u2013 and it&apos;s not a game of real power, it&apos;s a game of protocol, and it&apos;s a game of pretence,&quot; he said. &quot;This creates a sort of vicious cycle.

Investment bank UBS has been called in to &quot;assess the options&quot; for the company and its owners, and help raise funds for further international expansion as demand grows for Kidston&apos;s distinctively British brand of 1950s nostalgia. The floral empire is blooming, and now has 136 outlets, including a flagship store on London&apos;s Piccadilly which opened this week. In addition to the new London store, located in a prime spot next to Fortnum &amp; Mason and stocking more than 20,000 separate product lines, the Cath Kidston outlets include standalone stores, concessions and pop-up shops. Less than half are in the UK. The chain is one of Britain&apos;s fastest growing retailers, but its owners believe there is room for further expansion. There are already four Chinese stores, but all of them are in Shanghai and the ambition is to target other big cities in China and elsewhere. In a statement, the company said: &quot;Cath Kidston is growing rapidly and has exciting plans to capitalise on the international appeal of its brand. In these circumstances it is prudent that the company and its owners should carefully assess the options available to take the company through the next stage in its evolution and UBS has been appointed to help.&quot; TA, which is headquartered in Boston, bought into the company in 2010. Kidston remained as creative director and retains a 23% stake, with other management holding the final 12%. It is unclear whether she plans to reduce her stake as part of the current process. Kidston trained as an interior designer under the society decorator Nicky Haslam before branching out on her own, and switched her attention to retailing after opening her first store in 1993. Selling vintage fabrics and salvaged furniture revived with a lick of brightly coloured paint, its wares were a hit with housewives in London&apos;s exclusive Holland Park neighbourhood. Then a mistake made during an order left her with more duvet covers than she could sell. Kidston took to her sewing machine and transformed the surplus bedlinen into cushions, washbags and padded coathangers, and the homewares business was born. The year before TA took control, Cath Kiston&apos;s turnover stood at \u00a331m and the store count at 27. In March this year, sales passed the \u00a3100m mark for the first time, growing 19% to \u00a3105m. Hailed as the new Laura Ashley for the romantic appeal of her designs, Kidston credits her English country house childhood with inspiring her look \u2013 her cousin is the television presenter Kirstie Allsopp and her uncle was chairman of Christie&apos;s.

As many of you will know, Samsung has offered commitments to address our competition concerns in relation to its use of injunctions. Samsung essentially proposes not to enjoin companies which are willing to have the dispute settled by a court or arbitrator. We have market-tested these commitments and will take account of the feedback when we discuss with Samsung possible improvements to their commitments in the coming weeks.

That&apos;s 16.5m people.

Here&apos;s the deal, YouTube user GhostlyRich posted a video on YouTube in early December that showed that his Samsung Galaxy S4 caught fire while charging. While the battery did not explode (thankfully) you can clearly see the charging port is burnt. To no surprise, a burnt charging point rendered the device useless and seeing that the Phone is still under warranty, you would think Samsung would simply exchange the device and make good with the consumer to fix the issue. Wrong. What Samsung has done, foolishly, is sent the user a document saying that they will exchange his defective device only after he pulls his initial video from YouTube. If Samsung was unaware of how the internet works, it&apos;s about to find out that trying to quiet the user will result in a black eye for the company.  Original video: 45,000 views.

Siri, Topsy, and the web \u2013 context is everything &gt;&gt; getwired.com Wes Miller:   Many people have said Topsy was acquired to enhance advertising or iTunes content. Both are tangentially right. But ads have never appeared to be a primary focus for Apple \u2013 which makes sense, because the customer they build their hardware, software, and services for usually isn&apos;t a fan of ads. That said, the analytics from Topsy Pro could well wind up integrated into iAds. We&apos;ll see in time.\u00a0As for content discovery? Sure, that&apos;ll happen too, and people will buy content as a result of their searches. But I don&apos;t believe that this is what this acquisition was about. People expect Siri to be able to answer their queries, and if it can&apos;t, they disengage from the service, and potentially from Apple&apos;s platform, if they don&apos;t find that it just works the way they expect. That&apos;s why I believe Topsy has everything to do with Siri, and that&apos;s where the team will end up, and how we&apos;ll see the technology demonstrated at WWDC next summer.  &quot;The human condition&quot; (GIF) Queueing theory: in practice.

CMAP: &quot;Why do you use Microsoft Word?&quot; &gt;&gt; Charlie&apos;s Diary Charlie Stross:   I try to avoid Microsoft Word like the plague, but I have my limits.

There was no slack time in the proposed production cycle for those books: they were to come out at one month intervals in the UK in the spring and early summer of 2013.

It said the haze had unified Chinese people, as they found solidarity in their complaints; equalised them, as both rich and poor people were vulnerable to its effects; enlightened them, as they realised the cost of rapid growth; and &quot;made Chinese people more humorous&quot;, as smog-related jokes proliferated on the internet. It had also helped to educate people, it said. &quot;Our knowledge of meteorology, geography, physics, chemistry and history has progressed.&quot; The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid published by the Communist party&apos;s official People&apos;s Daily, added one more advantage: the smog could bolster China&apos;s military defences by affecting guided missile systems. &quot;Smog may affect people&apos;s health and daily lives. But on the battlefield it can serve as a defensive advantage in military operations,&quot; it said. The article buttressed its argument with a list of historical precedents, such as Serbian soldiers burning tyres to impede Nato planes.

In a repetition of the 1973 flotilla that heralded the end of atmospheric testing by the French in Muroroa, five yachts set out to forestall the deep sea drilling intentions of oil company Anadarko off the North Island&apos;s west coast. They returned on 1 December, having prevented nothing but their message is clear. New Zealand might be peaceful politically but it is not a pushover. The permits granted by the government for oil exploration in much of the deep ocean that surrounds our beautiful coastline are not to every New Zealander&apos;s liking and will be met by similar actions. Thousands lined the country&apos;s beaches recently to express their support for those few who spent 10 days 160km off shore, surrounding Anadarko&apos;s ship. In the 1980s the actions of an initial few led to the passing of our nuclear-free legislation. The nuclear threat remains but that posed by climate change is even more certain. Citizens everywhere must do what they can to persuade governments to reprioritise their energy agendas.Pat BaskettAuckland, New Zealand \u2022 In response to Margaret Wilkes&apos;s letter asking for suggestions on how to convince Australians that global warming is real: imagine heating your home with coal or wood but not venting the smoke and gases to the outside through a chimney. You&apos;d overheat and suffocate yourself in short order. It&apos;s the same principle with the planet. Since we can&apos;t vent our fossil-fuel production of heat and gases into outer space, it stays under our roof, our atmosphere. It&apos;s a bigger home, of course. But the area is finite. Eventually we overheat the room and poison ourselves.Bill HansonLeavenworth, Washington, US \u2022 Wow, who knew? This is no common revelation to find that there is a link between fast food and success in the world of international power diplomacy (29 November).

Since it&apos;s particularly difficult to hold your head up high when the church is so often \u2013 and rightly \u2013 pilloried in the media, I was delighted to read Jonathan Freedland&apos;s celebratory article: &quot;The pope may have no army, no battalions or divisions, but he has a pulpit \u2013 and right now he is using it to be the world&apos;s loudest and clearest voice against the status quo&quot; (22 November). Catholicism is as deep in me as race or gender; I can&apos;t simply extirpate it when it gets uncomfortable, any more than I can renounce being Australian. What&apos;s more, I&apos;m a convert, for hidden at the heart of the deeply flawed institution is a pearl of great price, living water I&apos;ve found nowhere else despite a lifetime of searching. And now, under the current papacy, there&apos;s a real possibility of composting some of the worst aspects of the monolith: a hierarchy that can abuse power as corruptly as any of the juntas whose redemption we pray for, body-hatred and damning of sexuality, and above all patriarchy that blights its structures, liturgy, language, morality and doctrine. Might Pope Francis be midwife to the rebirth of a church congruent with its founding vision, with Christ as iconoclast, prophet, mystery, and exemplar of justice, mercy, compassion and truth? Alleluia.Annie MarchHobart, Tasmania, Australia Nuclear price is too high In warning about the consequences of the likely catastrophe resulting from a nuclear reactor accident, Naomi Hirose from Tepco introduces a new concept into risk analysis \u2013 the prospect that the price of any serious accident would be too great to pay (29 November). Risk analysis indicates that the risk of a nuclear accident is extremely small. However, if that remote chance occurred, could we afford to pay for the consequences? If you take case of Hinkley Point: a serious meltdown accompanied by a large release of radioactivity into a westerly wind would probably render much of southern England uninhabitable. The costs, both economic and social, would be totally unsustainable. Any such event is extremely unlikely, but the awareness of the possibility of a meltdown did not deter the flawed &quot;safety&quot; test at Chernobyl, which rendered a huge area of the Ukraine uninhabitable, nor prevent the construction of a reactor close to the sea in an earthquake/tsunami zone at Fukushima. Thus to normal risk analysis, should we perhaps not add the further criterion: can you afford to pay the price if the extremely unlikely actually happens?Peter BorrellNewcastle, UK Cities are not that cool Simon Jenkins (15 November) may consider cities to be cool, but they are rapidly becoming pass\u00e9; digital technology means the rationale for capital and labour concentration is over. Cities may persist as theme parks, offering nostalgia and sensation for tourists and &quot;hipsters&quot;, but the city as we know it is doomed. This is evidenced by desperate attempts at civic boosterism and mega-projects, all intended to prop up what is, in fact, an expiring entity. As for elected mayors, we have one here in Toronto; no doubt many readers have read of his exploits. He was elected with 47% of the vote, out of a total turnout of 53%. Just be advised that if you want elected mayors, be sure that councils can get rid of them easily should they prove to be unstable - another election can sometimes be a long time off.Peter R SaundersToronto, Canada Who is Lady Gaga?

Also, Bradman was not subjected to long periods of travel \u2013 and when he did tour, it was in great comfort \u2013 nor to the constantly high level of opposition, not to mention the numerous forms of the game played today. Tendulkar has displayed remarkable consistency over his 25 years plus career. His stats reflect that: 200 Tests, 329 innings, 15,921 runs, 51 centuries. Time for the Bradman cult to fade into memory.Grahame WoodsCobourg, Ontario, Canada Briefly \u2022 By splitting away from the Communist party of England (Marxist-Leninist) in order to form the deliciously Pythonesque-sounding Workers&apos; Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, Aravindan Balakrishnan seemed determined to cover all the bases (29\u00a0November).Dave RobinsonNewstead, Tasmania, Australia \u2022 &quot;Stephen Harper&apos;s government&quot; and &quot;Canada&quot; are not necessarily identical \u2013 so please, make it not &quot;Canada&quot;, but &quot;Canada&apos;s Harper government has dropped any remaining pretence of supporting global action on climate change, etc&quot; (22 November).Julia FortinCourtenay, British Columbia, Canada Please send letters to weekly.letters@theguardian.com ", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2013-12-10T13:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/portugal-golden-visas-housing-market", "sentences": ["So much so that in July he hired Yansi Xu to represent the firm in Shanghai."], "title": "Portugal offers golden visas to rich foreigners", "article": "Pascal Gon\u00e7alves, who started the Casa em Portugal (House in Portugal) estate agent&apos;s, soon realised that the future of his venture depended on what happened abroad. Debt and austerity measures were threatening to swamp his business in Lisbon, Oporto and on the Algarve coast. So in 2010 he opened a branch in Paris, and another one in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, the following year. In 2012 he opted for Caracas and Luanda, the capital cities of Venezuela and Angola, respectively. He told them about the attractive houses and flats in his home country, with their characteristic azulejos (painted, tin-glazed) tiles. In October 2012 Pedro Passos Coelho&apos;s centre-right government introduced the vistos dourados (golden visas) scheme in a bid to boost VAT revenue and halt the drain on capital. Foreigners purchasing property worth more than \u20ac500,000 ($685,000) would qualify for a five-year visa to Portugal, and consequently the European Union. Gon\u00e7alves had backed the right horse. &quot;Since then we&apos;ve been booming,&quot; Gon\u00e7alves says with a smile. So much so that in July he hired Yansi Xu to represent the firm in Shanghai. &quot;The Chinese are our best customers, ahead of Brazilians and Angolans,&quot; he adds. Buying property is not the only way of qualifying for a visa and access to the Schengen area. Another option is to make an investment exceeding \u20ac1m or giving rise to 10 new jobs in Portugal. The rules, published a year ago, took some time to gain public attention, but middle-class buyers in emerging countries have certainly got the message. According to the Portuguese foreign ministry, quoted by AFP, 356 residence permits have been granted to investors, including 279 Chinese, 16 Russians, 10 Brazilians and nine Angolans. This adds up to about \u20ac222m invested in Portugal. &quot;It&apos;s crazy,&quot; says Michel Veloso Viera, a lawyer who assists foreigners with the paperwork. &quot;I&apos;m getting an average of 10 applications a week from Chinese families.&quot; Nor is Portugal the only country to be soliciting rich immigrants. Spain, Cyprus, Greece and the Netherlands have deployed similar schemes, in a bid to make up for falling investment, fill homes left vacant by the crisis and kickstart consumption. At a time when immigration is such a sensitive issue, this initiative, endorsed by Brussels, may seem surprising. Particularly as after five years a golden visa may lead to Portuguese nationality, Veloso Viera explains. Yet there has been little criticism of the scheme in Lisbon, apart from the leader of the far-right National Renovator party, Jos\u00e9 Pinto-Coelho, who claims that his country is &quot;prostituting itself&quot;. So far even the Socialist opposition has tacitly approved the move. &quot;We&apos;re adopting a cautious stance. The origin of funds must be checked, but it does encourage foreign investors, and if it can help our country ...&quot; says the Socialist spokesperson on economic affairs. The priority is to get Portugal back on its feet. Having survived since 2011, thanks to financial assistance worth \u20ac78bn from the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and Brussels, the country is keen to see the back of the troika as soon as possible. On the whole the Portuguese do not resent the tax breaks awarded to foreigners, even inside the EU. Although families are suffering from austerity policies, which have axed bonuses and increased tax, they are not unduly bothered by the idea that physicians, architects, senior executives and company directors \u2013 and all the others on the list of high added-value professions \u2013 settling in the country should qualify for a 20% cap on income tax. In France, where exasperation at rising taxes is particularly acute, the scheme seems appealing. &quot;There&apos;s not been a sudden rush, but certainly growing interest,&quot; says Carlos Vinhas Pereira, the head of the Franco-Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olivier, who operates a string of salad bars in fashionable Paris neighbourhoods, is adamant that the tax incentives did not prompt him to &quot;drop everything&quot; and start the same venture in Lisbon, about which he knew nothing a year ago. It all started, he maintains, with a national insurance inspection last January during which he and his employee were &quot;treated like dirt&quot;. He was so disgusted he decided to move to Portugal, citing the &quot;booming travel trade&quot; in Lisbon, but also the &quot;low wages, sunshine, cheap rents&quot; and direct flights several times a day. Sufficient to convince him to leave with his wife and children in January.

But in September Stephanie Flanders quit the corporation, joining Wall Street giant JP Morgan as a strategist for its asset management business, on a rumoured salary of \u00a3400,000 a year (before bonus). The former presenter of BBC2&apos;s Masters of Money, who once wrote speeches for US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, is no longer analysing what others say, but presenting her own views and advice. So what nuggets of wisdom does the 45-year-old Flanders \u2013 who in the 1990s briefly dated both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls \u2013 have for us now she no longer has to maintain BBC neutrality? Just three weeks after joining JP Morgan Asset Management she gave her first question and answer session to journalists. Where should we be putting our money in 2014?   It&apos;s emerging markets and Europe that interest Flanders most. China&apos;s stock markets have been weak over the past year, seriously underperforming Wall Street or the FTSE. The Shanghai Composite index is down nearly 10% since February, and is still trading at little more than a third of the peak level it hit in October 2007. Contrast that with the Dow Jones index in New York, which is at an all-time high, and the FTSE 100, which has recovered to its pre-financial crisis level, albeit still marginally below its end-1999 peak. &quot;I think that if you are brave and prepared for the bumps along the way, then emerging markets look cheap at the moment. An intelligent approach to Europe would also pay off, if you take advantage of the differentiation between European economies, including those outside of the Eurozone. It&apos;s time to be overweight in emerging market and European equities. I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;m pulling all my money out of the US or the UK, but they don&apos;t look cheap compared to Europe.&quot; She says the US and UK stock markets look surprisingly high, given that we are only just coming out of recession. &quot;Financial markets [in the US and UK] are at a level you&apos;d expect to see in a mature recovery,&quot; she warns. When will the Bank of England raise interest rates?   The Bank of England says it won&apos;t consider raising interest rates until unemployment drops to 7% or below, and Flanders is of the view that won&apos;t be in 2014, and may not even be in 2015. &quot;I continue to hope it will be a long time yet, and that the Bank of England will err on the side of lower for longer. That was very clear from the speech that Mark Carney gave this week.&quot; Is the euro out of the woods? Although Flanders thinks European stock markets are good value, she says smaller companies, vital to job creation and growth, are struggling to find capital to survive or expand. She worries that companies in the periphery countries, such as Greece, Spain and Portugal, are having to pay significantly higher interest rates to borrow compared with their German rivals, although there are signs that &quot;in the last few months those rates have strated to come down&quot;. But, she adds: &quot;The flow of credit in the eurozone is still one of its biggest challenges. Small and medium-sized companies are the most affected by this, and they are more important in the peripheral European economies compared to the US, UK and Germany.&quot; What should George Osborne be doing that he&apos;s not doing?   Getting British companies investing, boosting productivity and exporting \u2013 and improving the nation&apos;s infrastructure. &quot;Investment as a share of GDP is lower than it has been for 30 years. But the Treasury is designed in every fibre of its being to say &apos;no&apos; to whatever scheme is put in front of it,&quot; Flanders says. &quot;Osborne also needs to do more directly to support capital investment. There is a lot of cash that companies are sitting on, and we should be making it more worthwhile for companies to invest that, such as better capital allowances. &quot;We need real earnings to pick up and for productivity to improve. During the recession we saw the protection of human capital and we maintained employment levels, but the downside is the shortfall in productivity that resulted. We need to make that up.&quot; How strong is the economic recovery? Flanders points to figures which show that, in most developed countries, the &quot;purchasing managers index&quot; \u2013 which reflects levels of economic confidence \u2013 is on the up. &quot;People aren&apos;t just trying to be optimistic. Fiscal austerity is going to be much less. Last year the US economy grew despite an unprecedented amount of tightening. If the US can do that against a negative fiscal thrust, it makes you think next year is going to be a better year \u2026 even a fairly sombre view of the economic perspective in the UK should see us growing faster than the Office of Budget Responsibility suggests.&quot; What is the risk that the economic recovery will fizzle out?   The big debate in economics, says Flanders, is between those who say there is a big output gap \u2013 who believe that the UK economy can grow briskly for quite a few years before it hits a wall of inflation and interest rate rises \u2013 and those who say that despite the recession there is little spare capacity in the economy, and therefore it can&apos;t grow much from here. Flanders is broadly on the side of the optimists. &quot;We should be wary of writing off the recovery before the economy has even got back to where it was.&quot; Is everything you say now scripted by JP Morgan? Are you missing the cameras?   No, insists Flanders. &quot;The BBC was wonderful, but I was there for 11 years in total, and I really don&apos;t miss being in the limelight. I am getting used to the thrill of having my own opinions, and they [JP Morgan] really want me to be saying what I think, although I suspect that if they thought I was a raving communist they wouldn&apos;t have hired me.&quot;", "tags": ["Investments", "Investment funds", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Stephanie Flanders", "BBC", "Media", "JP Morgan", "Banking", "Economics", "Bank of England", "Business", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-10T16:48:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/12/china-coal-emissions-smog-deaths", "sentences": ["In some eastern cities including Shanghai, levels were off the index that tracks dangerous pollution, with schools closing and flights being cancelled or diverted."], "title": "China's coal emissions responsible for 'quarter of a million premature deaths'", "article": "Emissions from coal plants in China were responsible for a quarter of a million premature deaths in 2011 and are damaging the health of hundreds of thousands of Chinese children, according to a new study. The study by a US air pollution expert, commissioned by Greenpeace, comes as many areas in northern and eastern China have been experiencing hazardous levels of air pollution in recent weeks. In some eastern cities including Shanghai, levels were off the index that tracks dangerous pollution, with schools closing and flights being cancelled or diverted. Sales of air purifiers and face masks have soared with many retailers selling out of stock as residents try to protect themselves from the poisonous smog. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces visibility was reduced to less than 50 metres earlier this week and in the city of Nanjing a red alert for pollution was maintained for five consecutive days. The analysis traced the chemicals which are made airborne from burning coal and found a number of health damages were caused as a result. It estimates that coal burning in China was responsible for reducing the lives of 260,000 people in 2011. It also found that in the same year it led to 320,000 children and 61,000 adults suffering from asthma, 36,000 babies being born with low weight and was responsible for 340,000 hospital visits and 141 million days of sick leave. &quot;This study provides an unprecedentedly detailed picture of the health fallout from China&apos;s coal burning,&quot; said Dr Andrew Gray, a US-based expert on air pollution, who conducted the research. Using computer simulations, Gray said he was able to &quot;draw a clear map tracing the trail of health damages left by the coal fumes released by every power plant in China, untangling the contribution of individual companies, provinces and power stations to the air pollution crisis gripping the country.&quot; China&apos;s air pollution problems frequently make headlines around the world. Isabel Hilton, editor of China Dialogue, an independent website that publishes information and debate on the environment in China, said coal is the main cause of the country&apos;s air pollution problems. Coal burning in China &quot;produces heavy metal pollution and produces particulate pollution on a scale that is getting quite extraordinary,&quot; she said. China is the world&apos;s largest consumer of coal, which is its main energy source, and is responsible for around half the world&apos;s coal consumption. The impacts of its reliance on coal are becoming more well known and recently there was much online discussion after an eight-year-old girl was diagnosed with lung cancer which her doctor blamed on air pollution. According to Gray&apos;s study, while the growth of coal consumption has slowed, 570 new coal-fired plants are either being built or are planned, and if they go ahead would be responsible for a further 32,000 premature deaths each year. In September, the Chinese government announced a plan to tackle the high levels of air pollution including for the first time measures to cut coal consumption. Under the plan, China aims to cut air pollution in some of the worst affected areas including Beijing by 2017. Hilton said that the reductions in the plan would not be enough to make a difference within a short time frame. &quot;It is going to be difficult to make a difference very shortly. Much more radical things will have to happen,&quot; she said. &quot;The government has been forced into much greater transparency on the data,&quot; she added. &quot;But I do think the ambition has to be raised quite a lot.&quot;", "tags": ["Pollution", "Coal", "Environment", "Fossil fuels", "Energy", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-12T03:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/dec/15/inditex-spain-global-fashion-powerhouse", "sentences": ["Basic trends have almost global appeal, with Inditex&apos;s shoppers in Shanghai, New York and London happy to wear similar items, according to Garcia.", "Bringing all its products to Spain may seem efficient now, but Inditex&apos;s increasing strength in Shanghai and Beijing may yet mean the Arteixo model will need to be transferred to a small town in China."], "title": "Inditex: Spain's fashion powerhouse you've probably never heard of", "article": "On an unremarkable corner of Calle Juan Florez, a block away from the main shopping street in the Galician city of La Coru\u00f1a, Christmas party outfits are dramatically lit in windows glinting with gold and mirrors. The small Zara store, which winds around the doorway of an ageing office building that is also home to a firm of lawyers, was first opened in 1975 by Amancio Ortega, a local clothing manufacturer who had worked his way up from being a delivery boy at a shirtmakers. This is the seed that blossomed into Inditex, an empire that has shrugged off Spain&apos;s economic troubles to become the world&apos;s largest fashion retailer, with more than 6,400 stores in 86 markets and a rapidly growing online business. More than 120,000 people work for the company, 4,400 of them at the HQ near its La Coru\u00f1a birthplace. Ortega himself, 77 and still on the board, is now the third-richest person in the world, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $57bn (\u00a335bn). Inditex is valued at \u20ac69bn (\u00a358bn) on the stock market but is still growing so fast that it is about to double the size of its head office in Arteixo, Galicia, for the second time since it opened in 2000. The building is also the headquarters of Zara, Inditex&apos;s biggest chain. The company&apos;s seven other brands, including Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Pull &amp; Bear and Uterq\u00fce, have their own headquarters dotted around Spain, some near Barcelona and others further south. In Arteixo, Inditex still manufactures and designs its own clothing to an almost unique system created to put the customer in charge. Ortega, who has a majority stake in the company, is highly protective of his personal privacy and hardly ever photographed. He does not speak to the press. However, he is well known at the company headquarters, going in nearly every day to discuss everything from property to fashion with Inditex staffers at all levels. But the culture of secrecy means that only a handful of journalists have been allowed behind the wall of blue-mirrored windows which give the Arteixo offices the feel of a Bond villain-style lair, albeit one nestled between a fish factory and a power station. The Observer is the first British newspaper to be allowed a close look at how this company has developed its global appeal despite hardly buying any advertising, and has kept profits and sales rolling during a tough autumn and winter for fashion stores. Its processes have allowed it to deal with unseasonably warm weather by turning its operations around to produce more dresses, and pull back some of the coats and jackets that usually sell well in November. At Zara&apos;s British online store there is no sign of the discounting loudly blasting from rivals&apos; websites because it has not been lumbered with as much of the wrong kind of stock. When the weather turns against them, most retailers must plough ahead with plans made more than six months in advance, the clothes made and sent out to stores via a centrally controlled system. Slight local changes might be possible, but large groups of stores get similar stock. At Inditex, every store receives a tailored assortment, right down to the number of T-shirts, delivered twice a week. Just over half the stock will be designed and manufactured less than a month before it hits the shop floor. Even prices can vary considerably between countries. Shoppers in Spain, Portugal and Greece can buy the clothes as much as 30% cheaper than elsewhere in Europe or overseas markets such as China or the US. Jes\u00fas Echevarr\u00eda, communications director, said: &quot;The company is global, but we shape everything in a very exclusive way to individualise it and shape the store to the customer&apos;s needs.&quot; Ortega and Inditex&apos;s current chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla may not be keen to speak to the media, but part of Inditex&apos;s secret is a heavy reliance on conversation and collaboration. Each store&apos;s stock is developed in partnership between designers, country managers based at brands&apos; HQs and local store and even department managers around the world, who feed back ideas about what customers want and don&apos;t want. &quot;Decisions are being made from the bottom to the top, not just in the stores but in every step of the business,&quot; said Echevarr\u00eda. Just over half of Inditex&apos;s product is only ever produced in relatively small amounts; even if something is incredibly successful, it will never be reproduced exactly again. &quot;A blue and white print dress became a surprise hit this year,&quot; said Loreto Garcia, a lead designer of womenswear for Zara. &quot;When we get something like that we try a different silhouette in the same print or the same silhouette in a different print.&quot; She finds versatile fabrics that can easily work as well in a skirt as a jacket to help facilitate Inditex&apos;s flexible approach. With hardly any advertising to draw in new shoppers, updating the look of stores is also important. A new look is developed every 18 months for every brand. It&apos;s one of the main areas of capital expenditure for Inditex, with 300 to 400 stores a year renovated at a cost of \u20ac1.4bn a year. Designs are developed at an indoor street of model shops within the Arteixo HQ, where there is also a large room devoted to fake store windows, where ideas are worked up before kits are sent out around the world. In the vast white box at the centre of this decision-making process for the Zara brand in Arteixo, a central &quot;spine&quot; of managers, one or more for each country, is monitoring computer screens filled with sales data and talking to store managers or regional directors by phone. They are aided by computer algorithms, developed in partnership with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which help to get the right mix of sizes for stores. Managers are guided by these automatic suggestions, but can adjust everything manually, depending on local feedback and market knowledge. The country managers control the flow of product to stores and liaise with designers and buyers who sit close by, nestled in divided areas for different product categories, such as coats or trousers, and for different in-house brands, which all flow off the central spine. At the end of the office is a pattern-cutting and sample-making section, where up to 50 ideas a week just for womenswear can be brought to life almost instantly. These might be shown off in mini-catwalk sessions in front of the head office teams. Several times a year key store managers are invited to head office to share their street-level analysis of fashion moves.     Finished items at a Zara facility. Photograph: Rafael Palacio    Zara has long been seen as a brand reliant on catwalk trends. But Garcia said that ideas from the brand&apos;s own team, which includes 20 womenswear designers, and feedback from key fashion bloggers, as well as long-term fabric trends and the ideas of trend prediction agencies, were more influential. Basic trends have almost global appeal, with Inditex&apos;s shoppers in Shanghai, New York and London happy to wear similar items, according to Garcia. More than 95% of Zara&apos;s collections are sold internationally. The concept of seasons is also disappearing, with trends almost the same in the northern hemisphere&apos;s winter and the southern summer. Right now, for example, checks and tartans are in Zara stores worldwide \u2013 just in a different weight of fabric where it&apos;s summer. Garcia says there are still regional differences: &quot;In Germany they are a bit sporty, in France more rock and roll. In Russia things have to be a little bit more sexy: they don&apos;t like mannish fashion and might wear a pencil skirt with high heels, whereas in the UK it would be worn with a brogue, but it&apos;s just a small difference. In China in the new year they want to wear red, for the north of Europe we have to develop warmer coats, while the boyfriend coat is not popular in Asia: it&apos;s too big.&quot; But while stores around the world may sell similar fashions, there can be a surprisingly different array of items on show in Zara stores around the corner from each other or in neighbouring cities. It&apos;s all dictated by their shoppers. That&apos;s partly because staff at head office are able to make adjustments for product just three weeks in advance, using production in or close to Europe, with Turkey, Spain and Portugal major production centres. In Arteixo there are 11 factories owned by Inditex producing goods for the Zara brand. But the company has moved on from when the vast majority of its clothing was made in-house. Inditex owns just 2%-3% of its manufacturing capacity. In Arteixo, hardly any of the sewing is done in-house. The company focuses on more expensive and skilled jobs, such as cutting out garment pieces as efficiently as possible from piles of fabric or putting on price and security tags, rather than stiching items together. More than 100 partner factories nearby turn neatly stacked piles of fabric pieces sent from the Inditex-owned factories into finished clothes. This way of working has been labelled &quot;fast fashion&quot;, but Echevarr\u00eda insists: &quot;It&apos;s not fast, it&apos;s more accurate. What&apos;s fast is the logistics, and the moment of creation must be close to what customers are saying. To be quick is easy. But that is not our model. Everything we do is trying to think inside the skin of the customer. It&apos;s more expensive, but you get more loyalty from the customers and more flexibility, more accuracy.&quot; Another key to that accuracy is Inditex&apos;s distribution system. In Arteixo, all Inditex&apos;s factories are linked to its distribution centre by tunnels and a 200km network of ceiling rails on which 50,000 garments a week from each factory flow around on hangers. Fast-track fashions and basic items made in China or elsewhere in Asia are gathered in Spain, no matter where they will end up in the world, before being sorted for each store. Virtual &quot;boxes&quot; of garments can be grouped and stored on the network, marked by a barcode, then called up by the system when needed. The system allots individual garments piece by piece depending on the needs of each store and garments seem to magically fly off the rail network into boxes lined up for individual stores, as if controlled by an unseen hand. A separate system does the same for individual T-shirts or knitwear. No store receives a box of 20 pink T-shirts just because it is easier to transport and sort. Within eight hours of a store placing an order it will have been organised for shipping with a bespoke set of sizes and styles. It&apos;s an impressive system, envied by many fashion rivals, but it&apos;s under pressure. Inditex is constantly adding new stores, particularly in Asia, which recently overtook Spain as the biggest source of sales for the first time. Bringing all its products to Spain may seem efficient now, but Inditex&apos;s increasing strength in Shanghai and Beijing may yet mean the Arteixo model will need to be transferred to a small town in China. Stellar success online Inditex is already Spain&apos;s largest internet fashion retailer, controlling as much as a quarter of the market. Zara did not launch its fashion online until 2010. Other Inditex brands joined in September 2011, as much as a decade after many clothing retailers. Yet figures published at the Spanish equivalent of Companies House, the Registro Mercantil, show Inditex&apos;s eight online Spanish stores registered sales of \u20ac82m last year, stellar growth from the previous seven months for which accounts are available when they achieved just \u20ac9.8m in sales. Profits rose to \u20ac3.1m from just \u20ac160,000. That \u20ac82m is only equivalent to 2.5% of Inditex&apos;s total Spanish sales and many retailers expect to see at least 20% of their sales online. While that could affect performance in stores, Inditex continues to see like-for-like sales growth in its high-street stores of 2.5%-4% in the last three months, say analysts; many rival stores have seen sales fall back.     The original Zara store in La Coru\u00f1a. Photograph: Dani Ca  O    The group also continues to take online stores into new countries. It launched five brands in Russia this summer and will put Zara online in South Korea and Mexico next year. The web also provides a way for Zara and its fellow stores to tell shoppers about the latest items in store. Inditex&apos;s avoidance of advertising is partly driven by its manufacturing model, which relies on a constantly changing array of garments. That makes it almost impossible to book ads in magazines or on billboards weeks or months in advance \u2013 but the internet can change every day.", "tags": ["Zara", "Retail industry", "Fashion", "Spain", "Life and style", "Europe", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-15T00:04:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/16/nuclear-scare-stories-coal-industry", "sentences": ["As Greenpeace points out, in Shanghai a fortnight ago and in Harbin in October concentrations of particulates exceeded 500 micrograms."], "title": "Nuclear scare stories are a gift to the truly lethal coal industry | George Monbiot", "article": "Most of the afflictions wrongly attributed to nuclear power can rightly be attributed to coal. I was struck by this thought when I saw the graphics published by Greenpeace on Friday, showing the premature deaths caused by coal plants in China. The research it commissioned suggests that a quarter of a million deaths a year could be avoided if coal power there were shut down. Yes, a quarter of a million. Were Greenpeace to plot the impacts of nuclear power on the same scale, the vast red splodges depicting the air pollution catastrophe suffered by several Chinese cities would be replaced by dots invisible to the naked eye. This is not to suggest that there are no impacts, but they are tiny by comparison. The World Health Organisation&apos;s analysis of the Fukushima disaster concludes that &quot;for the general population inside and outside of Japan ... no observable increases in cancer rates above baseline rates are anticipated&quot;. Only the most contaminated parts of Fukushima prefecture are exposed to any significant threat: a slight increase in the chances of developing cancer. Even the majority of the emergency workers have no higher cancer risk than that of the general population. And this, remember, was caused by an unprecedented disaster. The deaths in China are caused by business as usual. The tiny risk that is imposed by nuclear power has both obscured and invoked the far greater risk that is imposed by coal. Scare stories about nuclear power are a gift to the coal industry. Where they are taken seriously by politicians \u2013 as they have been in Japan \u2013 and cause a switch from nuclear to coal power, they kill people. Since the tsunami in 2011, the internet has been awash with ever more lurid claims about Fukushima. Millions have read reports claiming that children on the western seaboard of the United States are dying as a result of radiation released by the damaged plant. It doesn&apos;t seem to matter how often and effectively the stories are debunked: they keep on coming. But children in the US really are dying as a result of pollution from coal plants, and we hear almost nothing about it. Plenty of reports also propose that the water on the Pacific coast of North America is now dangerous to swimmers, and the fish there too radioactive to eat. Again, it&apos;s not true. Except in the immediate vicinity of the plant, any extra radiation to which fish in the Pacific are exposed is minute by comparison to the concentration in their tissues of polonium-210, which occurs naturally in seawater. There are, however, genuine dangers associated with another toxic contaminant found in fish: mercury. What is the primary source of mercury pollution? Ah yes, coal burning. In October, for the first time, the World Health Organisation officially listed both gaseous outdoor pollution and airborne particulates as carcinogenic to humans. Exposure levels, it notes, are rising sharply in some parts of the world. In 2010 an estimated 223,000 deaths from lung cancer were caused by air pollution. But these cancers, though wildly outstripping those correctly attributed to man-made radiation, are just a small part of the pollution problem. Far greater numbers are afflicted by other diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, heart disease, hypertension, strokes, low birth weight, pre-term delivery, pre-eclampsia and (through heavy metal exposure in the womb) impaired brain function. Three hundred micrograms of fine particulates per cubic metre of air is classed as severe pollution, the point at which children and elderly people should not leave their homes. As Greenpeace points out, in Shanghai a fortnight ago and in Harbin in October concentrations of particulates exceeded 500 micrograms. By far the greatest source of these particles is coal burning. In total, air pollution in northern China \u2013 according to a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \u2013 has cut average life expectancy by five and a half years. We have exported much of our pollution \u2013 and its associated deaths \u2013 but the residue in our own countries is still severe. A study by the Clean Air Task Force suggests that coal power in the US causes 13,200 premature deaths a year. In Europe, according to the Health and Environment Alliance, the figure is 18,200. A study cited by the alliance suggests that around 200,000 children born in Europe each year have been exposed to &quot;critical levels&quot; of methylmercury in the womb. It estimates the health costs inflicted by coal burning at between \u20ac15bn (\u00a312.5bn) and \u20ac42bn a year. Do you still reckon coal is cheap? You&apos;re picturing filthy plants in Poland and Romania, aren&apos;t you? But among the most polluting power stations in Europe, Longannet in Scotland is ranked 11th; and Drax, in England, is ranked seventh. Last week the House of Lords failed to pass an amendment that would have forced a gradual shutdown of our coal-burning power plants: they remain exempted from the emissions standards that other power stations have to meet. While nuclear power is faltering, coal is booming. Almost 1,200 new plants are being developed worldwide: many will use coal exported from the US and from Australia. The exports are now a massive source of income for these supposedly greening economies. By 2030 China is expected to be importing almost five times as much coal as it does today. The International Energy Agency estimates that the global use of coal will increase by 65% by 2035. Even before you consider climate change, this is a disaster. You don&apos;t have to be an enthusiast for atomic energy to see that it scarcely features as a health risk beside its rival. I wonder whether the nuclear panic might be a way of not seeing. Displacement is something we all do: fixing on something small to avoid engaging with something big. Coal, on which industrialism was built \u2013 and which over the past 200 years has come to seem central to our identity \u2013 is an industry much bigger and nastier and more embedded than the one we have chosen to fear. I don&apos;t believe our choice is accidental. \u2022 Twitter: @georgemonbiot.

Fracking for shale gas, even if the process has not actually been producing much energy beyond its homeland in the US, has barely been out of the public consciousness. In the UK, drilling for oil by fracking explorers Cuadrilla in Sussex roused one of the biggest environmental protests in years, as thousands marched outside the village of Balcombe and Green party MP Caroline Lucas was arrested. A similar series of protests was mirrored in Manchester, later in the year. Public figures and industry bodies lined up to say the technology should go ahead in the UK, from David Cameron down to geologists, water companies and some environmentalists, and the government laid out sweeteners of \u00a3100,000 for communities who live near any shale gas wells that are fracked.

Enormous potential reserves were identified in Australia. The ramping up of exploration and awareness around shale gas is part of the wider picture of fossil fuel companies looking for unconventional sources of energy. Elsewhere, companies continued their efforts to push into the Arctic to drill for oil and gas. When a small group of Greenpeace activists boarded one of those efforts, a Gazprom rig in the Barents Sea, it inadvertently turned into one of the biggest stories of the year. The Russian authorities, which had allowed a similar protest the year before, responded by winching armed coastguards off a helicopter onto the group&apos;s Arctic Sunrise vessel, arresting the 28 activists and two journalists onboard, and detaining them without trial for several months, before finally releasing them on bail.

A steady drip of worrying news emerged from Fukushima, where workers continued cleanup efforts on the nuclear power station amid repeated leaks of radioactive material. In the UK, energy company EDF struck a deal with the government guaranteeing an above-market rate for nuclear electricity, paving the way for the country&apos;s first new nuclear power station in over 20 years. But critics said the deal was a bad for consumers, and just this week the boss of Ineos,\u00a0one of the UK&apos;s biggest energy consumers, said the electricity from the new reactors would be too expensive. The government also tried to restart stalled efforts to find a geological site for a long-term underground nuclear waste dump, by changing the rules on which councils have the final say.

In response, prime minister David Cameron was reported as saying he would &quot;get rid of the green crap&quot; \u2013 the subsidies for environmental and social programmes on energy bills.

In the UK, the amount of wind power installed at sea and on land was up by over 40% on the year before, including the opening of the world&apos;s biggest offshore windfarm, the London Array, which David Cameron attended and called &quot;a great day for Britain and a big win for renewable energy.&quot; Elsewhere in the country new plans for a barrage across the Severn estuary were rejected, and the government delayed (again) an incentive scheme to encourage householders to switch to renewable forms of heat, such as biomass.

Pleasant, Wis. These turbines have successfully cut nearly 6,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases in their first year. Combined with the site&apos;s cogeneration systems already in place, the Waxdale facility, which is the size of 36 football fields, is now able to generate, on average, 100 percent of its electrical energy onsite.  The wind power from these turbines significantly contribute to SC Johnson&apos;s renewable energy goals. The company recently reported that it is on track to reach its five-year goal of sourcing 33 percent of its global energy from renewable sources.  &quot;As a family company, SC Johnson has long been committed to reducing its environmental footprint, and investing in renewable energy is a critical part of our business strategy,&quot; said Kelly M. Semrau, Chief Sustainability Officer at SC Johnson. &quot;The results achieved with the wind turbines at our Waxdale facility are just one example that demonstrate our desire to lessen our footprint and positively impact communities around the world.&quot;  Over the past decade, the company has undertaken 10 renewable energy initiatives around the globe, including wind power, solar, and cogeneration. These initiatives have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 110,500 metric tons per year, which is equivalent to:  \u2022The emissions from 23,021 passenger vehicles** or\u2022The emissions from the total energy use of 5,519 homes for one year** or\u2022The emissions from 15,204 homes&apos; electricity use for one year** or\u2022The emissions from 4,604,167 propane tanks used for home barbeque grills** Renewable Energy Results at Waxdale In December 2012, SC Johnson commissioned two 415-foot wind turbines at Waxdale, in Mt. Pleasant, Wis., and one year later, the results are impressive. The wind turbines have cut 6,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually and have produced nearly 8 million kilowatts (KWh) of electricity since December 2012 -- enough energy to power 700 homes over the course of a year.* Coupled with the cogeneration system that SC Johnson installed in 2003, which cuts 47,250 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, Waxdale now produces 100 percent -- on average -- of its electrical energy on-site.* Waxdale is currently the site of the largest company-owned wind turbine manufacturing project in the Midwest and serves as the production headquarters for trusted products such as Glade\u00ae, Windex\u00ae, Pledge\u00ae, Scrubbing Bubbles\u00ae, Shout\u00ae, Raid\u00ae and OFF!\u00ae.  SC Johnson&apos;s Global Renewable Energy Commitment In addition to the wind energy and cogeneration projects in Mt. Pleasant, Wis., SC Johnson&apos;s renewable energy initiatives span the globe:  \u2022Solar projects in Shanghai, China provide hot water heating for several company operations and cut 70 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.* \u2022A wind power initiative in Toluca, Mexico enables the facility to receive 86 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, which cuts 3,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.* \u2022The company&apos;s first owned wind turbine in Mijdrecht, The Netherlands was installed in 2009 and now generates 50 percent of the electricity for the local facility while cutting 2,100 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.* \u2022The use of waste palm oil shells in Medan, Indonesia serves as a fuel source to heat water, which reduces local diesel use by 80 percent and transfers waste back to the value chain. This cuts 6,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.* \u2022A biofuel initiative in Surabaya, Indonesia uses waste husks from rice grains as a fuel source for heating water used in mosquito coil production, which cuts 7,090 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.* *GHG data represents annual savings.**Data acquired from the EPA.

Nowhere is thought to have witnessed faster change than Nikkaluokta, a small Lapland village above the Arctic circle in northern Sweden. On 3 December, it was enjoying an unseasonally warm 4.7C. Within a few days, the temperature had dropped to a bone-chilling -40.8C (-41.4F) but on 10 December it rose again in just a few hours to a balmy 7.7C. The 48.5C rise in under 48 hours is one of the greatest ever recorded and is comparable to the world&apos;s fastest-temperature rise: 27C in just two minutes in Spearfish, South Dakota back in 1943.     An iceberg floats off a glacier in northern Svalbard, Spitsbergen, Norway. All of Svalbards glaciers are retreating, even in the north of the archipelago despite only being around 600 miles from the north pole.  Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Corbis    What happened in Lapland was, on the surface at least, not unusual, abrupt short-term weather change possibly caused by a convoluted jet stream. But in a major report this month, the US National Research Council warned that abrupt climate change was already being seen with the collapse of the Arctic sea ice and in extinction rates. The good news, it said, was that most of the extreme climate predictions made over the past decade, such as an upwelling of methane from the bottom of the oceans or a shutdown of the Atlantic conveyor, were extremely unlikely \u2013 at least in the medium term. But the message was clear: if temperatures go on rising, expect the unexpected over the next 100 years. The IPCC 5th assessment report, which is considered the consensus of world scientists, was unequivocal that climate change was happening fast. In September, it stated that each of the last three decades had been successively warmer at the Earth&apos;s surface than at any preceding decade since measurements started in 1850. The period 1983-2012 was probably the warmest in the past 1,400 years, it said, and both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets were losing mass, along with most glaciers worldwide.     A sign in the main street of Taradale indicates extreme fire danger and a total fire ban throughout the area. Authorities declared a day of total fire ban for the entire state of Victoria, Australia, as the area continued to experience unusually high temperatures. The risks of fire danger were rated as extreme. Photograph: David Reid/Corbis    The Arctic in 2013 saw nowhere near as much sea ice loss as the exceptional 2012 when all records were broken by nearly 20%, but the relatively cool year still witnessed the sixth greatest ice loss since observations began in 1979. All seven lowest minimum ice extents have now occurred in the past seven years. Significantly for sea level rise, IPCC scientists said the loss of ice from Greenland&apos;s ice sheet, which is situtated on land, has probably increased from around 34bn tonnes a year in the last decade of the 20th century to 215bn tonnes a year today.     An aerial view of the area affected by floods caused by heavy rains in Khartoum, Sudan. Photograph: Stringer/Reuters    Confusingly, sea ice, which grows in winter months and retreats in summer each year, has steadily been growing in Antarctica. In September, the end of the southern hemisphere&apos;s winter, the ice extended to 19.51m sq kms, breaking a 35-year record. This, said some climate contrarians, showed for a fact that global warming was not happening. But scientists elsewhere countered that the ice growth was probabaly being driven by the convergence of stronger winds near the south pole. Latest observations from Europe&apos;s ice-monitoring satellite, CryoSat, suggests that the west Antarctic ice sheet appears to be shedding far more ice than just a few years ago, from around 30bn tonnes a year in the 1990s to around 147bn tonnes a year now as major glaciers retreat. Despite Antarctica&apos;s simultaneous warming and cooling phenomena, the second lowest temperatures ever measured on Earth was recorded in July at Dome Argus in the centre of the Antarctic plateau. The previous record low was -89.2C in 1983 at the Russian Vostok research station in east Antarctica. But a Nasa satellite this year detected an extraordinary -93.0C on July 10. This was marginally above the -93.2C recorded there in 2010*. Because neither temperature was measured on land, they will not be registered as official records.

Photograph: Japan Meteorological Agency/Barcroft Media    Heat extremes dominated the year. The last four months of 2012 were abnormally hot in Australia but January 2013 was the hottest month ever measured on the continent, with record temperatures being set in every state and territory and the highest recorded maximum of 49.6C at Moomba in South Australia. Temperatures were regularly above 48C, the Bureau of Meteorology added a new temperature colour to its maps and Sydney experienced its hottest night on record when it was still 34C at midnight on 10 January. According to the since axed Australian Climate Commission, Australians should get used to it: not only are heatwaves getting longer, hotter and more frequent, the number of record hot days is expected to quadruple in Sydney by the end of the century. Portugal, China, Hungary, Finland, and Britain, all recorded heatwaves, and the temperature in Death Valley, California hit 129.2F (54.0C), the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth during June. Meanwhile, Shanghai had 24 days with temperatures at or above 35C in July and recorded 40.6C, the highest ever temperature recorded in 140 years of records in the city. Northeast Brazil, which often suffers long droughts, experienced its worst in 50 years followed last week by massive floods. Europe, overall, was warmer than usual but the heat turned quickly to massive rainstorms. As much rain fell in a few hours in June in central Europe as normally falls in two months. The Czech Republic , Austria, south and east Germany, Switzerland, Slovakia, Belarus, Poland, Hungary and Serbia all experienced heavy flooding in what were desribed as one in 100 year rains. In some places in Austria, 150 to 200mm of rain (5.9 to 7.9 inches) fell in a day. Less high-profile were massive floods in Sudan, where more than 250,000 people were forced from their homes in August. The region around the capital, Khartoum, was particularly badly hit, with at least 15,000 homes destroyed and thousands of others damaged. The heat was also seen in the oceans. The journal Sceince reported that since 1950 Pacific Ocean waters had been warming at a rate 15 times faster than the rest of the seafloor. This suggested to some that the ocean depths may store more heat from global warming than suspected. The Pacific Ocean, in particular, seems to be absorbing more heat than at any other time in the past 50 years. Because the strength of tropical storms is linked to ocean temperature, it came as a surprise that the 2013 Atlantic Ocean hurricane season was one of the weakest recorded in 50 years. There were no major hurricanes in the Carribean, Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic basin and only Ingrid and Humberto out of the 13 named storms reached hurricane strength. It was a very different story in the western-north Pacific however, where 30 major storms had been recorded by early November. Thirteen of them were typhoon-strength, the biggest by some way being typhoon Haiyan, possibly the most powerful tropical cyclone to make landfall in recorded history. Haiyan smashed into the southern Phillippines, killing 6,000 people and wreaking massive damage. The World Meteorological Organisation said that it was impossible to blame climate change for individual storms but increasing evidence emerged during the year that there was a link. When in January 2013 scientists at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the UK&apos;s Met Office, and the research teams from 16 other global institutions tried to calculate how much climate change had possibly influenced 12 extreme weather events that occurred in 2012, they concluded that it had helped raise the temperatures during the run of 37.7C days in last year&apos;s US heatwave, and was behind the record loss of Arctic sea ice and the storm surge of hurricane Sandy, plus several other extremes. The weather year ended in a similar turmoil to how it had started \u2013 with hail falling in Cairo, snow in Israel, Syria and Jordan, and record high temperatures in Scandinavia and unseasonable heat on the Gulf Coast of the United States. *How cold is that?

Authorities have found it difficult to tackle pollution, but recognising the scale of the challenge, governments, laboratories and universities in China are now working intensively and collaboratively to better understand sources of air pollution and how they are dispersed or concentrated in the atmosphere.\u00a0 The country&apos;s five-year action plan has provisons to improve environment technology, planning and regulation. Its focus is on &quot;air pollution control led by government, enforced by companies, driven by market and participated in by the public&quot;. It emphasises on making polluters pay and rewarding energy efficiency, conservation and emissions reduction efforts. The plan also aims at reducing heavy pollution by a large margin and improve air quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei province, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. Currently the public and private sector use computer models to simulate how emissions from transportation, power plants and industry affect the atmosphere.\u00a0This information is then used to determine levels of concentration of toxic gases and particles at street level. \u00a0 Increasingly, more cities are now monitoring air quality in real time using meteorological towers and remote sensing from satellites to track pollutants.\u00a0In Beijing concentrations of micro particles in the atmosphere have been found to be more than 10 times the safe level recommended by the WHO. This has prompted authorities to take measures such as limiting industrial emissions and reducing traffic across the nation. In Shenzhen and Guangzhou air pollution levels are now decreasing after peaking in 2007.\u00a0Air quality in Shanghai is also recognised as better than in Beijing.\u00a0In part, this is because Shanghai now has strict regulations for ships entering its harbours and has advised that vessels should both switch to cleaner fuels when they are about 100 miles away, and make use of electrical power when they have docked.\u00a0 \u00a0 But even in these cities the haze is so thick that often in winter it blocks out the sun, reducing natural light and warmth significantly.\u00a0As a result temperature drops, households use more energy for heating; pollution gets worse, causing respiratory diseases and eventually more people are hospitalised. However, improvements could be made with more data becoming accessible and fed into simulation models to provide accurate assessments of how changes to transportation, industry and power plants and even agricultural practice could help to reduce pollution.\u00a0Dust and pollution concentrations can also be reduced by better overall planning, including size and type of economic activity, designs of buildings, roadways and green spaces. \u00a0 China is also applying existing technologies more extensively.\u00a0This is resulting in cleaner emissions from power stations, replacement of coal-power heating systems with electric and gas-fired systems, and bio-processing of agricultural waste (rather than burning which adds to pollution).\u00a0The government&apos;s aim is to reduce the country&apos;s coal consumption to below 65% by 2017. The country is also taking up affordable battery-driven cycles, priced at $200. In the near future, roadside detectors will be able to monitor emissions from individual cars. Already, trams and buses with monitors are able to survey street pollution more thoroughly.\u00a0 Air pollution can also be forecast a few days ahead, even on a street by street basis, by using models of how traffic and atmosphere are likely to change.\u00a0This will help tourists, cyclists and others to avoid polluted areas. Smart traffic systems to lessen congestion on roads are also being considered. These are already being trialled in Singapore. \u00a0 Air pollution continue to pose a serious health risk in China but efforts are underway to clean up the air. The government has set up special funds to subsidise environmental-friendly industries, it is improving policies on pricing and taxation and encouraging private funds to invest in air pollution control technology. There are also plans to rank air quality of key cities regularly and establish mandatory environmental information disclosure system for companies causing heavy pollution.

The frightening hike in its persistent pollution \u2013 soon nicknamed the airpocalypse \u2013 turned a long-running problem into a source of real anger. The political scene was also veiled by haze as analysts sought to establish the outlines of the new leadership&apos;s plans for the country. By the end of the year, things looked a little clearer in Beijing, though off-the-scale pollution had spread north to Harbin and south to Shanghai. Authorities had finally faced up to the pollution problem and vowed bolder measures to curtail it \u2013 albeit still far short of what environmentalists said was needed. And if Xi Jinping&apos;s ideal of the China Dream \u2013 lauded on billboards around the capital \u2013 still remained inchoate, there seemed to be a greater sense of clarity and purpose. Politics and pollution defined much of the year, though there was plenty of other news along the way, some long-planned \u2013 such as China&apos;s launch of its moon rover mission \u2013 and some simply startling: notably the Guardian&apos;s revelation that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was holed up in Hong Kong. In spring, 200 died and 1,000 were seriously injured in April when an earthquake hit Ya&apos;an in Sichuan \u2013 the same province devastated by a huge shock in 2008. In autumn, at least 42 people were killed by giant hornets in Shaanxi province. Manmade disasters took their toll too; 62 died when a leaking oil pipeline exploded in Qingdao in November. The smog underlined the unsustainability of China&apos;s headlong development and the sense that economic growth, which in any case is slowing, is no longer enough to keep many in China from chafing at the social and environmental costs. There was similar ire at the latest in the recurrent food safety scandals \u2013 this time involving rat meat passed off as lamb. And a spate of stories about the abuse or neglect of children raised concerns about social change. Even the behaviour of China&apos;s tourists led to a bout of national soul-searching, prompting officials to issue an etiquette guide for travellers. Domestic movie hits \u2013 Lost In Thailand and Tiny Times \u2013 entertained many but left others fretting about popular culture&apos;s vulgarity and materialism. But the biggest concern for many remained the country&apos;s endemic corruption. Xi has vowed to tackle both &quot;flies and tigers&quot; in a drive against corruption and extravagance that has been more intense and protracted than most expected. It also closed the door on disgraced politician Bo Xilai&apos;s career, though he fought back against the charges of corruption and abuse of power. However, when a senior leader vowed &quot;unprecedented reform&quot; at the autumn&apos;s key political meeting \u2013 the third plenum \u2013 he was greeted with scepticism. It is unclear how reform will be implemented but key pledges included relaxation of the &quot;one-child policy&quot;, greater freedom for farmers to sell or mortgage their land and move to cities, and the abolition of the re-education-through-labour system.     As the year drew to a close it was matters outside China's borders that dominated, with the reigniting of a long-running Sino-Japanese row over islands in the East China Sea. Photograph: Kyodo/Reuters    &quot;The third plenum is the most important development this year,&quot; said Zhang Ming, a political scientist at Renmin University. He sees the policy changes as evidence of Xi wanting reform and the leadership responding to public pressure. &quot;The meaningful reform is replacing allocation of resources by power with allocation of resources by the market,&quot; he said. Independent Beijing-based scholar Chen Ziming said there was more economic reform than in previous years but reduced efforts at social reform and no interest in political change. &quot;Their reform is very different from our understanding of reform,&quot; he said. Despite the top-down anti-corruption campaign, citizens who called for officials to declare their assets were arrested. Among them was Xu Zhiyong, a well-known legal activist, who was accused of &quot;gathering a crowd to disturb order in a public place&quot;, despite being under house arrest. &quot;If you look on the ground, I don&apos;t see many areas where there are visible improvements [in rights]&quot;, said Nicholas Bequelin, senior Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. &quot;The abolition of reform through labour is definitely a positive development \u2026 but large numbers of people who were warehoused in certain kinds of facilities will likely be warehoused in other kinds of facilities.&quot; A crackdown on internet &quot;rumours&quot; saw the detention of a 16-year-old who criticised police under new rules that allow users to be jailed for up to three years for widely seen or forwarded posts. This time officials targeted opinion leaders too \u2013 parading one outspoken businessman, Xue Manzi, on television, where he confessed to &quot;irresponsibility in spreading information online&quot;. The year began with a row over censorship at one of China&apos;s best respected papers \u2013 Southern Weekly. The Bloomberg and New York Times websites also remained blocked following their stories on the wealth of senior leaders&apos; families, and journalists were left waiting for visas. In Xinjiang, Bequelin added, it was clear that the situation had deteriorated. Scores have died in violence there this year and the tensions between authorities and Uighur Muslims \u2013 some of whom seek a separate state \u2013 spilled out of the north-western region to the capital in November. Three Uighurs died when their car ploughed through crowds and exploded in Tiananmen Square in what authorities called a terrorist attack by separatists, though others suggested it was linked to a raid on a mosque in the driver&apos;s hometown. And in Tibet, self-immolations continued, although there were fewer than in 2012. As the year drew to a close it was matters outside China&apos;s borders that dominated, with the long-running Sino-Japanese territorial row in the East China Sea reigniting as China announced it had established an air defence identification zone. Other countries already have such zones, but the rules governing China&apos;s and its inclusion of disputed islands also claimed \u2013 and administered \u2013 by Japan upped the ante. &quot;There are two things we have learned this year,&quot; argued Steve Tsang, an expert on China at the University of Nottingham. &quot;One is how strongly Xi Jinping has consolidated his position. The other is the end of the peaceful rise and the beginning of an assertive China.&quot; A famous maxim from Deng Xiaoping urged China to hide its light and bide its time. &quot;They are not hiding behind anything any longer,&quot; Tsang said.", "tags": ["Bo Xilai", "China", "Censorship", "Xi Jinping", "Communism", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Human rights", "Senkaku Islands", "Global economy"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-19T00:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/dec/19/novak-djokovic-boris-becker", "sentences": ["Becker will trek with Djokovic&apos;s substantial team through airports and hotels in Melbourne, Paris, London and New York for the majors, as well as Dubai, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome, Cincinnati and Shanghai for the Masters events."], "title": "Novak Djokovic's search for perfection leads him to Boris Becker | Kevin Mitchell", "article": "Boris Becker and Novak Djokovic have a lot in common: six slam titles, keen tennis brains and a sweeping disregard for convention. Their new coaching arrangement, which took tennis by surprise this week, could be a great fit. Or it could all be over by Christmas \u2013 next year, not this one. Quite why the German has agreed to cut into his agreeable schedule as a television pundit (how easy a gig is that for a former world No1 with a good line in off-the-wall quips?) to return to the grind of the ATP Tour is slightly easier to understand than why Djokovic needed a new coach in the first place \u2013 his game is not exactly crying out for an overhaul. Certainly he was disappointed to add just the Australian Open to his CV in 2013, but the 26-year-old reached the finals of the other three majors and lost to inspired tennis by great players each time: Rafael Nadal, twice, and Andy Murray. On the other hand, Nadal did leapfrog him to No1 in the world, and Djokovic did not like that \u2013 as was evident in his powerful win over the Spaniard at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. So this is the perfectionist in action. This is the man who allowed himself one square of chocolate to celebrate beating Murray in the Australian Open final. This is the man whose obsession with food is so complete he was inspired to write in his quirky 2013 tome, Serve To Win: &quot;To ensure my diet is the best possible, I get a blood test at least every six months to check my levels of vitamins and minerals and see whether my body is producing higher levels of anti-bodies, an indication I might be developing a sensitivity to a certain food. I sometimes use biofeedback machines to test my stress level.&quot; However, there is not much wrong with the Serb&apos;s game that a bit of fine-tuning at the net couldn&apos;t fix, so Becker looks as if he might be a very expensive volley coach doubling up as a high-profile motivator. As an energetic all-courter, Becker spent plenty of time killing points on the full behind a powerful serve, although it is inconceivable that Djokovic will be charging in from the baseline (his preferred place of work) on serve too often. Instead, he will look for incremental changes to his game that might be apparent in those close-quarter exchanges where his tentative racquet has sometimes let him down on key points. More fundamental to the success of their partnership will be how they get on off the court, and how Becker might sustain Djokovic&apos;s already solid sense of self-worth. Becker will trek with Djokovic&apos;s substantial team through airports and hotels in Melbourne, Paris, London and New York for the majors, as well as Dubai, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome, Cincinnati and Shanghai for the Masters events. It sounds glamorous, and it is \u2013 but it is also a lot of jet lag, a lot of room service, a lot of hard work, and that is a recipe for stress - or a quick spell on one of Novak&apos;s biofeedback machines. The relevant dynamic will be Becker&apos;s relationship with Djokovic&apos;s box, already a Serbian version of a travelling frat party. Becker is taking over from the 48-year-old Slovak Marian Vajda, who reached a high of 34 in the world and who has guided Djokovic&apos;s career for the past seven years. Vajda will be in the background and seems to have taken his demotion in good grace. &quot;Becker&apos;s assignment will not affect much my position in the team,&quot; Vajda said, &quot;since I will do all I can for Novak, just like I did before. On the other hand, choosing Boris as the head coach is a good solution. I am sure we will get along very well, and that Novak will continue to progress.&quot; For further insight, Djokovic, again from his book: &quot;I travel everywhere with my team: my manager, Edoardo Artaldi, who keeps me on schedule and some; my physiotherapist, Miljan Amanovic, who monitors my physical well-being; my coach, Marian Vajda, and assistant coach Dusan Vemic, who makes sure my technique never varies; and my girlfriend, Jelena Ristic, who cooks with me, trains with me, and keeps me on an even keel.&quot; If that sounds like a backstage take from This Is Spinal Tap, there is clearly an established posse for Boris to crash. Tellingly, Djokovic adds: &quot;Most of my inner circle is Serbian; they share the same terrible, war-torn past, and understand what it took for me to get to this point in life \u2013 and how impossible it once seemed.&quot; That is not to say Becker, the most sociable of tennis animals, will not fit in. But it may be a challenge. It is being said that Djokovic is copying Murray, who appointed another legend from the past in Ivan Lendl (one of Becker&apos;s fiercest adversaries) but that is too simplistic. It would be perverse if he hired Becker just to ape Murray. And there is no guarantee that Becker can emulate Lendl in coming virtually untested to the job of coaching to find almost instant success. Celebrity coaches do not guarantee results, as Jimmy Connors&apos;s one-tournament gig in Cincinnati with an injured and out-of-sorts Maria Sharapova illustrated, although Becker has been closer to the game than Connors in recent years and is probably more aware of what awaits him. Whichever way it goes, it will make for good entertainment: especially when Boris and Ivan line up opposite each other in their respective player boxes, possibly at the Australian Open next month.", "tags": ["Novak Djokovic", "Tennis", "Australian Open", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-19T09:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/19/2013-climate-change-review-global-warming", "sentences": ["2013 also saw China establish carbon trading schemes in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, which may help address appalling air pollution problems."], "title": "2013 climate year in review: 'the heat is on. Now we must act'", "article": "On 10 May 2013, the concentration of climate-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed the milestone level of 400 parts per million for the first time in human history. The last time so much greenhouse gas was in the air was several million years ago, when the Arctic was ice-free, savannah spread across the Sahara desert and sea level was up to 40 metres higher than today. The milestone moment was a sobering reminder that the emission of globe-warming gases is continuing unabated, despite ever more certainty that the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation is on track to end the millennia of relatively stable climate during which human civilisation has flourished. In September, a landmark report on climate change science from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded it was &quot;unequivocal&quot; that global warming was the result of human actions. Its authors said that, without &quot;substantial and sustained&quot; emissions reductions, the 2C limit set by the world&apos;s governments would be breached, resulting in heatwaves, droughts and more extreme weather. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, urged world leaders to pay heed to the &quot;world&apos;s authority on climate change&quot; and forge a new global deal on cutting emissions. &quot;The heat is on. Now we must act,&quot; he said.     Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, addresses the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change via video link. 'The heat is on. Now we must act,' he said. Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images    John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said: &quot;This is yet another wake-up call: those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire.&quot; The IPCC report, compiled by hundreds of the world&apos;s climate experts, was the first for five years and also stated that sea levels are expected to rise a further 26-82cm by 2100, though a significant number of scientists think this is an underestimate. The IPCC also warned of the increasing acidification of the oceans as it absorbs CO2, with an October report finding the seas are becoming more acidic at the fastest rate in 300 million years and a mass extinction of species may already be almost inevitable. The so-called &quot;pause&quot; in climate change \u2013 a slowing of the global air temperature rise over the last 15 years \u2013 was dismissed by IPCC co-chair Thomas Stocker, who said climate trends &quot;should not be calculated for periods of less than 30 years.&quot; Other scientists noted that excess heat has continued to be trapped by greenhouse gases and that just 1% of it heats the atmosphere, compared to 93% that warms the oceans. Another much-discussed issue \u2013 how sensitive the climate is to increases in atmospheric CO2 \u2013 turned out to make little difference to the temperature rises projected by the IPCC.     Excess heat has continued to be trapped by greenhouse gases and 93% warms the oceans.  Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images    The most controversial part of the IPCC report was its first statement on how much more CO2 humans can pour into the atmosphere without triggering dangerous levels of climate change \u2013 and the conclusion that more than half of that &quot;carbon budget&quot; has been used up. &quot;There&apos;s a finite amount of carbon you can burn if you don&apos;t want to go over 2C,&quot; said Stocker. &quot;That implies if there is more than that [in fossil fuel reserves], that you leave some of that carbon in the ground.&quot; The climate economist Lord Stern and others had warned in April of the risks of a &quot;carbon bubble&quot;, because two-thirds of the fossil fuel reserves underpinning the value of oil, gas and coal companies will have to remain underground to keep warming under 2C. &quot;The financial crisis has shown what happens when risks accumulate unnoticed,&quot; said Stern, who added that the risk was &quot;very big indeed&quot; and that almost all investors and regulators were failing to address it. The consensus of climate scientists on the cause of global warming had been emphasised in May, when a study of thousands of research papers published between 1991 and 2011 showed 97% endorsed human-caused global warming.     The annual meeting of the UN's climate body, the UNFCCC, took place in November in coal-friendly Poland. Photograph: Jenny Bates    This consensus on the science was not matched by consensus on a political deal to tackle climate change. The annual meeting of the UN&apos;s climate body, the UNFCCC, took place in November in coal-friendly Poland, and concluded by sending nations away to &quot;do their homework&quot; ahead of a deadline for a global deal in 2015. The critical question: which nations should cut their emissions and by how much? Australia attracted criticism after its new government, led by Tony Abbott \u2013 who has called climate change &quot;crap&quot; \u2013 failed to send a minister to the UN climate talks but set about dumping the country&apos;s nascent carbon tax. Meanwhile, Australia&apos;s spring was the warmest on record.     Anti-carbon tax protesters in Australia.  Photograph: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty Images    However, the big two global emitters \u2013 China and the US together cause 40% of emissions \u2013 provided brighter news when agreeing in July to expand their joint efforts against climate change, a move seen as raising the prospects for an eventual global climate deal. The agreement covered cleaner vehicles, carbon capture technologies, energy efficiency and smart grids. 2013 also saw China establish carbon trading schemes in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, which may help address appalling air pollution problems. Such schemes, where permits to pollute are traded are seen by many as the cheapest way of cutting emissions but the world&apos;s biggest scheme \u2013 the EU&apos;s \u2013 saw only modest progress in addressing the glut of permits that is holding the carbon price at rock-bottom levels. In the UK, the coalition fought over green policies, with the prime minister, David Cameron, reported as saying he wanted to get rid of all the &quot;green crap&quot; \u2013 the environmental levies charged on energy bills. In contrast, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said: &quot;We will do everything we can to strengthen the role of the low-carbon sector in the new economy.&quot; In December, the government&apos;s official advisers on climate change told ministers there was no evidence supporting the weakening of emissions targets in a review demanded by the chancellor, George Osborne.

Well, that and a preference for sensible footwear nudged the young ice dancer-skater Elise Christie on course for a career in short-track speed-skating which, all going well, ought to culminate at February&apos;s Winter Olympics in Sochi. The 23-year-old heads to her second Games as a medal contender, having last season been crowned the overall 1,000m World Cup champion, as well as becoming the first British woman to win an individual world championship medal. &quot;I started as a figure skater in Prestwick,&quot; says the softly spoken, surprisingly slight native of Livingston in Scotland, before explaining how she became involved with the comparatively brutal, unpredictable and unchoreographed discipline akin to stock car racing on ice. &quot;I saw speed skating one day and thought it looked like a bit of fun. I didn&apos;t have to get dressed up, so that kind of attracted me to it and I thought the boots looked a bit more comfortable as well. Gradually, over time, I progressed more at speed skating than I did at figure, so I moved to England to take part in it full time.&quot; Standing a little over five feet tall in her bare feet and looking for all the world like a gust of wind might blow her over, it is difficult to imagine Christie participating, let alone excelling, in a sport where explosive speed is her particular stock in trade and collisions are inevitable as groups of four to six skaters whizz around an ice rink and jockey for position over distances of 500m, 1,000m and 1,500m. She found being stuck in the pack &quot;horrible and scary&quot; and so set about revolutionising the sport with trademark front-running tactics. She laughs at the suggestion that she seems too petite and fragile to succeed in such a helter-skelter sport. &quot;Everyone says that,&quot; she says. &quot;It took me a long time to build a lot of leg muscle and even now, my girth isn&apos;t very big but there is a lot of tone to my legs if you actually see them. I think anyone can do well with what they&apos;re given, you&apos;ve just got to work hard at it. I think everyone is shocked when they hear that I&apos;m a speed skater because a lot of speed skaters have quite big bulk. I&apos;m genuinely not a very dirty skater but if needs be I can give as good as I get. If somebody gets on the wrong side of me, then they better look out.&quot; One of the five-strong squad of Team GB short-track skaters confirmed this week for the Winter Olympics, Christie&apos;s preparations for Sochi have been less than ideal. She started the season with a dose of mumps, then the death of her grandmother days before she began racing affected her performances at World Cup events in Shanghai and Seoul. Last month she secured her Olympic place in Turin but quarter-final exits in the 500m and 1,000m displeased her boss, the Team GB performance director Stuart Horsepool. &quot;If this was the Olympics, I&apos;d be devastated; we&apos;re not sharp enough, we&apos;re not quite ready,&quot; he said. A week later, a bad pile-up during the circuit&apos;s Russian leg left her fearing the Olympics might be over, but her injuries proved mercifully superficial. Christie recovered to take third place in the 1,000m, her only World Cup podium place of the season. &quot;I was more than happy to end up with the bronze,&quot; she said. &quot;That should send out a message to my rivals I am able to skate from the back as well as from the front.&quot; Christie described winning another bronze, in last year&apos;s world championships 1,000m as &quot;overwhelming&quot;, but at the time left the ice crying tears of sadness over an opportunity lost rather than the biggest success of her career to date. Having been knocked on to a barrier on the opening day of competition and with podium opportunities dwindling, in her next event she raced to win a medal \u2013 any medal \u2013 rather than going all out for gold or nothing. &quot;I actually cried when I got off the ice, which sounds very selfish but that is not at all how it is,&quot; she says. &quot;I was disappointed I didn&apos;t give myself the best opportunity to win the race. I was over the moon at winning a world championship medal, it&apos;s an amazing thing, but at the same time I left with regret and I learned a lot from that because I won&apos;t ever leave a race with regret again. I&apos;ll go out to race and giving everything I can and if that means losing a medal trying to win, at least I&apos;ll know I tried to win that race rather than just settle for a medal.&quot; So if Christie finds herself in a position where Olympic bronze is assured in Sochi, she&apos;d happily put it on the line and risk a spill over the barriers to win gold instead? &quot;In terms of the Olympics, the only pressure I&apos;m putting on myself is to come off [the ice] and not regret anything,&quot; she says. &quot;Every day, I&apos;m doing what I can to make that chance as big as possible. I want no regrets \u2013 everything&apos;s about me coming home happy.&quot; Happy in her skin-suit and without a sequin in sight.", "tags": ["Winter Olympics 2014: short track speed skating", "Winter Olympics 2014", "Winter Olympics", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-20T11:43:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/20/china-bill-clean-air-pollution", "sentences": ["While Beijing has long been notorious for its pea-soup air, a number of traditionally clearer cities, including Shanghai and the northeastern metropolis Harbin, have registered pollution levels high enough for local authorities to ground flights, close schools and pull cars from the roads.", "On Friday, Shanghai\u2019s concentration of airborne PM 2.5 \u2013 particulate matter small enough to lodge deep within the lungs \u2013 rose to 214 micrograms per cubic meter, three times China\u2019s national limit.", "The official Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center warned children and the elderly to stay indoors."], "title": "China faces $176bn bill to clean up air pollution", "article": "Cleaning up China\u2019s air pollution will cost 1.75 trillion yuan (\u00a3176b) between 2013 and 2017, a high-ranking environmental official has estimated.\u00a0 Wang Jinnan, deputy head of the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning, said that the investment \u2013part of an anti-pollution &quot;action plan&quot; announced by China&apos;s cabinet in September \u2013 \u201cwould drive up GDP by nearly two trillion yuan (\u00a3202b) and create over two million jobs,\u201d China\u2019s official newswire Xinhua reported.

Yet many smog-related government measures, such as curbing street-side barbecues and certifying pilots to land in low-visibility conditions, have drawn criticism for glossing over the problem. In October, one Beijing official blamed the smog on \u201cthe traditional way of cooking Chinese dishes.\u201d In response, many Chinese people have taken measures into their own hands. Face masks have become a fashion statement; air purifier sales have spiked. An elementary school in north China\u2019s Shijiazhuang, one of the country\u2019s most polluted cities, has begun teaching its students a smog-defying aerobics routine involving acupuncture points associated with respiratory health. Last week, a hospital in the southwestern Chinese city Chengdu opened a \u201csmog clinic\u201d to treat air pollution-related ailments such as coughs and asthma; it has been treating roughly a dozen patients a day. &quot;We should not fear smog.

The handsome 1920s mansions and secret walled gardens from the city&apos;s previous boom period house a growing population of French entrepreneurs focused on a renaissance. &quot;The neighbourhood feels like a French country village,&quot; says Shanghai restaurateur Franck Pecol. Hailing from Marseille, Pecol opened\u00a0his eponymous bistro Franck in 2007 in a peaceful side street courtyard known as Ferguson Lane. Parisian classics such as terrine de campagne and poulet r\u00f4ti chalked up on the menu du jour blackboard attracted a eurocentric crowd, and Franck&apos;s success convinced the owner to open more outlets, all around the same courtyard. Le Petit Franck is a wine bar showing old French films, and Farine is Shanghai&apos;s best French bakery, while rooftop taco stand La Taqueria (closed in winter) complete the portfolio. There&apos;s also a Marseille-style pizza parlour called \u00e0 C\u00f4t\u00e9 (meaning &quot;next door&quot;), and an artisanal burger joint will open just down the road early next year. &quot;It&apos;s places like these that make this part of Shanghai special,&quot; says Pecol. And it doesn&apos;t appeal just to his fellow europhiles \u2013 70% of Pecol&apos;s clientele are now Chinese. French boutique chic is well-represented across the former Concession. At Rouge Baiser Elise, Parisian Elise de Saint Guilhem uses her mother-in-law&apos;s 18th-century patterns as inspiration for hand-embroidered tableware, bedding and baby gear. Knotted Chinese buttons and peonies add an oriental flourish to the French designs.     Song Fang Maison de Th\u00e9    Nearby is the Song Fang Maison de Th\u00e9, a\u00a0three-story townhouse where guests can sip 70\u00a0premium Chinese teas and French blends, and\u00a0purchase leaves in the tea shop&apos;s aquamarine tins emblazoned with Mao-era propaganda art. Meanwhile, an apothecary-styled shop, Ba Yan Ka La, sells skincare and body products, which are based on ancient Chinese herbal wisdom, with ranges including goji berry, lotus seed and Tibetan roseroot. As dusk falls across the quarter, colourful Vespas and fixed-gear bicycles congregate outside a\u00a0tiny bar where French chatter mingles with the sound of boules cracking against each other.

Staffed by European hospitality school interns, La P\u00e9tanque has an open kitchen, French film posters and a p\u00e9tanque alley.

The sky is thundery and the sea is a uniform shade of sludge. Shun-Wen Tong, a 22-year-old student from the Chinese city of Hangzhou, cranes his neck to look at the town 54 floors below: concrete hotel blocks, pulsating traffic and directly beneath him, half- hidden in the tropical gloom, an amusement park called Funny Land. The off-season weather is just one of the dodgy things about Pattaya \u2013 a resort known to many as &quot;Thailand&apos;s Blackpool&quot;, it is two hours outside Bangkok \u2013 but Tong is savouring every moment. &quot;It&apos;s magical. I&apos;m very happy,&quot; he says, holding his camera in one hand and a complimentary orange juice in the other. &quot;Finally I am seeing the world.&quot; Tong is on his first-ever overseas trip. For him it&apos;s a thrilling, life-changing experience. But to the rest of world he&apos;s not just any tourist. He&apos;s a Chinese tourist \u2013 that is, a global phenomenon, an unstoppable trend, a lucrative opportunity. International travel has been growing among the Chinese over the past decade, with rising prosperity at home and the relaxation of Communist government travel restrictions. Now millions are on the move. &quot;Chinese tourism,&quot; said CNN breathlessly in April, &quot;might be the biggest phenomenon to hit the global travel industry since the invention of commercial flight.&quot; In 2012 the Chinese overtook Americans and Germans as the world&apos;s top international tourism spenders, heading off on 83m foreign trips and spending $102bn. By early 2015, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, Chinese globetrotters will take more than 100m overseas trips. By 2020 the figure will double to an incredible 200m. In Thailand, the number of Chinese tourists shot up by 107% this year, nudging Bangkok ahead of London to become the world&apos;s most visited city in Mastercard&apos;s latest survey.     A crowd of Chinese tourists cheer during the elephant show, where the animals perform stunts such as football and painting, at Nong Nooch Tropical Botanical Garden in Pattaya. Photograph: Nana Chen for the Observer    Everyone is scrambling for a\u00a0share of the spoils. In October, the British government announced plans to simplify UK visa procedures for nationals from China, with the goal of trebling Chinese tourists to Britain by 2015. India has launched Chinese-language Life of Pi tours after the film was a box-office hit in China, while Greece is promoting &quot;idyllic island honeymoons&quot; to the Chinese market. Even the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe is currently trying to negotiate a &quot;preferential tourism pact&quot; with Beijing \u2013 despite diplomatic strains last year after police outside Harare arrested four Chinese migrant workers for allegedly killing and eating rare tortoises. With the proliferating numbers has come the predictable but mostly misplaced sentiment that Chinese travellers have taken over from Americans as the world&apos;s new &quot;ugly&quot; tourists. The trend for independent travel is sharply on the rise, especially among the younger Chinese. But around half of all Chinese tourists still travel in organised groups \u2013 a\u00a0factor that increases their collective visibility and amplifies stereotypes and cultural unfamiliarity on both sides. Reports abound that Chinese tourists are loud and rude, or that they refuse to queue or give tips. Other complaints range from the practical to the surreal. In July, residents of the small Swiss city of Lucerne protested that up to 120 Chinese tour buses a day were paralysing local traffic, as they deposited tourists who wanted to buy luxury watches. Then there were bizarre reports, picked up by the Chinese media, of competing Chinese honeymooners brawling in French lavender fields over the best spot for photos to capture a\u00a0&quot;Monet moment&quot;. A group travelling to North Korea drew scorn for throwing sweets to children as though they were &quot;feeding ducks&quot;, while a\u00a0number of Chinese tourists in the Maldives were reportedly caught giving fake marriage papers to upmarket resorts in order to get free dinners offered to newlyweds. Still, the fact that such tales make headlines seems to reflect the current hypersensitivity towards Chinese behaviour abroad more than anything else. In a recent poll by lifestyle website LivingSocial, Americans were still ranked the least popular foreign tourists by five different countries, including, tellingly, by Americans themselves. Brits and Germans fared little better.     An elderly woman fans herself among other Chinese tourists. She had her beehive set to last the duration of her holiday. Photograph: Nana Chen for the Observer    Thailand is at the forefront of the boom. With its mix of temples, beaches and duty-free shopping, the self-styled &quot;land of smiles&quot; is the most popular destination for Chinese tourists after the satellite Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao. Tong is visiting Thailand with 35 others from Hangzhou city in southeastern China, including his youthful-looking grandparents, on a seven-day organised tour. The tour cost \u00a3500 each, including flights. &quot;I wanted to come here to see the elephants and the Buddha statues. It&apos;s a very holy place,&quot; he says. &quot;But my family chose it mostly because it&apos;s only a four-hour flight from China and we got a good deal.&quot; Pattaya is on almost every Chinese tour group&apos;s itinerary. A former fishing village, it grew into a tourist playground during the Vietnam war, when American forces on R&amp;R discovered its then-pristine, palm-fringed bay. Girly bars, theme parks and golf courses quickly multiplied. Today it attracts about 8\u00a0million tourists annually, including more than a\u00a0million from China. Yet Chinese tourists are oddly absent from the town&apos;s teeming centre and main beaches. They&apos;re not hard to find once you know where to look. Car parks jammed with coaches signal the mass presence of tour groups at Pattaya&apos;s numerous elephant shows, crocodile and snake farms, ladyboy cabarets and outlet shopping malls. In Thailand, the proportion of Chinese travelling in tour groups rises to 70%. Most tours go from one self-contained attraction to the next, stopping only for lunch at Chinese restaurants (eating Thai food is usually a separate activity) before returning for the evening to their high-rise hotels. It&apos;s left to the Russians \u2013 the other great tourist influx in recent years \u2013 to play chicken in the main bay on screaming jet skis and haggle with beach vendors over the price of polyester sarongs. At Sriracha tiger zoo, which sees around 2,000 Chinese tourists daily, visitors can pose for photos with one of the 400 tigers kept in dusty enclosures. They can also &quot;enjoy the intelligence of the pigs in the pig show&quot; or shoot targets with air guns to make meat drop into feeding troughs in the Shoot &apos;N&apos; Feed tiger arena. The zoo has existed for years amid controversy over whether the docile tigers are drugged or beaten, as well as its racial stereotyping policy of hiring Africans to pose in loincloths \u2013 but Chinese tourists on a schedule have no time to think about any of that.     Life is a cabaret: a group of katoeys, or ladyboys, pose with two Chinese tourists. Photograph: Nana Chen for the Observer    Shu-Hsuan Chi and Tzu-Chen Wu, both in their 60s, are scuttling to a tiger-feeding session. The two women from the northeastern port city of Dalian worked in the same grocery shop. They are celebrating their retirement with a 10-day tour of Japan, Korea and Thailand. Pattaya is their last stop. &quot;We have no economic problems in China now and free time to travel,&quot; says Wu. She is sporting a beehive hairstyle she has had done specially &quot;to last for the whole trip&quot; to avoid having to visit a foreign salon. &quot;It has been tiring but enjoyable. We have many things to tell our family and friends about when we get back home.&quot; Another tourist, 40-year-old property developer Min Liu from central Henan province, also says he&apos;ll have plenty to talk about when he returns. But most of it won&apos;t be positive. &quot;This is the first and last time I will leave China,&quot; he says. He came overseas &quot;out of curiosity&quot; but thinks Thailand is inefficient and much more unsafe than China. &quot;Also, the local food smells bad and the flavour is wrong. It&apos;s not suitable for Chinese people,&quot; says the burly bald-headed man. The Chinese travel boom is similar to past waves of mass tourism among newly affluent middle classes. Thomas Cook basically invented the package tour in the 1850s when he began taking groups of British industrialists on two-week &quot;grand circular tours&quot; of Europe, sparking a new leisure activity among the well-heeled (who also grumbled about the exotic food). Americans followed with their loud voices and even louder leisurewear in the plentiful 1950s. Then came the Japanese, with their sun hats and cameras, in the &quot;economic bubble&quot; years of the 1970s and 80s. A major difference today is that the global travel industry is much more developed and finely calibrated to maximising profit. Providing endless &quot;attractions&quot; and services to woo tourists is now gigantic business, with tourism currently worth an estimated 9% of global GDP. (The global arms industry, by random contrast, is worth an estimated 2.5%.) Even when tourists don&apos;t travel in groups, as fewer Chinese are doing as time goes on, it&apos;s not easy for countries to find the right balance between proscribing their activities and letting them discover places for themselves. Pimpingfar Chokrapinnpass, a\u00a0marketing officer at the Tourism Authority of Thailand, admits as much: &quot;We want visitors to have authentic experiences of our culture and people, but it&apos;s not always possible because of the way the industry works.&quot; Chinese tourism has been slow to take off in the UK partly because Britain is not included in the Schengen programme that allows travellers to visit most of Europe on a\u00a0single visa \u2013 hence George Osborne&apos;s recent announcement of simplified visas. Only around 200,000 Chinese tourists visited Britain in 2012, while 1.4 million visited France. No effort is being spared to promote British charms. In September, British Airways launched its new direct flight from the Chinese western hub of Chengdu to Heathrow by staging a surprise &quot;Chinese panda flashmob dance&quot; in a Chengdu shopping mall. About 50 people in panda suits were hired to wiggle to disco music against a Union Jack backdrop, including some dressed up as apparently famous British pandas such as David Beckham, Sherlock Holmes and Harry Potter. There was even a panda Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with a baby panda George. Dancing pandas won&apos;t solve everything. Take Barnsley, for example. The South Yorkshire town is the birthplace of James Taylor Hudson, a missionary widely credited with introducing Christianity to China in the 1850s. Some townspeople believe Barnsley could attract millions of Chinese pilgrims \u2013 there are around 70 million Christians in China \u2013 and even become &quot;a new Bethlehem&quot;. In August, however, the Barnsley Chronicle reported that a Beijing woman who came to assess the town&apos;s potential said Chinese investors were &quot;disappointed&quot; with her findings. &quot;Chinese visitors like midnight shopping, karaoke and massage, not bars and drinking,&quot; 58-year-old Mary Lui told the newspaper. &quot;But they can&apos;t find it here in Barnsley.&quot; Lui suggested the town should consider opening a 24-hour shopping centre, an &quot;authentic&quot; Chinese restaurant and a health centre. But who&apos;s to say that Christian-minded Chinese wouldn&apos;t find some redeeming features in Barnsley as it is? What the investors are really complaining about, it seems, is that there aren&apos;t enough big business ventures to make money from an influx of tourists. Wolfgang Georg Arlt of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute says surveys and web forums inside China repeatedly show that modern tourists are &quot;more open-minded&quot;. Both China and the west, he says, would do well to stop resorting to stereotypes and find out what people really like. One such stereotype is of Chinese tourists as shopping obsessives who buy up the entire contents of luxury boutiques. Many Chinese do buy designer items overseas \u2013 in the coming year they are projected to buy more luxury goods than all other nationalities combined. Along with the usual aspirational love of status symbols, duties of up to 60% on such goods back home partially explain the phenomenon. back in Pattaya, tour guide Angela Wu says shopping is rarely the sole reason for a\u00a0foreign trip. Wu, 45, from Shanghai, is chain-smoking in the lobby of the Miss Tiffany transvestite cabaret show while her tour-group charges watch the evening&apos;s glittering performance. &quot;Most people travel because they want to see something they can&apos;t see in China,&quot; she says. &quot;They&apos;re interested in historical sites and famous art in Europe, and natural scenery in America and Australia.&quot; Pattaya&apos;s spectacular ladyboys are another example of something they can&apos;t see back home. (On one tour group&apos;s itinerary, the Chinese word used to describe them translates as &quot;person-creatures&quot;.) After the show, the sequin-bedecked performers in towering headdresses crowd into the lobby to pose for photographs with tourists for an extra charge of 40 baht (80p) a time. &quot;Please inform management if the artists misbehave,&quot; says a large sign warning about potential overcharging. But on this occasion it&apos;s some of the Chinese men who misbehave by trying to squeeze the ladyboys&apos; breasts during their photo sessions. &quot;They think it&apos;s OK because the breasts are not real,&quot; says Wu wearily. Wu, who has worked as a guide for 20 years within and outside China, says taking her countrymen and women overseas is like &quot;going into battle&quot;. &quot;No decision is ever simple. Everyone has an opinion that must be heard.&quot; But she doesn&apos;t believe that Chinese tourists deserve a wholesale reputation for being badly behaved. Like any nation, she says, &quot;there are polite people and rude people&quot; and most extreme cases of uncouth behaviour are isolated incidents that shouldn&apos;t tarnish all Chinese people. There was outrage in May, for example, when it emerged that a teenage boy from the city of Nanjing had etched his name on a\u00a03,500-year-old stone carving at a Luxor temple in Egypt. While the boy&apos;s parents publicly apologised, Chinese netizens pointed out that China&apos;s ancient Great Wall is covered with western graffiti. Other incidents occur, Wu says, as a result of the acute disorientation that some people experience in alien surroundings. She cites one occasion when she took a group of provincial Chinese tourists to Sydney. &quot;It was winter at home but summer in Australia, so I told them to go into the toilets when we got off the plane to change into light clothing.&quot; When they arrived, Wu found many people stripping down to their underwear at the arrivals gate, in view of other passengers. &quot;They would never do that back in China. People were just confused,&quot; she says. Nevertheless, mindful of the nation&apos;s image overseas, China&apos;s government issued a\u00a064-page Handbook for Civilised Tourism in October containing safety tips and etiquette rules for its citizens abroad. Along with some useful advice, the booklet&apos;s rules include: &quot;Don&apos;t steal the lifejacket from the airplane&quot;, &quot;Don&apos;t leave footprints on toilet seats&quot;, &quot;Don&apos;t take more than you can eat from breakfast buffets&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t dry your smalls over hotel lampshades&quot;. There are also some country-specific tips, such as warning travellers to the UK that asking British people if they&apos;ve eaten is &quot;deemed impolite&quot;, and advising female tourists to wear earrings while in Spain, otherwise &quot;they will be considered naked&quot;. No wonder some people are confused. Luckily Shun-Wen Tong, the student I met at the top of Pattaya&apos;s observation tower, was not one of them. He emailed me when he returned to Hangzhou to say he had survived his package tour without any dramas. He wasn&apos;t quite as convinced as before that Thailand was &quot;100% a holy country&quot; after visiting a &quot;sex show where ladies shot tropical fruit from their private parts&quot;, but he was impressed at how &quot;spirituality and sexuality happily co-existed&quot;. Most of all, he said, the experience had given him the confidence to arrange his own trips abroad in future. A few days later, Tong sent me a 10,000-word document in both English and Chinese entitled A Journal of My Travels, all about his time in Thailand. &quot;I hope you like it,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This is just the first instalment.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Travel", "Travel & leisure", "Business", "ent and tourismHospitality, event managem", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China holidays", "Asia", "Thailand holidays"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-22T00:05:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/23/peoples-bank-china-injects-capital-economy", "sentences": ["Worries about the banking system contributed to a 2% drop in Shanghai shares on Friday, although the stock market steadied on Monday after Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said she would be revising up her forecasts for US growth in 2014."], "title": "People's Bank of China injects capital into economy to ease credit crunch fear", "article": "The People&apos;s Bank of China is seeking to allay fears of a credit crunch after a shortage of day-to-day cash among commercial banks in the world&apos;s second biggest economy drove market interest rates to almost 10% on Monday.

Benchmark interbank rates \u2013 the rates at which banks lend to each other rather than to the public \u2013 climbed to 9.8% at one stage on Monday, their highest for six months, despite the central bank&apos;s cash injections last week. The actions by the PBoC were a response to signs of tensions in the far east&apos;s financial markets, caused by an earlier tightening of policy by the central bank, aimed at reducing the risk of cheap credit causing asset bubbles. Banks in China often find themselves short of cash at the end of the year as companies increase their demand for capital and institutions have to meet tough regulatory requirements. China&apos;s growing shadow banking system, which tends to offer higher interest rates to investors, has also been draining funds from traditional banks. Lorraine Tan, director of equity research at S&amp;P Capital IQ, told CNCBC that the PBoC may need to take more action. &quot;I think it&apos;s just a momentary thing \u2026 it&apos;s a seasonal issue, a rush for cash. Definitely the PBoC needs to pump in more money, which it has been doing, but a little bit more is probably necessary.&quot; Beijing pumped trillions of yuan into the economy during the global meltdown of 2008-09 and succeeded in ensuring that recession was short-lived. But officials have grown increasingly concerned that the stimulus encouraged excessive borrowing by commercial property companies and by local government. The PBoC has been pushing up interest rates in recent months to rein in credit growth without causing a &quot;hard landing&quot;. Investors fear the combination of Fed tapering \u2013 the gradual winding down of America&apos;s quantitative easing programme \u2013 and tighter China interest rates could weigh on emerging market currencies and assets, as it did back in June.

Phablets to outdo small tablets in 2014: technalysis&apos;s O&apos;Donnell &gt;&gt; Forbes  In the US, people routinely mock extra-big smartphones that approach tablet-computer dimensions. Maybe it&apos;s time to stop snickering. Demand for these odd-sized devices is growing so fast in Asia, Europe and Brazil that &quot;phablets&quot; worldwide in 2014 should outsell traditional smaller tablets, predicts Bob O&apos;Donnell, the founder of Technalysis Research.  &quot;I thought phablets were ridiculous at first,&quot; O&apos;Donnell concedes. &quot;How could you hold one to your ear to make a call? But over time, they grow on you.&quot; For 2014, he predicts that 175 million phablets will be sold worldwide, versus a more modest 165 million sales of smaller tablets (screens measuring 8 inches or less on the diagonal.)  As only 16% of users&apos; time on smartphones is spent talking, having a big screen is useful. But O&apos;Donnell seems to be anticipating a larger Apple design &quot;in spring or autumn&quot;. Stick to the latter. Toshiba ships DVD media with laptop without DVD drive &gt;&gt; Gadget Writing Tim Anderson:   One day you will be able to buy a Windows device and have a smooth and delightful experience getting started. To be fair, something like a Surface tablet can give offer a reasonable experience if you are lucky. Not so a Toshiba Portege Z930 ultrabook \u2013 at least, not if you buy one with Windows 7 pre-installed, and want to run Windows 8, as a contact of mine has just done. Why would you not buy one with Windows 8 pre-installed instead? With hindsight, that is what I would recommend; but since it says on the box, &quot;This system is pre-installed with Windows 7 Pro software and also comes with a license and media for Windows 8 Pro software,&quot; he did not think it much mattered. The problem: The Z930 has no optical drive, but Windows 8 is supplied in the form of two recovery DVDs.  Amazingly, things then get worse. An open letter to the chiefs of EMC and RSA &gt;&gt; F-Secure Weblog Mikko Hypponen:   On December 20th, Reuters broke a story alleging that your company accepted a random number generator from the National Security Agency, and set it as the default option in one of the your products, in exchange of $10m. Your company has issued a statement on the topic, but you have not denied this particular claim. Eventually, NSA&apos;s random number generator was found to be flawed on purpose, in effect creating a back door. You had kept on using the generator for years despite widespread speculation that NSA had backdoored it. As my reaction to this, I&apos;m cancelling my talk at the RSA Conference USA 2014 in San Francisco in February 2014.  Things are starting to happen. Why Huobi purportedly has higher volume than BTCChina and OKCoin &gt;&gt; Great Wall of Numbers Tim Swanson:   For those unfamiliar with Huobi, it is now the largest Bitcoin exchange in China doing roughly 40,000-80,000 in volume a day (versus 4,000 at OKCoin) \u2013 though these numbers could be suspect (see the last section below).\u00a0 Earlier today I spoke with my friend who is building an exchange in Shanghai who explained the volume discrepancy. The way the current exchanges in China are nearly all set up is that all of the trading is actually conducted using the CEO&apos;s personal bank account. \u00a0That is to say, none of the exchanges (at first) utilized a corporate account. \u00a0At some point this past year the big exchanges managed to switch to corporate accounts in some form or fashion. \u00a0So on top of the 3rd party payment provider ban issues last week, the CEOs at the big exchanges (probably) expect some kind of crackdown on personal accounts so they are trying to go completely legitimate and avoid the risks associated with personal liability.

It was the seventh break-in of its kind in the city this year. &quot;These are not amateurs,&quot; Berlin police department spokesman Thomas Neuendorf said by telephone. &quot;We suspect that we&apos;re dealing with a gang.&quot; A stolen Opel Corsa was used to smash the Apple store window and the thieves escaped in two Audis, Neuendorf said. On 9 December, thieves drove into Berlin&apos;s Alexa shopping mall and took about \u20ac100,000 ($137,000) of electronics.  Tribune to acquire Sony audio recognition unit Gracenote for $170m &gt;&gt; TechCrunch  Global consumer electronics conglomerate Sony is getting a tiny bit leaner with the sale of Gracenote, a business unit that provides audio recognition and metadata solutions to a number of device manufacturers and media companies. Tribune will spend $170m to buy out Gracenote in a deal that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014, and will combine it with Tribune Media Services (TMS). The sale comes five years after Sony acquired Gracenote in a deal worth $260m\u2026 Sony has been making cuts in its media business, and has come under pressure from investor Daniel Loeb to spin off the entertainment unit. Getting rid of Gracenote, which provides technology not just to Sony, but to a number of its competitors in the consumer electronics world, therefore makes a bit of sense.  The only way it makes sense is if it&apos;s losing money. Happy Christmas to everyone.

Sci-fi films depict a futuristic world where Baidu.com is the new Google and Mcdonalds has been replaced by Grandma Wang&apos;s Dumpling Emporium. And yet again Shanghai is number one on the Programme for International Student Assessment&apos;s (Pisa) 2012 ranking list of international education, and the US is once again at a low rank, this time 36th place. The US is desperate, and naturally the Chinese educational system seems like an answer. But let me tell you \u2013 this is not the case. I know; for two years I attended a local Shanghainese high school and this is the truth: they are terrible. The biggest problem with Chinese education? It&apos;s medieval. Shanghainese education is just like the stories my grandmother tells about high school in the 1940&apos;s. Footage of military parades in Fascist Italy share an unnerving resemblance to the morning assemblies from my school in Shanghai. Chinese education would be a poison for America, not a remedy. The problem is that there are too many Chinese students. Shanghainese classrooms have about 40 students and in the countryside classes have over 60. The most efficient way to organize all these children is by testing, categorizing and grading them \u2013 Chinese education is essentially elitist. Students that excel in school are rewarded with prizes and encouragement, but struggling students are abandoned. I once served as a translator for the principal of my school when seven Swedish principals came to visit Shanghai. The Swedes asked what the school did for students with &quot;special needs&quot; and the principal answered:   The special students who are doing well in class? We make sure to put a lot of focus on them.  This Chinese principal didn&apos;t understand the concept of special needs, and neither does the Chinese educational system. A major reason why certain students do poorly in China is that their skills are ignored. Creativity and critical thinking are seen as objects of western frivolousness. Although Chinese students analyze literature, they never write essays and instead they simply memorize the texts. I have never memorized so much in my life as I did in Shanghai. The ideal Shanghainese student is like a sea sponge blindly absorbing any and all information and spewing it all out during the tests. The system in the US is not ideal \u2013 nobody can call the SAT a platform for creativity \u2013 but the American system does at least encourage questions and tries to make students into critical thinkers. If there are Chinese students with a critical mind, they are almost always self-taught. The Chinese educational system produces millions of test-taking experts. The culmination of this test-taking mania is the Gaokao, the national university entrance exam. Much like the SAT, these exams give you a certain amount of points and these points correspond to the university you may attend. In 2006, a record high 9.5 million students took these tests. All three years of high school are devoted to the exams, and teachers refer to them continually.  In the last year the entire senior grade is usually sent off to another campus to make sure that they are not distracted from their study by social life. Many of my friends agree that the test is useless \u2013 the calculus problems and memorized literature will not be of any use in the future \u2013 but they have no choice. This is the way the system works, and to succeed in life they have to follow it. So obviously when the Shanghainese students have a Pisa test placed in front of them, they complete it without having to think twice. Chinese children have been taking tests since the arrival of their milk teeth. The system breeds Pisa champions, but it also ruins young lives.  Should America follow China? Absolutely not, so stop the rumors. American education isn&apos;t perfect, but while following Shanghai might mean higher Pisa scores, it would be disastrous for the nation&apos;s children and its future.", "tags": ["Education", "China", "US news", "World news", "US education"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-28T12:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/29/signs-slowdown-prime-london-property", "sentences": ["The slowdown in London prices is in contrast to predicted double-digit growth in places such as Dubai, Beijing, Shanghai and Sydney."], "title": "Prime London property prices show signs of slowdown", "article": "Soaring house prices in London&apos;s prime locations are showing signs of a slowdown, according to new figures.

However, the annual rate of increase was below the 8.7% recorded last year and the 12.1% seen in 2011.

Little did the striker know then that those words would soon take on a different and distinctly dark connotation. Anelka is under investigation by the Football Association for the quenelle gesture, described in some quarters as the &quot;reverse Nazi salute&quot;, which he made while celebrating the first of his two goals at Upton Park. Despite the Frenchman&apos;s insistence that it was done in &quot;special dedication to my comedian friend Dieudonn\u00e9&quot;, he could yet be banned for a minimum of five matches under FA anti-discriminatory rules. Such a sanction could well spell the end, in England at least, of a career that has never been short of drama. From forcing a move from Arsenal to Real Madrid in 1999, to refusing to bow in front of team-mates during his brief spell at Shanghai Shenhua, Anelka has proved himself a troubled and troubling figure ever since catching the eye as a teenager at Paris Saint-Germain in the mid-1990s. It was felt that a nadir had been reached when Anelka was expelled from France&apos;s 2010 World Cup squad after insulting the then head coach Raymond Domenech, but events at the weekend suggest that, at the age of 34, the player has managed to sink even lower. Given the notoriety the quenelle has gained in France ever since Dieudonn\u00e9 M&apos;Bala M&apos;Bala, a figure known for harbouring antisemitic views, first used it in 2009, it is inconceivable that Anelka was not aware of the outrage he would unleash by performing it in east London. West Bromwich Albion&apos;s caretaker manager, Keith Downing, gave his support to Anelka in the aftermath of Saturday&apos;s game but that was before he had been able to fully digest the exact nature of what the striker had done, and should he be charged and banned by the FA then that could well prove to be that for Anelka at West Brom, whom he joined on a free transfer last July on a one-year deal. Given his age and baggage, it is conceivable that &quot;Le Sulk&quot; would find it difficult to attract a seventh different club from these shores to take on his services. Saturday&apos;s controversy overshadowed what was an excellent display by Anelka. Making just his eighth appearance for West Bromwich after a period at the Hawthorns interrupted by illness, injury and tragedy (Anelka took compassionate leave in August following the death of his agent Eric Manasse), the forward played with guile and intelligence, scoring his first and second goals for the club in the space of five first-half minutes, the first a cool finish following Chris Brunt&apos;s defence-splitting pass and the second, which put the visitors 2-1 up, an instinctive shot from close range. Here was evidence of why clubs such as Arsenal, Real, Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus have all signed Anelka and, until a storm of outrage broke around him, there was a sense that he had finally got going as a West Brom player. Behind the scenes, at least, it appears Anelka has proved a welcome addition to the club&apos;s ranks, with Berahino, who scored the visitors&apos; third goal with a fizzing drive, praising the veteran as a positive influence on his fellow frontmen. &quot;He&apos;s passed on a lot of experience to me, Victor Anichebe and Matej Vydra,&quot; said the England Under-21 striker. &quot;Just watching him in training \u2013 he&apos;s got good movement, always thinking ahead. He is a good guy and a great footballer.&quot; Anelka undoubtedly played a key role in West Bromwich securing what was a third successive draw under Downing, and as the club continue to search for a long-term successor to Steve Clarke there were definite signs that they maintain the quality to escape relegation trouble. The same can also be said of West Ham who, having lost the lead given to them by Joe Cole&apos;s early goal, showed admirable resilience in going 3\u20132 up thanks to Modibo Ma\u00efga and Kevin Nolan&apos;s well-taken second-half goals. However, this was the third league game in succession in which they have conceded three times, and the boos that rang out after the final whistle suggest Sam Allardyce is under increasing pressure ahead of the Hammers&apos; crucial visit to Fulham on New Year&apos;s Day. &quot;What will be, will be,&quot; said Allardyce when told he is now favourite among many bookmakers to become the next sacked Premier League manager. &quot;In my defence, we&apos;ve had six or seven players out injured for weeks.
