Tens of thousands of people lined the banks of the River Thames as the chimes of Big Ben rang in the new year in the capital, while an estimated 80,000 descended on Edinburgh for its famous Hogmanay street party. Fireworks events also took place in Cardiff and Belfast, while Londonderry marked its final few hours as the UK City of Culture in 2013 with a cathedral service. Some 50,000 revellers in London braved the threat of rain to enjoy what was billed as &quot;the world&apos;s first multi-sensory fireworks display&quot;, when peach snow and orange-scented bubbles descend on a section of the crowd. Partygoers queued for hours to get a prime spot near the London Eye, where an enormous fireworks display lit up the skyline.  Up to 100,000 are thought to have enjoyed the display, during which people were given LED wristbands and fruit-flavoured sweets that linked to the tastes and smells of the multi-sensory display to bring something different to the new year festivities. After watching the fireworks, revellers joined in a traditional rendition of Auld Lang Syne. London mayor Boris Johnson said there was &quot;no better way to celebrate the highs of 2013 and the start of an exciting new year&quot; than enjoying one of the world&apos;s most dazzling fireworks displays&quot;. The Metropolitan police said it had 3,800 officers on duty for the event, while London Ambulance Service received 1,100 calls between 7pm and midnight, and 469 in the first hour of 2014. Travel on buses, the Tube, trams, Docklands Light Railway and the London Overground remained free until 4.30am. In Edinburgh thousands of people counted down the last moments of 2013 before fireworks over Edinburgh Castle and Calton Hill marked the start of the new year. The Pet Shop Boys headlined a concert in Princes Street Gardens, while there was also a Keilidh playing traditional Scottish music. Today around half a million people are expected to attend the annual New Year&apos;s Day Parade in London, which could be hit by rain and strong winds. The celebration parade will feature music from around the globe, leaving the Ritz Hotel at noon and winding through Piccadilly, Pall Mall and Trafalgar Square before ending in Parliament Square. In New York a sea of horn-tooting, hat-wearing revellers cheered and kissed as the famed crystal ball dropped in a freezing New York City Times Square to ring in 2014, capping a worldwide wave of celebrations that included a dazzling 30-minute fireworks show in Dubai.

Photograph: Adrees Latif/Reuters    US supreme court Justice Sonia Sotomayor led the 60-second countdown and pushed the button that unleashed the shimmering orb with 2,688 crystals, a role usually filled by the New York City mayor. Michael Bloomberg, on his last day in office, was sitting the celebration out after 12 years on the job, while newly elected mayor Bill de Blasio took the oath of office just after midnight at his Brooklyn home. The New York celebration featured performances from artists such as Miley Cyrus, Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis and Blondie There were spectacular displays in Rio, Brazil, where thousands watched as fireworks lit up the skies over Copacabana Beach. In Russia, where two suicide bombings in two days killed 34 people, eerily empty buses lumbered through the streets of Volgograd, where authorities canceled mass events for New Year&apos;s Eve and asked residents not to set off fireworks. President Vladimir Putin, in his New Year&apos;s Eve address to the nation, vowed that the fight against terrorists will continue &quot;until their destruction is complete&quot;, Russian news agencies reported. In Dubai on the Persian Gulf officials sought to break another record by creating the largest fireworks show. The skyline was a canvas for a dazzling 30-minute show. The display capped off with six minutes of fireworks that engulfed the city&apos;s manmade, palm-shaped island, with its fronds and trunk shimmering in thousands of lights. In Ukraine anti-government protesters hoped to set their own record for the most people to sing a national anthem at the same time. On Kiev&apos;s main square at least 100,000 Ukrainians sang their national anthem in a sign of support for integration with Europe. The square has been the scene of massive pro-European protests for more than a month, triggered by President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s decision to ditch a key deal with the European Union. In the Philippines two people were killed and around 600 injured by firecracker blasts and celebratory gunfire as the nation marked the end of a year of tragic disasters, including an 8 November typhoon that left more than 6,100 dead and nearly 1,800 missing.     Fireworks explode over Sydney Harbour at midnight, ushering in the new year, in Sydney January 1, 2014 Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters    In Sydney there was a fireworks display that sprayed from the sails of the Sydney Opera House and the city&apos;s harbor bridge. New Zealand concluded 2013 with its own fireworks that erupted from Auckland&apos;s Sky Tower while cheering crowds danced in the streets. In Tokyo five priests at the Zojoji temple used ropes to swing a wooden pole against a large bell, sounding the first of 108 gongs to mark the new year. Simultaneously, &quot;2014&quot; lit up in white lights on the modern Tokyo Tower in the background. China had light shows at part of the Great Wall near Beijing and at the Bund waterfront in Shanghai. The city of Wuhan in central Hubei province called off its fireworks show and banned fireworks downtown to avoid worsening its smog. Pope Francis used his year-end prayer service of thanksgiving to urge people to ask themselves: fid they spend 2013 to further their own interests or to help others? The pontiff asked people to reflect if they used the past year to make the places where they live more livable and welcoming. Citing Rome as an example, Francis said the city is full of tourists, but also refugees.", "tags": ["World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-01T06:47:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jan/01/arts-preview-2014-blockbusters", "sentences": ["Architecture Shanghai Tower, by GenslerAs America bickers over which of its towers is tallest, the new World Trade Center or the Sears Tower, China is busy building soaring totems that will outshine them all.", "Next year will see the completion of the gargantuan Shanghai Tower, the second tallest building in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at 632 metres."], "title": "Arts preview 2014: blockbusters", "article": "Television True Detective Crime drama is always looking for new ways of dramatising a murder investigation: one killing investigated over 10 episodes; alternating viewpoints of cops, killer, victims and so on.

Captain America: The Winter SoldierMarvel Films just keep churning them out. This is the ninth recent derivation from The Avengers family, a follow-up to 2011&apos;s Captain America: The First Avenger, and a side-project of all those Iron Man and Thor movies. If the title is anything to go by, this one features the Cap&apos;s former sidekick Bucky, revived and transformed into a Soviet-era assassin. The usual Marvel crew are due to put in an appearance, led by Chris Evans and Scarlett Johannson (as\u00a0Black Widow). We&apos;ll also get to see Robert Redford in his first superhero movie, as a senior Shield operative. AP 28 March. The Amazing Spider-Man 2Hands up if you think there&apos;s been too many Spider-Man films? Well, it doesn&apos;t matter: here&apos;s another, courtesy of studio Sony&apos;s desire to keep hold of its rights to the material. Admittedly, the new series of Marc Webb-directed webslingery infuses the Spidey story with a roughhouse, skater-chic charm, with Andrew Garfield one of the classiest performers to ever don Spandex. Not too much has yet emerged of this one&apos;s plot, except that the Rhino (Paul Giamatti) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) appear to be the big villains. AP April. Dawn of the Planet of the ApesTim Burton&apos;s 2001 Planet of the Apes remake encouraged studio 20th Century Fox to punt a hopeful new series of the simian-bothering sci-fi. Now Cloverfield director Matt Reeves is in charge, filling in events well before the classic Charlton Heston story. Gary Oldman is the human talent, facing off against the apes. AP 17 July. Sin City: A Dame to Die ForAlmost a decade after the first instalment, here&apos;s a second collection of Frank Miller&apos;s sicko noir stories, with Miller again sharing directorial duties with Robert Rodriguez. Many of the same characters (and actors) are returning, including Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis; expect another dose of highly stylised comic-panel noir, with stunning visuals doing their best to compensate for the rampantly creepy sexism. AP 29 August. The Hobbit: There and Back AgainCritical opinion has held that things have picked up with Smaug, after the bloat of the first film, An Unexpected Journey, so here&apos;s hoping Peter Jackson can keep the standard up. Presumably There and Back Again will take in the aftermath of the dwarves&apos; takeover of the Lonely Mountain, their confrontation with the Wood-Elves and humans of Lake-town, and the climactic Battle of the Five Armies. After that, we&apos;ll all need a rest. AP 19 December. ExodusRidley Scott is offering up a Cecil B DeMille-ish answer to Darren Aronofsky&apos;s Noah, by retelling the Moses story with Christian Bale as the Jewish law-maker. Joel Edgerton is the Pharaoh Rameses, Sigourney Weaver the Pharaoh&apos;s mum Tuya, and Aaron Paul the Mosaic sidekick Joshua. As the founding myth of biblical Israel, this could be controversial territory, but Scott has successfully handled this type of tricky material before, in the crusades movie Kingdom of Heaven, and we expect him to be as agile here as before. AP 5 December. Theatre Shakespeare in LoveThe film made Joseph Fiennes. And, thanks to a smartly self-aware script by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, wasn&apos;t too bad for Shakespeare either. Screen-to-stage musicals have become almost as predictable as traffic jams in the West End, but thanks to the involvement of adapter Lee Hall (Billy Elliot) and director Declan Donnellan (of Cheek by Jowl), hopes are high that this might not pale beside the Shakespearean glories of West Side Story and Kiss Me Kate.

Miss SaigonIt&apos;s 25 years since this reworking of Puccini&apos;s Madame Butterfly \u2013 set in Saigon in 1975 as the Americans withdraw from Vietnam \u2013 opened in a production by the then little-known Nicholas Hytner. The Prince Edward is a smaller space for this epic love story from the writing team behind Les Mis\u00e9rables, so it&apos;ll be interesting to see if the reboot (and the famous helicopter scene) come off.

Art Matisse: The Cut-OutsThere is no more enigmatic masterpiece of modern art than Matisse&apos;s Snail, a huge paper cut-out whose revolving planes of colour have been delighting visitors to the Tate since it was bought by the museum in 1962. A toddler can enjoy this work of art \u2013 and recognise the shape of a snail \u2013 but is it an image or an abstract decoration that happens to be snail-like? This feast of colour and movement that Matisse created in 1953 exceeds any possible pictorial intention. Matisse made his cut-outs when the art world was transfixed by American abstraction. Yet the French painter asks more profound questions about the nature of meaning in art than Jackson Pollock ever did. His Snail is a sly subversive mocking all attempts to interpret it. Promises to be the most popular and beautiful artistic event of the year. Jonathan Jones Tate Modern, London SE1, 17\u00a0April to 7 September. VikingsThe world shuddered. Monks in Lindisfarne lay awake listening for war cries. On the far side of the world, native Americans saw sails on the horizon. The Vikings were a power in the world, a demonic force of pagan mayhem that threatened to destroy the frail beginnings of Europe and even put a frostbitten toe in Newfoundland. Yet a lot of the time, these Scandinavians farmed and told stories. To be a &quot;viking&quot; was a seasonal occupation: it meant to go out on the summer seas looking for trouble. Destructive as these warriors were, their myths are fascinating, their art has a rugged splendour, and this show \u2013 which includes a real longship \u2013 should thunder like Thor&apos;s hammer. JJ British Museum, London WC1, 6 March to 22 June. Mondrian and Colour Two major shows focus on the impeccable Dutch abstractionist Piet Mondrian. Mondrian and Colour at Turner in Margate considers the significance of colour in\u00a0his early career, bringing together around 40 paintings by the artist from the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag and other collections in Europe and the US. Tate Liverpool will present the concurrent show Mondrian and his Studios: Abstraction into the World. This will explore the artist&apos;s importance both as abstractionist and in his relationship with architecture and urbanism, and the spaces and places, in Amsterdam, Paris and New York, where he worked. The show will also include his wonderful 1914 series Pier and Ocean. Do that geometric boogie-woogie thing! Adrian\u00a0Searle Turner Contemporary, Margate, 24 May to 21 September; Tate Liverpool, 6 June to 21 September.  ColourColour in painting is as much the product of chemistry and the availability of pigments as it is of an artist&apos;s perceptions. Colour can be symbolic, it can imitate nature, it can be as earthy, ethereal and fugitive as it can be poisonous and exorbitantly expensive and rare. The history of painting is, in part, a history of materials and their uses. The development of impressionism and plein-aire painting was as much related to new industrially manufactured pigments and their availability in tubes as it was to artistic theory. Trade routes and artistic experiment, technical innovation and an almost alchemical search for the lost secrets of the old masters changed the way paintings looked and were made in radical and far-reaching ways. Each room will be devoted to a different colour, and will look at the National&apos;s own collection in relation to minerals, textiles, ceramics and glass on loan from major national and international cultural institutions. AS National Gallery, London WC2, 18 June to 7 September.     Photograph: The National Gallery    Rembrandt: The Final YearsForty paintings, 20 drawings and 30 prints by an artist doesn&apos;t sound a lot, but when the person we&apos;re talking about is Rembrandt and the focus is on\u00a0the works he created in the last two\u00a0decades of his life, expect something magisterial. Like late\u00a0Titian, Rembrandt&apos;s style towards the end of his life became ever more frank and unconcerned with\u00a0the kind\u00a0of painterly decorum\u00a0and\u00a0detail expected by\u00a0his patrons. With his churned-up surfaces, harsh lighting and dramatic settings, his manner achieved more than an illusion of directness. Nowhere is this clearer than in his drawings and etchings. And when we look at Rembrandt looking at himself, in his late self-portraits, we get the feeling that he just doesn&apos;t care what we think. Which is exactly what makes us care as much as we do. AS National Gallery, London WC2, 15 October to 18\u00a0January\u00a02015. Architecture Shanghai Tower, by GenslerAs America bickers over which of its towers is tallest, the new World Trade Center or the Sears Tower, China is busy building soaring totems that will outshine them all. Next year will see the completion of the gargantuan Shanghai Tower, the second tallest building in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at 632 metres. Designed by anonymous corporate giant Gensler, it climbs in a spiral like a frozen whirlwind, captured in glass, housing a stack of offices, shops and vertical gardens, and accommodating up to 16,000 people.

Antonio Pappano: Verdi RequiemFew conductors today bring out the drama of Verdi better than Pappano. His 2009 recording of the Requiem with his Rome-based Orchestra of Santa Cecilia won rave reviews, not only for its moments of blazing theatricality, but also for its finely crafted details and quality of intense inwardness. For these two UK concerts he&apos;s joined by top-notch soloists, including tenor Joseph Calleja, in what promises to be an unbeatable live experience. Imogen Tilden Symphony Hall, Birmingham, 16 May; Royal Festival Hall, London SE1, 18 May. John Eliot Gardiner: MonteverdiFifty years ago a Cambridge undergraduate assembled a group of singers to perform what was then still an extreme rarity, Monteverdi&apos;s great 1611 setting of the Vespers, in King&apos;s College Chapel. Those singers formed the nucleus of what became the Monteverdi Choir and have continued their close association with that concert&apos;s conductor, John Eliot Gardiner, ever since. On the exact anniversary Gardiner and his choir and\u00a0orchestra, the English Baroque Soloists, return to King&apos;s to recreate that debut; even though Monteverdi&apos;s Vespers is much more familiar now than it was in 1964, it is always thrilling to hear it live.

There&apos;s no blaring music, no sharp cries of victory; all you hear is the rustle of clothing, a hushed conversation, the occasional thump on a table \u2013 subtle signs of fortunes made and lost. If Las Vegas is a gaudy monument to the American dream of endless possibility, Macau, the only place in China where gambling is legal, is a fitting Chinese counterpoint: a temple to the acquisition of extreme wealth by any means necessary. The former Portuguese colony, administered by Beijing as a &quot;special autonomous region&quot; since 1999, is just a speck on China&apos;s south coast, an 8\u00a0sq\u00a0kilometre peninsula joined by bridges to two hilly islands in the South China Sea. Yet it&apos;s home to 35 casinos, which last year brought in a record $45bn (\u00a327.4bn), according to figures published last week by Macau&apos;s regulator, the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. That is estimated to be more than seven times the amount made on Las Vegas&apos;s Strip. But the peninsula has a problem: two-thirds of its gambling revenue still comes from closed-door VIP rooms controlled by &quot;junkets&quot; \u2013 companies that bring high-rolling punters across from the mainland on extravagant package deals and load them up with credit. Multimillion-pound bets and flights on private jets are common, as are suggestions of money laundering and links to organised crime. But over the past year the once-untouchable junkets have felt the chill of president Xi Jinping&apos;s crackdown on corruption among party officials. Casino bosses have taken note \u2013 they are investing heavily in lavish resorts, high-end shopping malls and elaborate stage shows as the region tries to reinvent itself. Just as it once turned itself from colonial backwater to den of organised crime, now Macau needs to become a family tourist destination, a playground for China&apos;s burgeoning upper middle class. And they seem to be succeeding: last year&apos;s $45bn takings were up nearly 19% from 2012. &quot;An accountant would say, looking at the balance sheets, that this thing is far from broken,&quot; said Glenn McCartney, a tourism expert at the University of Macau. &quot;But when you go beyond the economics, you realise you shouldn&apos;t have all of your eggs in one basket.&quot; Leading the transformation is the Venetian Macau, the world&apos;s largest casino (51,000 sq meters), housed in one of the world&apos;s largest buildings. Despite temperatures in the mid-teens, the ground outside its main entrance was covered in fake snow this Christmas. Opera singers belted out carols from a high balcony framed by ersatz gothic columns. Nearby, a man was handing out sweets. &quot;We&apos;re trying to give everybody a feeling of Christmas,&quot; said entertainment manager Guy Lesquoy. Venice is too far away for most Chinese holidaymakers, but the Venetian offers a handy substitute. Over Christmas, 120,000 visitors a day walked its ersatz Italian streets and filled its 3,000 hotel suites. Lesquoy has 200 performers on his staff, including Russian acrobats, Belarusian flautists, and Filipino opera stars who croon Chinese folk tunes from gondolas plying the resort&apos;s third-floor grand canal. Overhead, a computer-controlled artificial blue sky was set to dusk.     Manny Pacquiao after his victory over Brandon Rios in Macau. Photograph: John Gurzinski/AFP/Getty Images    The Venetian also includes a 15,000 capacity sporting arena, a 92,000 sq metre shopping mall, four swimming pools, and an exhibition hall so vast that looking straight across its empty expanse inspires a feeling of falling. It recently hosted a fight featuring Filipino boxer Manny Pacqui\u00e1o, as well as performances by Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Alicia Keys. The Rolling Stones will perform there in March; according to Lesquoy, tickets sold out in two hours. Competitors have followed suit. Over the road, the mega-casino City of Dreams has opened two regular shows: Taboo \u2013 a cabaret \u2013 and the House of Dancing Water, an acrobatics spectacle directed by Franco Dragone, formerly of Cirque du Soleil. Nearby, six more resorts are under construction. One, MGM Resorts, will include a 20,000-seat arena; another, an ultra-upscale boutique resort called Louis XIII, will boast a suite that costs nearly \u00a380,000 a night. Investors say Macau&apos;s bet on the continued prosperity of the middle class is a safe one. About 800,000 tourists from mainland China visited Macau in 1999; last year, that had grown to 17 million. Most arrive ready to spend. &quot;The average bet in Macau is at least US$100, and I&apos;m talking about the mass market,&quot; said Aaron Fischer of CLSA Asia Pacific Markets in Hong Kong. &quot;That&apos;s a reflection of how crazy things have gotten in China.&quot; Most of this money changes hands in round after lightning-fast round of baccarat, an old European card game based on chance. &quot;Chinese gamblers don&apos;t come here for fun; they come here to win,&quot; said Desmond Lam of the University of Macau. About half of them only stay in Macau for about 24 hours: they play baccarat until first light, then stumble bleary-eyed on to the first Hong Kong-bound ferry of the day. Hence the silence. &quot;They believe in feng shui and they believe in luck \u2013 it&apos;s much stronger here than in western countries, and their gambling reflects that,&quot; said Lam. On the casino floor of the Grand Lisboa hotel, a glittering, pineapple-shaped skyscraper visible from almost anywhere on the peninsula, two businessmen from China&apos;s Hunan province were bemoaning their losses over Taiwanese cigarettes, paying little attention to the nearly naked woman performing aerial acrobatics on a dangling blue ribbon behind them. Such scenes were repeated across the peninsula. In a lush, suite-like room on the fourth floor of the Ponte 16 casino, a middle-aged woman with purple eyebrows sat alone at a baccarat table. She bet \u00a3300, lost it, and immediately laid down another stack of chips. In the Sands Macau, a man in a puffy pink jacket blew on the card he&apos;d been dealt, slowly turned up one corner to reveal an eight of diamonds, pumped his fist in the air and slammed his elbow on the table. He collected his winnings and left. His seat was taken immediately. Ben Lee of Macau-based consultancy IGamiX said Macau would struggle to be a tourist destination on the lines of Las Vegas. Beijing may want Macau to be an international showcase for China, much like its gleaming neighbour Hong Kong, but, said Lee: &quot;All Macau is a showcase for is how much the Chinese from mainland China gamble.&quot; For non-gambling tourists there was simply much more to see elsewhere, he added.     The Venetian Hotel and Casino in Macau. Photograph: Dan Chung/The Guardian    And despite President Xi&apos;s crackdown on the junket system, some experts say that VIP rooms are still thriving. Junkets are nearly impossible to regulate: in private rooms several floors above the hordes of tourists, top clients continue to spend millions of pounds in off-the-record bets. &quot;Junkets are legitimate agents in Macau&apos;s casino system,&quot; said Philippa Symington of FTI Consulting&apos;s Shanghai office and the author of a recent report on money laundering in Macau. &quot;Their activities can stray into criminal territory. This can range from working around occasional loose regulations \u2013 for example, enabling players to avoid identification \u2013 to relying on organised crime groups to collect gambling debts.&quot; In some ways, money laundering is to Macau what corruption is to mainland China \u2013 ubiquitous, yet impossible to eradicate without undermining the entire economy. China restricts the amount of money its citizens can carry abroad to about \u00a32,000 per trip and \u00a330,000 over a year. Macau appeals to wealthy mainlanders who, fearing scrutiny and volatility at home, may want to funnel their fortunes into overseas property markets and bank accounts. Junkets take advance payments on the mainland and offer easy credit across the border, allowing clients to far exceed Beijing&apos;s limits. Streets near major casinos are lined with brightly lit pawn shops selling shrink-wrapped luxury watches for thousands of pounds, which punters from the mainland buy on credit and immediately return for cash. The 2013 annual report from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, a US government agency, quoted an anonymous academic as saying: &quot;Each year, $202bn in ill-gotten funds are channelled through Macau.&quot; In December 2012, one of the region&apos;s most notorious criminals, gangland boss Wan Kuok-koi, known as Broken Tooth, was released after serving 14 years in prison for loan sharking, criminal association and illegal gambling. Wan once led 14K, the region&apos;s most notorious triad, and for many locals, his release was a reminder of how much had changed. &quot;I don&apos;t want to affect the stability of Macau,&quot; he told the South China Morning Post. &quot;There&apos;s absolutely no way I want to do that.&quot; Yet the lure of Macau&apos;s casinos again proved irresistible. In July, Wan told Hong Kong&apos;s Next magazine that he planned to open a VIP room in an unnamed casino.

Everywhere, but particularly in the south, there was a lovely and disarming sense of occasion, often leading to a mild frenzy for our signatures and for photographs. Every student had a smartphone and we were asked to pose for numerous photos. I don&apos;t know why they were so sought-after or if these pictures ended up on social networking sites but there were certainly times when the photo seemed to be of more value than the play itself. I wondered if Shakespeare was another western brand among many others for which there was now a growing hunger. Certainly there was a fascination with us as the bringers of a very British thing. And a passionate curiosity to know more about the world we came from. A group of four asked me what I did in England when I wasn&apos;t being an actor. I said I watched football, played it sometimes, and enjoyed drinking beer. They replied with noises of wonderment. When the students talked about Shakespeare, they spoke with passion about the power of his words: &quot;Shakespeare is not about nationalities; it&apos;s universal, about being human,&quot; said one student in Hangzhou. &quot;That&apos;s why he&apos;s popular in China.&quot; We asked another in Zhuhai whether Shakespeare was well-known: &quot;Yes, he is well-known here. Do you in Britain know Confucius? It is the same, I think.&quot; Another student desperately searched for the right words to explain that she valued Shakespeare&apos;s presentation &quot;not just of outer worlds but of inner \u2013 what&apos;s in your heart&quot;. We found that most often the biggest response of the evening \u2013 at least the noisiest \u2013 came in response to the discussion between Lady Macduff and her son on husbands: &quot;How wilt thou do for a father?&quot; &quot;Nay, how will you do for a husband?&quot; &quot;Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.&quot; There are many more men in China than women, so this is a complex and deep-rooted issue. Shakespeare&apos;s comic inversion is also felt as a sharp truth here. For a large part of the audience this was their introduction to live Shakespeare. The complete works weren&apos;t published here in translation until 1978 (and were the first complete works of any foreign writer to be published in Chinese translation). Chinese is a tonal, primarily monosyllabic language, so the audiences were simultaneously hearing the rhythms of Shakespeare&apos;s blank verse and reading the very different Mandarin structure \u2013 &quot;Two truths are told.&quot; Though there are, I&apos;m sure, many Chinas, this life on the road gave us only glimpses of a few and for the most part we were meeting the representatives of a new China, emerging in the wake of a sustained economic boom. I&apos;m not sure where the world of the university students and the concert hall regulars meets the beautiful grey, Beijing hutongs of dusty back streets or the pavement life of Guangdong. It feels clear which China will own the future though. Our young audiences talked longingly of Wangfujing, the main Beijing shopping thoroughfare, full of Apple and Armani products; the hutongs are fast disappearing. The arts appear to be lagging well behind the pace of economic change and transformation. I met a regular actor at the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre, who told me he thought there was a lack of playwriting in China engaged with contemporary issues. A change was needed, he said, but that for that to happen &quot;we need the students to change&quot;. I also spoke to a man in his 40s who had seen our show, whom we met in a German beer hall. He talked openly of the dissatisfaction with government that he senses from all ages. He thought that both the young and older generations were very aware of a growing gap between the rich and the poor, with many of the older people increasingly calling for a return to the old, Maoist, days, &quot;where people were equal, but poor&quot;, while the young looked for a more fundamental shift forward. He saw a strong connection between the Macbeths and the case of Bo Xilai, the charismatic and ambitious star of the Chinese Communist party, and his wife Gu Kailai, both of whom are now behind bars following one of the biggest corruption scandals in modern Chinese history. &quot;Vaulting ambition&quot; of this type was, he said, widespread: &quot;They think: &apos;If you get in my way, I will get rid of you&apos;. &quot; We&apos;re back now, reflecting on some remarkable highlights. The variety of the places we found ourselves in was challenging at times, but also inspired us to improvise. One night our Macbeth, noting how the vocal sound from the stage was bouncing back off the hall of residence building in front, simply said &quot;Tomorrow and \u2026&quot;, then let the echo reply, and added his final &quot;tomorrow&quot; to complete the famous line, in which Macbeth expresses his existential despair after hearing of the apparent suicide of his wife. Of course there was the occasional lowlight too. The Porter&apos;s underpants are drifting somewhere along the Pearl river, after a hotel window mishap. They will have to be our gift to China for now. We might try to get them back the next time round. Michael Wagg was playing Banquo in Macbeth for TNT Theatre.

The song is Cinnamon and Lesbians, and even though you don&apos;t believe him for a second \u2013 Malkmus, 47, is now a responsible father of two who moved, briefly, to Berlin in the run-up to this album, to enjoy its family-friendliness rather than its techno dungeons \u2013 that carefree line telegraphs something important about Wig Out at Jagbags. Since the demise of Malkmus&apos;s 90s band Pavement \u2013 erudite, messy; a heroic counterpoint to the hegemonic lurch of grunge \u2013 half of his albums have been knotted affairs. Malkmus&apos;s rhythms have tended towards the tesseract and his melodies towards origami. The gnarliest tune here is the first. With a hammered on-beat and whining guitars near the gum line, Planetary Motion is a reminder of how good the Jicks are at making smart pop out of hairy-palmed prog-blues \u2013 before the party really begins. Wig Out at Jagbags is exceedingly comfortable with Malkmus&apos;s feted past as a pop slacker-savant. It&apos;s OK with the idea of having fun, like Pavement did. It seems comfortable, too, with the idea of a late 80s/early 90s revival. There&apos;s even a little Pixies-grunge fusion in a song called Shibboleth, with its Kim Deal-in-Doc Martens bassline and Black Francis guitar squeal. Rumble at the Rainbo, though, finds Malkmus appearing to hate the idea of being stuck in the past, poking fun at reunions and ossified musical tastes. There was a well-received Pavement reunion in 2010 but it didn&apos;t last long, unlike the current Pixies psychodrama. &quot;Come and join us in this punk rock tune/ Come and slam dance with some ancient dudes,&quot; Malkmus laughs, as genres fly by like crowd-surfers. Soon after, on Chartjunk, he&apos;s rolling his eyes, presumably at youth \u2013 again, without much bile: &quot;I been you/ I been everywhere you&apos;re going\u2026&quot; This time the genre is galumphing country glam, tied off with a widdling guitar solo that makes you want to cheer. You get the sense that Malkmus and his Jicks aren&apos;t in a thorny place right now, but in an open-hearted, mellow one, making a gloriously accessible record that hasn&apos;t required dumbing-down in order to achieve its grooves. Fran &quot;Travis&quot; Healey was Malkmus&apos;s neighbour in Berlin and organised some local dads to be the brass section on songs such as Chartjunk and J Smoov. There are immensely entertaining references to raclette, Micronesia and headlice, &quot;windbag wisdom&quot;, &quot;Christian constructs&quot;, &quot;truckhuggers&quot; and &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;. Lariat is carried along on Malkmus&apos;s easy-going vocal melody but the single remains full of toothsome little guitar flourishes. Two-thirds of the way in, someone bangs cheery chords on a piano, only allowing themselves a little jazzy expostulation on the coda. Singles are by nature the juiciest bait, but what&apos;s cheering is that so many of these tracks match Lariat for sheer breeziness. Cinnamon and Lesbians turns out to be a keynote tune, riffing on the free-associative word-mulch Malkmus has made his trademark. &quot;Shanghai&apos;d in Oregon/ Cinnamon and lesbians,&quot; Malkmus begins, before muttering a curt &quot;hey!&quot; and setting the guitars on a lyrical journey that outdoes mere language.

The government will, for a trial period, allow games consoles to be made within Shanghai&apos;s free trade zone and sold within China, subject to standard local inspections on multimedia goods. An official statement confirming the decision described it as\u00a0an &quot;experiment [to] temporarily adjust&quot; relevant regulations in order to &quot;explore the experience of reform and opening&quot;. The move paves the way for the biggest foreign games console makers - Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo - to push into the Chinese market where video games are worth 83bn yuan ($13bn) annually, according to China&apos;s annual games industry conference. The announcement did not state a timeframe for the experiment or fully explain the sudden change in policy, but it is\u00a0in line with wider economic reforms and liberalisation in China over recent years. Another factor that may have prompted the relaxation is the illegal trade in video games, which thrives throughout the country despite state attempts to restrict it. The ban on consoles has meant that PC gaming dominates as much as two thirds of the games market, but there is a vibrant market in illegal consoles. The intention to relax trade restrictions was announced last year, making this latest statement part of a longer process and perhaps little more than a formality. &quot;This just means one step of the process has been taken,&quot; said Yasuhiro Minagawa, Japanese firm Nintendo&apos;s public relations manager, speaking to Reuters. The reference to specific areas of trade is significant for foreign companies, however, who are primed to begin doing business as soon as Chinese government officials have finished unpicking such complex bans and restrictions. Video games themselves are particularly symbolic, such is their significance as a commodity and a form of entertainment both in and outside China. The free trade of such games and consoles would mark a profound step toward China&apos;s globalisation both economically and culturally. \u2022 The Battle for the internet: US and China engage in cyber war games", "tags": ["Games", "China", "Technology", "Censorship", "Business", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-07T15:01:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/jan/10/haoliang-xu-activate-singapore-global-public-leader", "sentences": ["Prior to joining the UN, Xu was a computer-aided design engineer with Louis Berger International Inc in New Jersey and an assistant lecturer at Tongji University in Shanghai, China."], "title": "UN's Haoliang Xu joins global leadership debate at Guardian's Activate Singapore", "article": "January 2014 sees the Public Leaders Network continue its prestigious series of interviews with major figures from the world of global public services.

But Ghana is pressing ahead to build this $10bn (\u00a36.6bn) technology city outside the capital, Accra. Designed by OBR architects, the city will consist of six towers, including a 75-floor, 270m-tall (885ft) building, the highest in Africa, where 25,000 people will live and 50,000 will work. There have been teething problems, with the site moved to a larger one at Pampram. Residents at the original location, Dunkunaa, claim the project had incurred the displeasure of the gods when the developers refused to acknowledge the chiefs and elders of the area. That could be the least of Hope City&apos;s problems, warns Professor Vanessa Watson of the University of Cape Town. She has flagged up concern not just over the Pampram project, but over other &quot;urban fantasies&quot; involving large-scale reconfigurations of existing cities (such as Kigali in Rwanda, and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia) or the construction of satellite cities (such as Tatu, outside Nairobi in Kenya, and Kigamboni, outside Dar es Salaam in Tanzania). These new city plans are a relatively recent phenomenon, most dating from the past five or six years, with the private sector playing a dominant role in nearly all the projects. In the paper African urban fantasies: dreams or nightmares?, published by the International Institute for Environment and Development on Monday, Watson casts doubts over whether these grandiose urban projects, driven by local politicians and global investors who see Africa as the &quot;last frontier&quot;, will meet the real needs of most people. &quot;The bulk of the population in sub-Saharan African cities is extremely poor and living in informal settlements,&quot; she writes. &quot;Some of these settlements are on well-located urban land that is also attractive to property developers. Attempts to implement these fantasy plans within existing cities will (and is already) having major exclusionary effects on vulnerable low-income groups through evictions and relocations.&quot; She questions the premise on which these big projects are based: rapid urbanisation in Africa and the growth of a middle class on the continent. Watson cites studies arguing that claims of very rapid urbanisation may be overstated and rates may be higher in smaller towns. The Africa Development Bank defines the middle class as those spending $2-20 a day, and the upper middle class as spending $10-20 a day. &quot;It is difficult to imagine how households with such minimal spending power can afford the luxury apartments portrayed in the fantasy plans (as well as the vehicles needed to move around these new cities), and it may be that prospective property developers are seriously misreading the African market,&quot; she writes. As an example of an architectural white elephant, Watson cites the Chinese-built &quot;ghost towns&quot; outside the Angolan capital, Luanda \u2013 cities comprising of tower blocks of apartments selling at $150,000 to $200,000 each. Ambitious urban projects may have worked in Shanghai, China and Ho Chi Minh City, and cities such as Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore are clearly the models for the new African cities. But Watson doubts whether African governments have the capacity to pull them off. On a mundane level, she wonders how cities, invariably described as smart and sustainable and consisting of tower blocks reliant on lifts and air conditioning, can function in an environment where power cuts occur several times a day. &quot;Maybe they will be able to, but what nobody can tell me is what will happen to the people living in shack settlements in those cities,&quot; Watson says. Satellite cities are frequently justified on the basis that they are located on empty land. But it is rare, she argues, for larger cities to be empty, and if such land is not within an environmentally protected area, then it is likely to be actively farmed. &quot;In all kinds of eviction processes, landowners rarely hold land title, and full compensation for land, shelter and livelihoods is unlikely,&quot; she adds. The desire to construct fantasy cities is bound to divert scarce resources from meeting the basic services and housing needs of the much larger poor urban populations. &quot;What seems most likely is that the majority of urban populations will find themselves further disadvantaged and marginalised,&quot; writes Watson. &quot;It is access to land by the urban poor (as well as those on the urban periphery and beyond) that is most directly threatened by these processes, and access to land in turn determines to urban services, to livelihoods and citizenship.&quot;", "tags": ["Cities and development", "Global development", "Ghana", "Africa", "World news", "Urbanisation", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-13T15:17:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/15/simon-dyson-sanction-european-tour-golf", "sentences": ["So I just have to get on with it and carry on.&quot; Dyson insisted after the incident at Lake Malaren in Shanghai that he was not guilty of deliberate wrongdoing."], "title": "Simon Dyson back in action and out to be 'very careful from now on'", "article": "Simon Dyson has spoken for the first time at his relief over avoiding a serious European Tour sanction for breaching the rules.

From dried-up rivers to smog-filled cities, China is contending with the negative environmental effects of its super-fast industrialisation of recent decades.  As of January, air pollution in Beijing had soared to 40 times the level recommended by the World Health Organization, according to The Economist, and the country is expected to produce twice as many carbon emissions as the US by 2015. Some 40% of China&apos;s mammals are classified as threatened species. The country is also under severe water stress. At the same time, China&apos;s growing economy is ravenously hungry for resources, consuming between 40% and 50% of the world&apos;s coal, copper, steel, nickel, aluminium and zinc.  There are signs that the Chinese government and industry are looking into more restorative economic models to help solve these problems. One of these is the circular economy, which encourages manufacturers to design products and systems such that they can be returned and the materials recycled, reused or remanufactured. It is about being smarter on a number of fronts: \u2022 Increasing resource productivity by using raw material in longer and linked product lifecycle loops, enabling long-term growth and development \u2022 Managing water to make sure it&apos;s recycled during manufacturing, cleaned to a high standard and returned to the local sources \u2022 Making sure the materials used to make products contain the healthiest possible chemicals for humans and the environment and that they can be collected and safely recycled later \u2022 Designing out waste, a critical factor as the world economy continues to use up and waste a high proportion of its finite natural resources In their 2002 book, Cradle to Cradle, William McDonough and Michael Braungart framed the idea of designing products to have positive health, environmental and social benefits, and to end up not as waste, but as materials for new products. In their latest book, The Upcycle, they wrote:   &quot;Human beings don&apos;t have a pollution problem; they have a design problem. If humans were to devise products, tools, furniture, homes, factories, and cities more intelligently from the start, they wouldn&apos;t even need to think in terms of waste, contamination, or scarcity \u2026 Good design would allow for abundance, endless reuse, and pleasure.&quot;  Can China move fast enough? The biggest challenge may be reversing some of these environmental trends fast enough. Developing complex, circular economy systems takes time. However, the country already is seeing signs of rapid growth in the popularity of this concept.  For one thing, the China Association of Circular Economy \u2013 a group of government, research and business members working to promote the growth of the circular economy mainly through recycling \u2013 launched at the end of last year. The association claims that China&apos;s circular economy grew by 15% annually, on average, from 2006 to 2010, and projects it will almost double from 1tn yuan ($164.13bn) in 2010 to 1.8tn yuan ($295.42bn) in 2015.  As Peter Lacy, who leads Accenture&apos;s strategy and sustainability practice in the Asia Pacific, puts it:  &quot;With demand for resources in China growing more than twice as fast as the world average, we see disruptive innovation in circular approaches to production and consumption and the emergence of new business models. Our research shows that in the coming decade between 6m and 7m jobs will be created in the circular economy in China alone. And we are only just beginning.&quot;  Recycling One of the first things China has done is establish industrial parks to recycle waste, such as the Tianjin Ziya Circular Economy Industrial Park in south-west Jinghai County, near the Hebei province. Opened in 2006, the park houses 120 companies with a capacity to recycle 1m to 1.5m tons of waste, including electronics, vehicles, rubber and plastic. Every year, it can supply 400,000 tons of copper and 150,000 tons of aluminium, among other materials. Tianjin Ziya also has created an &quot;engineering island&quot;, which brings together energy savings and environmental protection by integrating sewage collection treatment, water reuse and rain collection. It is now reusing 100% of its water, without harming the desert environment.  Meanwhile, China has reportedly put up a &quot;green fence&quot; and has stopped accepting poorly sorted or dirty shipments of the waste materials from foreign exporters. Designing out waste Other Chinese companies have found innovative ways to fully utlize their raw materials. Shanghai-based steel company Baosteel, for example, has \u2013 through its subsidiary Baosteel Magnetic \u2013 found a way to make use of the metals, including rust (or, more properly, red (ferric) iron oxide and iron oxide scales) and zinc residue, that accumulate on magnetic materials. Products made from those metals are used in computers, green lighting, high-definition displays and automotive electronics fields, among other things. The company also has developed iron oxide material suitable for phosphate-acid-iron-lithium batteries. Meanwhile, the Shandong Tranlin Group, a pulp paper manufacturer, has developed a straw cleansing pulping technology that can process straw for use in its paper products and even &quot;upcycle&quot; residuals from the straw pulping process into organic fertiliser. Reducing toxicity Aside from recycling and designing out waste, another key aspect of the circular economy is the idea of promoting non-toxic materials. Cradle to Cradle certification, for example, requires specific processes to ensure the materials designed into products contain the best available chemicals, as assessed against a set of human health and environmental criteria. Goodbaby, a Chinese manufacturer of strollers, high chairs, cribs and children&apos;s car seats based near Shanghai, has been developing Cradle to Cradle products since 2010. Advised by the European consultancy EPEA and founded by Braungart, Goodbaby has a blueprint to get all its products C2C certified by 2020.  What&apos;s next? So, is the circular economy taking off in China? It&apos;s under discussion. The topic of scaling up the circular economy was on the agenda at the annual New Champions summit held in China by the World Economic Forum. In 2013, business leaders from foreign and local companies (including me), management consultants, environmentalists, researchers and politicians met in Dalian to discuss the circular economy. Discussions will continue in Davos this month.

Gisborne acknowledged: &quot;The superiority of the female mind is unrivalled.&quot; Unrivalled, that is, in duties that &quot;\u2026 refresh the over-laboured faculties of the wise \u2013 and, diffuse, throughout the family circle, the enlivening and endearing smile of cheerfulness.&quot; In her 2010 book, Delusions of Gender, psychologist Cordelia Fine points out we conform to whatever are the prevailing social expectations of what it means to &quot;man up&quot; or act as a &quot;real woman&quot;. In the 18th century, that meant many girls abided by notions of excessive femininity. But now? As the last several days have amply demonstrated, when male and female roles are under constant redefinition, dictated not least by the market and the need to earn a family wage, while a certain class of men, accustomed to generations in power, see both their influence and &quot;their&quot; institutions challenged, it can become a bruising and, at times, ugly, contradictory and profoundly socially unjust battle. But first, we have the good news. On Friday, the London Stock Exchange appointed two women directors, Sherry Coutu and Joanna Shields. The proportion of women on FTSE 100 boards has topped 20% for the first time, raising hopes that the UK government&apos;s weedy target of 25% of female representation by 2015 is reached without mandatory quotas. According to Jane Scott, the UK director of Professional Boards Forum, only 13 FTSE 100 companies have 30% or more female representation on the board. &quot;There is no shortage of candidates,&quot; Scott says. &quot;And there is no compromise on the experience or skills required.&quot; The economic argument has been repeatedly proved. In a 2012 report, for example, the Credit Suisse Research Institute said that organisations with one woman or more on the board outperformed those with none by 26% over a six-year period. In that context, shareholders should be appalled at the poor commercial judgment on display, if not the sexism. Change in the boardroom is under way but it is hardly a female revolution. Greater participation in public and political life is vital to such an endeavour. However, only one in four MPs is female; women are a tiny minority at the cabinet table and in the Lords, in senior financial committees, at the higher echelons of the judiciary and on public boards. Innovatory schemes such as the Fabian Women&apos;s network programme are essential to challenge the old boys&apos; alliances whose roots are centuries old. However, until a critical mass is achieved, women in parliament and public office will continue to feel guests in a predominantly hostile house. A battle that resumes tomorrow at Westminster  yet again reveals the size of the gulf between the Lords and the ladies. Or, more precisely, in this case, the 10 women who have alleged that the Liberal Democrat Lord Rennard behaved &quot;inappropriately&quot;. The women have been judged &quot;credible&quot; witnesses yet, surreally, the rules of the Liberal Democrat party do not permit disciplinary action. Rennard has refused Clegg&apos;s request to apologise. Undoubtedly, the electorate will take heed that in 2014 a major political party has no suitable procedure for dealing with serious sexual allegations. In contrast, the law courts are, belatedly, proving more active. Tomorrow, supported by more than 100 peers, Lord Rennard intends to resume his seat. As we report today, Bridget Harris, one of his accusers, has quit the party in disgust. &quot;Nick Clegg had a duty to show moral leadership. He hasn&apos;t&quot;, she says. &quot;I don&apos;t believe that parliament is the place for change anymore.&quot; It is precisely this lack of representation that means women, unjustly, have become the shock absorbers of austerity. They are paying a far higher price proportionately than men, finding themselves cemented into a lifetime of low earnings and under-utilised qualifications. George Osborne, has announced a further \u00a312bn in public spending cuts. As feminist economists on the Women&apos;s Budget Group repeatedly point out, 65% of jobs in the public sector are held by women; 310,000 public sector jobs will be axed in five years until 2015. Eighty per cent of the &quot;new&quot; jobs are in the private sector, according to the TUC. They are low skill, low paid. A far higher proportion of female income therefore also comes from benefits so, again, women are hit hardest by benefit cuts. Paradoxically, at school, girls outperform boys. However, they are scarce, for instance, in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). In 2012, 12 times more boys than girls took computer studies at A-level. In Shanghai and Singapore, there is no gender division in the subject. Here, segregation by occupation continues. Women are steered into the arts and &quot;care&quot;, grossly undervalued. Even when they enter the professions, progress halts when they have children. Part-time means a career is sabotaged. Childcare costs cripple. According to the Fawcett Society, twice as many women as men are economically inactive; three times more women are in part-time work; and 28% of women are low paid compared with 17% of men. Skills-appropriate jobs for women could boost GDP by 10% by 2030. Everyone benefits. Instead, currently for women, the ladders are rapidly disappearing as the snakes on the board multiply. A general election may help. In 2015, politicians will temporarily scramble to find their inner woman as they go in search of the crucial female vote. Manifestos should signal that investment in social infrastructure matters. Universal free childcare ought to carry as much clout as rail expansion and HS2. Women need flexible working that strongly supports part-time careers. Reskilling is a priority; child benefit should be restored and anomalies in tax credits addressed. More than 900,000 working families will not qualify because one or both parents earn too little to pay income tax. Among other demands should be added equal pay and positive action in public life, quotas even. What this agenda costs in the short term will be more than matched by what is unleashed in talent and capabilities, improved tax revenues and reduced benefits. Ideally, a flourishing society allows everyone, male and female, to fulfil their potential. Instead, gender, class and ethnicity all carry heavy and unnecessary penalties. That is socially unjust, economically unsound, globally uncompetitive and politically naive.

The UK is,\u00a0for example,\u00a0a world leader in offshore wind \u2013 a technology with the potential to\u00a0create thousands of jobs at home\u00a0and reduce emissions around the world. In Spain, where wind is now the dominant power source,\u00a0emissions fell by nearly a quarter in one year. As costs fall the\u00a0International Energy Agency forecasts\u00a0that offshore wind alone could provide 18% of the world\u2019s energy, displacing coal to power major coastal cities \u2013\u00a0such as Shanghai\u00a0\u2013 across the planet. And our own\u00a0prime minister likes to boast\u00a0that\u00a0with\u00a0offshore wind the UK is leading the world\u2019s clean technology race. Yet, as he speaks, his\u00a0government, and\u00a0some of the biggest energy firms, are working to undermine the policies which have brought\u00a0this success. Ministers are arguing Britain should not sign up to any more renewable targets beyond those Tony Blair signed us up to, which expire in 2020. There is one likely result. Once again we would have pioneered a set of industries, from wind to tidal and wave, only to give up and\u00a0let others reap the rewards of our investment. Since 2008 global deployment of renewable technologies \u2013 led by Europe \u2013 has\u00a0seen solar panel costs fall by 80% and wind turbine costs fall by 29%. And we\u2019re just starting to push the boundaries. Solar panels\u00a0are becoming ever more efficient, offshore wind turbines\u00a0can now float\u00a0which will make deployment in the\u00a0North and Irish sea cheaper. Dong, the biggest offshore wind developer,\u00a0say costs will fall below fossil fuels by the 2020s. Not every energy firm objects to renewables \u2013 just the ones that sell fossil fuels. Analysis by Bloomberg suggests that across the world renewable projects are already out-competing dirty energy, and that\u2019s\u00a0before communities, and whole cities from\u00a0Hamburg\u00a0to\u00a0Bristol,\u00a0get in on the act for themselves. Few policies have\u00a0delivered results\u00a0as effectively as support for renewable energy, and the hard, expensive work, will be done by 2020.\u00a0Why not reap the rewards that we have already paid for? On a European level, abandoning\u00a0renewable energy targets means relying only on the broken European Emissions Trading System (ETS) to meet our climate obligations. This would mean gambling\u00a0our future on a market that has utterly failed. The price of credits is now so low it is\u00a0cheaper to burn Lignite, the dirtiest fossil fuel you can find,\u00a0than relatively expensive gas. Even if it could be fixed \u2013 and we hope it is \u2013 just putting a price on carbon pollution doesn\u2019t get clean energy built. Investments cost billions and last for decades \u2013 nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen to the carbon market next year\u00a0let alone in decades to come. So governments will still have to support clean energy, and that means renewables. The UK\u2019s independent climate advisors say that even if technologies like carbon capture and storage and nuclear deliver at massive scale (which we doubt)\u00a0the UK\u2019s offshore wind capacity will still need to double again after 2020. Yet\u00a0if\u00a0there is no\u00a0support, no targets for renewable energy \u2013 just a vague promise\u00a0to decarbonise our power sector \u2013 it won&apos;t happen. The lack of a post-2020\u00a0strategy is already showing what will happen. At one point global\u00a0giants Mitsubishi, Siemens and General Electric\u00a0were all planning factories here \u2013 none have yet arrived. The wider UK supply chain is also being hit as companies\u00a0scale back their ambitions\u00a0in the light of future uncertainty. David Cameron once championed the international\u00a0\u201cNorstec\u201d offshore wind scheme to\u00a0\u201charness the clean energy of the northern seas\u201d. The plan was to generate thousands of jobs with UK firms helping to build offshore wind farms across the North Sea in Dutch, German and British waters. Without an EU\u00a0renewable energy\u00a0target the project won\u2019t happen. Without a European renewables target simply toughening up our commitment to decarbonise \u2013 as the Labour party suggests \u2013 won\u2019t really help\u00a0either. Disjointed national action\u00a0can\u2019t hope to draw the\u00a0benefits\u00a0of scale\u00a0which have brought us to the cusp of\u00a0a\u00a0future without costly fossil fuels. Costs will be higher, and the EU\u2019s own\u00a0impact assessment warns,\u00a0jobs will go elsewhere\u00a0without European co-ordination. That\u2019s why 8 European ministers wrote to the\u00a0EU\u00a0commission\u00a0calling for \u201crobust\u201d targets on renewables to continue. Only if we know how much power we will generate, and where, can we build the interconnectors and electric car charging systems\u00a0which will bring down the cost of clean energy across the continent. Of course, we need\u00a0more than just a renewables target.\u00a0Support must be focused at the technologies with potential for further cost reductions \u2013 like offshore wind, wave and tidal and the long-term costs must be shared fairly, not burdened onto the consumers of today. Above all consumers, communities and cities need to be freed to invest in renewable energy \u2013 returning the benefits to households and cutting bills. It\u2019s easy\u00a0to\u00a0see\u00a0why\u00a0the likes of\u00a0Shell and British Gas want to stop renewable energy from becoming cheaper, and available to all \u2013 they make money by selling gas.

This is the ad hoc defence upon which the West Bromwich Albion striker has fallen back thus far, insisting that the gesture invented by the antisemitic French funnyman Dieudonn\u00e9 M&apos;bala M&apos;bala, in the course of one of his comedic outings, is &quot;anti\u2011system&quot;. When retroactively found to have posed with Dieudonn\u00e9 for his own quenelle snap \u2013 are we calling them quelfies yet? \u2013 the Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri also claimed the gesture &quot;symbolises being against the system&quot;. Well of course it does. And what terror it must strike into the heart of The Man, against whom an as-yet-unquantified number of footballers are clearly engaged in a heroic struggle, even as they trouser tens of thousands of pounds a week from a cavalcade of democracy-averse sheikhs and influence-buying hyper-capitalists, go on holiday in various slave-built emirates, and drive \u00a3200,000 revolutionmobiles where monogrammed leather upholstery comes as standard. It seems slightly mean to break it to them, but there are those who might judge that bloodline between themselves and Che Guevara has become slightly corrupted. Having said all that, we might discover that Anelka lives a secret double life as a radical, system-crushing activist. Perhaps he works undercover for WikiLeaks. Perhaps he was one of the denizens of the Occupy encampment that sprang up outside St Paul&apos;s Cathedral in 2011, and would nick off there between Chelsea training sessions to explain to like-minded souls that all property is theft and so on. He didn&apos;t stay the full distance of the occupation, of course \u2013 the radical offer to earn \u20ac12m a year for Shanghai Shenhua seems to have been ideological temptation too much. Or something, It is the sort of ideological puzzle worthy of Anelka&apos;s friend, Dieudonn\u00e9, who seems almost intriguingly blind to his own contradictions. The jokey belittling of the Holocaust, the flattering asides about the gas ovens \u2026 maybe he&apos;s one of those brilliantly bright graduates of the Bernie Ecclestone School of F\u00fchrer Studies, whose primary lessons seem to be that the guy was a bit of an arse but got things done (Hitler, as opposed to Bernie, though Ecclestone might be flattered to know there are many who would apply the same mildly exasperated praise to himself). Fellow alumni include the fashion designer John Galliano, who was convicted and fined for antisemitism in France. &quot;I love Hitler. People like you \u2026 would all be gassed,&quot; he declared to some fellow cafe customers in 2011 \u2013 apparently unaware that were a fellow such as himself to be teleported back to 1942, he would not find himself designing uniforms for the Third Reich. Which isn&apos;t to say he wouldn&apos;t have found his skin used in the design of something or other \u2013 but as a gay man he would have had considerably less state-conferred innate superiority over Jews than he seemed to imagine. And so with the mixed race Dieudonn\u00e9, whose Cameroonian father would likely not have guaranteed the comedian a top-table place at the Wannsee conference. In fact, as an always-refreshing flick through Mein Kampf would remind him, Hitler thought the mere existence of mixed race people such as Dieudonn\u00e9 was a co-conspiracy between the increasingly &quot;negrified&quot; French and the Jews to &quot;bastardis[e]&quot; Europe. You sense it would have taken rather more than thinly disguised sucking up over his gas chambers policy to have softened his heart on that one. Still, plenty for Anelka to get defensive about come his defence, and we must look forward to enlightenment at his earliest convenience. The writing&apos;s on the wall As for other delights to come our way the second the FA announces the length of Anelka&apos;s ban, they seem likely to include a series of contrarian think pieces explaining that the episode has been another middle-class nail in the coffin for the working man&apos;s ballet. Are you familiar with this unintentionally hilarious genre of diatribe? I must confess a terrible weakness for examples \u2013 typically penned by chaps whose stagy defence of literally any old bigotry they hear (or more likely read about) in a football ground seems born of some desperate, misplaced and transparently doomed need to belong among a tribe they pantingly mythologise, but who would probably lamp them if they ran into them in a pub. The way these reactionary scribes appear to see it, any attempt \u2013 ever \u2013 to change what is considered acceptable in a football stadium is an assault on the very quintessence of football itself. Consequently, it must be resisted. Antisemitic gestures should be allowed to sneak in; black players should just suck up the monkey chants and stop getting in the way of some website writer&apos;s quest to be accepted by people who \u2013 and again, it seems almost mean to break the news \u2013 will actually never think the ultra-polemicist is &quot;one of them&quot;, certainly not as long as they continue twatting about with phrases such as &quot;the political hermeneutics of a gesture&quot; and &quot;the cynical conspiracy theory-laden Weltanschauung of the contemporary left&quot;. These writers aren&apos;t the last, salt-of-the-earth defenders of the working man&apos;s game.

With Eurostar, London&apos;s St Pancras and the Gare du Nord are just over two hours apart. Ask a Chinese tourist and an American student touring Europe. Ask the numerous professionals who commute several times a week, if not every day. Ask an international investor or an entrepreneur looking for opportunities. Ask our youth who jump on the train to party across the Channel. People are increasingly linked and mobile. This narrows the distance between us. To use the term coined by sociologist Saskia Sassen, London and Paris are &quot;global cities&quot; or &quot;villes-monde&quot;. As such, they have links that go across national borders. These connections are the very source of our common strength. In a globalised world, the winners will be those who build networks. To be successful, let us avoid unnecessary parochialism. While drafting my programme for Paris 2020, I was inspired by the visions of other great cities \u2013 including London, New York, Singapore, Sydney and Vancouver. One striking feature of their visions is that many of the challenges, objectives and strategies are similar, if not identical. Some issues are localised, but we are all dealing with sustainable development, efficient transport systems, energy savings, innovation ecosystems, food supply, resilience ... All those long-term visions are based on pillars for which co-operation is vital. This is not to deny that our market economies are defined by competition \u2013 the City of London is a major financial centre competing with Paris&apos;s \u2013 but the future of our urban systems lies in the collaboration needed to adapt to the 21st century&apos;s challenges. As a parallel, think about the intensity of the entrepreneurial spirit within science parks and business incubators: the attitudes are competitive \u2013 becoming the best, the first, the fastest is a driver for excellence. However, it does not prevent people from collaborating on many issues. Partnership is actually the raison d&apos;\u00eatre of those structures and spaces. I look forward to the same degree of cross-fertilisation between our cities. We need to exchange ideas and best practices better, benchmark our results to see what works in all our majors concerns, from security to housing, through culture and tourism. The attractiveness of our cities ought to be a common goal, beyond slogans. In the competition of an increasingly connected world, the size and diversity of skills and resources will matter.

History teacher Harry Fletcher-Wood explores this question in fascinating detail on his blog Improving Teaching. He draws lessons from the book Better by surgeon Atul Gawande, who writes about how he and his profession can improve their performance. Harry investigates three key themes that run through the text, which he believes offer a model of practice for teachers as much as they do for doctors. The first theme is remorseless self-investigation. He writes: &quot;Only ruthless introspection can reveal the limitations of our own practice, values and beliefs, and the effects they have on our work.&quot; Actions based on ethics and constant improvement are the two other themes he delves into. Harry ends the post on Gawande&apos;s afterword, which offers a list of actions he believes can support people to become &quot;positive deviants&quot;. They include: ask unscripted questions, don&apos;t complain, write something and change. You can read the full post on Harry&apos;s blog Improving Teaching. Tough Young Teachers and Teach First Tough Young Teachers, a new series on the BBC that follows the progress of a group of Teach First recruits, has been causing a stir on Twitter since it was first aired. Professor John Howson has written a really nice piece on one of the recent episodes. As well as questioning how he would have fared teaching in the schools featured, he hones in on some of the issues surrounding Teach First. One of his concerns is that it&apos;s not clear how Teach First ensures people placed in 11 to 16 schools are exposed to post-16 teaching. He&apos;s worried that this lack of sixth-form experience could restrict the range of schools willing to employ people once they&apos;ve finished the programme. Another risk he highlights is that the scheme doesn&apos;t give trainees the chance to have a fresh start at tackling behavioural problems in a new school. Instead, he says the episode suggests that Teacher first recruits have to battle through or be sacked. You can read his full post on his blog John Howson. Homework matters One of the most interesting pieces I stumbled upon this week was on how homework makes a massive difference to the learning process by headteacher Tom Sherrington. He says that the students who are successful at A-level and at GCSE are those with highly developed independent learning skills and argues that a strong school culture of homework is crucial to developing this. Not everyone agrees with him, however. He lists the objections teachers often put forward, from &quot;there&apos;s no point of setting homework for the sake of it&quot; to &quot;children need to have a childhood, why rob them of their evenings?&quot;. Deftly, he dismisses them one by one. He then talks about six reasons why he believes homework matters so much. Top of his is list is bridging the gap between teacher-led and student-led learning.

This year, they&apos;re going after fireworks. Lighting fireworks to bring in the lunar New Year holiday, which begins this year on 31 January, is an old Chinese tradition, long thought to ward off evil spirits and bring good luck. But this year, China&apos;s state media have cast the practice as an environmental faux pas, a sky-blackening indulgence. The state newswire Xinhua, citing an official organisation, urged families to use &quot;flowers and electronic substitutes&quot; instead. Last year, wide swaths of China logged their worst air pollution in decades. Cities across the country have taken emergency measures to combat the smog, such as grounding flights and shutting schools. Beijing spent more than half of the year shrouded in a pea-soup haze. Municipal governments have played their part in the anti-fireworks campaign. Beijing recently introduced a regulation requiring people who buy five or more boxes of fireworks to register with an official ID; the city will halt fireworks sales entirely if the pollution rises to dangerous levels. Shanghai cut the city&apos;s number of authorised firework sellers by 400. The government of Hangzhou, a historic city near Shanghai, has cancelled its annual New Year fireworks display, a decade-long tradition.     Chinese citizens wear masks in Beijing on another foggy day in January 2014. Critics of the government campaign blame unregulated industry and transport for the pollution.

Beijing has promised to allocate \u00a375.8bn towards the goal, tightening restrictions on coal burning and vehicle emissions. Fireworks do have an effect on air quality, albeit a temporary one \u2013 according to the state-run Global Times newspaper, pollution levels in Shanghai quintupled after the fireworks extravaganza marking the early hours of last year&apos;s celebrations. Yet the anti-firework measures have proved controversial \u2013 many users on Sina Weibo, the country&apos;s most popular microblog, called it an attempt by authorities to shirk their environmental responsibility, akin to previous official claims that the smog was caused by street-side barbecues and stir-fry cooking. &quot;You leave so many factories unregulated, and then you take it out on a national holiday?&quot; wrote one user. &quot;How many fireworks would it take to create as much as one takeoff in a private jet?&quot; asked another.

Should we be concerned? | Steven Hill", "article": "Leaked documents this week revealed what many already knew: Chinese investors are storing their money \u2013 and investing \u2013 more and more overseas. China&apos;s rich and powerful seem to prefer the British Virgin Islands for their offshore transactions, but the US and Europe remain top destinations for their actual investments. The question is: should we be concerned? Polls show that a majority of Americans believe China poses the greatest threat to the US economy, and a third aren&apos;t comfortable with any investment by Chinese firms into US companies. In the past, the US government has killed Chinese investments in American companies, such as an infamous deal where China&apos;s state-owned CNOOC tried to buy petroleum company Unocal corp for $18.5bn in 2005. On the one hand, people look at the high-profile investments that China is making in the west, especially US real estate, and they question whether such iconic places should be in a communist country&apos;s hands. In the Big Apple, Beijing real-estate tycoon Zhang Xin led an investment group&apos;s $1.4bn purchase of the General Motors office tower last year, a 50-story monster that reportedly is the most expensive building in the US. Another headliner was Fosun International Ltd&apos;s purchase of the landmark building One Chase Manhattan Plaza for $725mn from JP Morgan Chase. Anticipating a surge in Chinese commercial activity, Fosun billionaire co-founder Guo Guangchang projects that eventually his company will fill as much as one-third of the building with Chinese companies. No doubt they will be assisted by the China Center (CCNY), a pro-business headquarters for Chinese investors and companies seeking to gain a foothold in the US. CCNY will be one of the biggest tenants in the new One World Trade Center (the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack), taking up six floors and 190,000 square feet of office space. This kind of investment is good for New York City, and a sign of Chinese investors&apos; confidence in the Big Apple during a time of economic uncertainty.  But money from China isn&apos;t just flowing into big time projects in Manhattan. It&apos;s also going to unlikely places, such as bankrupted Detroit, where financing is badly needed. Motown has become the fourth most popular US destination for Chinese real estate investors (behind New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia). With thousands of homes foreclosed, some two-storey homes have been auctioned off for as little as $39. This attracted attention in China, with state broadcaster China Central Television reporting that houses in Detroit cost the same as &quot;a pair of leather shoes&quot;. Chinese investors have made bulk purchases of dozens of cheap homes in the urban rings surrounding the city center, many of them bought without even having been seen. Then Dongdu International Group of Shanghai bought two downtown icons: the Detroit Free Press building for $9.4mn and the David Stott building for $4.2mn. Yes, Chinese investors have purchased the former headquarters of the free press in Motor Town. Most of these investments should be welcome, not only in the US but also in Europe. Indeed, Europe has attracted twice as much Chinese investment as the US, as investors have seized commercial opportunities arising from the eurozone crisis. The Chinese have been providing fresh capital when western investors are tapped out or weary of troubled places like Detroit or Greece. This is a sign of China&apos;s further integration into the global market, and should be welcomed, not feared. The more the Chinese invest abroad, the more they have reason to want to partner with western countries and see them succeed. But it goes beyond that. Americans need to understand what&apos;s driving Chinese investors. Many have begun looking abroad because of tight policy measures by China&apos;s communist government aimed at cooling off the country&apos;s overheated real estate market.  Some experts also believe that the parking of wealth offshore may indicate\u00a0an increase in capital flight from China. A study conducted by Bank of China and Hurun found that more than half of China&apos;s millionaires have taken steps to emigrate or are considering doing so. Chinese individuals already have stashed offshore anywhere from $450bn to $658bn in assets, with Boston Consulting predicting that amount will double in three years. CNBC recently called the movement of Chinese capital &quot;one of the largest and most rapid wealth migrations of our time&quot;. That&apos;s not a strong sign of Chinese investors&apos; confidence in their own country.  On the other hand, the Chinese have\u00a0only 13% of their wealth outside China, while the global average is 20% to 30%, according to Oliver Williams of WealthInsight. In a developing society like China, it&apos;s normal for the wealthy to geographically diversify their investment portfolios and send more of their wealth abroad. While there&apos;s something ironic about investors from the land of &quot;communism-capitalism&quot; exploiting the west&apos;s economic vulnerabilities to snatch up valuable properties, that&apos;s how capitalism&apos;s &quot;creative destruction&quot; is supposed to work. Adam Smith would be pleased.  Unfortunately, the Chinese seem to want to play both sides of the coin. The Chinese government doesn&apos;t allow foreign investors to acquire properties of significance, whether real estate or companies. Other investment restrictions and requirements are applied to foreign enterprises in China, such as usually requiring foreign companies to enter into joint venture agreements with local Chinese partners. While some consideration should be given to the fact that China is still a developing nation, in general East-West relations should live by the Investor&apos;s Golden Rule: &quot;Invest in others as you would have them invest in you.&quot; This principle should be enshrined in trade agreements, and be part of the findings whenever US or European regulators consider whether to approve Chinese investments.  The world should welcome China&apos;s further integration into the global market, since the more Chinese and western economies are integrated, the more it will build political bridges and diffuse tension. But the rules have to be fair and equal, and right now, they&apos;re not. China should be nudged to further open its economy.

He is discreet about individuals, but scornful about large swaths of the industry he\u00a0works for and the absurdities it indulges in, among them the Oscars. &quot;Hollywood, basically \u2013 what&apos;s the polite word for shitting? Defecates hundreds of millions of dollars, all so\u00a0that everyone can chase after the little blue ribbon. The economics are\u00a0insane. If you do the math, very few films get what&apos;s known as the Oscar bump.&quot;     Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in Lost in Translation, produced by James Schamus.  Photograph: Focus/Sportsphoto/Allstar    Doing the math is what he likes to do. Schamus sees himself primarily as a &quot;marketing guy&quot;, a casual term for the kind of string theory you need to\u00a0read and play the world movie markets. Focus succeeded, he says, thanks to micro-marketing. The key\u00a0to\u00a0making money is in niche demographics \u2013 and, in this context, niche can mean whole continents outside America. &quot;You can take the data and throw up a map of the world and see where, for example, family movies are big: northern Europe. Action movies: Middle East, zones in\u00a0Asia. Sci-fi/fantasy: Russia.&quot; Another bonus, over the years, has been his disposition. &quot;I&apos;m an eternal pessimist,&quot; says Schamus, &quot;which is why I stayed in business, I think. Only\u00a0two, three or four movies a year will make a $20m profit. So, you&apos;d better plan on getting your ass kicked pretty regularly. Because if you plan on\u00a0success every time, you&apos;re out of\u00a0business.&quot; His collaboration with Ang Lee has resulted in 11 films, from The Ice Storm, which Schamus adapted for the screen from Rick Moody&apos;s novel, to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Brokeback Mountain (the most successful Focus\u00a0film of all time) and the period Shanghai spy movie, Lust, Caution, which has been the subject of\u00a0more scrutiny in China than almost any film ever made. It is Schamus&apos;s favourite of Lee&apos;s films, &quot; the most rigorous and uncompromising,&quot; he says, &quot;and it was perversely fun to see how it played out culturally in different territories. Here, the New York Times was like, &apos;Oh, it starts with a really boring mah jong scene.&apos;&quot; That opening scene, in which the heroine is shown playing mah jong, has, in China, been parsed for hidden purpose with the kind of zeal a western audience will bring to David Lynch. &quot;The continuity person almost needed to be hospitalised \u2013 2,000 continuity photos, because every single tile tells a\u00a0story. The entire game\u00a0had been plotted out, and we covered it from six\u00a0or seven angles. What plays out in that six minutes is an epic, literary, philosophical, political, sexual narrative \u2013 a mind-boggling storm of\u00a0thought.&quot; The biggest mystery, perhaps, is\u00a0how Schamus, who grew up in southern California, was able to write the script of a movie like Lust, Caution, a Mandarin-language film (his script was translated from the English) depicting a culture which he can only approach from the outside. As he says, drily, &quot;What do I know from mah jong?&quot; It&apos;s a\u00a0question of trust and compatibility. &quot;Working with Ang \u2013 I\u00a0would say it&apos;s like Donald Rumsfeld&apos;s &apos;unknown unknown&apos;. I have to live knowing that I\u00a0don&apos;t know what I don&apos;t know, but somehow make that function. I don&apos;t pretend to be the expert, but I&apos;m feeding into a mental and emotional machinery that is able to mobilise and use that stuff.&quot;     Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in Brokeback Mountain.  Photograph: Focus/Sportsphoto/Allstar    In 2003, he produced the movie Hulk, which Lee directed, a perfect example of Schamus&apos;s credo: that you don&apos;t get anywhere in the film business by being too precious. It amuses Schamus to watch even the loftiest film critics being forced to engage with\u00a0&quot;Giganto-Turd III, made by the most despicable, cretinous, money-grubbing, horrible dimwits&quot;. And afterwards having to admit that they have been entertained by whatever summer blockbuster it is that they&apos;ve\u00a0seen. Two years ago, in partnership with Universal, Focus bought 50 Shades of Grey, a literary phenomenon that fascinates Schamus. &quot;The discourse around the book was: &apos;I couldn&apos;t put it down, it was terribly written.&apos; Nobody says that about Dean Koontz. In general, the trope is gendered. If it is badly written, boring, and repetitive, it is at least in good historical company. Samuel Richardson was basically writing 50 Shades of Grey. At the end of\u00a0Pamela, she actually marries the guy\u00a0who&apos;s been trying to rape her the whole book. And the discourse around that book was: &apos;These are perverse sexual fantasies for idle women.&apos; Not\u00a0even well written.&quot; Schamus has a Phd in English Literature and spent his entire 20s in full-time education at Berkeley. He opted to write a dissertation on the Danish film-maker Carl Theodor Dreyer, and left California for New York in order to work on it, where he also started writing screenplays. To his astonishment, there was some buzz around his early efforts, and he was invited back to California for studio meetings, all of which were cancelled \u2013 along with his nascent career \u2013 by a writers&apos; strike. Looking back, he says, that was probably a good thing. He might never have gone into producing, and the boy-wonder screenwriter wouldn&apos;t have been a good life for him. Why? Because he might have turned into Joe Eszterhas? &quot;There is that concern. Because I\u00a0gain weight very easily.&quot; He recalls,\u00a0with a shudder, a Vanity Fair\u00a0Hollywood issue devoted to screenwriters. &quot;It was so traumatising, that photograph. It was someone&apos;s Beverly Hills backyard and it&apos;s 25 guys, all with my build, but slightly more degenerated. Flannel shirts, jeans. They&apos;re all in the most macho poses, thumbs hooked in their belts. They all\u00a0make, by my standards, fabulous amounts of money. And they all looked completely pissed off. They&apos;re neurotic and miserable. The job is ego-crushing. It&apos;s a gigantic ass-kick to the soul.&quot; He pauses. &quot;That said, I love the challenge of Hollywood screenwriting. Love it. Give me a rewrite job on a popcorn movie \u2013 I\u00a0love that stuff.&quot;", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Oscars", "Oscars 2014", "Film industry", "Ang Lee"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-28T18:54:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/29/regional-chinese-food-britain-sichuan-hunan", "sentences": ["More recent Chinese arrivals to the UK, who include not only students but also businesspeople and tourists, are just as likely to come from Fujian, Shanghai or Liaoning as the Cantonese south of China, which means that Chinese restaurateurs no longer need to adapt their tastes to an old stereotype of Anglo-Cantonese food.", "Shanghainese food has traditionally been hard to find in Britain, although the city lies in one of China&apos;s richest gastronomic regions.", "For a glimpse of Shanghainese cuisine, seek out the elegant dishes created by Shanghainese consultant chef Zhang Chichang at the Bright Courtyard Club in Baker Street, or the modest, homestyle stir-fries such as green soya beans with pork and pickled greens at Red Sun in New Quebec Street."], "title": "Forget crispy duck: regional Chinese food is taking over Britain", "article": "Kai Wang and her friends like to sniff out the latest regional Chinese restaurants: a tiny cafe in east London specialising in food from China&apos;s north-east, or one near London Bridge serving numbing and hot crayfish. Kai, 26, is a media professional who came to the UK from Beijing in 2008, first to study and then to work. &quot;When I arrived in London I thought I was really going to miss Beijing food. I love traditional Beijing cuisine, but also the spicy regional cuisines that have become popular in recent years: Sichuan, Hunan and Hubei. When I came to the UK, the Chinese food here all seemed to be so sweet and westernised, with a focus on the Cantonese style, which is too light and delicate for Beijing tastes. But more and more authentic Chinese regional restaurants have opened in the past few years, not just in Chinatown but all over the city.&quot; It is people like Kai who have been one of the driving forces in a revolution in Chinese cooking in London and Manchester, and increasingly all over the UK. Unlike the older generation of Cantonese immigrants who arrived decades ago, bringing with them Hong Kong flavours adapted to western tastes, Kai and her contemporaries want to eat bolder, spicier food, and the trendy dishes that remind them of home. &quot;So many westerners order dishes such as sweet-and-sour pork, char siu buns and stir-fried rice noodles with beef, which I really don&apos;t like,&quot; she says. In the mid-1990s, a restaurant called Baguo Buyi opened in the Sichuanese capital, Chengdu, giving a glamorous new spin to Sichuan folk cooking and setting off a nationwide craze for Sichuanese flavours that is only now beginning to cool. Since then, Hunanese food and the hearty cooking of the north-eastern or Dongbei region have also enjoyed their time in the limelight of Chinese culinary fashion. More recent Chinese arrivals to the UK, who include not only students but also businesspeople and tourists, are just as likely to come from Fujian, Shanghai or Liaoning as the Cantonese south of China, which means that Chinese restaurateurs no longer need to adapt their tastes to an old stereotype of Anglo-Cantonese food.     Stir-fried preserved pork with dried radish at Local Friends. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Many establishments, including Liao Wei Feng in Bethnal Green and Local Friends in Golders Green, have menus divided into two sections. They have one list of the usual Anglo-Canto suspects, including lemon chicken and crispy duck, and another offering some of the most authentic Hunanese food available in the capital, with dishes such as &quot;stir-fried fragrant and hot fish&quot; and &quot;steamed belly pork, Chairman Mao-style&quot;. North-eastern and Hunanese cuisines are not the only ones making gradual inroads into British restaurant culture. Large numbers of Fujianese immigrants have joined the catering trade, although they are often inconspicuous in the kitchens of Cantonese restaurants. Fujian province lies on the south-eastern Chinese coast, and is known for its delicate soups, appetising street snacks and gentle way with oysters and other seafood. A handful of Fujianese cafes have come and gone in London: only one remains, Fuzhou in Gerrard Street, which is the place to go for gorgeous fishballs stuffed with minced pork and cabbage-and-clam soup with slippery rice pasta. Shanghainese food has traditionally been hard to find in Britain, although the city lies in one of China&apos;s richest gastronomic regions. The city itself is best known for the xiao long bao &quot;soup dumpling&quot; and for its sweet, soy-dark braises, but the wider region is the source of exquisite river delicacies such as crab, eel and shrimp, and famous dishes including beggar&apos;s chicken and dongpo pork. For a glimpse of Shanghainese cuisine, seek out the elegant dishes created by Shanghainese consultant chef Zhang Chichang at the Bright Courtyard Club in Baker Street, or the modest, homestyle stir-fries such as green soya beans with pork and pickled greens at Red Sun in New Quebec Street.     Stinking tofu at Local Friends. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Sichuan and Hunan are China&apos;s best-known spice regions, but chillies are also adored in Guizhou province. Maotai Kitchen in Soho, named after the famous local liquor, offers Guizhou food. The jovial chef, Zhu Shixiu, grew up in the beautiful hills near the Guizhou-Hunan border, and, after years working in Cantonese restaurants, has been given free rein with the menu. His wife makes the &quot;villagers&apos; pickled Chinese cabbage&quot;, a delicious salad laced with coriander, fermented black beans and chilli. Many of his rustic dishes share the sour-hot characteristic of Hunan cooking, but the intriguing lemongrass note in some of them comes from litsea oil (mu jiang you), a Chinese medicine used as a condiment in Guizhou and a few other regions. Maotai Kitchen is part of the same group as Leong&apos;s Legends, which serves Taiwanese specialities. While there has been a flowering of regional cuisines in London, only Sichuanese cuisine has really broken out of the capital and begun its long march all over the country \u2013 a sign, perhaps, of its decade-long status as China&apos;s trendiest style of cooking. Red N Hot has branches in Manchester and Birmingham, while Red Chilli has expanded from its original Manchester HQ into Leeds and York: the spicy menu charmingly promises to look after &quot;your pocket, stomach and soul&quot;. And in Oxford, My Sichuan has taken over the old school house at Gloucester Green, where chef Zhou Jun from Chengdu presides over a kitchen offering all the classic Sichuanese specialities. As China&apos;s changing culinary fashions continue to cause ripples in the restaurant scene in London, the range of regional flavours is only likely to increase and spread across the country. In the meantime, Sichuanese cuisine has already radically changed the face of Chinese food in many parts of Britain. No one, it seems, need go for long without dry-fried beans or a bowlful of sliced sea bass in a sea of sizzling chilli oil.", "tags": ["Chinese food and drink", "Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-29T12:22:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jan/29/unesco-education-report-teacher-quality", "sentences": ["Unsurprisingly, with such attitudes towards teachers, Shanghai topped the 2012 Pisa rankings."], "title": "Teachers' pay must be at the heart of global education reform", "article": "Progress in global education \u2013 especially in the poorest regions of the world \u2013 remains painfully slow. The latest Unesco Education for All global monitoring report, published Wednesday, underlines how far we still are from guaranteeing a good quality education for every child. While many pupils are now attending school, the quality of the education is often so poor that they are failing to learn the most elementary skills. Around 175 million young people in poor countries \u2013 equivalent to one quarter of the youth population \u2013 cannot read all or part of a sentence. The situation for girls is particularly dire. If current trends continue, it will take until 2072 for all the poorest young women in developing countries to become literate. In other words, it will only be the grandchildren of today&apos;s pupils in sub-Saharan Africa that can expect to learn the skills that the developed world takes for granted. Though the subject of improving education in the region could keep conference organisers in business for years, the overwhelming problem outlined in the report is simple: the availability of teachers and the quality of teaching. Over the last few years, there has been much excitable talk about Africa being on the cusp of an economic renaissance. But this will amount to another lost opportunity if the number of teachers is not increased to cope with the continent&apos;s exploding young population. Worldwide, 8.2 million new teachers need to be recruited by 2015 (pdf). If they are not, then Sub-Saharan Africa will be the worst affected region. The quality of teachers is equally important. In a third of countries analysed by the report, less than three-quarters of primary school teachers are trained to national standards. In West Africa, where the teaching of basic skills is particularly poor, over half the teachers have little formal training and are on low-paid temporary contracts. Poor pay results in many teachers earning supplementary income through second jobs, or running family businesses, when they should be in the classroom. This culture has been allowed to develop because there is little accountability: independent observers do not regularly inspect schools, and teachers do not have to prove their competence in the classroom after they have been hired. There is, of course, no simple solution to this litany of problems. But the Education for All report is right that developing countries must attract the best candidates into teaching and incentivise them to stay. When governments have to choose whether to spend education budgets on new facilities or the salaries of teachers, there&apos;s a good argument that spending on attracting teachers will yield the most tangible results. Peter Dolton from LSE has proven that there&apos;s a clear link between the level of teachers pay and the quality of a country&apos;s educational outcomes. Those countries that are in the upper-reaches of the Pisa rankings \u2013 South Korea, Finland, Singapore \u2013 all make an effort to recruit the best graduates and often demand that entrants to the profession have a second degree. With many competing demands on fragile states \u2013 to build roads, provide healthcare and provide a welfare safety net \u2013 it&apos;s unrealistic to expect that governments can provide the additional education provision required by Africa&apos;s youth bulge alone. If managed well, partnerships with the private sector can bring in the investment to build schools quickly and import international expertise. For instance, entrepreneur James Tooley has pioneered school places in Ghana for 65 cents per day \u2013 including a school uniform, a hot lunch and work books \u2013 which is within reach of regular families. Most importantly, we must raise the status of teaching. This isn&apos;t just a problem in developing countries. In a survey in 21 different countries on which profession the public thought was comparable with teaching, it was only in China that people thought that the status of teachers was similar to that of doctors. Unsurprisingly, with such attitudes towards teachers, Shanghai topped the 2012 Pisa rankings. And it&apos;s not just about teacher pay. We must culturally value teaching \u2013 seeing it not simply as a worthy vocation but as a job for the highly skilled that is essential to our future. Without that, we will condemn more generations to leave school unable to read to the end of a sentence. Vikas Pota is chief executive of the Varkey GEMS Foundation.

Then they told him there was no room at the hotel where he lived. Unpaid, unwelcome and unhappy, a friend took him in. And there Toni Doblas decided his short time in Azerbaijan was over. &quot;My career&apos;s been up and down,&quot; the Spanish goalkeeper says. A Real Betis fan, he spent four seasons in Primera with them reaching the Champions League against Chelsea and Liverpool. He led Betis to the 2005 Copa del Rey, their first title in 28 years, the third ever, with two penalty saves in the semi-final. And he later joined Zaragoza for the first of three spells, winning promotion. But by the third spell, Zaragoza were relegation-bound and broke. Doblas wasn&apos;t playing and they weren&apos;t paying. Azerbaijan led to familiar problems. Doblas calculates that he has been paid five months&apos; wages in three years. His case is with the Court of Arbitration for Sport . Those 45 minutes against Maccabi Haifa in the Europa League were his last for his club. At 33 he was largely forgotten with nowhere to go. Then this winter, after four months without a team, well into the second unemployed spell of his career, another opportunity arrived and last week Toni Doblas faced CSKA Moscow as captain. Doblas won&apos;t be paid and nor will his team-mates but this is different. Doblas is playing for the AFE \u2013 Spain&apos;s Players&apos; Union team. This is the eighth successive transfer window in which the AFE, led by sporting director, Vicente Blanco, has sifted through the applicants to build a 24-man squad of out-of-work footballers seeking a second chance, bringing them together for a month of intensive training. Based near Alicante, the aim is simple: to help them find themselves and find a club. Among Doblas&apos;s team-mates is Ayoze D\u00edaz, who last played at Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a after eight years at Mallorca. Goalkeeper Urtzi Iturrioz&apos;s Alav\u00e9s won promotion to the Second Division. Xavi Mor\u00e9&apos;s Real Oviedo didn&apos;t: his final home game before briefly joining the now-bankrupt SD Noja was a play-off semi-final in front of 20,000. Toni Moral, who played youth football at both Madrid and Barcelona, was in Greece. So was former Betis and Sporting Gij\u00f3n midfielder Tati Maldonado. Alberto Heredia was in Kazakhstan. And Albert Yague was at Badalona, having spent two years in Georgia. Gabri G\u00f3mez was one of Yague&apos;s Badalona team-mates but most of these players have known each other for just days, thrown together by circumstance. They all have one thing in common: they&apos;re unemployed. None has a team. What they do have, says Thomas Christiansen, &quot;is a real desire ... and in most cases a real need&quot;. Christiansen is a Danish-born Spain international, brought to Barcelona at 18 by Johan Cruyff. He played in Spain, Denmark, Greece and Germany, where he was top scorer, and was assistant coach at Al Jazira Club in the UAE last season. He&apos;s the AFE team coach this month. And he&apos;s right: &quot;need&quot; is the word. For these players, most from Spain&apos;s Second Division B, the economic impact is huge. The list of countries they&apos;ve played in represents obligation as much as opportunity and in the next few days Marc Serramitja will depart for Norway, Heredia to Nicaragua, and Moral to the UAE. &quot;If you have a family, you can&apos;t live on a Spanish Second Division B salary,&quot; Christiansen admits. The crisis bit hard. &quot;We&apos;re jornaleros, labourers. In Second Division B, \u20ac1,500 a month is a sueldazo,&quot; Xavi Mor\u00e9, who has a three month old daughter. A sueldazo is a huge salary. Under \u00a315,000 a year. The players have been given coaching, advice, media lessons and English classes. A fireman named Jos\u00e9 lectured on dealing with extreme pressure. Most importantly, they&apos;ve been given games: five matches against professional teams, coinciding with the winter window; five chances to prove themselves. Even for those with less economic need, there are benefits. &quot;Deportivo went into administration and I was one of the better paid players so they let me go,&quot; Ayoze explains. &quot;You feel lost. I&apos;d go to the gym at the same time as we used to train, I&apos;d keep the routine, stay active, but it just wasn&apos;t the same.&quot; Ayoze is 31, so why not retire? &quot;I&apos;ve been playing 12 years,&quot; he says. &quot;This is what I love, what I&apos;m good at. I got the baccalaureate but no qualifications. You think: &apos;what else can I do?&apos; I had no team and I kept thinking: &apos;something has got to come up, it&apos;s got to.&apos; But it didn&apos;t. Being here was a mental and emotional necessity: to be part of a team, to feel like a footballer again.&quot; That is the key. &quot;We&apos;re set up just like a professional team but with one difference: we want our best players to leave. In an ideal world, on the last day I&apos;ll be standing here on my own,&quot; Christiansen says. The coach has a full staff, plus physio, nutritionist, delegate and kit-man, and then there&apos;s Juanjo, press officer-turned-general manager. There are set plays, heart-rate monitors, stats, scouting reports and tactical videos. As if to prove the point, before facing CSKA Moscow at the Russians&apos; impeccable winter HQ near Orihuela, palm trees bordering pristine pitches, Christiansen finds a white board with CSKA&apos;s set plays on in the adjoining dressing room. He&apos;s still laughing hours later: &quot;They were exactly as we&apos;d said.&quot; Facing CSKA is their toughest test yet but unlike previous games, played in bigger and more public grounds against Shanghai Shenhua, Peru&apos;s Club Alianza Lima, Hurac\u00e1n Valencia and Swiss side FC Biel, barely 50 people watch: scouts, agents and friends. There are also two dogs. Russian coach Leonid Slutsky prowls the touchline maintaining an angry monologue. On the bench, assistant Viktor Onopko is passive. CSKA&apos;s back four are all internationals, including club captain Aleksei Berezutski. But the AFE team, playing a Barcelona-inspired 4-3-3, play well and it finishes 0-0. Over the five games, they don&apos;t concede a single goal. Xavi Roca, the assistant coach, is beaming \u2013 in just a week together, they actually look like a team. Others are less happy. Players board the bus past the sign saying &quot;no eating,&quot; one or two clutching CSKA shirts, and unwrap sandwiches, switching on their mobiles. Hoping. &quot;After the game you check if anyone has called you, if anyone has seen you, and you see a few WhatsApps from your wife and friends,&quot; Xavi Mor\u00e9 admits. A few days later, Burgos will come for him, but against CSKA he wasn&apos;t at his best. Days pass and the end of the window draws near. So far, as the bus pulls out only one player has found a club: Alberto Heredia. &quot;When you haven&apos;t got a club you feel empty, professionally and emotionally. I felt sunk: I trained with a local side but you feel your confidence go. &apos;I can&apos;t, I can&apos;t ...&apos;,&quot; Mor\u00e9 says later. &quot;Coming here really helps but you know every game is an opportunity and that&apos;s on your mind. There are quite a few of us who are pretty affected, struggling. I felt low today ... just, not good.&quot; Doblas agrees. &quot;We all have our low moments. Some are getting a lot of calls, some aren&apos;t. Some clubs don&apos;t even ring me because they think I won&apos;t move for such little money,&quot; he says. &quot;Footballer&apos; is what I am. My five-year-old son loves the fact that his dad plays and I&apos;m only 33. I had something nearly, nearly done the other day .... and then they call saying they&apos;ve changed their mind.&quot; Doblas blows out his cheeks in deflation: &quot;Pfff.&quot; Laura, the psychologist, chats privately to some; tomorrow she&apos;ll gives a group talk. &quot;They&apos;re very down,&quot; one coach admits. Christiansen declares a night off, clearing minds and releasing pressure. They&apos;ll head out for a while, all together. Some have become close even if their objective is to get away. Then events start accelerating. Toni Doblas is not one of them but within a few days 10 players have found work. Christiansen&apos;s not alone exactly, but he&apos;s getting there. The first piece of good news breaks that very night; hope comes with Ayoze. The players are eating when he appears, smiling a little shyly. In his hand is a piece of paper. The call came from Tenerife: Ayoze has got a club and back home too, 11 years after he departed the island where he was born and the club where his career began. He&apos;s leaving tomorrow morning. The 22 professional footballers sitting round the dining room table get to their feet and give him a standing ovation.", "tags": ["Finances", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-01-30T10:45:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/jan/30/diageo-shares-hit-spirits-dampen-emerging-markets", "sentences": ["Those large and garish Johnnie Walker Houses in Shanghai and Beijing \u2013 &quot;ultimate luxury venues&quot; to promote Scotch \u2013 are not yet barren wastelands."], "title": "Diageo's shares fall to 15-month low as spirits dampen in emerging markets", "article": "Diageo&apos;s snap summary of its financial results has been consistent in recent years. &quot;A strong company getting stronger,&quot; has been the pitch. So shareholders will have known something was up when yesterday&apos;s headline read: &quot;The strength of a diverse portfolio in a tougher environment.&quot; Rough translation: &quot;We thought we&apos;d do better than this.&quot; So did the market. Diageo&apos;s shares fell 4% to \u00a318.21 as half-year operating profits advanced only 3% to \u00a32.06bn. The share price stands at a 15-month low and has come down from \u00a321 last August. What&apos;s changed? A number of factors: the Chinese clampdown on so-called &quot;extravagance&quot; by government officials; a weak beer market in Nigeria; and drinkers in some countries in Asia and Latin America trading down from scotch as they contemplate currency crises and feel colder economic breezes. Diageo is nevertheless correct to point out that there is strength in diversity. For all the hype about emerging markets, 60% of group profits still come from the US and western Europe. The former is performing well (net sales up 5%) and the latter now looks to be close to a trough (net sales down 1%). And baijio, the white spirit that Chinese communist officials no longer dare to neck in public (sales down 66%), is only about 1% of Diageo. The company still reports that &quot;super and ultra premium&quot; whisky is selling well in China, which suggests that some punters pick up their own tabs or that the diktat against &quot;gifting&quot; is not universally obeyed. Those large and garish Johnnie Walker Houses in Shanghai and Beijing \u2013 &quot;ultimate luxury venues&quot; to promote Scotch \u2013 are not yet barren wastelands. For all that, Diageo is the latest in a series of international consumer companies to report a slowdown in growth in developing markets as a whole. The story was similar at Unilever.

Now she considers it a nuisance. The turning point came in November when, just as she began the fifth month of her pregnancy, Beijing announced a big change to the contentious policy, allowing couples to have two children if one parent is an only child. Chen, a 28-year-old employee at a state-owned enterprise, should qualify \u2013 her husband does have siblings, but she does not. Yet her hopes may be dashed: although she is pregnant with her first child, she lives with her husband&apos;s 16-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, and family planning officials may consider the teenager her own. As Chen fruitlessly searched the internet for details, her emotions turned from hope, to confusion, to anger \u2013 first at the lack of information, then at the policy as a whole. &quot;This policy has so many downsides \u2013 it violates natural law, it makes kids spoilt and thankless,&quot; she said. &quot;Sooner or later, they&apos;re going to have to give it up. It&apos;s really just a matter of time.&quot; Chen is not alone. While experts doubt the relaxation will deliver a baby boom, they say it has delivered something else entirely: a paradigm shift for many Chinese people who, over three decades, have grown numb to the government&apos;s role in their reproductive affairs. The policy&apos;s pitfalls are common knowledge: it has engendered an economically perilous demographic crunch and human rights abuses such as forced late-term abortions, abducted infants and the use of violence to collect fines. Yet &quot;resistance against the policy has never really been that strong&quot;, said Wang Feng, an expert on China&apos;s demographics at the University of California, Irvine. &quot;That&apos;s why I think this top-down change \u2013 when the government says &apos;now the policy has outlived its use and needs to be changed&apos; \u2013 that actually triggers a change in thinking.&quot; Five years ago, Wang estimated, only three out of 10 Chinese people were adamant that the policy should be scrapped. &quot;Now, with the announcement of this change, it may not be an exaggeration to see a shift to the other way around. Maybe nine out of 10 would say it&apos;s about time to get rid of this.&quot; Last week, the wealthy coastal province of Zhejiang became the first to sign the revision into law. Hubei in central China and Guangxi in the south could follow suit by March, state media say. Authorities say the policy has prevented 400m births since its implementation in the late 1970s. For evidence, they often point to UN estimates that the country&apos;s birthrate has dropped from 4.77 births per woman in the 1970s to 1.64 in 2011. Yet experts have called the figure into question. China&apos;s greatest fertility drop-off occurred in the decade before the policy was introduced, they say; its continuing decline mirrors that of other developing nations. China already allows many people to have two children, such as couples who are both only children, and ethnic minorities. Yet many of these families refrain, unwilling to bear the economic cost of a second child. Since the early 1990s, &quot;there&apos;s been no tightening up of the policy, but the fertility rate continues to decline&quot;, said Zuo Xuejin, an executive vice-president at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. &quot;So the basic driver for declined fertility is socioeconomic change.&quot; If China&apos;s demographic trends hold, the country will probably scrap the policy by 2020, according to Zuo. &quot;By 2025, the government will be encouraging people to have more children.&quot; Yet the policy will almost certainly continue to have a hold on people for years, experts say, for reasons that have little to do with demographics. For leading officials, backtracking on a three-decade-old policy would entail an intolerable loss of face. The country&apos;s sprawling family planning bureaucracy, which levies more than \u00a31bn annually in fines, is too deeply entrenched to suddenly dismantle. &quot;At the same time as China announces this policy change, it says the government will continue to put population control as its main mission,&quot; said Cai Yong, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. &quot;You see a contradiction right there.&quot; Chen is still waiting for details on her eligibility, and probably won&apos;t find answers until Beijing formally legislates. She badly wants a second child, unlike many of her colleagues. &quot;If my child doesn&apos;t have any siblings, she&apos;ll grow up very lonely,&quot; she said. If she finds out it is illegal, she will book a flight to the US and hopefully give birth there, granting her child foreign citizenship. &quot;Before, most people would go to Canada, but some policies changed, so people don&apos;t go there any more,&quot; she said. &quot;Going to America is really popular.

But things are looking up for this Arctic conurbation halfway between Europe and China. Over the next 30 years climate change is likely to open up a polar shipping route between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, cutting travel time to Asia by 40% and allowing Russia&apos;s vast oil and gas resources to be exported to China, Japan and south Asia much faster. Nadym stands to benefit from a warmer climate more than any other Arctic city \u2013 the Russian government plans to connect it by road and rail to other oil and gas centres; Gazprom, the world&apos;s largest gas company, is building a port nearby with French oil major Total; and if the new northern sea route is open for even six months of the year, Nadym will find itself on the 21st-century equivalent of the ancient silk route. &quot;The entire centre of gravity of the world economy is shifting to Nadym,&quot; said the mayor, Stanislav Shegurov, a former gas worker, at a recent meeting of Arctic leaders in Norway. Expectations are high that the route will complement the Suez canal as a key waterway for trade to and from Asia. &quot;The Arctic is our home and our future. We will make full use of the northern sea route. We are building infrastructure, we are making history. We have ambitious plans,&quot; said Anton Vasiliev, Russian ambassador for the Arctic. Only 71 large ships, working mostly with Russian icebreakers, navigated the route in 2013, but Russia expects a 30-fold increase in shipping by 2020 and ice-free water over most of its length by 2050. The summer ice has declined by nearly 50% in 40 years and by 2050, say Laurence Smith and Scott Stephenson of the University of California, ordinary vessels should be able to travel easily along the northern sea route and ice-strengthened ships should be able to pass over the pole itself. Confidence that the Arctic will become economically important is seen in the rush of countries and companies to claim a stake. Eleven countries, including Poland and Singapore, have appointed Arctic ambassadors to promote their national interests. Gazprom last week launched in South Korea the first of four giant &quot;ice-class&quot; natural gas carriers for the sea route. The Russian government plans to spend more than $3bn reopening a military base on the Novosibirsk Islands and is building new icebreakers and navigational centres. Oil giant Rosneft and ExxonMobile will start drilling for oil in the Kara Sea this year. Norway and the other Nordic countries have all made Arctic development a priority. &quot;The Arctic is changing rapidly. It will be our most important foreign policy area. Climate change is putting Norway under pressure,&quot; said its prime minister, Erna Solberg. Finland, which has no access to the northern sea route, has proposed a railway linking its mines to the Russian coast. &quot;Finland needs a new Nokia. The Arctic could be it,&quot; said its Arctic affairs ambassador, Hannu Halinen. American, Canadian, Japanese, South Korean and British companies all intend to use the sea route to mine across the region, but no country hopes to gain more than China, according to Wang Chuanxing, polar researcher at Tongji University, Shanghai. &quot;China&apos;s economy is 50% dependent on trade. The development of the northern sea route would have a major impact on its economy. One-third of China&apos;s trade is with the EU and the US. The opening of the northern sea route is vital for China,&quot; he said. Japan also hopes to benefit. &quot;Ten per cent of the world&apos;s unexploited crude oil and 20% of its natural gas is said to be in the Arctic. Recent changes because of climate change are attracting people in Japan. We want to actively participate. We are researching the Arctic sea route,&quot; said Toshio Kunikata, the Japanese ambassador in charge of Arctic affairs. &quot;A great chess game is being played with countries staking claims to the Arctic to make sure they are not left out. Climate change is taking place at twice the global average speed in the Arctic. Some countries, like China, are looking 50 years ahead,&quot; said Malte Humpert, director of the Washington-based thinktank the Arctic Institute. &quot;The polar research institute of China said that Arctic shipping would play a major role in the country&apos;s future trade, and suggested that, by the year 2020, 5%-15% of China&apos;s trade value \u2013 about $500bn \u2013 could pass through the Arctic. But that may be too hasty. We think the route will mostly benefit China&apos;s trade with Europe, but this is not likely to be because its priority is to build closer ties with Latin America and Africa. &quot;We think future shipping in the polar region will mostly consist of seasonal activity and transporting the region&apos;s natural resources to markets in east Asia. Climate change will transform the frozen north into a seasonally navigable ocean, but Arctic shipping routes will not become a new silk road for China.&quot; says Humpert. Norwegian shippers are cautious, too. &quot;Sailing trans-arctic from Yokohama to Hamburg would shave 40% off the distance compared to the Suez Canal. Yet our own predictions have been modest. In 2013 there were 71 commercial transits through the polar sea, compared with 18,000 and 14,000 through the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal,&quot; said Sturla Henriksen, head of the Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association. &quot;In 30 years, more than two-thirds of the volume of Arctic summer ice has disappeared. Our children will be the first generation in modern history to experience an entirely new ocean opening up. The Arctic has now become a true strategic hot spot at the centre of global interest. The high north embodies high stakes. A paradigm shift in international politics is taking place,&quot; said Henriksen.", "tags": ["Arctic", "Polar regions", "Environment", "Climate change", "Russia", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-01T12:24:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/02/on-my-radar-corin-sworn-cultural-highlights", "sentences": ["City: Shanghai     Shangai.", "I just got back from Shanghai, which was wild.", "We went to the Urban Planning Exhibition Centre and it had a picture of Shanghai in 1984 and then another of the skyline today; the 1984 skyline is absolutely unrecognisable."], "title": "On my radar: Corin Sworn's cultural highlights", "article": "Based in Glasgow, artist Corin Sworn was born in London and raised in Toronto.

Even the most optimistic of Sydney fans wouldn\u2019t have expected such a rout over their oldest rival, especially considering the match was played in Melbourne. With the catharsis of five unanswered goals and the confidence that comes from playing your opponents off the park, one might have been forgiven for expecting Sydney FC to back up this week against Melbourne\u2019s other team. Things certainly started well for the visitors, with Heart midfielder Orlando Engelaar sent off in the first half and Andrew Redmayne gifting Corey Gameiro the opening goal after some spectacularly average goalkeeping in the first half.  But with just 10 men, Melbourne Heart came out after half-time like a bat out of hell, and Sydney FC goalkeeper Vedran Janjetovic proved that whatever Redmayne could do, he could do worse. His butter fingers just after the break allowed Jonatan Germano to equalise, and Sydney were suddenly in dangerous territory. Unconvincing despite the man advantage, Sydney were eventually punished by David Williams, who stole the show in the dying moments as he ran half the length of the field, bamboozled two defenders and slid a shot into the bottom corner. It was a tremendous comeback from Melbourne Heart in front of their new mega-rich owners, and the stacks-on-Williams celebration showed that there is still plenty of life left in the A-League stragglers. Sydney, on the other hand, are still trying to prove they are more than just a one-hit wonder. New Zealand \u2019Nix?  In a city dominated by rugby union, experiments with football in Auckland have generally ended in tears. Remember the Football Kingz? If you don\u2019t, never mind Googling them - the less said about them the better. Most A-League fans will, however, remember the New Zealand Knights - that abysmal convalescent home for British journeymen footballers. They were the first A-League club to have their licence revoked in late 2006, and it couldn\u2019t have happened to a more deserving bunch. Low crowds, poor football and a general lack of interest from the football community in Auckland made for some seriously depressing matches.  Wellington Phoenix have been back a couple of times to Auckland since the death of the Knights, and have drawn decent crowds on both occasions. The affection for the \u2019Nix, or at the very least for football, clearly extends beyond Wellington. It was encouraging to see 18,506 spectators pile into Eden Park - the spiritual home of rugby union in Auckland - to witness Wellington Phoenix defeat Adelaide United on Saturday night. The Phoenix haven\u2019t been shy in travelling this season, taking games to Napier and Christchurch, and during the week the Phoenix general manager David Dome spoke of the importance of maintaining a commercial presence in the country\u2019s largest city. But while their owner Gareth Morgan has previously sounded out an Auckland-based team to spark a local rivalry, it is surely too soon to consider a second Kiwi side. And if the travelling roadshow continues to bring in the crowds, perhaps the Phoenix will suffice as New Zealand\u2019s sole A-League team? Taggart back on the scoresheet Of the 17 goals Newcastle Jets have scored so far this season, Adam Taggart has eight, a return which has seen him make the striker position his own. Most impressive, however, has been the manner in which he has scored the goals. Against Adelaide in Round 5 he began with a delightful flick over the keeper\u2019s head, which was duly repeated against Brisbane a week later. Since then, the Young Socceroo has preferred to score from range, finishing several crackers from distance with both feet. In just three matches during November, Taggart had racked up six goals. Then all of a sudden he stopped scoring, and the goals dried up for Newcastle. The Jets might have only managed a draw on Saturday night against the Western Sydney Wanderers, but Newcastle fans will be pleased to witness Taggart end his drought. His first was special - as the Jets broke through the middle of the park on 26 minutes, Wanderers defender-cum-holding midfielder Matthew Spiranovic broke up the play with a well timed challenge. A good 30 yards from goal, the ball spilled to Taggart. Ignoring the free man to his right, he took one look, and without taking a touch to steady himself, lashed the ball into the back of the net. The Wanderers should really have won it after goals on either side of half-time from Aaron Mooy and Michael Beauchamp, but it was Taggart who popped up to salvage a point, this time tapping in for the simplest of finishes at the death. What a strange feeling it must have been to score a scrappy goal. As nice as it is to only score pretty goals, in the end, they all count. Central Coast do it tough... again The transfer market is rarely kind to the Central Coast Mariners. Over the past few years it\u2019s become something of a tradition for the Mariners to farewell their best and brightest players, often to the detriment of the squad as a cohesive unit. Such are the realities of operating on a small budget in a salary-capped league - transfer fees have become a lifeblood in the business of running the club. This season has been no different, as Michael McGlinchey followed coach Graham Arnold to Japanese club Vegalta Sendai, while this weekend it was announced that Daniel McBreen and Trent Sainsbury would sign for Shanghai SIPG and PEC Zwolle respectively. As usual, both transfers are understandable - McBreen gets a chance at one last lucrative contract while Sainsbury makes the inevitable progression to European football. Both, of course, will be sorely missed. It certainly doesn&apos;t help, either, that Marcos Flores will be out injured for the season.  Fortunately for the Mariners, however, there are reinforcements waiting in Eddy Bosnar and Korean midfielder Kim Seung-yong. At 33, Bosnar comes home after more than a decade overseas, while Seung-yong arrives with decent pedigree having scored in an Asian Champions League final and with experience at some of the top clubs in South Korea. With the dearth of Asian players in the A-League, it might be worth keeping a close eye on Seung-yong. After Sunday evening&apos;s demoralising 2-1 loss to Brisbane Roar, the Mariners will certainly be hoping the newcomers fit in sooner rather than later.  Besart Berisha the difference If anyone had any doubts over how focused Brisbane Roar striker Besart Berisha would be after it was announced that he would join Melbourne Victory next season, his display against the Central Coast Mariners should serve as a lesson. Brisbane fans will no doubt be disappointed their star striker decided to move south, especially considering his reasons. &quot;I want really to win titles,&quot; said the Albanian striker. &quot;I don&apos;t go for money.&quot; It&apos;s hardly convincing - winning titles has been Brisbane Roar&apos;s stock in trade for the past few years. In any event, Mike Mulvey and Berisha have been at pains to sideline the issue, and prove that he is still committed to winning games in Brisbane. His performance on Sunday evening wasn&apos;t vintage Berisha, but nonetheless he prowled between the defensive lines and tackled like a mongrel.

Yet according to a new Greenpeace study a range of hazardous chemicals is being used in the production of kids&apos; wear from top fashion brands. A frequent question about producing toxin-free clothing is whether it is economically feasible for textile companies to replace hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives. The answer is resoundingly yes; doing so is essential if companies want to keep their business sustainable. The global textile industry is notorious for using potentially hazardous chemicals. According to research, more than 550 types of dyes and over 3,000 chemicals of auxiliaries containing carcinogenic chemicals, hormone disruptors, or heavy metals, are restricted for use in textile products under the laws of different countries. Research published by Greenpeace found that some of the chemicals widely used in the textile industry are toxic to reproductive development in mammals or interfere with the hormone system. And children may be more sensitive to the effects of these hazardous chemicals than adults. A recent UNEP and WHO report supported the proposition that the timing of some impacts caused by hormone disruptors can be critical, particularly for growing children. There is global concern over this issue (half a million people signed up to the Greenpeace DETOX campaign within days of its launch in 2012) and it has created far-reaching impacts within the global textile industry. Some leading players within the industry such as Benetton have moved to address the problem with a policy of implementing strict controls over its supply chain. Other companies have worked closely with their suppliers, often located in developing countries, to understand what is being used in the production of their products and what safer substitutes might be. Entire groups of toxic chemicals, previously ubiquitous in the supply chain, have been phased out by such companies within a short period of time \u2013 for example, biodegradable biopolymer and fluorocarbon-free water repellent materials are used as safer alternatives. More importantly, these companies have created incentives for &quot;upstream&quot; players in the textile supply chain, those who provide dyes and detergents, to weigh-in and start vying for a share in the market for safer alternatives. High-end British brand Burberry this week committed to start disclosing the chemical discharges of its suppliers in the global south by the end of June 2014. And by 1 July 2016, the fashion house says it will eliminate all per- and poly-fluorinated chemicals from its supply-chain. This opens a new chapter in the story of toxic-free fashion and raises the bar for the luxury sector. Brands such as Gucci, Versace and Louis Vuitton now risk getting left behind. Textile industry meetings in Beijing or Shanghai are now filled with energetic chemical engineers showing greener product lines to their potential customers in the textile business. Companies such as Mango have even produced detailed timelines about when their safer substitutes will be available in the next few years. This kind of market dynamic will almost certainly make safer alternatives more available and accessible for textile industry players who are aiming at providing toxic-free products for their customers. Early birds have an advantage. Across the globe regulations are kicking in that will force the textile industry to shift to toxin-free mode. More stringent regulation will be the reason that brands will eventually have to change to safer alternatives. In 2013, the textile industry was listed for the first time under China&apos;s national five-year plan for prevention and control of environmental risk of chemicals as a &quot;key industry for regulatory control&quot;. The signal sent by regulators in the world&apos;s largest textile producing country is very clear: no more toxic clothing in our backyard. The central government of China is also expected this year to release a blacklist of toxic chemicals that will be subject to strict regulatory control. Some of them are major chemicals used by the textile industry. These developments indicate that textile brands should move fast to catch up not only with consumer preferences but also regulatory intentions. The earlier the brands catch the trend, the more &quot;first mover advantage&quot; they can enjoy.

Why?", "article": "A breakthrough in marketing is essential for there to be a genuine breakthrough in capitalism, as I have previously written. This is essential given the unmet demand among people around the world.  You might then ask, is there real demand out there? And are companies not addressing this already? The abundant research points to there being a genuine and untapped marketplace of social change. JWT has surveyed consumer markets in the US, Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Across the world the picture is consistent. The vast majority of people, in fact, well over 80% of consumers from Shanghai to London, New Delhi to New York feel strongly that companies and brands must actively lead social change. In emerging economies, optimism about the future and a positive attitude to brands and consumerism stands in stark contrast to the suspicion and lack of trust that is widespread in the west. Unfortunately, these very same people, together with their western counterparts feel companies and brands are nowhere close to doing any of this. And these are the same people, who have never felt more empowered by social media and mobile. Consumers in China, India, Mexico and the Middle East, not just the so-called developed world, feel this personal and collective power. And the most vocal, most demanding and most empowered of all of course are the next generation of consumers; people between 18 and 30. Many of whom want a reset. Paul Polman, the global CEO of Unilever clearly gets this. He said: &quot;In any company, you have to go back to what drives people. Making more money or being bigger means less and less. Brands with a purpose and that are values-led over time are going to be more successful.&quot; He has asked his company to figure out how the progressive intent and actions of Unilever and its Sustainable Living Plan can be manifest through their individual brands and ultimately drive consumer loyalty for Unilever. Its recent launch of Project Sunlight is a precedent setting initiative that attempts to answer this question. It invites participation and connects social leadership across a wide portfolio of brands and social issues. Where will this go? Will it build beyond a single initiative and inform widespread brand activation connecting and involving people in multiple markets? These questions are part of the single most important and difficult challenge in modern marketing history. How can companies succeed in business but at the same time successfully embrace and respond to consumer expectation for social change and social leadership? The answers are at the heart of driving true, sustainable breakthroughs in capitalism. On the surface, this widespread and unresolved demand would appear to be the soil from which a true movement in capitalism should grow. Companies simply need to come to grips with this demand and these people, the way marketing-led organisations are supposed to: addressing the needs and wants of consumer citizens through insight, great creativity and new ideas. But, despite some compelling exceptions, it is not happening. Why? Marketing has lost its seat at the corporate table Peter Drucker, the dean of modern business had a very strong opinion about the core ingredients of success. He said there are only two essential things in business; marketing and innovation. Everything else is a cost. It would seem Drucker&apos;s point of view has been long ignored. Finance, sales, and operations have taken the wheel of companies over the past several decades. While there are important instances to the contrary, marketing has been relegated to delivering quarterly results and has been pushed out of the boardroom and away from executive tables. To make matters worse, the average CMO, according to the executive search firm Spencer Stuart, lasts less than two years on the job. And Fast Company declared the position of CMO &quot;the most dangerous job in business.&quot; Big business and big retail are fighting for their lives; playing defence In so many markets, price has become the major battleground and the ability to add brand value and create brand differentiation in traditional ways is running out of gas. Little wonder that marketers still look at you funny when you talk about social leadership. Why? Because their jobs are on the line for the next quarter. They don&apos;t have two years to prove something. It is hard enough to implement traditional brand building programs that will actually add value to the brand or company rather than draw from it. Their budgets are constantly shrinking. The onslaught of digital and social media and the unpredictability of millennials are further challenging the fundamental ways companies sell and market. It is hard and the risks are high Tapping into this market place is not your usual new product launch. Consumers need fresh solutions, new value propositions, new ways of engaging, not simply new products. There is no play book or a legion of experts in your company that have done this before. Nor are there text books full of precedents to reassure management that there is a likelihood of success. It is someone else&apos;s job Sustainability and CSR remain outliers in most corporations. Responsibility usually rests in the hands of corporate affairs or a sustainability chief. Certainly it is siloed; cut off from the operations, the marketers, the heart of the business. And that&apos;s just four.  In the third and final article in this series, I will outline what these and other barriers call for.

Not all that surprising, perhaps, until you consider the scale of the institutions in question. One was the Long Museum, a 10,000 square metre private art gallery owned by one of the biggest art collecting couples in China. The other was the Power Station of Art (PSA), Shanghai&apos;s first public museum of contemporary art, named for the enormous former industrial building it occupies on the banks of the Huangpu river. Both were about to celebrate their first birthdays at the time of my visit to Shanghai in September last year and both were eerily quiet. No one likes an overcrowded gallery, of course, but there&apos;s definitely something off-putting about being in a museum alone. The Long Museum and the PSA are part of an extraordinary wave of high profile public and private museum and gallery building taking place not just in Shanghai but across China. The last couple of years in Shanghai alone have seen the relocation of the China Art Museum; the launch of the Yuz Museum; and the relocation of the Shanghai Himalayas Museum (another private institution) to an enormous new space in Pudong. In March, these institutions will be joined by another \u2013 larger \u2013 branch of the Long Museum, opening in a newly developed area of the city known as the Xuhui Riverside. Deep pockets, but how deep? It&apos;s a thrilling time for the Chinese museum sector, but it&apos;s also an uncertain one. Attendance figures for both the Long Museum and PSA have been disappointing so far. The PSA attracted only 250,000 visitors in 2013, while the picture at the Long Museum is grimmer still. Wang Wei, the museum&apos;s chief curator, and her husband, billionaire businessman Liu Yiqian, spend over \u00a31m on running costs annually and paid out around \u00a330m in capital expenses, but welcomed only 50,000 people through their doors last year. The couple have deep pockets, but it&apos;s hard to see how such a project is sustainable in the long-term, especially given their soon-to-open second space has set them back a further \u00a330m. If Wang is worried about the future, she didn&apos;t show it. The curator, who had no experience in the sector before taking the helm at the Long Museum, said she is &quot;satisfied with the current operation situation&quot;. There are, however, a number of strategies in place to boost attendance figures, including public lecture programmes for adults and children and a range of membership schemes. Wang is also looking at exploiting commercial potential of her museums, hiring out spaces for events and working with partners \u2013 luxury brands, for example \u2013 to raise revenue from different sources. She would like to encourage philanthropy too and is considering approaching foundations in the West for funding. New media means more for artists As a state-run institution, the PSA is in a more stable position, but deputy director of planning Li Xu had his concerns about how his museum will fare in the future. He attributes the underwhelming visitor numbers to the PSA&apos;s out-of-the-way location and poor transport links: &quot;It has to be accessible. No matter how much you love contemporary art, this place has to be easy to get to or else your passion will be washed away.&quot; Li believes the Chinese education system is also a challenge. &quot;Our education department works very hard,&quot; he said, but the emphasis schools put on preparing for high school and university entrance exams means that students have little or no time to spend at institutions like the PSA. Philip Dodd is chair of Made in China, a London-based company that works with governments, brands, media and creative businesses to facilitate engagement between China and Europe. &quot;The [Chinese] education system still has to undergo a really radical transformation,&quot; he said. &quot;The museums are part of that radical transformation&quot;. But Dodd also stresses the crucial role that social media is likely to play in the development of the Chinese museum sector. &quot;There are 675 million mobile phones in China, and that&apos;s just scratching the surface,&quot; he said. &quot;Because the old media has been state-controlled, this new media, which is much more difficult to control, may become a really interesting place for artists to work in, or private museums to work in.&quot; Is this China&apos;s museum era? The sheer scale of social media engagement in China is also indicative of just how different are the contexts in which museums in China and those in the West are operating. Chinese museums are eager to learn and humble enough to learn from the West, said Dodd. &quot;But they have a different strategy: put up the museum, put in the collection and then begin to develop what one might call the audience for that museum.&quot; It&apos;s therefore crucial for the Chinese museum sector to find its own solutions to its own particular challenges, rather than just importing ideas from the West. Wang said she is keen to learn from Western institutions, but added: &quot;In China, private museums have their own characteristics and we have our own reality.&quot; How those institutions \u2013 both private and state-run \u2013 will fare in the coming years is very hard to predict. &quot;China is beginning a system of museum building that took about 130 years to resolve itself in Europe \u2026 so part of our problem at the moment is our expectations of China,&quot; said Dodd. &quot;I don&apos;t think the future&apos;s bright, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s cheap and cheerful; it&apos;ll be very complex, it&apos;ll be difficult. &quot;There will be losses, there will be gains, but I do think that for China \u2013 and for Asia more generally \u2013 this is the museum era.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

By the time she gets home, usually long after dark, Cardoso has spent almost a quarter of her day, and a sizeable share of her income, on public transport. Little wonder then that she \u2013 like tens of thousands of other Rio residents \u2013 is furious that bus fares in the city are due to go up on Saturday. &quot;It&apos;s absurd,&quot; Cardoso says. &quot;Minimum salaries are very low and basic living costs are already high so the transport fare affects the food on the table for many families.&quot; Her sentiments are widely shared, and the fare increase has already sparked a new round of street protests. As this week&apos;s London Underground strike has underlined, frustration is a common feeling among commuters around the world, but it is being taken to incandescent heights in Brazil&apos;s two biggest cities, where transport has become a focus of fury about government corruption, inefficiency and inequality.     Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes. Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images    Bus price increases were the spark for the huge protests in more than 80 cities last June, prompting governments to postpone the fare hike and promise more spending on transport. But commuter costs are now creeping back up. This Saturday, Rio will raise municipal bus prices by 9%, from 2.75 reais to 3 reais (75p). That may seem cheap compared with London or New York. But for a daily commuter, that still works out at about a sixth of the minimum wage of 724 Rs a month \u2013 more in the case of people who, like Cordoso, have to use buses and trains. Mayor Eduardo Paes has tried to alleviate the impact by extending free bus passes to school pupils and by forcing the bus companies to install air conditioning on their entire fleets.

In Rio de Janeiro, there were barrier-jumping demonstrations last month by almost 100 people at Central do Brasil station. On Thursday, organisers are planning the sixth street rally in as almost as many months against planned fare rises. In S\u00e3o Paulo, buses have been torched on an almost daily basis since the start of the year and subway systems have been interrupted this week by a wave of disruptions, confrontations and emergency brake-pull protests, forcing thousands of passengers to walk through the tunnels.     Dilma Rousseff.  Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters    It was not supposed to be this way. When Brazil bid for the 2014 World Cup, one of the government&apos;s main justifications for the multibillion-dollar expense was an improved transport infrastructure. Along with the Olympics, the sporting events were supposed to accelerate a $400bn plan to upgrade airports, subways, roads and bus links. But projects have been plagued by bureaucracy, inefficiency, corruption and a general lack of dynamism. With just four months until the opening match, more than a quarter of the 49 original transport projects scheduled for completion before the tournament have been scaled down, delayed or cancelled. Promised new metro links in Salvador and S\u00e3o Paulo, and tram services in Brasilia and Cuiab\u00e1, will not be ready in time. President Dilma Rousseff had promised that a bullet train between Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo would be built in time for the World Cup that would also link with the major airports in both cities. Today, construction has yet to start and refurbishment of the airport terminals \u2013 which remain shoddy throwbacks to the 1970s \u2013 will not go up for tender until March.    Rio, Shanghai metro 1993 vs. 2013 pic.twitter.com/Y6OhRc5XXx&mdash; Patrick Boehler (@mrbaopanrui) October 2, 2013    &quot;It&apos;s a joke. We were awarded the World Cup seven years ago and only now we&apos;re calling tenders for the airports?&quot; said Brazil&apos;s 1994 World Cup-winning coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, in a recent interview. Social networks are filled with anger, dismay and embarrassment. Highlighting how slow Rio de Janeiro has been in developing its subway system is a now-viral image comparing the city&apos;s metro to that of Shanghai&apos;s since 1993. The single short line and spur of Rio&apos;s system has barely changed and now covers 25 miles and 35 stations. Shanghai, meanwhile, had no subway in 1993, but is now a dense spider&apos;s web, encompassing 333 miles of track and 329 stations. Asked why Rio has moved so slowly, Mauro Kleiman, a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro&apos;s Institute of Urban Planning, said the city put too much emphasis on cars, neglected long-term planning and failed to keep pace with the speed of urbanisation. &quot;People are angry because the quality of transport services fails to meet demand,&quot; he said. &quot;With the economy growing, more and more people come to the metropolis. They get jobs. They commute. This leads to crowded roads and crowded public transport.&quot; While many cite Rio&apos;s geography \u2013 mountainous terrain, proximity to the sea and complex soil structure \u2013 as the main challenge to the development of a subway network, Kleiman says such engineering challenges are not insurmountable. Instead, he says historical and political factors have undermined transport.     Boys playing football in the Borel favela. Photograph: Buda Mendes/Getty Images    Rio had an extensive railway and tram system until 1962, but replaced most of it with asphalt roads. &quot;This was when we switched from being a city of public transit to being a city of cars,&quot; Kleiman said. The government&apos;s priorities are also affected by the political clout of the city&apos;s four main bus companies, which are concentrated in the hands of some of Rio&apos;s oldest and most influential families. Politicians also like prestige projects that can be completed during their term of office. Day-to-day maintenance and upgrades are not seen as priorities. As a result, Rio still has wooden sleepers on what is left of its tracks and rails are not regularly realigned, so trains wobble and often derail. Juciano Rodrigues, a researcher at the Observatory of the Metropolis at the National Institute of Science and Technology, says class politics are also to blame. Unlike many other cities, he says, the outskirts of Rio are considered a &quot;periphery&quot; for the poor rather than a dormitory town for middle-class commuters. Relocations of inner-city favela residents often result in communities being pushed further from the fringes. As a result, many people are having to spend a major share of their income and their time on long commutes to low-paying jobs. The government says that is why most of Rio&apos;s transport improvement budget has been spent on the development of a Rapid Bus Transport System, which ought to be cheaper and quicker to roll out. Compared to recent decades, municipal officials say they are putting more money into easing commuter hardships. That is one of the reasons why they need more revenue. But Rodrigues predicts more protests over the price rise. &quot;It&apos;s awful, terrible. They&apos;re asking people to pay for something really bad,&quot; he said. &quot;This new rate is much higher than inflation. In percentage terms, the weight of transport in the family budget is the same as food.&quot; This is the crucial issue. Whether or not Brazil completes its projects in time for the expected influx of 600,000 foreign visitors for the World Cup, those who will be most affected by the quality and cost of transport here are those like Cordoso, who have to make the journey every day from the poor to the rich world. \u2022 Additional reporting by Anna Kaiser More on the buildup to the World Cup Brazil in the spotlight: &apos;Our hour has arrived&apos; Rio favelas being &apos;socially cleansed&apos; in runup to sporting events Fifa issues ultimatum to host city over World Cup stadium delays", "tags": ["Brazil", "Road transport", "Americas", "World news", "World Cup 2014", "World Cup", "Football"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-06T07:36:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/feb/07/poverty-impact-attainment-feedback-coping-requires-improvement", "sentences": ["He&apos;s found that the poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers in the UK and the United States."], "title": "Impact of poverty on exam results and how schools can help budding composers", "article": "Pisa test results debunk myth that poor pupils are destined to fail at school Last year&apos;s Pisa tests have revealed a wealth of fascinating insights into pupil achievement across the world and analysis of the data is still being carried out.

Leading a school that requires improvement One of the best pieces I came across this week was by Debbie Light, who talks about what it&apos;s like to be in the senior leadership team of a school that requires improvement. It&apos;s a wonderfully reflective piece that also offers some great ideas for raising standards. One of the schemes the school recently trialed was open classroom fortnight, where teachers opened up their classroom to be visited by a colleague. You can find out more about the challenges of working in a school that&apos;s constantly being monitored by Ofsted and how Debbie&apos;s tackling this in the full post on Teacher Tweaks. How to give effective feedback If we give students feedback and lots of it will they do better? And is feedback still helpful when pupils know they have made a mistake? These are some of the questions teacher Neil Atkin discusses in a great blog post on how to give students effective feedback. As well as exploring research on feedback, Neil offers lots of suggestions for ways of helping students get more from comments on their work. One of his ideas is for feedback to be peer-led, with pupils answering a question put to them on post-it notes on a classroom wall, which other pupils tick and initial if they agree with. You can read more about his ideas on his blog Neil Atkin. How can schools help the next generation of composers flourish? Composers, musicians, teachers and university researchers have come together to investigate how schools can better support budding composers. One of the team&apos;s recommendations is for pupils to be exposed to more music they don&apos;t know to help challenge and inspire them. They&apos;ve also called for teachers and composers to collaborate more, as they believe it will helps teachers think more creatively in terms of how they present material.

Some signs telling you which way to go; some other pilgrims; some towns; some fields. What then do you do if you have to write about it? Gideon Lewis-Kraus has come up with the bright idea of writing about himself. A graduate of Stanford, he is American and he is young. He is, it seems, attempting to find himself as he sets out on these journeys. He goes on pilgrimages in Spain, Japan and Ukraine, and hangs about the place in Berlin and Shanghai. Some of his accounts of moving and staying still are engaging, at times engrossing. His version of the art world in Berlin, for example, inextricably linked to bar life and sex life, is filled with wit, insight and hilarity. He has a way of seeming to\u00a0be as lazy as sin, a sort of good-for-nothing who leaves others to pick up the tab, too empty-headed to read or think much, but this is merely a type of sly grace. He is a good noticer who has the knack of pretending that, really, he has noticed nothing much at all \u2013 he was too busy thinking about himself. In Berlin he notices that the less effort artists put into a piece, the more they require &quot;extensive documentation. They didn&apos;t believe in preparation but they did believe in proof.&quot; He goes to openings, happenings and bars. He has\u00a0a gift for writing smart sentences, such as: &quot;Two friends visited and had a\u00a0threesome with a tied-up Swede.&quot; Or,\u00a0of a conceptual artist: &quot;He had thick\u00a0tortoiseshell glasses and whined with refinement.&quot; After Berlin, he and his friend, the writer Tom Bissell, walk the route, the Camino, to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Since I did this myself 20 years ago and cheated by taking a train, and have skipped through a good deal of the literature about it, I can say with true authority that Lewis-Kraus&apos;s version of\u00a0the journey to Santiago is supremely\u00a0accurate. He catches the pain and the boredom, the mixture of pointless banal walking and huge almost spiritual uplift. He writes with wit and good sense about the awful suburbs of the cities versus the beauty and the variety of the landscape; more than anything, he deals\u00a0with the weird mood swings he and Tom suffer as they walk on day after day, and the oddness and sweetness of their fellow pilgrims. Gideon and Tom seem to have elements of the two lovable thieves who take the route (and the belongings of anyone they encounter) in Bu\u00f1uel&apos;s film The Milky Way, until you begin to notice that they start walking each day before dawn and never grow to hate each other. I remember American guys like them when I was on the Camino, especially in the early morning in the dorms as they woke up the whole place at 4.30am, all balls and bellowing, before setting out to conquer the west. If in the foreground of this book there is smart-boy wit and youthful, rueful good humour, in the background there is pain. Lewis-Kraus, as he travels, has a problem with his father, a\u00a0rabbi who is homosexual and living with his boyfriend. Over all the years, the father, from the son&apos;s point of view, has been absent, dishonest, unavailable, self-absorbed. The encounters with the father, or even the thoughts about him,\u00a0are made\u00a0all the more sharp and angry here because of the general geeky tenderness of the tone in the rest of the book. Lewis-Kraus, in the section set in Berlin, has glib things to say about Germans: &quot;They revelled in their powerlessness. For them simply not being a Nazi counted as an accomplishment \u2026 The Germans had made not being Nazis into a central part of their identity.&quot; This is ominous, but he gets away with it because of the other things going on in his German chapter. In Spain too, he gets away with not knowing the language or anything about the country at all. He makes not knowing or caring into a sort of innocence and charm. But by the time he arrives in Japan, still knowing nothing, his narrative sags; his poorly stocked mind begins to irritate as he walks from temple to temple on the Japanese island of Shikoku. Lewis-Kraus&apos;s concern with himself and his comfort seems to increase exponentially as the reader&apos;s interest wanes. It is worthy of note perhaps that one of the places he stays &quot;is a masterpiece of understated passive-aggression, the crowning achievement of a thousand years of melancholy anti-utilitarian Japanese aesthetics&quot;. But it is tedious when his discomfort and boredom and his failure to find suitable shelter occur night after night, with nothing much else going on, and run for over 100 pages. Once two pilgrimages are done, and he is preparing to go with his father and brother on a Jewish pilgrimage in Ukraine, Lewis-Kraus descends for a short time into psychobabble as he attempts reconciliation with his father. &quot;The forgiveness had to come first, because part of that gesture is reconciling yourself to the fact that there&apos;s never going to be any such thing as real, satisfying redress, especially when the person in front of you is no longer the person you&apos;ve been so mad at and so disappointed in for so long. The truth about the past has relevance only insofar as it might help to re-establish credibility and accountability going forward.&quot; Going forward, indeed. As the three members of the Lewis-Kraus family go forward in the company of many Hasidic Jewish men in the town of Uman in Ukraine, the energy levels of the book pick up a bit. While they walk by mass graves and the sites of pogroms, while the religious rituals go on around them, the two brothers attempt to get what is called full disclosure from their father about his homosexuality. This is why they have come here; the pilgrimage is personal and, for all three, the matter is urgent and their tone is earnest. For the rest of us, there is a problem because the history of pogroms and violent antisemitism in Ukraine, and the rituals Hasidic Jews use to mark what happened, may interest us more than the conversations between these three gents, however well-intentioned. It may be a cultural difference. In Ireland, you are brought up to believe that talking about yourself \u2013 or even thinking about yourself \u2013 is bad manners. In New York I notice that most of the population are not brought up that way. All the same, Lewis-Kraus manages to make his own needs and the dramas within his own family pressing and oddly raw and almost moving. He and his brother interrogate their father&apos;s life and try to understand what happened. Away from home, on pilgrimage, they come to see that the way their father dealt uneasily with his sexuality and nonchalantly with his family was both complex and simple. By the end of the book, as in all the best movies, something has been resolved, and perhaps there is something we, who are not members of this particular family, could learn from all of this. It is hard to\u00a0be sure.", "tags": ["Travel writing", "Autobiography and memoir", "Travel", "Books", "Biography", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-07T11:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/07/host-your-own-poker-night-do-something-social", "sentences": ["Six of us are squished around the table \u2013 Tom, me, Laura, Jake (an old friend visiting from Shanghai), Lynn and my girlfriend, Georgie."], "title": "Host your own poker night", "article": "It&apos;s a cold, wet night in England, but this place looks pretty darn Texan. We&apos;re at my friend Tom&apos;s flat to play poker. The game is Texas hold&apos;em, and\u00a0everything&apos;s American: watery beer in the fridge, chicken wings in the\u00a0oven and a huge bowl of jelly beans on the table. Tom&apos;s even dug up a dealer&apos;s visor. Six of us are squished around the table \u2013 Tom, me, Laura, Jake (an old friend visiting from Shanghai), Lynn and my girlfriend, Georgie. We&apos;ve agreed to a buy-in of \u00a310, but only Georgie&apos;s come prepared. Jake and Lynn offer Chinese yuan, I scrape up \u00a36.70 in change, Tom and Laura settle for IOUs. We&apos;re pros, obviously. Tom knows the rules, so he gives us a brief tutorial (see panel beneath main story). The dealer hands out two cards each. A starting bet of one chip (the small blind) is put down by the player to the dealer&apos;s left, then one double that (the big blind) by the next player along. Everyone else looks at their cards and matches the big blind if they want to play. The dealer then lays out three &quot;community cards&quot; (known as the flop), a fourth card (the turn) and a fifth (the river), with a round of betting in between each. During betting each of us can choose to raise the bet (meaning everyone else has to match it), check (a free pass with no extra chips laid down, requiring all players to show their cards) or fold (quit the round). The idea is to play the best combination of the seven cards available to you (two of your own, five on the table) to win the combined bets (the pot). &apos;Hands&apos;t range from a pair (two queens, say) to a full house (one pair plus three of a kind, eg two sevens and three queens) to the majestic royal flush (ten, jack, queen, king and ace, in the same suit) with various fiddly iterations in between. It sounds complicated on paper, but it&apos;s easy to pick up, especially if \u2013 like me \u2013 you&apos;re willing to turn an enjoyable game of skill and luck into a psychological mauling of people you hold dear. Tom deals first and we&apos;re off: elbow-to-elbow around the pot. It would be difficult not to see Laura&apos;s cards, even if I wasn&apos;t trying to. &quot;You can&apos;t see my hand, can you?&quot;, she asks. &quot;No. Of course not&quot;. Laura has the two of diamonds and the King of spades. I haven&apos;t played much poker, but \u2013 seeing as I am lying and cheating before the first hand is done \u2013 I must be a natural. Wikipedia says that success in the game relies on having a rich understanding of psychology and probability, but years of watching films\u00a0have taught me that it&apos;s all about the tell. The tell is a behavioural tic that gives you an idea of whether your opponent is bluffing about what&apos;s in their hand. Derren Brown once taught a pensioner to beat a table of professional players by reading their tells. I decide to give it a go. Jake and Lynn are easy to read. They&apos;ve come all the way in from the\u00a0suburbs for my poker night. Their\u00a0tell is needing to catch the last train back. Laura has a knack for reading the table and a gift for pushing others to bet more than they can afford. Her tell is that I can see her cards. I know Georgie hates inefficiency. So I think she&apos;d bet only when she has something impressive in her hand. Speaking to her afterwards it turns out that this is nonsense. &quot;I&apos;m a piss-taking bluffer,&quot; she says, a bit annoyed that I&apos;ve misread her so badly. To be fair, we&apos;ve only been in a relationship for five years. Tom \u2013 one of my best friends since I was 15 \u2013 should be an easy mark in comparison. Instead he&apos;s my nemesis \u2013 harder to read than Pynchon. He&apos;s practical and logical. He keeps track of the bets, and sets an alarm to remind us when to raise the blind. But then there&apos;s his inconsistency. For every handful of chips that he stacks (a sign of a conservative player, according to poker gurus), there&apos;s another sprawling across the table. He could be an expert player, but maybe this is just Tom \u2013 the sweet-natured, fun-loving guy who once got so angry he threw a sofa at me. He&apos;s been like a brother for nearly two decades. At the table, I don&apos;t know him at all. We go back and forth between hands, with the chips sliding between us until I luck out on a pair of aces (&quot;statistically the best starting hand&quot; \u2013 Wikipedia, again) and go all in, because that&apos;s what they do in films. I win. A huge pot is mine. From there it&apos;s a matter of forcing people into submission by betting higher than they can hope to match. &quot;This isn&apos;t fun anymore,&quot; says Georgie. I feel sympathy, which somehow morphs into a greedy sneer on the way to my face. The game ends. The tenner, the 200 yuan and the IOUs are mine. I&apos;m over the moon. Everyone else seems a bit glum. But that&apos;s poker. A game where there can be only one winner and that winner is a liar, a bully and \u2013 in this case \u2013 a cheat.     WC Fields makes a poker face.

Dressed in a pink Chanel jacket and black pencil skirt, she poured the then 80-year-old&apos;s water for him, lovingly stroked his back and quietly reminded him to calm down when he began slapping the table to make his point. Most impressively of all, the former volleyball player leapt out of her seat with athletic speed to administer a fierce right-handed spike to the protesting comedian, Jonnie Marbles, who had rammed a foam pie into the octogenarian&apos;s face. Having dispatched the assailant, she then carefully cleaned the remnants of the pie from her husband&apos;s suit. As an advert for a loyal and dutiful wife, it could hardly have been improved had she stood up and sung Stand by Your Man. But according to a damning feature in the latest issue of Vanity Fair, the marriage was already coming apart. Behind the scenes, it argues, Deng had become hypercritical and aggressive towards Murdoch. As one friend is quoted as saying, she &quot;would insult him, insult staff, scream, bark orders&quot;. The magazine also alleges that she conducted a number of friendships behind the media baron&apos;s back, including with Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google. And it suggests that Deng became infatuated with Tony Blair, who visited her several times and in several locations in America and London when Murdoch was not present. The rumour of an affair between Blair and Deng surfaced last year, following Murdoch&apos;s divorce from Deng. It was instantly dismissed by Blair, who is godfather to Deng&apos;s and Murdoch&apos;s 12-year-old daughter Grace. But Murdoch also let it be known that he would have no further dealings with the former prime minister. What adds a certain verisimilitude to the latest claim of a crush on Blair is the publication of a note, apparently written by Deng, in which she rhapsodises about Blair like a gushing schoolgirl. &quot;Oh, shit, oh, shit,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Whatever why I&apos;m so missing Tony. Because he is so charming and his clothes are so good. He has such good body and he has really really good legs Butt\u2026 And he is slim tall and good skin.&quot; She also says that she loves his power on stage, as though he were a rock star and she a starstruck groupie. Two major questions arise from this note. The first, obviously, is whether that &quot;Butt\u2026&quot; is a misspelt preposition at the beginning of an uncompleted sentence or a reference to this nation&apos;s one-time leader&apos;s backside. The second is where did it come from and who leaked it to Vanity Fair? The answers may never be known, but it seems clear that the source of the note is no friend of Deng. For the portrait the magazine paints is of a calculating and ruthless user of men who has employed her sexual capital to fulfil an incendiary ambition to get ahead. While various &quot;friends&quot; and acquaintances describe her as gauche and ill-tempered, she is held up as a role model for the acquisitive Chinese yuppies known as &quot;Shanghai girls&quot;. Is it an accurate character study or a vindictive hatchet job playing on racist and sexist stereotypes? There are voices that come to her aid, but they tend to sound like PR-scripted statements rather than heartfelt testaments. Fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg says she is &quot;a fantastic woman and a great mother&quot; and Nicole Kidman adds: &quot;Wendi is all about friendship between women.&quot; Perhaps, but the insistent message is that those friendships work better when the women are not married to men to whom Deng has taken a fancy. Wendi Deng was born Deng Wen Ge, which means &quot;cultural revolution&quot;, and grew up in the Chinese industrial city of Xuzhou. It was a common name at the time \u2013 1968 \u2013 intended to signify her parents&apos; adherence to Maoist principles. But in many ways Deng has lived up to her birth name, for her story is one of an extraordinarily dramatic cultural change. Her father was manager of an engineering factory, a position that made the Dengs slightly better off than average, which is to say very poor by western standards. She lived with her parents, three siblings and an aged aunt in a three-bedroom flat. Despite the cramped conditions, she worked ferociously hard, spurred on by a prototype &quot;Tiger mother&quot;. &quot;My parents were so tough,&quot; she said in an interview with Vogue, &quot;that in the summer when everyone was on vacation, I had to study the whole textbook for the next year so I would be ahead in class.&quot; An old schoolfriend recalls that Deng would be up at 3am studying English, the language that she hoped would be her passport out of Xuzhou. In her late teens, she attended a medical school in Guangzhou, where she met Jake Cherry \u2013 a 50-year-old American middle manager, overseeing a freezer factory \u2013 and his wife, Joyce. The Cherrys befriended the 19-year-old and Joyce helped her apply for a university in the US. The following year, she moved into the Cherrys&apos; San Fernando Valley home, sharing a room with their five-year-old daughter. Within two years, Cherry had left his wife and married Deng. And less than three years after that, shortly after Deng got her green card, the couple were divorced. In reality, just a few months after marrying Cherry, Deng had taken up with another man, this time one in his mid-20s, whom she would soon leave &quot;deeply wounded&quot;. This section of Deng&apos;s biography was said to be unknown to Murdoch when he embarked on his third marriage in 1999, although it&apos;s hard to believe that a man of his means didn&apos;t bother running a background check. In any case, the details were shared with the world the following year, when the story appeared in the Wall Street Journal. Despite his best effort, Murdoch was unable to prevent publication, which may be one of the reasons he bought the newspaper seven years later. Deng had moved from California to take an MBA at Yale School of Management, from where she landed an internship at Star TV, the Hong Kong station then owned by Murdoch&apos;s News Corp. It was here, in 1997, that Deng first met Murdoch, who had flown in to address the staff. Legend has it that during a sycophantic Q&amp;A session, the young Deng broke ranks and put a critical question to one of the most successful businessmen in the world: &quot;Why is your business strategy in China so bad?&quot; It wasn&apos;t long before Murdoch had left Anna, his wife of 32 years, for Deng, a woman who was 37 years his junior. Deng later told an interviewer on Chinese TV that she initially rejected Murdoch&apos;s affections, explaining that if the relationship failed, she would lose her job and everything. &quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; she said Murdoch replied. &quot;I will marry you.&quot; In the space of a decade, Deng had gone from impoverished obscurity to being the wife of a world-renowned multibillionaire. A minutely small number of people would have the confidence to attempt that transition and an even smaller number could then flourish in the company of the superrich and globally famous. But Deng did. The couple moved into a $44m apartment in Fifth Avenue, said to be the most expensive in New York, and she set about entertaining a crowd that included people such as David Geffen, Bono and Fox co-founder Barry Diller, restyling Murdoch in more casual clothes and dyed hair and encouraging him to spend his money more freely. She told Murdoch&apos;s biographer, Michael Wolff, that Murdoch was worried about the extravagance of buying a new yacht. &quot;His whole family like this,&quot; she jokingly complained. &quot;They so cheap.&quot; She also advised Murdoch on business in China, had two children, ran several households, networked furiously and got involved in the worlds of fashion, film and art. A friend who went on holiday with the Murdochs said that Deng had become&quot;obsessed&quot; with &quot;social status and spending and a billionaire&apos;s lifestyle&quot;. In other words, she was acting like someone who was openly interested in wealth and social position. But this is hardly a revelation. Murdoch had been married to a woman, Anna, who liked to keep a low profile. And he left her. What, to paraphrase the classic Mrs Merton question, did he think attracted the beautiful young Deng to an ageing billionaire? Although there are several fresh details in the Vanity Fair feature, it&apos;s a very old story and one immortalised in the 19th-century novel with which the magazine shares its name. If Deng is a 21st-century Becky Sharp, we should recall that for all her cynicism, Thackeray&apos;s heroine also possessed an indomitable spirit. She may no longer be standing by her man, but Wendi Deng will certainly survive.", "tags": ["Wendi Deng", "Rupert Murdoch", "Media", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-08T22:02:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/09/brits-built-modern-world-foster-rogers", "sentences": ["On the one hand its achievements \u2013 the Pompidou Centre, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, the Eden Project \u2013 are magnificent and world-changing, the result of epic efforts of will and daring."], "title": "The Brits who built the modern world", "article": "There is always a dilemma in writing about the British tradition of architecture once called &quot;high-tech&quot;, whose best-known protagonists include Richard Rogers, Norman Foster and Nicholas Grimshaw. On the one hand its achievements \u2013 the Pompidou Centre, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, the Eden Project \u2013 are magnificent and world-changing, the result of epic efforts of will and daring. On the other hand its rhetoric can be head-bangingly simplistic and blatantly contradictory. Which, if it were only a problem of rhetoric, might not matter much, but it has physical effects in the real world. To be specific: in the 1970s, when the high-tech style was forged, much was made of its power to create flexible and adaptable structures, with roofs hung off wires so that floors could be unimpeded by columns, and panels and pipes on the exterior that could be switched around at will. There was only ever modest evidence that such strategies worked as claimed, and plenty of examples where they did not. Equally, its protagonists would claim to be problem-solving and practical, yet Foster&apos;s Hong Kong tower was reportedly the most expensive building in the world. At which point it had to be justified as a work of art, which is something other than practical.     Norman Foster, left, and Richard Rogers at Yale in 1962. Photograph: Stirk Harbour + Partners    So too with a claim to be accessible and democratic, repeatedly made for this kind of architecture. There is nothing accessible about the hermetic\u00a0glass ball that Foster designed for the mayor of London&apos;s headquarters, or the hyper-luxury, high-security flats that Richard Rogers designed at One Hyde Park. The Pompidou Centre was wonderfully accessible, but even its politics are more complicated than they seem. For all its radical look, its political purpose was to reinforce the conservative presidency of Georges Pompidou. The question arises again with a three-part BBC4 series and an RIBA exhibition, The Brits Who Built the Modern World, which argues that a group of 1930s-born men have been &quot;the most successful generation of architects Britain has ever produced&quot;. Exhibits A and B are Foster and Rogers, but there are also Grimshaw (the Eden Project and Waterloo Eurostar terminal), his former business partner Terry Farrell (the MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall) and Michael Hopkins, who once worked with Foster and later designed\u00a0the Mound stand at Lord&apos;s and the MPs&apos; office building, Portcullis House. All could at one time have been called high-tech, though Farrell would defect to the style&apos;s evil twin, postmodernism.            All were moved by the romance of technology, joined to a belief that architecture should enable, emancipate and engage. So Foster designed a facility for a shipping company in the London docks, where blue- and white-collar workers shared the same sophisticated spaces, while Grimshaw and Farrell designed a factory for furniture company Herman Miller, where external wall panels could be clipped on and off to suit changing needs. All, argues the TV series, were shaped by their times: the war, followed by austerity and all-round grimness, followed by the joyful release of the Festival of Britain, followed by a revolutionary explosion of possibilities in the 1960s. They shared a British, going-on patriotic view of machines and industry, whereby the inventive brilliance of a Spitfire could help save the world. It was a view crystallised after the war by the Eagle comic, in which the adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, coexisted with cutaway diagrams of how machines worked. Always in the background were the triumphs of Victorian engineers, the Crystal Palace and the great railway stations.     The 1976 Herman Miller factory in Bath designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Terry Farrell.  Photograph: John Donat and RIBA Library Photographs Collection     Even as this heritage was celebrated, British industry was turning to dust and the United States appeared as a gleaming mirage of possibility. Foster, Rogers and Farrell all studied there and described the experience as life-changing. The Californian Case Study houses, which were attempts to harness technology to making better homes, were a huge influence on all the\u00a0Britons and their works, including\u00a0the steel-and-glass house that Michael Hopkins and his wife, Patti, designed for themselves in Hampstead, north London. By the 70s, all these architects were designing definitive projects and were getting attention. They were given a stylistic label, &quot;high-tech&quot;, only to be then hit by the powerful and contradictory forces of the 1980s, embodied by the emblematic figures of Margaret Thatcher and Prince Charles. If Thatcher preached American-style opportunity and enterprise, the prince argued for extreme forms of architectural traditionalism. Rogers and Foster found their options limited at home, and it became a journalistic trope that Britain created great architects but that they had to go abroad to achieve their best projects.     The steel-and-glass house that Michael Hopkins and his wife, Patti, designed in Hampstead, north London. Photograph: Joe Low/ RIBA Library Photographs Collection    After 1990, the wheels of fashion and fame turned again, and it&apos;s hard to argue with the claim about this being the &quot;most successful generation&quot;. It can be measured in the very many hundreds of staff employed by these five architects, or in the airports, train stations, towers, parliaments, law courts, museums and masterplans that they have pumped out in the far east, the United States, Australia and Europe. The reasons for their success, to this degree, are not instantly obvious, although talent, ambition, risk-taking and high degrees of professional organisation all played their part. But the triumph of high-tech is also testament to the power of imagery in the contemporary world. These architects attracted print and broadcast media from early in their careers, and the very simpleness of their pronouncements became an asset. Their works offer the look of modernity and democracy, and symbolise freedom, progress and problem-solving at the same time that they are \u2013 sometimes but not always \u2013 achieving these things.

The self-help author from Melbourne represented himself in court and said that he was justified in robbing more than $140,000 from the bank because like Robin Hood, he gave the money to the homeless. He also claimed he committed the robbery to call attentions to problems with the banking system. It was not established if the proceeds of the crime were distributed to the needy. In sentencing a weeping Donaldson last year, the judge complimented him on his storytelling abilities.  Donaldson has already begun pitching his heist story in the hope of book and movie deals.

A friend was apartment hunting and \u2013 despite being employed, personable and trustworthy \u2013 was having a difficult time finding a place. After a few weeks, she was invited to a &quot;pre-showing&quot;, where landlords show the apartment to a select group of prospective tenants before having an open house. The apartment was perfect, if expensive: think hardwood floors, lots of light, high ceilings. She was smitten. As she was strolling through what she thought might become her new home, however, a man in hip clothes walked up to the landlord and said, &quot;I&apos;ll give you a year&apos;s rent, in advance&quot;. Needless to say, she did not get the unit. As I say, I was sceptical. Then I heard basically the same story again, from a completely different source, about a completely different apartment. Then I heard a version of it about a flat in London, another about a competitor bribing a rental agent in New York, and another about the strategy of the pre-listing offer, where deep-pocketed tenants make generous bids to the owners of buildings where workers are making major repairs, to secure places that may soon be available before other tenants can even see them. That&apos;s when I realised the truth of these stories is sort of irrelevant. The ruthless, rich renter stealing apartments from the professional middle class has clearly manifested an urban archetype for our day. Which makes perfect sense, because housing affordability is the urban crisis of our day. Here in the Bay Area, the median list price for a two-bedroom home in San Francisco is now more than $900,000 (\u00a3550,000). The median monthly rent for a similar home is over $3,000. If you can find either, that is: housing supply is so tight that bidding wars on real estate and multiple applicants for rentals are the norm. Of course, San Francisco merely provides one outrageous example of a truly global trend. With the next billion poor people making their way to the world&apos;s cities, a revival in middle-class cultural preferences for urban living and the booming wealth of global economic hubs, cities are straining at the seams. The demand for urban housing has far outstripped supply in cities around the world. And when lots more people compete for the same homes, prices soar. Scrambles for real estate are reality now from Shanghai to Sao Paulo. On a planet of cities, affordability is social justice. The hardships rising rents cause low-income people \u2013 the strained budgets, the overcrowding, the increased risk of homelessness and the pushing out of the urban poor into suburbs where their time and money is further taxed by longer commutes and more expensive transportation \u2013 undermine hardworking people&apos;s prospects and worsen income inequality, with serious consequences for all of us.     Cities have not been building enough new housing for generations. Photograph: Reuters    The debate about restoring affordability to our cities is often rancorous and out of date. Often we see the problem framed simply as a matter of regulating landlords or punishing developer greed. Renters&apos; rights, subsidies for the poor, price controls and the like can play a role in buffering the poor from the market. All, though, have also shown themselves to be seriously inadequate given the scale of the gulf between available housing and demand for homes. Public housing can&apos;t keep pace. Nor do schemes aimed at keeping people from moving to cities succeed, even when they&apos;re repressive and unjust. Indeed, we know the approaches that won&apos;t work: all of them, other than building a lot more housing. To make housing affordable again, we need to catch up to decades-worth of unmet demand, over the next few years. In many cities, this means goals measured in the tens of thousands of new homes; in the fastest-growing cities, it means hundreds of thousands. Build enough housing and (economists and experience both tell us) prices should at least stabilise. Want social justice? Build a lot more housing. In order to build that kind of housing we need efforts that are new not only in scale, but in approach. We can build some housing incrementally, without changing the skyline or cityscape, but not anything like enough. To produce enough homes to matter, fast enough, we&apos;re going to have to fundamentally alter parts of our cities. That, of course, demands a local government willing and able to plan and permit such widespread change. It also takes an array of homebuilders doing the actual work, often in more innovative and low-cost ways, like more collaborative housing, manufactured buildings and flexible living spaces. Most of all, it takes broader public insight into how large-scale development can improve our cities. That development can make cities better has not been a popular idea in recent decades. But there is a large new constituency for change, today: the young. Though the fact is often ignored in our debates, housing affordability is a generational issue. The people most disadvantaged by unaffordable housing are the young. In many cities, high costs and low-paying jobs mean that for young people renting a great apartment is a pipe dream, never mind owning a home. In that context, change doesn&apos;t look bad at all. More, young people tend to understand that new housing, well-built, can be a tremendous force for positive transformation. Built in sufficient amounts, new housing can check the rise in housing costs; but with good design, it can also help grow new people-centered streets, increase use of bikes and transit, and promote healthier and more active lives. Housing construction and more residents help the local economy and create far more jobs than subsidies for large corporations. More taxpayers help our cities balance their books though larger revenues and more efficient infrastructure. New housing is one of the few truly powerful tools citizens and local officials can actually make use of to improve our cities and the world. More housing can even help us meet the global climate crisis. We know that in compact and walkable communities, each person uses less energy (and thus emits less carbon dioxide) than a similar person in more spread-out areas. A planet of small ultra-rich cities and sprawling low-density slums will be a planet warming faster than a planet of dense, mixed-income, transit-friendly cities.     San Francisco is an outrageous example of a truly global trend \u2013 that competiton for housing has hit a critical level. Photograph: Patrick Batchelder /Alamy    Combine compact development on a large scale with a push for more sustainable urbanism, and we can see the outlines of cities that will work in the 21st century take form. We can enable low-consumption lives through better public services and sharing systems. We can convert excess roads and parking lots into great streets, green spaces and parks, making denser neighborhoods nicer to live in then they were before and more resilient to weather extremes. We can promote green building and more sustainable water and energy infrastructure, making rising prosperity even more ecologically frugal. We&apos;re only just glimpsing how much hope for the planet rests on getting cities right. Building cities defines the global economy already; building them better will define who succeeds and fails in the years ahead. It&apos;s not a zero-sum game. More people inventing ways to house everyone while improving our cities can mean better cities everywhere. We can create more widespread prosperity for everyone. To do that, we must have the courage to aim big, experiment, let people try new ideas, take creative risks; we must stop being so afraid that every change is a threat. Because in the real world, the biggest threat is no change at all. Alex Steffen writes about cities, sustainability and social innovation.

New Look&apos;s hesitation comes despite IPO fever among retailers with about 15 businesses considering a listing this year with a total valuation of about \u00a38bn. Convenience store chain McColl&apos;s and online kitchen appliances store AO have already announced their intention to seek a listing while the likes of Boohoo.com, Poundland at Pets at Home are expected to reveal their plans imminently. Kristiansen&apos;s comments came as New Look revealed that underlying sales growth had ebbed away in the last quarter, with sales at established stores up just 0.5% in the three months to 28 December in the UK amid unseasonably warm weather and heavy discounting across the high street. Total sales rose 5% to \u00a3452.1m boosted by a 50.3% surge online. The Dane insisted that New Look had taken market share from the likes of H&amp;M and Marks &amp; Spencer in the quarter as Parker coats and novelty jumpers sold well. Despite admiting that gross margins had slipped during the period Kristiansen insisted: &quot;It was as really robust performance. We&apos;ve taken more market share than we&apos;ve taken for a very long time.&quot; Amid tricky times in the UK, where Kristiansen said he expected the market to remain tough, New Look is striking out abroad while closing 15 stores a year at home reducing its portfolio from 580 to 500 outlets over time.

Pollution is a rising concern for China&apos;s stability-obsessed leaders, keen to douse potential unrest as affluent city dwellers turn against a growth-at-all-costs economic model that has tainted much of the country&apos;s air, water and soil. The report, by the Beijing-based Social Science Academic Press and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, ranked the Chinese capital second worst out of 40 global cities for its environmental conditions, official media reported on Thursday. Moscow was rated the least hospitable, based on factors such as cost of living and security, as well as pollution. While China&apos;s state media acknowledges that the smog is a serious problem, the report&apos;s language is unusually strong, and higher authorities may be attempting to blunt its impact. The Communist party mouthpiece, the People&apos;s Daily, put a positive twist on the findings, saying that its authors simply held Chinese cities to exceptionally high standards. China&apos;s smog has brought some Chinese cities to a near standstill, caused flight delays and forced schools to shut. Beijing was hit by severe levels of pollution at least once every week, according to the 2012 Blue Paper for World Cities report. That was on top of a significant level of air pollution covering the capital for 189 days in 2013, according to the city&apos;s Environmental Protection Bureau. Though China&apos;s record on pollution is patchy, the government said on Wednesday it would set up a 10bn yuan (\u00a3990m) fund to fight air pollution, offering rewards for companies that clean up operations. Overall the government has pledged to spend over 3tn yuan to tackle the problem, creating a growing market for companies that can help boost energy efficiency and lower emissions.

Since the pair, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov, posted a video of their ascent to Youtube on Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of viewers have learned two things about the tower: one, that it&apos;s the world&apos;s second tallest building, after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai; and two, that this makes it frighteningly, vertiginously tall. The 632-metre Shanghai Tower (the pair climbed a further 18 metres up a crane on its roof) has been under construction in Shanghai&apos;s Lujiazui district, a gleaming financial centre directly across from the city&apos;s famous Bund, since 2008. It&apos;s set for completion later this year. In the 1980s, Lujiazui was little more than a swath of grassy fields. Now it&apos;s a forest of skyscrapers. It&apos;s difficult to glean from the video, in which the two men sneak into a poorly lit building site and climb up unadorned concrete stairs, but the tower is designed to be a sort of urban Elysium, packed with luxury hotels, offices and retail space. A slideshow on the website of Gensler, the American architecture firm behind the project, shows illustrations of the finished product, its glass-and-steel shell twisting up towards the sky like a giant cannolo. Gensler calls the tower a &quot;super-highrise precinct&quot; \u2013 a series of individual neighbourhoods strewn over 142 vertically stacked acres, equivalent to nearly 80 football pitches. Each will surround a &quot;light-filled garden atrium&quot; designed, apparently, to &quot;foster community and support daily life&quot;. The building twists through 120 degrees from its base to its top, helping it withstand the city&apos;s notoriously strong winds. Its elevators are designed to move at nearly 40mph. Altogether, the stunt took the two men about 20 hours to complete, although the actual ascent took just two. They entered the tower under cover of dark, scaled the rooftop crane at daybreak, exchanged a high five \u2013 and then waited around for the light to improve, so they could best record the views down over the tops of the building&apos;s closest neighbours: the Jin Mao Tower and Shanghai World Financial Centre, rising above a thin cloud cover. The Shanghai Tower will be an amazing building, if Gensler&apos;s plans hold true.

In the Frankenstein-inspired 80s teen comedy Weird Science, two teenagers brought dream girl Kelly LeBrock to life by wiring a Barbie doll to a computer, while Electric Dreams placed an operating system named Edgar in the middle of a love triangle with a musical twist. Harrison Ford's Deckard didn't seem to know whether he was human or robotic as he fell in love with a replicant in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. And in Andrew Niccol's S1m0ne, a film director creates a supposedly compliant virtual movie star with whom the whole world promptly becomes infatuated, forcing him into a lifelong relationship that begets digital children. Meanwhile, over in the real world, plenty of people&nbsp;have engaged in flirty interactions with everything from their satnav (popular voice options include a Frenchman who tells you that you look fabulous as you take the next left) to their Siri (as per The Big Bang Theory), with both marriages and divorces resulting from the intimate interactions and infidelities of online avatars. \nWithin this evolving electronic ecosystem, the premise of Spike Jonze's self-penned modern romance seems like business as usual, as Joaquin Phoenix's soon-to-be divorcee finds unexpected happiness with an operating system (OS) tailor-made to put him at his ease.&nbsp;Phoenix plays Theodore Twombly, a twitchy, tortured soul hiding behind tortoiseshell spectacles who holds down a day job ghostwriting personalised (e-)letters for those unable to put their&nbsp;emotions into words. Faux intimacy is Theodore's stock in trade, yet he falls for the seductive skills of an electronic office organiser that reads him like a book \u2013 and offers unquestioning allegiance in the wake of his failed marriage to independently minded Catherine (Rooney Mara). One minute Theodore is having functional conversations with his OS about cleaning up his inbox; the next he's having the kind of cybersex that has proved the preferred method of interaction for isolated online lovers the world over. But, as Theodore grows&nbsp;in confidence, so too does the self-named Samantha, the infinite portals of the virtual world enabling her to become so much more than the sum of his parts. \n \n  \n \nAt its inception, Her partnered Phoenix with mercurial talent Samantha Morton who was on set every day, playing an off-screen Annie Hall to his Alvy Singer. It was only during the lengthy editing process that Jonze recast the object of Theodore's affection, with Scarlett Johansson stepping in as the voice of Samantha. Did something organic get lost in the process, somehow heightening the air of detachment? Perhaps that's the intention; after all, a wry satire about falling in love with your mobile phone shouldn't be expected to ooze human warmth. But, for all the breathy emoting (on both sides), there's little here to rival the bond that emerges, for example, between Frank Langella and his automated housemate in the underappreciated Robot &amp; Frank, meaning that Her runs the risk of becoming a little too arch for its own good. If only the movie came with a handy voice-change function that allowed us to hear what Morton's Samantha sounded like. What difference would that have made? \nAs he falls for Samantha, so Theodore withdraws from the world, an awkward encounter with Olivia Wilde's blind date (and a failure to put his arms around Amy Adams's unhappily married \"friend\") signifying how far he has drifted from human interaction. In the film's most toe-curling sequence, Samantha organises a sex surrogate whose physical presence is all kinds of wrong, suggesting that the last thing on earth Theodore wants is a human touch. Meanwhile, the system errors that once crashed Theodore's marriage begin to re-surface like a recurrent computer virus. \nHaving retreated into the life in the mind in Being John Malkovich and Where the Wild Things Are, Jonze finds himself entirely at home inside Theodore's head, where tragicomic riffs from the films of Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman (with whom Jonze appears to share a collective unconscious) drift like the erasable memories of Eternal Sunshine&nbsp;of the Spotless Mind: you half-expect Jim Carrey to pop up at the offices of BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com asking Theodore to explain eloquently&nbsp;to Kate Winslet that he hasn't really forgotten her at all. Yet Jonze's world view is altogether more brittle, a quality reflected in the clean lines and bold colours of the production design (retro-styled to interwar chic), which are beautifully captured and framed by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. \nVisually, Her is stunning, the contemporary vistas of Shanghai adding to the mesmerising portrait of near-future LA in which streets shimmer and shine, and people bathe in the light of hi-def screens and glowing personal appliances, each locked into their own virtual world. On the surface this is one of the best-looking pictures of the year. But in the battle between head and heart there remains a Tin Man-shaped hole, leaving the viewer smiling wryly at the thought-provoking conceits while remaining as emotionally isolated as the movie's protagonist. \nWhich is probably the point.", "tags": ["Drama", "Film", "Culture", "Spike Jonze", "Joaquin Phoenix", "Scarlett Johansson", "Amy Adams"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-16T00:05:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/feb/15/stella-mccartney-husband-hunter-boots-london-fashion-week", "sentences": ["His plans show Willis is thinking very big: Hunter will open its first store in London in July, with plans for others in New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai."], "title": "The boot's on the other foot as Stella McCartney's husband takes to the catwalk", "article": "When it comes to fashion shows, Alasdhair Willis&apos;s usual role is to provide a supportive presence on the front row for his wife, Stella McCartney. On Saturday, however, roles were reversed as the British wellington boot company Hunter showed its first runway collection at London fashion week. The show raised the curtain for a new era under creative director Willis, the former publishing director of design magazine Wallpaper. Although wellington boots were in the news for all the wrong reasons last week, Willis was at pains to avoid making links with the terrible weather. &quot;We would never want to profit from that, in any way,&quot; he said before the show. As McCartney looked on, models showed off vinyl capes, waxed jackets and dresses and mackintoshes in weatherproof materials. Colours ranged from primary brights to classic khaki, deep purples and metallics. Willis said the collection was inspired by extremes of exploration \u2013 by deep-sea diving and outer space, and by the pioneering spirit of the era in which Hunter was first established, as the North British Rubber Company, in 1856. The designs also took cues from the component parts of the wellington boots themselves, with details such as the &quot;moustache&quot; on the toe of the boot being echoed on shoulders and pockets of jackets. The most spectacular moment of the show came just before the finale, when magician Dynamo made a surprise appearance on the catwalk. First, he performed his Matrix move, leaning back on one leg until parallel with the floor. Next, eight of the models on stage were magically &quot;disappeared&quot; before being summoned back for one last walk, during which playing cards showered down on models and guests. Willis said that the Instagram-friendly spectacle was symbolic of his ambitions for Hunter: &quot;We are drawing on our heritage, but we are pioneering and forward-looking. The British heritage brands that are successful globally are not just stamping a union flag on clothing and trying to sell it to China \u2013 they are moving forward.&quot; Dynamo was a canny match in marketing terms, too: &quot;He is the most-followed magician in the world,&quot; said Willis, &quot;with a reach of six million on his social platforms.&quot; Though Hunter has been firmly on the fashion radar since Kate Moss wore a pair to Glastonbury in 2005 \u2013 a moment that many have identified as the starting point for the now omnipresent &quot;festival chic&quot; trend \u2013 it was only in 2012, when US private equity firm Searchlight bought a stake in the business, that taking the company global and diversifying beyond boots became a possibility. Searchlight hired Willis to lead this charge, and Willis restructured the company into two divisions: Hunter Original, the &quot;twentysomething, cooler, fashion-conscious&quot; line, with prices starting at \u00a385 for boots and \u00a3380 for rubber jackets, which were being shown on Saturday , and Hunter Field, a tech- and performance-focused line which will launch in spring/summer 2015. His plans show Willis is thinking very big: Hunter will open its first store in London in July, with plans for others in New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai.     The high heeled Hunter  Photograph: Ben A. Pruchnie/Getty Images    Overseeing a catwalk show is a huge challenge, as Willis&apos;s wife knows only too well. McCartney&apos;s best advice? &quot;Trust your instinct,&quot; said Wills, and also: &quot;Keep calm, don&apos;t get stressed \u2013 although I know what it&apos;s like, seeing it on the other side for 13 years. When you&apos;re at the centre of it the lead-up to the show is very difficult.&quot; The woman who made Hunter a household has not been forgotten, either \u2013 the collection includes a heeled wellington boot inspired by a certain Ms Moss. &quot;Kate told me that she would love to wear a heel to Glastonbury \u2013 especially this year, when it was so dry,&quot; said Willis: &quot;and this is the perfect wellington heel.&quot;", "tags": ["Stella McCartney", "London fashion week autumn/winter 2014", "London fashion week", "Fashion"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-16T00:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/feb/14/world-largest-concrete-pour-la-trucks-los-angeles", "sentences": ["Its skyline won&apos;t grow like Shanghai&apos;s or Dubai&apos;s, but it will continue to grow."], "title": "World's largest concrete pour: LA witnesses 'ballet of construction trucks'", "article": "     Hundreds of spectators lined the streets in downtown Los Angeles Saturday for what might seem a lacklustre event in a city known for its entertainment: a parade of trucks poured a load of concrete into a hole. But this was no ordinary hole. It&apos;s the site of the future Wilshire Grand, a 73-storey building filled with offices, retail and hotel rooms that will, when it opens in 2017, be the tallest building in the city, and the eighth tallest in the US. It&apos;s a building of such significance in the city that even the pouring of its foundation is a moment to celebrate. The project \u2013 a $1.1bn (\u00a3660m) investment \u2013 will be the first major skyscraper built in the city in more than 20 years. That&apos;s a time span that&apos;s seen the global footprint of cities expand dramatically. Hyperspeed development in places like China and the Middle East have turned practically empty land into instant city skylines boasting the tallest buildings in the world. Long an American pastime, building skyscrapers has become a global game \u2013 and LA has largely been out of it. So it is being welcomed with great pomp that LA is once again building tall. Walking down the middle of a closed road Saturday, the building&apos;s developer was joined by its architect and the city&apos;s mayor in leading a parade of dignitaries around the project&apos;s site. Accompanied by the University of Southern California&apos;s marching band and a pair of white and blue concrete trucks, the parade moved its way around the site as spectators and policemen took photos with their phones. The parade was the spectacle, but the real show was the pouring of the building&apos;s foundation, a banal yet in this case highly publicised procedure that will help ensure the 1,100ft tower can withstand the seismic and wind forces that will regularly test its structural integrity.     How the Wilshire Grand stacks up against some of the world's tallest buildings.    For reasons not purely promotional, the foundation&apos;s concrete was dumped into the hole in one continuous pour \u2013 21,200 cubic yards (16,200 cubic metres) of concrete dumped by 2,120 trucks over a 26-hour period, enough to earn the event a Guinness World Record. The continuous pour turned out to be the most economical way to fill the hole, according to Chris Martin, lead architect of the Wilshire Grand project, from LA-based firm AC Martin. But pouring this much concrete at once is no small task. From sourcing the concrete and materials, to closing the streets, to keeping the concrete cool enough to set, the procedure is indicative of the technical evolution of building massive buildings. &quot;You&apos;ve never seen anything like this,&quot; says Martin. &quot;I never have.&quot; The entire site covers three acres, but the tower&apos;s foundation takes up about a football field&apos;s worth of space. It was a 17ft 6in hole ringed by 50,000lb (22,700kg) steel starter columns, providing a sturdy base for the structural columns that will rise to the building&apos;s highest floors. After a series of speeches, a long line of trucks began pulling around the site, where the long, green arms of concrete pumping machines reached down from the street surface into the hole. At about a dozen stations, each truck took about 10 minutes to dump its 6,000lb load of concrete into the pumping machines before shuffling out and making way for another. Altogether they poured the equivalent of six and a half Olympic-size swimming pools full of concrete. It was a day-long relay that Martin called &quot;a ballet of concrete trucks&quot;. For about the next two weeks, more than 19 miles of plastic tubing will carry refrigerants through the mass, accelerating the cooling of the concrete&apos;s exothermic reactions enough for it to solidify. By then, the 17ft 6in thick foundation alone will weigh more than 90m lbs, the equivalent of four Eiffel Towers. Hyperbole and marching band theatrics aside, this project is more than just a fancy way to fill up a big hole. The foundation and its forthcoming tower are seen as an almost existentially important project for downtown Los Angeles, and the city as a whole. &quot;I think it has a potential to put LA on the map with respect to the world of tall buildings,&quot; says Daniel Safarik, of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a group that tracks the development of skyscrapers. &quot;Previously, LA was best known for blowing up tall buildings in movies, so you only had a few seconds to appreciate whatever architectural merits the US Bank Tower or the SunTrust Building had before it was destroyed by aliens or Bruce Willis.&quot; Historically, downtown LA was a capital for banks and oil companies. But in the early 1990s, banks began to merge together, consolidate offices or ditch the city for another state or country. &quot;It created this huge vacuum in class A office space,&quot; says Martin. The pressures and realities of the global market were manifest in empty office towers throughout downtown LA. It&apos;s been a slow rebound, and many in the city are hopeful that the Wilshire Grand is part of a new wave of investment downtown that will help the city compete internationally. Not that LA has been sitting stagnant. Thanks to an adaptive reuse ordinance that has allowed the conversion of old and underused office buildings into housing since 1999, the downtown area has seen a return to prominence in this multicentric city. A population of more than 50,000 people is turning the central business district into a round-the-clock neighbourhood. But downtown LA requires more than the loft spaces and coffee shops of a gentrifying residential neighbourhood.     How the Wilshire Grand will fit into the Los Angeles cityscape - according to an artist's impression.  Photograph: AC Martin    &quot;Cities are globally competing with each other,&quot; Safarik says. &quot;Regardless of their use, skyscrapers are seen as communicating the economic prominence of a city, and depending how big the country is, even the whole country. They&apos;re seen as a symbol of that place on the global stage. That&apos;s why it&apos;s gotten increasingly important for cities to build them.&quot; The US was the birthplace of the skyscraper. Built in 1884, the 10-storey Home Insurance Building in Chicago is widely recognised as the world&apos;s first, owing to the innovative use of structural steel to frame the building. Despite a rich history of American skyscrapers \u2013 from New York&apos;s art deco-topped Chrysler Building to the former tallest building in the country, Chicago&apos;s Willis Tower, to the now-tallest 1,776ft One World Trade Centre, which recently topped out in lower Manhattan \u2013 the US has been overshadowed in recent decades by other countries, especially in Asia. Large economic and political differences mean that American cities are highly unlikely to go on a building binge of Chinese proportions, but they&apos;re also unlikely to stop building altogether. The Wilshire Grand is one example; downtown Manhattan offers many others. Even the long-sidelined, 150-storey Chicago Spire project has shown signs of waking from its slumber in the midwest. For Los Angeles, the Wilshire Grand is proof that the city still has the cachet to go big. Yet it is also true that the developer investing the $1.1bn to build this tower is not from LA, nor even the US. The company behind the project is the South Korean shipping and airline giant, the Hanjin Group. But this is not a slur on LA; rather, it is proof the city is still able to compete in the increasingly competitive global market, according to Qingyun Ma, an architect and dean of the USC School of Architecture, who has worked on some of the tallest buildings now standing in many Asian cities. &quot;LA has always been a platform for global interest and for global ambition,&quot; Ma says. &quot;My personal take is that this tower will cause a lot more ambition globally to come to LA, not only to downtown but to many places to build taller buildings.&quot; He is hopeful that a denser, more urbanistic city will result \u2013 but knows it will take time. Martin, too, suggests the city will have to be patient. Its skyline won&apos;t grow like Shanghai&apos;s or Dubai&apos;s, but it will continue to grow. &quot;I remember in &apos;92 when we said we&apos;re not going to build any tall buildings for a long time,&quot; he says. &quot;At the time I was thinking 20 years \u2013 and we&apos;re kind of on track for that.&quot; Nate Berg is a Los Angeles-based journalist who covers cities, design and technology.

English friends had explained to me, not without pride, the importance of grumbling to the national character, but I still want to stress to every Londoner I meet that \u2014 take it from a visiting Los Angeleno \u2014 the tube exists, and that counts as no trifling achievement. Beyond that, and like every other means of urban transport system around the world, it tells you nearly everything you need to know about the city it serves. If you wish to understand London or any place else, look no further than how people move through it. This goes not just for subways, but overground trains, buses, cycleways, rickshaws, and every mobility solution in between. You can learn a great deal from robust transport systems, and even more from underdeveloped ones. This line of thinking never occurred to me in my years growing up just outside Seattle, a city which I frequented but never gave much thought. Seattle&apos;s &quot;retro-futuristic&quot; image has, for the past half century, rested in large part on a pair of structures built for its 1962 World&apos;s Fair: the globally recognisable Space Needle, and the lesser-known but still sadly evocative monorail. While neither offer much of everyday value to the locals, the monorail \u2013 which takes the form but, in running back and forth on only a mile of track, not the function of a dedicated public transit system \u2013 stands as a reminder of the city&apos;s many frustrated attempts at complete urbanisation. Proposals for a useful monorail network have risen and fallen over the years; the first light rail line there opened only in 2009. The surprisingly backward state of Seattle transport tells a story familiar to many American cities: an aesthetically bold, forward-looking optimism in the years after the second world war, followed by decades of bitter struggle with its own demanding suburbs, home in this case to the mighty or once-mighty likes of Boeing and Microsoft. Amazon&apos;s recent relocation of its offices to downtown Seattle bodes well for the life of the city proper, but it still has no end of catching up to do with the metropolises of Europe, Asia and Latin America, where high densities of transit not only exist, but make statements about the cities that built them. Often the style of a city&apos;s transport reflects how that city sees itself, or would like to. The still-gleaming Santiago metro opened in 1975 as a declaration of Chile&apos;s emergence, real or desired, from provincial isolation. With improvements that have turned it over the past 25 years into South America&apos;s most extensive subway, it also announces the country&apos;s escape from dictatorship. &quot;Make sure you ride the metro,&quot; Santiaguinos abroad would insist to me upon hearing of my plans to visit their city.     Despite the grumbles from its passengers, the tube functions as London's main arteries. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters    Few outside Chile know the high quality of Santiago&apos;s transport, but everyone knows the high quality of Tokyo&apos;s. Before making my first trip to Japan, I prepared myself for astonishment at the functionality of its trains. I also prepared myself for the white-gloved hands of the oshiya, or &quot;pushers&quot; \u2013 station workers employed to cram as many rush-hour commuters as possible behind a subway car&apos;s closing doors. In the event, though I never felt the touch of the oshiya, I was impressed not just at the perfectly punctual, all-reaching trains, but the way riders regard them not as objects of great municipal and national pride, but as expected necessities. Japanese major cities, more than any others of my acquaintance, run on expectations \u2013 a constant stream of them, routinely fulfilled to the slightest detail. If the schedule says the bus will show up at 8:31, a Kyoto-based English friend told me, people start looking at their watches at 8:32. Even in Osaka, Japan&apos;s comparatively Falstaffian second city, reputedly characterised by rustic straightforwardness and saturated with vulgar capitalist energy, the trains (on which I never saw anyone drink, eat, or speak into a mobile phone) adhere to a standard of regularity no less rigorous than Tokyo&apos;s. Korea, with less time to develop than Japan and more development to do, has given rise in Seoul to a city that appears to have only just been torn out of its packaging. None of its 50 tallest towers have stood for even 30 years, and most of the Seoul metropolitan subway that takes you between them entered service more recently than that. The longest (and busiest, and most station-equipped) such system in the world has developed into not just a means of getting efficiently from Apgujeong to Bokjeong, but a showcase of the spirit that turned a city in shambles in the 1960s into a vision even the most space age-minded American of that era wouldn&apos;t have entertained. But for everyone who sees the future in Seoul or Tokyo, many more see it, with hope or regret, in Shanghai. The astonishing speed with which infrastructure has sprouted in the Chinese city inspires contradictory feelings in those of us based in slower-growing cities: envy that our governments can&apos;t build whole rapid transit systems in a matter of years, tempered by relief that they lack the authority necessary to do so. Ride a train in a Chinese metropolis and, by all accounts, you experience the idea of cities as massive logistical problems; object lessons that even the ambition and resources that China commands can&apos;t alone solve them. Los Angeles attained its vast size and bizarre shape due to the growth of its first, early 20th-century, pre-population-boom rail system, the formidable &quot;red cars&quot; and &quot;yellow cars&quot; of the Pacific Electric and Los Angeles Railroads. But the sweeping eight-lane freeways that replaced them after the war still monumentalise the freedom of speed and impulsive mobility \u2013 at least when you drive on them in the middle of the night.     A jeepney in Manila: US military 4x4s left over from world war II have been converted, often flamboyantly, into the most popular form of transport in the city. Photograph: Thom Lang/Corbis    One of its components actually began in 1900 as a six-mile bicycle highway, an innovation that sounds more suited to modern Copenhagen than to LA in any era. Because the Danish capital has spent the past half-century encouraging cycling as a primary means of transport, you&apos;ll learn far less about the city on its limited, expensive subway than you will on its wide, traffic-separated bicycle lanes, observing the cross-section of the population that pedals all around you. Of all Copenhagen&apos;s sights, none blows American minds more than that of one of the city&apos;s many girls in skirt and spike heels, cigarette in one hand, mobile phone in the other \u2014 sitting on, of all things, a bicycle. As it has elevated &quot;hygge&quot; (cosiness) into a way of life, Copenhagen has elevated the humble bicycle into a cultural icon, a pillar of its image. London has done the same with black taxis and doubledecker buses \u2013 not to mention &quot;mind the gap&quot; as a take-away phrase for tourists, expats and students. But while New York&apos;s cabs exude a trademark rough-edged urbanity, American cities don&apos;t usually represent themselves with elements of transit \u2013 apart, that is, from the classic yellow school bus. Regular American city buses are typically maligned, due to the supposed poverty of their riders. This gearing of public transport toward the socioeconomic margins, especially margins seen as isolated from or in conflict with the majority, impedes popularity and thus implementation; dedicating a bus lane in Los Angeles has proven a task comparable to the labours of Hercules. The bicycle in America has only just begun to escape similar associations. Most designations of bike-friendliness have gone not to proper cities but college towns: Davis, Boulder, Long Beach, Iowa City \u2013 places that, while pleasant enough, command little national, let alone international import. Modest Portland, Oregon, the US city in which I most enjoy cycling, feels like a Tokyo or Seoul by comparison. Yet despite its reputation as a paradise for alternative transport, I always notice suspiciously few normally clothed riders on the road there with me. Ride a bike in any of America&apos;s supposedly top cities to do so, and you come to know the still-strong American genius for branding, as opposed to the faltering American genius for execution. When Los Angeles laid down its first high-profile cycle lane, the rain washed it mostly away within months. Even as a city&apos;s forms of transport empower us, they limit us, reducing us to a narrow set of obsessions: New Yorkers&apos; compulsive but futile questions about when the train will come; Angelenos&apos; sad, Sisyphean quest for free parking; Copenhageners&apos; budgeting for their next bicycle when their current one inevitably gets stolen; Londoners&apos; ceaseless insistence that the whole of their infrastructure lies more or less in ruins. Yet they can also make manifest the human ingenuity that makes such improbable accretions as cities work in the first place. A Filipino friend once described Manila to me as a transport enthusiast&apos;s paradise, albeit one made up of many thousands of small, barely-maintained units. Anyone who boards a &quot;jeepney&quot; (a US Army jeep, flamboyantly converted for public transportation) there gains insight into the culture of repurposing and improvisation that keeps the city chugging along, whichever natural, political, or infrastructural disasters may come. You get the same sense from a ride on one of Mexico City&apos;s green &quot;pesero&quot; microbuses \u2013 icons, too, in their way \u2013 which pick up and drop off passengers where required, rather than on a set route.     A rare quiet moment on LA's freeway system. Photograph: Eye Ubiquitous/Rex    Certain developing cities have drawn the eyes of the rest of the urban world with their transport alone: Curitiba in Brazil, made its name by pioneering bus-based rapid transit, a form of which, over in the Colombian capital, Bogot\u00e1, has also made a hearty go. Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, Bogot\u00e1&apos;s former mayor, has proven eminently quotable on the matter of transport as a reflection of metropolitan character and building the means of transport as a way of defining that character. &quot;An advanced city,&quot; he has proclaimed, &quot;is not a place where the poor move about in cars; rather, it&apos;s where even the rich use public transportation.&quot; This goes a fair way to explaining the seething frustrations of many American cities, composed in large part of poor people in cars, made ever poorer by their associated costs. Pe\u00f1alosa has also spoken of our &quot;need to walk, just as birds need to fly&quot;, suggesting a city&apos;s need for &quot;pedestrian infrastructure shows respect for human dignity&quot;. And indeed, you can learn as much about a city from observing how people walk in it as how they ride, cycle, and drive. I did so in London, whose citizens cross the street any time they please, regardless of what the traffic signal says. Me and my Los Angeles compatriots remain, alas, too cowed by the pricey threat of jaywalking tickets, the monstrously aggressive (and in my experience mythical) spectre of the &quot;LA driver&quot;, and the sheer width of the roads to do the same. We can learn from London, I told myself, and the thought cheered me. It had to, as I&apos;d wound up stranded by the tube strike, an illuminating transport phenomenon which had me revising my opinions about the city all over again. We can learn from London, yes, but let&apos;s not learn everything from it.", "tags": ["City transport", "Cities", "Urbanisation"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-17T10:02:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/18/maths-more-pointless-than-latin-british-pupils-china", "sentences": ["For a start, the Chinese figures are not for China at all, but just booming Shanghai."], "title": "For Britain's pupils, maths is even more pointless than Latin | Simon Jenkins", "article": "There are lies, damned lies and statistics, but worse still are maths statistics. They send people mad. Elizabeth Truss, the education minister, sets off next week to see why Chinese pupils are so good at maths: indeed, why even working-class Chinese pupils are better than middle-class British ones. She and her boss, Michael Gove, believe the future of the British economy rests on her findings. Truss&apos;s trip, with loyal headteachers in tow, makes The Hunting of the Snark look like sanity. David Cameron and his colleagues are infatuated with anything to do with China. Now it is education. It so happens that in 2010 researchers from the London Institute of Education reported that Chinese school performance had nothing to do with China. Even in Britain, &quot;Chinese pupils from families in routine and manual jobs perform better than white pupils from managerial and professional backgrounds.&quot; It is maths that has the mesmeric appeal. To Gove and Truss it is virtually a state religion. Captains of industry, titans of science, politicians of all parties, they all take up the cry, declaring maths to hold the secret of the universe. Stuff the little blighters full of maths, they demand, and Britain will again rule the world. Square the hypotenuse, and Johnny Taliban will beg for mercy. The appeal of school maths to control-minded politicians is obvious: it is easy to test, and thus to measure, unlike vague, slippery humanities. British governments, gripped in the vice of targets, crave quantification. They have thus made what is measurable important, rather than what is important measurable. They are Gradgrind&apos;s useful idiots. How else could they credit the OECD&apos;s rubbishy but much publicised Pisa tables, which put China &quot;top&quot; in maths in 2012? For a start, the Chinese figures are not for China at all, but just booming Shanghai. The other top maths countries were also de facto city states, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, shorn of their poorer hinterlands. Truss might as well compare rural China with the cities of London and Westminster. These global surveys are notoriously unreliable. Barely 15% separates the top 25 Pisa states, meaning that sampling discrepancies can move countries wildly up and down. The Cambridge statistician David Spiegelhalter is splendidly dismissive: &quot;The imputation of plausible values, based on an over-simplistic model and assuming the &apos;difficulties&apos; are fixed known quantities, will underestimate, to an unknown extent, the appropriate uncertainty in the scores and rankings.&quot; I could not put it better. The maths cult is relentless. The Institute for Fiscal Studies claims that maths achievers &quot;earn 7% more at 30&quot; than others. It does not ask if people who earn more just happen to have been good at maths. Truss too is obsessed. Shortly before the crash in 2008, she wrote that Britain&apos;s &quot;world-class mathematicians have aided its ascension as one of the financial capitals of the world&quot;. They had elevated British financiers from mere bank lenders to &quot;masters of the universe&quot; through their brilliant derivatives modelling and trading. We needed more of them, she pleaded. In that case, I assume it was being too good at maths that cost Britain the worst recession and the deepest misery since the second world war. I learned maths. I found it tough and enjoyable. Algebra, trigonometry, differential calculus, logarithms and primes held no mystery, but they were even more pointless than Latin and Greek. Only a handful of my contemporaries went on to use maths afterwards. Our teacher told us it was for &quot;mind training&quot;, the last cry of the desperate pedagogue. Hence my delight on reading the words of the great mathematician GH Hardy, that his subject &quot;must be justified as art if it can be justified at all&quot;. I know of no proof of a causal link between maths and national success or happiness. The fact that countries that do badly in Pisa league tables, such as America, Britain and Germany, are neither poor nor specially wretched ought to make statisticians at least pause. Of course children need to be taught the rudiments of number, proportion and probability, as they do to read and write. But there are few occupations that need maths at the level I studied, and they can learn it as a language skill. I firmly believe all the maths most people use can be found in John Allen Paulos&apos;s short classic, Innumeracy. It damns alike those who boast &quot;I was never any good at maths&quot;, and those who teach it so badly that millions loathe it. Government manpower planning rarely works. Margaret Thatcher&apos;s government declared that Britain needed more mathematicians and scientists. Universities were starved of money for arts and given double grants for science. Teacher salaries were loaded against humanities. John Major and Tony Blair took up the cry. The BBC went on to broadcast hours of Brian Cox and friends, showing science with a sense of humour, cool clothes and better sex. It was a total failure. Young people voted with their feet for the arts \u2013 while the economy boomed. If British schools are to be slaves to Gove&apos;s economic dogma, they should be turning out accountants, lawyers, administrators and salespeople. That is where the money is. Britain needs literate and presentable young people, sensitive to culture and the world around them, skilled in health, entertainment, finance, the law and citizenship. The truth is that Gove, like most of Cameron&apos;s ministers, is an old socialist planner at heart. Nobody has a clue what ought to be taught in schools. Britain&apos;s curriculum, like its teaching methods and school year, is stuck in Tom Brown&apos;s Schooldays. Confused education ministers default to &quot;What was good enough for me is good enough for them&quot;. We should all go back to rote. I once visited Chinese schools; they were like communist drill halls, factories of pressure, discipline and childhood misery. The ultimate ambition for China&apos;s top mathematicians is to flee to America&apos;s Silicon Valley, where I gather they are packing their children into progressive Steiner Waldorf schools \u2013 as far from Gove&apos;s dirigisme as could be imagined. The wisest comment on all this comes from South Korea&apos;s former education minister, Prof JuHo Lee. Looking at the highest youth suicide rate in the world, he declares that &quot;test scores may be important in the age of industrialisation&quot;, but that was over. Schools should turn their attention to &quot;creativity and social and emotional capacities&quot;. Britain is out of date. The maths lobby&apos;s bluff should be called.

At 3.45pm on Friday, 11-year-old Zou Tingting, five minutes late, bounded through the school&apos;s west gate and into her waiting mother&apos;s arms. Tingting&apos;s classes were over, but her day was just beginning \u2013 she had an hour of homework, plus lessons in ping pong, swimming, art, calligraphy and piano. Tingting&apos;s mother, Huang Chunhua, said that, like many Chinese mothers, she once considered Tingting&apos;s academic performance her top priority; now she realises the importance of a well-rounded education. &quot;I&apos;ve seen British curricular materials, and I&apos;m actually kind of jealous,&quot; she said. &quot;British teachers guide students to discover things on their own \u2013 they don&apos;t just feed them the answers, like in China.&quot; In recent weeks British parents and educators have been in a panic about the discrepancy between the Chinese education system and the UK&apos;s. In December the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released the 2012 results for its triennial Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) test \u2013 a reading, maths and science examination administered to half a million 15-year-olds in 65 countries. Shanghai students topped the rankings; the UK ranked 26th. Next week education minister Elizabeth Truss will lead a &quot;fact-finding mission&quot; to Shanghai to learn the secrets of China&apos;s success. She plans to adjust the UK&apos;s education policy accordingly. Yet Chinese parents and educators see their own system as corrupt, dehumanising, pressurised and unfair. In fact, many are looking to the west for answers. Huang said that some parents bribe Shijia primary school to admit their children (though she declined to say whether she had done so herself). Tingting attends an expensive cramming school at weekends, leaving her tired. She will probably have to abandon extracurricular activities in high school to devote more time to the college admission exam, called the gaokao. Many parents consider the gruelling nine-hour test a sorting mechanism that will determine the trajectory of their children&apos;s lives. Chinese experts are also less impressed than Truss by the Pisa scores. &quot;Even though Shanghai students scored well on the test, this doesn&apos;t mean that Shanghai&apos;s education system doesn&apos;t have any problems,&quot; said Lao Kaisheng, a professor in the education department of Beijing Normal University. &quot;In fact, it&apos;s the opposite.&quot; As long as China&apos;s education system remains vast but resource-constrained, Lao added, its schools will default to testing as a reliable indicator of competence. &quot;The education system here puts a heavy emphasis on rote memorisation, which is great for students&apos; test-taking ability but not for their problem-solving and leadership abilities or their interpersonal skills,&quot; he said. &quot;Chinese schools just ignore these things.&quot; According to an analysis of the rankings, the children of Shanghai&apos;s cleaners and caterers are three years more advanced than UK lawyers&apos; and doctors&apos; children in maths. Yet the figures are an unreliable measure of equality. Although Shanghai&apos;s 23 million people make up less than 2% of China&apos;s population, its per capita GDP is more than double the national average; its college enrolment rate is four times as high. Furthermore, nearly half of Shanghai&apos;s school-age children belong to migrant families and were effectively barred from taking the test: because of China&apos;s residence registration system, these students are forced to attend high school in their home provinces, where schools are often debilitatingly understaffed. Although students from 12 provinces took the test in 2009, the government only shared Shanghai&apos;s scores. &quot;The OECD has not disclosed if other Chinese provinces secretly took part in the 2012 assessment. Nor have Pisa officials disclosed who selected the provinces that participated,&quot; wrote Tom Loveless, an education expert at Harvard University, on a Brookings Institute blog. &quot;There is a lack of transparency surrounding Pisa&apos;s relationship with China.&quot; Wang Peng, a teacher in Wuhu, a city in Anhui province, said that his school&apos;s average class size is significantly larger than most in Shanghai, and that it cannot compete in terms of financial strength. Wang said he makes about \u00a3300 a month; teachers in big cities make twice as much. &quot;As far as education methods go, there&apos;s not a huge difference [between Wuhu and Shanghai],&quot; he said. &quot;But the general educational environment, and the opportunities that students receive \u2013 those are really different.&quot; Occasionally, reminders of the system&apos;s ruthlessness cause soul-searching. In 2012, pictures of a classroom of Chinese high-school students hooked up to intravenous amino acid drips while studying for the gaokao went viral on social media. Last May two teenagers in Jiangsu killed themselves after &quot;failing to complete homework&quot;, according to state media. In 2012, a student emerged from the exam to learn that his mother had died in a car crash 12 days prior; the school and his relatives conspired not to tell him so as to not distract him. Authorities recognise the problem. Last June the government issued guidelines urging schools to focus on students&apos; &quot;moral development&quot;, &quot;citizenship&quot; and &quot;ambition&quot; rather than their test scores. Yet solutions remain elusive. One recently retired teacher at a Beijing middle school said she earns extra money by teaching an after-school cramming course called maths olympiad. The programme was designed as an advanced exercise for outstanding maths students. In the late 1990s Beijing authorities barred grade schools from setting entrance exams, and some simply adopted maths olympiad scores as a substitute. Parents began to see the course as required, even if their children were uninterested or under-qualified. Although the education ministry has repeatedly cracked down on maths olympiad instruction, schools maintain the programme under different names, state media reported in 2012. Enrolment figures remain high. &quot;When maths olympiad first started, it had the right idea \u2013 it was a programme for students who were really interested,&quot; said the teacher, who requested anonymity because of the course&apos;s controversial profile. &quot;There are a lot of kids without the ability who go to study this stuff, and it consumes their weekends, and their winter and summer vacations. &quot;These students aren&apos;t developing in a healthy way. This shouldn&apos;t be allowed to happen.&quot;", "tags": ["China", "Education", "Education policy", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Politics", "Liz Truss"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-22T15:58:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/22/didier-drogba-galatasaray-chelsea-champions-league", "sentences": ["Shanghai is a long way from the Uefa Champions League both geographically and competitively, which is why Didier Drogba finds himself in Turkey and how it has come about that he lines up for Galatasaray against Chelsea in Istanbul this week.", "This season, thanks to his and Wesley Sneijder&apos;s presence and the club&apos;s success in reaching the Champions League, Galatasaray managed to sell more than 47,000 season tickets, a Turkish record.&quot; Drogba opted for Istanbul midway through last season when, with things not going according to plan at Shanghai Shenhua, he realised he could have another shot at the Champions League."], "title": "Galatasaray's Didier Drogba trains Champions League sights on Chelsea", "article": "Shanghai is a long way from the Uefa Champions League both geographically and competitively, which is why Didier Drogba finds himself in Turkey and how it has come about that he lines up for Galatasaray against Chelsea in Istanbul this week. Time is no longer on the striker&apos;s side. He will have turned 36 by the time the return leg at Stamford Bridge takes place next month and, though a move back to Chelsea in a playing capacity was briefly mooted last year, new reports linking him with various MLS clubs appear to make more sense. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, satisfied that Chelsea saw the best of the Ivorian first time round, is already preparing a royal welcome. &quot;The Turkish champions with King Didier is the draw we would have asked for,&quot; the Chelsea manager said. &quot;When he comes back to this club he deserves a reception better than mine.&quot; Drogba will probably get one too, for few players over the course of Premier League history have been as widely appreciated. There may have been better players and more successful individuals and Drogba&apos;s penchant for exaggerating contact in search of a penalty or free-kick made him a villain in the eyes of many, though even the most joyless purist would have to admit he made an entertainingly theatrical villain. At his best he was a handful the best defences struggled to contain, at his worst, whether being knocked down with a feather by Jens Lehmann or stupidly slapping Nemanja Vidic to earn dismissal in extra-time in the Luzhniki Stadium in 2008 - thereby obliging John Terry to step up for the fateful penalty kick that could have decided the Champions League final in Chelsea&apos;s favour \u2013 he was always good box-office. Drogba eventually atoned for the latter error with his final act in a Chelsea shirt, tucking away the last penalty to secure the club&apos;s first Champions League trophy against Bayern Munich two years ago. The performance earned him the official man-of-the-match award and a permanent place in Chelsea history, though given that the Moscow final could have gone either way, and that Chelsea under Guus Hiddink were positively itching to have a go at Manchester United in Rome the year they were scandalously denied by Tom Henning Ovrebo at the semi-final stage, Drogba&apos;s time in England could almost be viewed as under-rewarded \u2013 particulary as he missed out on a Champions League final at the end of his first season in this country only by virtue of Luis Garc\u00eda&apos;s infamous phantom goal at Anfield. Under-recognised, however, he was not. When Blackpool achieved their unlikely promotion to the Premier League in 2010 one of the hundreds of fans interviewed for local television vox-pops stated categorically that what she was most looking forward to was seeing Drogba: &quot;Here on this pitch.&quot; The effect seems to have been more or less the same in Turkey. &quot;He has been a big hit with the Galatasaray fans,&quot; said Alp Ulagay, a football writer for the H\u00fcrriyet paper. &quot;He is probably the biggest name recruited by a Turkish club. We have had Nicolas Anelka, Roberto Carlos, Gheorghe Hagi and others but Drogba is the most famous and charismatic. This season, thanks to his and Wesley Sneijder&apos;s presence and the club&apos;s success in reaching the Champions League, Galatasaray managed to sell more than 47,000 season tickets, a Turkish record.&quot; Drogba opted for Istanbul midway through last season when, with things not going according to plan at Shanghai Shenhua, he realised he could have another shot at the Champions League. He scored eight goals in 11 games for the Chinese club, impressing observers with his work-rate and determination to succeed \u2013 in contrast to Anelka, who left his new audience in no doubt why he earned the nickname Le Sulk \u2013 but the pair had basically joined a club in the middle of an ownership dispute that had little prospect of paying the wages that had been promised. Once Fifa ratified his disputed move back to Europe Drogba&apos;s goals and assists helped Galatasaray clinch the title last season and, though his tally at the moment stands at a respectable 18 goals in 46 matches, fault lines are beginning to appear. While Drogba was the key man during the group stage of the Champions League campaign, especially impressive in the two performances against Juventus that helped Galatasaray qualify at the Italians&apos; expense despite a mauling at the hands of Real Madrid in their opening game, he has not been anywhere near as good since. He has scored only twice in his last 10 games and has been particularly ineffective, a bit like Galatasaray themselves, in away games. &quot;Drogba can sometimes appear arrogant with referees and rival players,&quot; Ulagay said. &quot;He keeps himself very private, doesn&apos;t say much, but you have the impression he might think himself above this league or at least some of the matches he has to play. He seems to save his best for the Champions League.&quot; If Drogba saves his best for the two games against Chelsea there are unlikely to be too many complaints from either side, though his immediate task is to rebuild bridges on the home front. Playing at Antalyaspor last week Drogba was visibly annoyed at being substituted by Roberto Mancini before the end of a 2-2 draw \u2013 dropping two points away to a side close to the bottom of the table is symptomatic of Galatasaray&apos;s current form and explains why they are six points behind the leaders Fenerbahce \u2013 and made no secret of his displeasure, pointedly refusing to shake the hand of the assistant coach, Tugay Kerimoglu, formerly of Blackburn, as he left the field. If he is offered a contract renewal it is likely to be for one more year. Drogba would prefer two but that might not happen, hence the suggestions, no more than rumours at the moment, that he could seek a final payday in the United States. He has his Foundation to think of after all \u2013 Drogba sponsors hospitals and schools in his native Ivory Coast \u2013 and America would undoubtedly love him even if that stage might seem small after shifting 47,000 season tickets in Istanbul. For the time being the Champions League stage beckons for perhaps the last time and, whether or not he is picking his matches, one would not bet against the big fella showing he still has one or two big games left in him.", "tags": ["Didier Drogba", "Chelsea", "Galatasaray", "Champions League", "Football", "European club football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-22T22:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/23/maths-teaching-revolution-needed-conrad-wolfram", "sentences": ["The problem is not the difference between Britain and Shanghai \u2013 which education minister Elizabeth Truss visited on a fact-finding mission last week \u2013 but the worldwide difference between maths in education and maths in the real world: everywhere, we are teaching largely the wrong maths."], "title": "The UK needs a revolution in the way maths is taught. Here's why\u2026", "article": "Reading the headlines of outrage after international school maths tests showed Britain lagging far behind Asian countries, you might conclude that our children are bad at maths. But is this the case? Even if the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests decently reflect today&apos;s maths standards, I believe that simply trying to climb up the table is wrong. The problem is not the difference between Britain and Shanghai \u2013 which education minister Elizabeth Truss visited on a fact-finding mission last week \u2013 but the worldwide difference between maths in education and maths in the real world: everywhere, we are teaching largely the wrong maths. Here&apos;s why. In the real world we use computers for calculating, almost universally; in education we use people for calculating, almost universally. This growing chasm is a key reason why maths is so despised in education and yet so powerful and important in real life. We have confused rigour at hand-calculating with rigour for the wider problem-solving subject of maths \u2013 the necessary hand mechanics of past moments with the enduring essence of maths. At its heart, maths is the world&apos;s most successful system of problem solving. The point is to take real things we want to work out and apply, or invent, maths to get the answer. One example involves four steps: define the question, translate it to mathematical formulation of that question, calculate or compute the answer in maths-speak and then translate it back to answer your original question, verifying that it really does. The central change in real-world maths of the last 50 or so years is that we automated the hell out of calculating. Computers now do a fantastically better job than people \u2013 even well-trained ones \u2013 in almost all cases. An example I like to give is to pick up my iPhone, activate its Siri voice recognition and say: &quot;Solve x cubed plus 2x plus one equals zero.&quot; With any luck, back comes the answer \u2013 the three solutions, presented with graphs and formulas. This is a cubic which, except in special cases, even further maths A-level students don&apos;t get to. In schools most of us learn the formula for solving a quadratic equation, but not a cubic. You must seriously question why we are spending years of our students&apos; lives failing to be able to compute what my phone did in seconds. Instead, they should be grappling with real problems and applying maths to them. Defining questions and abstracting them to maths are crucial steps that Britain&apos;s (and other countries&apos;) schools spend woefully little time on, because students laboriously practise obsolete hand calculating skills. Worse, the curriculum forces the use of toy problems. Real problems tend to be harder and messier, but it&apos;s possible to handle such problems only if computers do the calculating. Indeed, it&apos;s the mechanisation of calculating that&apos;s powered maths to be applicable to so wide a swath of society. From medicine to mobile phones to finance, to the very computing technology that drives it, maths has become usable and useful because we&apos;ve mechanised computing answers so successfully. One of the scariest aspects of maths for many students is how disconnected from anything in their lives it seems to be. After my 2010 TED talk on the subject, a huge number commented to the effect: &quot;This is the first person who&apos;s explained why any of the maths I learnt at school has any relevance to my life.&quot; What a waste of human endeavour when the world&apos;s population is spending 20,000 student lifetimes a year learning hand-calculating. Why would they use an equation, what problem would they be solving with it and how do they set it up? Even when our current system tries to give a context for maths, the problems are contrived so they&apos;re solvable with weak hand-calculating techniques, so that everyone can see that they are not useful in real life. In real life the problem leads, and if the computation is messy and complex that&apos;s OK, the computer will probably cope. By removing the computer from maths education you remove most of the real context. Just to be clear. I&apos;m talking about using the computer for doing the computation and changing the subject-matter \u2013 which I call computer-based maths \u2013 not for replacing the teacher or changing the delivery of the existing content. Of course, we should modernise our delivery too, but however well we deliver the wrong subject it won&apos;t make it right. The real world should be your guide: no one seriously claims computers have made real-world maths less conceptually demanding; quite the contrary. Indeed, the reason governments around the world are panicked about maths is because of the chasm between students&apos; understanding and real-life needs. It&apos;s not so much that maths education is worse than it was; instead, real life is much more demanding and we&apos;re running in the wrong direction to catch up. Instead of rote learning long-division procedures, let&apos;s get students applying the power of calculus, picking holes in government statistics, designing a traffic system or cracking secret codes. All are possible, all train both creativity and conceptual understanding and have practical results. But they need computers to do most of the calculating \u2013 just like we do in the real world. One recent direction that will help all of this is the government&apos;s new-found enthusiasm for computer coding in schools. Much of the reason given for why it&apos;s important is that everyone can understand the insides of the apps they&apos;re using. But I think there&apos;s a much deeper point. Code is the modern way in which you express maths and the way to get computers calculating: it&apos;s that central. There&apos;s one country that pushed coding in schools before the UK: Estonia. It is also the first country to use the computer-based maths education system. There, my company has just finished building a completely rethought probability and statistics curriculum. School students will be working on problems such as &quot;Am I normal?&quot;, &quot;Are girls better at maths?&quot; &quot;Will it rain tomorrow?&quot; and &quot;Should I insure my laptop?&quot; They&apos;ll be using real, large datasets with all the difficulties that entails. They&apos;ll be doing coding and some of the maths they&apos;ll be handling is traditionally taught only at university. What&apos;s really impressive is that Estonia has already come top in Europe in Pisa. And it recognises how being top on today&apos;s playing field isn&apos;t what&apos;s needed for tomorrow. Where Estonia leads, others will follow \u2013 not just in the process of learning but in the subject matter. It&apos;s happened with coding. Now it needs to happen with school maths or it will go the way of classics. Those who lead the charge will reap the greatest rewards, as Britain did with universal education in the 19th century. Even better, I believe British culture makes us rather good creative problem-solvers, potentially world-beating if successfully tethered to the power of computer-based maths. Non-conformity, creativeness and looking around the rules is key to British (and Estonian) cultures and a great competitive, opposite to the cultural imperatives in many of the Asian countries doing well in maths tests, countries that may struggle to imbue such characteristics. Playing the wrong game badly is hardly smart. Let&apos;s lead in rewriting the rulebook and succeed at the right game. Visiting Estonia would be a start.

She tested the hypothesis by growing one group of chilli and tomato seeds under artificial lab light, and another under a suburban Beijing greenhouse. In the lab, the seeds sprouted in 20 days; in the greenhouse, they took more than two months. &quot;They will be lucky to live at all,&quot; He told the South China Morning Post newspaper.

One person not put off by the smog was President Xi Jinping, who braved the pollution to make an unannounced visit to a trendy neighbourhood popular with tourists. Dressed in a black jacket and trousers \u2013 and no facemask \u2013 Xi made a brief walkabout in Nanluoguxiang district last Thursday morning. The visit prompted approving coverage in Chinese news reports, but also mockery on social media sites. &quot;Xi Jinping visits Beijing&apos;s Nanluoguxiang amid the smog: breathing together, sharing the fate,&quot; said a Xinhua headline. Photos and shaky video footage apparently of Xi&apos;s visit ricocheted around Chinese social media sites. &quot;Why isn&apos;t he wearing a facemask?&quot; asked one Sina Weibo user. &quot;Isn&apos;t it bad for his health?&quot; This week Chinese media reported that a man in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province near Beijing, had sued the local environmental protection bureau for failing to rein in the smog. Li Guixin filed the lawsuit asking the municipal environment protection bureau &quot;perform its duty to control air pollution according to the law&quot;, the Yanzhao Metropolis Daily reported. Li is also seeking compensation for the pollution. &quot;Besides the threat to our health, we&apos;ve also suffered economic losses, and these losses should be borne by the government and the environmental departments because the government is the recipient of corporate taxes, it is a beneficiary,&quot; he told the Yanzhao Metropolis Daily. Li&apos;s lawyer, Wu Yufen, confirmed the lawsuit but refused to comment because of the sensitivity of the case. He said: &quot;This is the first ever case of a citizen suing the government regarding the issue of air pollution.

There were about six bars in the stack, which might have weighed about 75kg in total. If gold, at today&apos;s prices, they would be worth $3.2m.

He said that it&apos;s normal to receive silver coated gold bars especially from Morocco due to the gold export limits imposed by the Moroccan customs.&quot;     Gold trading in Dubai is said to have reached $70bn in 2012. Photograph: Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images    It also emerged the Moroccan suppliers had brought the shipment in by hand and were paid in cash at Kaloti&apos;s office in the souk. The shipment had left North Africa incorrectly labelled silver, and was properly accepted at Dubai airport customs as gold. It sounded like a smuggling scam. Further investigations found about four tonnes of gold, hidden beneath silver plating, may have come to Kaloti in a similar manner from several suppliers in Morocco. At today&apos;s prices, which are lower than those of 2012, four tonnes of gold is worth more than $170m. After being melted down, the bars would eventually emerge from the refinery as newly minted bullion, of 99.5% purity or greater, destined for the international gold market and stamped with a serial number and the words &quot;Kaloti, Dubai&quot;. Following the E&amp;Y inspection, Kaloti expected to be able to claim that its gold bars had been independently verified as conflict-free and responsibly sourced. But the inspectors were rapidly taking a very different view. They were shocked by refinery admissions that it accepted gold which had probably been smuggled. This was to be just one of the failings they stumbled over but it was enough, they thought, to mean the refinery had already effectively failed its inspection and would receive from E&amp;Y the worst available score for the review period, covering the last seven months of 2012: &quot;Breach of review protocol and zero tolerance&quot;.\u00a0 Serious  This score is reserved for the most serious lapses \u2013 such as refineries withholding information from reviewers, using unethical means to influence them, knowingly taking conflict gold, or taking gold from suppliers they know to have used falsified or misrepresented paperwork.\u00a0 Such a conclusion could even have resulted in the Dubai authorities stripping Kaloti of certification needed to trade easily with international customers. The damage to Dubai&apos;s reputation as a gold market would be huge. Of the gold seemingly smuggled from Morocco, E&amp;Y inspectors initially recorded in confidential reports that there had been &quot;misrepresentation and falsification of documentation by the ... supplier with the knowledge and acceptance of [Kaloti].&quot; There were other serious shortcomings. Kaloti records showed more than 1,000 transactions with customers walking into the group&apos;s office in the souk, off the street, without having to provide paperwork and being paid cash for gold. A total of 2.4 tonnes was accept this way, with company records showing simply &quot;call customer&quot;. The average amount received from these walk-in customers was 2.25kg, but once gold weighing 35kg \u2014 the average weight of a 10-year-old boy in the UK \u2014 was exchanged for cash from a walk-in customer whose identity was unrecorded. Today this amount of gold would be worth about \u00a3850,000. And these cash deals were just a small fraction of Kaloti transactions taking place outside the banking system. &quot;EY team observed large quantities of cash in the vault,&quot; minutes of the inspectors&apos; visit to the gold souk office recorded. &quot;Kaloti team explained that about 40% of the transaction value in Kaloti was carried out in cash in the Gold Souk office.&quot; E&amp;Y&apos;s eventual finding was that the refinery group&apos;s cash-for-gold deals in 2012 amounted to $5.2bn, compared to $6.6bn of transactions involving conventional bank transfers. If the office opened for business all year round that would still be equivalent to more than $14m a day being paid out to customers in cash.\u00a0 Kaloti told the inspectors clients sometimes preferred cash as payment via a bank transfer involved a charge of 1,000 dirhams (\u00a3163). It later added that cash deals had &quot;historically been the typical modus operandi in Dubai&apos;s cosmopolitan wholesale gold market&quot;. Again the E&amp;Y inspectors were troubled. Kaloti had declared itself signed up to international guidelines recommending all gold firms should &quot;avoid cash purchases where possible, and ensure that all unavoidable cash purchases are supported by verifiable documentation&quot;.\u00a0 Elsewhere, inspectors also found evidence of Kaloti transactions with suppliers from Sudan, a country linked to conflict gold in the past. Instead of showing heightened vigilance, Kaloti staff were happy to offer cash-in-hand in exchange for gold hand-delivered and originating from artisanal, small-scale mines (ASMs). Inspectors found Kaloti had no record of mining licences for the shipments, ensuring any audit trail to the source was lost. ASMs are low-tech, labour-intensive mining operations, highly vulnerable to extortion by armed groups. E&amp;Y inspectors diligently recorded each of the failures. Less than three months into their work, the list had become so concerning that they discreetly contacted the regulator, warning the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) of impending embarrassment. The response was a surprising one. One DMCC email inquired: &quot;We would like to understand that if we change the review period to Jan-March 2013 ... would there be a material difference that will impact the rating positively?&quot; This was the first indication that led some at E&amp;Y to believe the Dubai authorities were prepared to tinker with their own rules if the result spared the blushes of important players in the Dubai gold industry \u2013 an inference the DMCC says was unfounded. One internal E&amp;Y email revealed concern that Amjad Rihan, the partner in charge of the inspection team, was &quot;getting some heat from the regulator who is keen to promote the Dubai gold industry on the global stage&quot;. Unrealistic It added: &quot;They have unrealistic expectations of their industry&apos;s level of compliance, which have repeatedly been communicated to them, and there is an undercurrent of them looking to use EY&apos;s brand for their advantage, which of course is being managed.&quot; In a statement to the Guardian, the regulator said: &quot;The DMCC strongly refutes any allegation that it pressured EY, that it sought to influence or interfere with the review process or that it softened the review process to favour any member refinery.&quot; Establishing the DMCC 12 years ago, Dubai&apos;s ruler Sheikh Mohammed, said: &quot;The world&apos;s gold production is about 2,300-2,400 tonnes. Our main objective is to achieve half of the world production in the next few years. We have the will and the determination.&quot;\u00a0 While Dubai&apos;s wider economic fortunes faltered in 2009, the DMCC thrived, benefiting from a surging gold price and heavy demand from India and China, the emerging economic engines of global growth. In typical Dubai style, last year DMCC chairman Ahmed bin Sulayem celebrated this success by announcing the regulator had commissioned the Burj 2020, the world&apos;s tallest commercial tower, to be built for Dubai&apos;s hosting of the World Expo in six years&apos; time. Meanwhile, Dubai&apos;s largest refinery group Kaloti in December broke ground on what it says will be the world&apos;s largest gold refinery, a new $60m plant with capacity to refine as much as 1,400 tonnes of gold a year. &quot;The construction of our new refinery is part of the company&apos;s overall strategy to expand its capacity up to 2,000 tonnes,&quot; said Munir Kaloti. In the end, the DMCC did not elect to alter the inspection period for Kaloti. Instead, between May and June last year, the regulator came up with another, less conspicuous, tweak to the rulebook. It removed a recommendation that the overall verdict of inspectors be recorded in public documents, instead ordering that any such reference must henceforth be kept confidential. At the time DMCC maintained, as it does now, these rule changes were being introduced &quot;to be consistent with similar global accepted guidance manuals&quot; \u2013 a claim verified by London consultancy firm SGS in a detailed report. Other gold regulators around the world were also fine-tuning rules at this time as they too assimilated international standards drawn up by the OECD. Nevertheless the DMCC&apos;s alteration \u2013 which was not to be the last occasion the regulator tinkered with the rules \u2013 greatly concerned senior partners at E&amp;Y Dubai, particularly Rihan, who led the division involved out the Kaloti audit.\u00a0 Behind the scenes he and senior executives at E&amp;Y Dubai contacted the audit group&apos;s global office in London asking for urgent advice on how best to treat the damaging findings in refinery inspection reports. &quot;The issue of conflict minerals is both delicate and critical for our business in Dubai and, indeed, the region,&quot; said one email to E&amp;Y&apos;s global head of climate change and sustainability Juan Costa Climent, a former Spanish finance minister. &quot;We need to take a position urgently and we need the global firm to be fully aware of the facts and the issues \u2026 I am sorry to press you on the matter but it is both serious and critical.&quot; Within two weeks the issue had been further escalated to Mark Otty, E&amp;Y&apos;s London-based managing partner for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, who assembled a team of senior figures to deal with the matter, also calling in law firm Linklaters to provide outside advice.\u00a0 &quot;We are taking this issue very seriously,&quot; Otty wrote in one of a number of emails on the subject. &quot;I have taken the lead in relation to our investigation of it.&quot; Meanwhile, in Dubai, it became increasingly clear that Kaloti did not see the problem. The refinery group began drafting an official summary of E&amp;Y&apos;s inspection \u2013 a document it believed would become the only publicly available report. Not only did it make no reference to the inspectors&apos; overall conclusion, in accordance with the DMCC&apos;s new rules, but it also contained scant mention of many serious failings found by the independent review team. This was too much for E&amp;Y, which responded by indicating it would not be able to sign off on such a whitewash report as accurate. After Kaloti received a quiet word from the DMCC, however, it began to work more collaboratively with E&amp;Y towards a formula of words acceptable to both. Kaloti hired Jeff Rhodes, one of the most experienced executives in the Dubai gold industry who served on DMCC committees, to deal with the matter. By now Rihan, a 39-year-old partner at E&amp;Y, had stepped back from the project, remaining deeply uncomfortable.\u00a0 The work progressed without him, with both sides exchanging and refining drafts of what both inspectors and refinery staff believed would eventually be published as the official summary of the troublesome inspection. Leaked draft filings, attached in these email exchanges, show the extent to which E&amp;Y actively advised Kaloti how best to describe its shortcomings publicly.\u00a0 At one stage the audit firm recommended edits which removed reference to &quot;bars coated with silver&quot;, replacing the words with a more generic reference to &quot;an incident in which there were certain documentary irregularities&quot;. It was a formula Kaloti was quick to adopt. At a stroke, any suggestion of smuggling was replaced with a more anodyne phrase hinting at what may just have been a clerical error. Contacted by the Guardian, E&amp;Y was unable to answer several detailed questions because it was under a duty of confidentiality to Kaloti, but said: &quot;EY Dubai refutes entirely the suggestion that we did anything but highly professional work in relation to our engagement with Kaloti.&quot; It added that any failings discovered were fully reported to the DMCC. Meanwhile, the Guardian understands it is commonplace for audit firms to use their technical expertise to advise clients on the appropriate wording to be used in official reports. On 8 September last year official filings were submitted to DMCC, their language carefully polished and signed off by EY and by three managing directors at Kaloti. The phrase &quot;breach of review protocol \u2013 zero tolerance&quot; did appear in paperwork expected to be made public, but there was no indication it was also the inspectors&apos; final conclusion. Colleagues at E&amp;Y told Rihan they regarded it a successful outcome. Otty urged him to look on the bright side. &quot;The situation has changed dramatically \u2026 In particular, we have a team in Dubai who have worked very hard to get us to the point that both client and regulator will report deficiencies,&quot; he emailed. &quot;On this basis I suggest that we \u2026 achieve all that you were focused on \u2013 and more.&quot; Joe Murphy, E&amp;Y Dubai managing partner, also suggested Rihan should no longer have cause for concern. &quot;Each of these clients has now issued a compliance report which satisfactorily takes into account the elements of non-compliance,&quot; he emailed. &quot;We can now expect that DMCC will publish the compliance report \u2026 There is now no tension or concern about reporting.&quot; Murphy may not have know it, but, in truth, tensions had not vanished. Kaloti was fuming. It felt it had been rushed into the regulatory submission. The company had understood that the controversial shipments from Morocco were going to be rated only as &quot;non-compliant, high risk&quot;, but were told the rating would be &quot;breach of protocol and zero tolerance&quot; just days before the submission deadline. Despite being convinced E&amp;Y was wrong, three top Kaloti executives, signed the compliance report \u2014 even though the refinery believed it to be incorrect \u2014 and cleared the audit firm to submit it to the DMCC. Kaloti say this was done reluctantly, and only to meet a regulatory deadline. According to the DMCC, queries over the findings in the submitted Kaloti report were first raised with it by E&amp;Y, at the request of the refinery group.\u00a0 If it was unusual for a firm like E&amp;Y to be querying its own regulatory filings after they had been submitted, the move seemed doubly odd given that Otty and other senior figures at E&amp;Y&apos;s global head office in London had earlier spent considerable time wrestling over how best to treat the Morocco finding with the help of Linklaters. EY Dubai had concluded Kaloti&apos;s actions merited a rating of &quot;breach of review protocol and zero tolerance&quot;. Now, however, they were no longer so sure. In response the DMCC contacted E&amp;Y giving its opinion of inspectors&apos; assessment. That led the audit firm re reconsider its own view and ultimately to recall its 8 September submission. A new set of filings were entered one month later, this time with controversial dealings with Moroccan suppliers downgraded to &quot;High risk, non-compliance&quot;.\u00a0\u00a0 The exact reason for the reclassification is unclear, but confidential paperwork shows that it remained uncontested that Kaloti had told inspectors &quot;gold plated with silver was exported as silver in Morocco however the same is declared as gold at Dubai customs&quot;. Again, the regulator rejected any allegation that it pressured E&amp;Y or in any other way acted improperly. E&amp;Y said it &quot;refutes entirely the suggestion that we did anything but highly professional work.&quot; The unusual circumstances in which the regulatory filings had been retracted was not the end of the matter. Less than three weeks later, the DMCC would change the inspection reporting rules once again, this time in a way that meant Kaloti&apos;s second compliance report, with the downgraded finding, would never be made public. It was a move that surprised some at E&amp;Y. As the weeks had passed, without the anticipated publication, members of the inspection team became increasingly puzzled why no reports had been made public. By this time they were completing a brief follow-up inspection to verify Kaloti had put in place remedial action, and that failings earlier identified by E&amp;Y had not reoccurred. As part of this process they noted that the failure to publish a compliance report once again put Kaloti on track for further public criticisms. DMCC guidance required refiners to &quot;publicly report ... to generate public confidence [in the inspection process]&quot;. In internal memos E&amp;Y inspectors wrote: &quot;The refiner has not publicly reported ... This disclosure needs to be made prior to issuance of the follow-up review report.&quot; Such an omission, E&amp;Y reviewers believed, was another &quot;Non-compliance: High Risk&quot; failing. What they had not counted on, however, was the DMCC&apos;s willingness once again to bend its own inspection rules. This time, without advertising the changes on its website, the regulator quietly changed the public reporting standards, introducing the new concept of a &quot;consolidated compliance report&quot;. This removed any requirement for a refiner to publish a compliance report with embarrassing findings \u2014 so long as it later carried out a short follow-up review. The review and initial audit period would then be summerised in a single published report. These discreet changes led E&amp;Y to advise Kaloti that the refiner was no longer required to publish a separate compliance report covering the earlier inspection. The DMCC consulted with EY before introducing this change, and it said the audit firm confirmed such a move would not compromise the integrity of the ongoing review and publication process. In confidential papers, E&amp;Y noted that the DMCC rules had been &quot;amended&quot; in November 2013. In documents to be made public, however, E&amp;Y was circumspect. It said it had tested Kaloti compliance against DMCC rules &quot;in issuance as at the date of this report&quot;. In one internal email, a sharp-eyed E&amp;Y inspector noted that a date and version number were missing on the regulator&apos;s new rules. When, last December \u2013 and six months later than planned \u2013 Kaloti for the first time made public its official summary of the troublesome E&amp;Y inspection, this eleventh-hour DMCC rule change was not mentioned. Also hard to discern in this, the only publicly available summary of E&amp;Y&apos;s inspection, were full details of the shortcomings at Kaloti, between June and December 2012. In the publicly released consolidated report Kaloti stressed that by the end of the period it was &quot;fully compliant&quot; with all DMCC responsible gold sourcing standards. There was no mention of &quot;breach of protocol and zero tolerance&quot; or even &quot;non-compliance, high risk&quot; in the report.\u00a0The report did refer briefly to some past imperfections, labelling them &quot;deviations&quot;. Referencing dealings with gold seemingly smuggled from Morocco, it said: &quot;There was lack of documentation in identifying risk in the supply chain for a small number of transactions although they were in accordance with Dubai Customs import regulations&quot;. That Kaloti routinely offered cash-for-gold is stated clearly, though there is no indication that the sums involved ran into billions of dollars. &quot;During the initial review period we had deviations ... in which [Kaloti] did not identify risks in cash settlement transactions which was the typical modus operandi in the Dubai wholesale market.&quot; There is no suggestion any descriptions in the Kaloti report, signed off as &quot;fair&quot; by E&amp;Y, were out of line with regulatory rules or industry practice. In any event, whatever these elliptically described historic lapses had been, Kaloti&apos;s consolidated report said they had been firmly rectified. Kaloti said: &quot;The final findings of the consolidated report were published in accordance with the requirements of the regulator, and were consistent with global best practices and industry norms of compliance reporting.&quot; Meanwhile, after months trying to persuade senior colleagues in Dubai, and at E&amp;Y&apos;s London office, that clear details of failures should appear in Kaloti&apos;s published report, Rihan decided to take the full findings, to the Guardian. He had become increasingly isolated at E&amp;Y and senior figures were growing impatient at his meddlesome interventions. &quot;It is the firm&apos;s view ... a satisfactory position was reached with regard to the client engagements and with the DMCC,&quot; wrote Murphy. &quot;We respect, but do not agree with, your views as to how issues with one specific client [Kaloti] require to be presented both to the DMCC and more broadly,&quot; wrote one of E&amp;Y&apos;s top lawyers in London, claiming Rihan&apos;s position was at odds with &quot;internal and external experts&quot;. When independent lawyers for Rihan wrote to E&amp;Y formally urging for the audit firm to ensure the complete picture of inspection findings be revealed, the response was a sharp one from lawyers at Linklaters. &quot;The position is that EY Dubai agreed to carry out certain assurance work for clients [including Kaloti]. Pursuant to the terms of those engagements, EY Dubai was required, both as a matter of contract ... and as a matter of compliance with the regulatory regime under which it operated, to apply the DMCC guidelines as in force from time to time. &quot;EY Dubai has done so and delivered the required reports to its clients and to the DMCC setting out the findings made in the course of the work that it undertook. &quot;EY Dubai has therefore discharged its obligations ... Mr Rihan may have preferred that matters had been handled in a different manner, but that was not his decision to make.&quot;", "tags": ["Gold", "Dubai", "EY", "Africa", "Financial sector", "Accountancy", "Commodities", "Business", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-02-25T21:51:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/feb/26/st-james-place-share-price-rise", "sentences": ["Yesterday&apos;s intriguing development was the planned purchase of an adviser business for British expatriates in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai."], "title": "St James's Place goes from strength to strength", "article": "Lloyds Banking Group sold too soon.

Sales were collapsing at a rate of 26% a year, it lost 1.4bn Danish kroner (\u00a3150m) in 2003 and private equity firms were circling the 82-year-old family-owned Danish company. Now, after a series of job cuts and the ending of the family&apos;s management of the company, the plastic brick business has rebuilt itself into the world&apos;s most profitable toy maker ahead of Barbie&apos;s Mattel. The company, which has been headquartered in the small Danish town of Billund (population 6,155) since 1932, has reported &quot;another record breaking year&quot; of sales and profits growth \u2013 for the ninth consecutive year. Its high profitability comes from its ability to turn each kilogram of raw material plastic \u2013 which costs less than $1 \u2013 into sets that sell for more than $75 per kg. Annual profits increased by almost 10% to 8.2bn kroner (\u00a3900m) \u2013 about the same as the profit Facebook turned in last year. Sales jumped 10% to 25.3bn kroner (\u00a32.8bn). &quot;That is an incredible quadrupling of our revenues in less than 10 years,&quot; Joergen Vig Knudstorp, Lego chief executive, said. &quot;We think we are changing children&apos;s lives forever when they play with Lego. We think this was another year where we got great affirmation of that.&quot; Knudstorp is credited with driving Lego&apos;s resurgence since he took over as CEO from Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, grandson of the company&apos;s carpenter founder, during the 2003-4 crisis. He said Lego&apos;s success was due to constant innovation and the creation of 60-70 new products every year, including Harry Potter, Star Wars and SpongeBob SquarePants ranges. But he admitted it is still a &quot;major innovation challenge&quot; to &quot;stay on the top of children&apos;s wish lists&quot; against competition from iPads and computer games. &quot;We need to constantly become better, or otherwise there will be someone out there who will catch up to us,&quot; he said. Jane Westgarth, a toy analyst at market research firm Mintel, said Lego&apos;s recovery had been fuelled by its investment in quality and design. &quot;They are doing things that are taking Lego into a slightly different position, from the boxes of bricks where you had to use your imagination to sets you use in specific ways with characters you already know,&quot; she said. &quot;If it&apos;s good quality, people are prepared to pay that little bit extra.&quot; Westgarth said Lego was also benefiting considerably from parents&apos; nostalgia for their own childhood \u2013 parents including David Beckham, who admitted earlier this month that he builds Lego with his children to stay calm and had just completed the 4,287-piece Tower Bridge kit. &quot;For a parent aged 30 there&apos;s no doubt about it that they would have Lego in their homes. Parents like to introduce their children to things that they loved as children.&quot; The company, which sold its Legoland theme parks to Madame Tussauds owner Merlin Entertainments in 2005, is building on its &quot;red core business&quot; by boosting its digital presence, but Knudstorp said his customers have done most of the work for him. More than 99% of Lego videos on Youtube \u2013 featuring Lego recreations of everything from the London 2012 Olympics to the New Testament \u2013 are made by users. &quot;We&apos;re not leaving the brick, but we will leverage digital technology to stay relevant over the next 20 years,&quot; he said. Lego, which is derived from the Danish &quot;leg godt&quot; meaning &quot;play well&quot;, is also benefiting from &quot;a considerable amount of excitement&quot; prompted by the Lego Movie. The film, which features the hit Tegan and Sara song Everything is Awesome, is taking \u00a32m a day in UK cinema box offices, and has topped the US and Canadian charts for three consecutive weekends. Next up is Knudstorp&apos;s &quot;pretty simple ambition&quot; to &quot;take the bricks all over the world&quot;. Lego is sold in more than 130 countries round the world, but Knudstorp admits that &quot;we&apos;re not really there&quot; in many of the world&apos;s less well off nations. &quot;We see a huge opportunity to bring Lego further out into the world in the next 20 years,&quot; he said. Sales in China, where Lego will open a new $300m factory in 2016, grew by more than 50% last year - although from asmall base. Knudstorp believes Lego could be expanded to 600m Chinese customers within in the next decade.&quot;But we need a set up that is much more diverse, much more international, than we are today. &quot;It would be arrogant to think that just because you&apos;re Danish you&apos;re equally knowledgeable about what it takes to succeed in countries all over the world,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to remain very much a Danish company rooted here in Billund, a place where we were born and we have our heritage and we will never leave. &quot;But we want to be a Danish company that&apos;s welcoming to all sorts of cultures.&quot; To do so the company is diversifying senior management into four global offices in London, Singapore, Shanghai and Connecticut. The company is still owned by the descendents of Ole Kirk Kristiansen, a master carpenter and joiner who founded the company in Billund in 1932, when it was a small village. Ole&apos;s son Godtfred joined the firm when he was 12 years old, and the company&apos;s first toy was a wooden duck called Lego. The first plastic bricks were produced in 1949. Godtfred&apos;s son Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen was chief executive from 1979-2004. Forbes magazine named Kjeld as Denmark&apos;s richest man with a net worth of $7.3bn in March 2013.

Mark writes: &quot;The authors found that symptoms in one person leading to a diagnosis of dyslexia are often absent in another person similarly diagnosed. Therefore a typical education invention for one pupil may not help another who has also been diagnosed with dyslexia.&quot; You can read the full post on Mr Melaney&apos;s blog site. How did Shanghai win this year&apos;s education world cup? If there was an education world cup, says professor Chris Husbands, then Shanghai would currently be holding the trophy. In this great blog post, the director of the Institute of Education talks about how the world&apos;s attention is focused on the city after research suggests that its students are performing exceptionally well. Chris picks apart the strengths and weaknesses of Shanghai&apos;s education system, offering some interesting food for thought on what the UK could learn from its teaching practices. One point he considers is the high expectations of teachers. &quot;All new teachers are expected to complete 360 hours of continuing professional development in their own time during their first three years. &quot;And all teachers are part of teaching and research groups, which meet for 90 minutes each week to discuss classroom teaching and jointly plan the next week&apos;s work.&quot; It&apos;s a fascinating insight into how Shanghai&apos;s children are taught and you can read the full blog on the Institute of Education&apos;s website. How babies can help teach pupils empathy Recently a book has been published called Empathy: A Handbook for Revolution. In one section of the text, its author Roman Krznaric talks about how empathy can be taught by schools. He focuses on an education programme called roots of empathy, which began in Canada and is now being piloted in south London. In the scheme, a class of pupils effectively adopts a baby for a year, which visits them every few weeks. As well as caring for the baby, students discuss how the baby feels. For example, they might talk about why the baby is crying or laughing. This is then extended to questions outside of the baby&apos;s world, such as what is it like to be bullied in the playground? A study in Scotland showed that the programme boosted co-operative behaviour by 55%, decreased bullying and increased academic attainment. You can read more on its findings in this summary of the report. There is also an evaluation of the programme by the North Lanarkshire psychological service on the Action for Children website. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 March 2014. In the roots of empathy programme, real babies are used, not dolls that are simulated to act like a baby. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. Looking for your next role?

State media blamed the killings at Kunming in Yunnan province, south-west China, on militants from Xinjiang in the country&apos;s restive north-west. &quot;Evidence at the crime scene showed that the Kunming railway station terrorist attack was carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces,&quot; the Xinhua news agency said, quoting officials in the city. Reports said five attackers were shot dead by police following the incident on Saturday evening and another five were being hunted. Unverified photographs circulating on social media appeared to show the blood-soaked bodies of victims lined up on the floor. Other images showed distraught people running away from the station and crowds gathering among police officers and ambulances. Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered a full-scale manhunt to find those responsible for what was one of the deadliest attacks in the communist country in recent years. &quot;Severely punish in accordance with the law the violent terrorists and resolutely crack down on those who have been swollen with arrogance,&quot; he said, according to Xinhua. &quot;Understand the serious and complex nation of combating terrorism. Go all out to maintain social stability.&quot; Chinese TV said the country&apos;s top police official, Meng Jianzhu, was on his way to the scene. Yang Haifei, who was wounded in the chest and back, told Xinhua he had been buying a train ticket when the attackers approached and he had tried to escape with the crowd. &quot;I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone,&quot; he said. Others &quot;simply fell on the ground&quot;. Some who escaped were desperately searching for missing family. &quot;I can&apos;t find my husband, and his phone went unanswered,&quot; said Yang Ziqing, who had been waiting to catch a train to Shanghai when the knife gang struck. Eyewitnesses were quoted by the China News Service, saying the attackers, dressed in black, &quot;burst into the train station plaza and the ticket hall, stabbing whoever they saw&quot;. Xinhua said at least 113 people were injured in the &quot;organised, premeditated&quot; attack. The victims were taken by ambulances to hospitals around the city. Weibo users took to the social network to explain what happened, though many of those posts were quickly deleted by government censors, especially those that described the attackers, two of whom were identified by some as women. Others condemned the attack. &quot;No matter who, for whatever reason, or of what race, chose somewhere so crowded as a train station, and made innocent people their target \u2013 they are evil and they should go to hell,&quot; wrote one user. The website of the state-run People&apos;s Daily newspaper said the gang struck at 9pm local time on Saturday, hacking into victims who it said were &quot;passersby&quot;. It said the station had been cordoned off and more than 120 police, firefighters and security officers deployed to the scene. TV images showed police wrapping a long, sword-like knife in a plastic bag, amid the heavy security at the station. Kunming, about 1,300 miles south-west of Beijing, is a bustling university town and major commercial hub on trade routes linking southern China to neighbouring Vietnam. The attack comes at a particularly sensitive time as China gears up for the annual meeting of parliament, which opens in Beijing on Wednesday and is normally accompanied by a tightening of security across the country. China has blamed similar incidents in the past on extremists operating out of Xinjiang, though such attacks have generally been limited to Xinjiang itself. China says its first major suicide attack, in Beijing&apos;s Tiananmen Square in October, involved militants from Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, many of whom resent Chinese restrictions on their culture and religion. In July 2008, the city was hit by two explosions on board separate public transport buses, leaving two dead. Officials did not classify the blasts as acts of terrorism and later dismissed reports that they were claimed by a Xinjiang separatist group.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-02T08:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/shortcuts/2014/mar/02/mr-harry-authentic-british-restaurant-shanghai", "sentences": ["The people of China \u2013 or at least the 22 million of them who live in Shanghai \u2013 finally have a chance to get cultural payback for every time westerners have ordered dizzyingly inappropriate combinations of dishes in Chinese restaurants.", "Mr Harry Authentic British Restaurant, in a mall next to the city&apos;s main branch of Marks &amp; Spencer, has been the Shanghai restaurant scene&apos;s surprise of the year, with customers \u2013 most of whom are Chinese \u2013 crowding in to try exotic specialities like full English breakfast, cottage pie, apple and rhubarb crumble, and cream teas.", "&quot;I&apos;m very confident they&apos;ll have a significant impact on the business,&quot; says Spencer, speaking as he tries to explain mushy peas to a fashionably attired but baffled Shanghai lady who lunches.", "&quot;We get a lot of expats and tourists coming by \u2013 the DJ Goldie came two days running when he was in Shanghai \u2013 but it&apos;s the Chinese customers who have asked most about home deliveries.", "But there are plenty of superb Chinese restaurants in the vicinity where you can eat for \u00a32 or less, so Shanghai diners are clearly voting with their wallets."], "title": "Why Shanghai diners love China's first British restaurant", "article": "The people of China \u2013 or at least the 22 million of them who live in Shanghai \u2013 finally have a chance to get cultural payback for every time westerners have ordered dizzyingly inappropriate combinations of dishes in Chinese restaurants.

On Monday the prime minister announced he would lead a business delegation to China, South Korea and Japan next month, including the inaugural \u201cAustralia Week in China\u201d promotion to build trade and investment links. Abbott rated Australia\u2019s overall relationship with China as \u201cgood and getting better\u201d, despite strained ties following China\u2019s declaration of an \u201cair defence zone\u201d in the East China Sea including islands claimed by both China and Japan.  In November, Australia summoned the Chinese ambassador to express its concerns about the way in which China had proclaimed the air identification zone, prompting a public rebuke from China. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade assistant secretary Peter Rowe told a Senate committee hearing last week that he had \u201cnever in 30 years encountered such rudeness\u201d, referring to critical comments made by the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, during a visit to Beijing by Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, in December. Abbott said on Monday the relationship was in \u201cvery good shape\u201d and Australia would do everything it reasonably could to achieve a free trade agreement with China later this year \u2013 \u201cbut in the end there are two sides to a negotiation\u201d. Asked whether he accepted he had to smooth over the diplomatic tension, Abbott said: \u201cI met with the Chinese ambassador a week or so back and he assured me that the Chinese government at the very highest of levels was looking forward to my trip, was looking forward to Australia Week In China. From time to time there are always going to be issues but there is a fundamental strength to this relationship and I want to build on those strengths.\u201d Abbott, who flagged a 12-month goal for the Chinese free trade agreement in October last year, said it was possible to have a \u201crespectful disagreement\u201d with China on one issue while maintaining a strong trade relationship. The trade and investment minister, Andrew Robb, said another round of negotiations with China and Japan happened last week and the parties were \u201cmaking good progress\u201d.  Robb denied reports that China had put its free trade agreement negotiations with Australia on the back burner. \u201cI think we\u2019re on track to finish the Chinese and the Japanese [negotiations] in a satisfactory timeframe,\u201d Robb said. The comments came as Abbott confirmed details of his trip to Asia next month, including visits to Japan, South Korea and China \u2013 countries that represent 40% of Australia\u2019s total two-way trade in goods and services. Abbott said he would be joined by senior Australian business people and would also invite state premiers and territory chief ministers. The prime minister said Robb would also lead the largest-ever commonwealth-sponsored Australian trade delegation to China, with about 350 business representatives registering to join the trip. Abbott said he hoped to formally sign the Korea-Australia free trade agreement during the visit and to \u201csubstantially advance\u201d talks with Japan. \u201cTrade means jobs,\u201d he said.

Metcalfe&apos;s tale tells of a British teacher working at a Chinese school, with cultural differences resulting in &quot;devastating consequences&quot; for his young Chinese host. She was inspired to write the story, she said, after spending a year in China working for the British Council, &quot;which sparked off a lot of ideas about cultural exchange and the different degrees of success with which different people are able to translate themselves for others and for different kinds of cultural environments&quot;. Metcalfe&apos;s piece is competing with stories from Elizabeth Strout, who won the Pulitzer for her novel Olive Kitteridge, and Adam Johnson, who took the prestigious US fiction award for The Orphan Master&apos;s Son. Johnson&apos;s short story Nirvana is set in the near future, as a man&apos;s wife deteriorates from a wasting illness, and Strout&apos;s Snow Blind is a decade-spanning tale taking place in rural America. The shortlist for the prize, the world&apos;s richest for a single short story, also includes Anwar Gets Everything, the disturbing tale of a Bangladeshi construction worker in Dubai by the award-winning British/Bangladeshi writer Tahmima Anam, and British author Jonathan Tel&apos;s The Shoe King of Shanghai, in which a migrant to Beijing steals shoes from a funeral and tries to sell them on.

There was no sign of a last-minute government rescue for Shanghai Chaori Solar, after the firm failed to repay the bulk of an interest repayment that was due on Friday. The loss-making firm warned earlier this week it would be only be able to repay 4m yuan (\u00a3389,000) out of the 89m yuan interest payment, due on 1bn yuan of bonds issued in 2012.

He said a bondholders&apos; meeting to discuss the debt would be called in the coming days. &quot;We will try our best to pay bondholders as soon as possible but the company also has other debts,&quot; said Liu. The default happened after a last-gasp refinancing plan fell at the final hurdle, according to local media. Analysts said the move was a step forward for market discipline, in contrast to the customary government interventions to prop up struggling companies. &quot;The Chaori default goes to show the government will begin to let the market decide the fate of weak borrowers. This test case indicates the government is addressing the moral hazard issue,&quot; Christopher Lee, managing director of corporate ratings for Greater China at Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, told Reuters. &quot;Incidence of defaults will likely be incremental but controlled,&quot; he said, naming metals and mining, shipbuilding and materials as key default risks.

Total sales of air purifiers hit 3.5bn RMB (\u00a3293m) in 2013, according to Daxue Consulting who have carried out market research. &quot;There is 80-100% growth year-on-year compared to 2012,&quot; said Matthieu David-Experton, CEO of Daxue Consulting, which has offices in Shanghai and Beijing. More than 40% of these sales in 2013 were recorded in November and December when air pollution levels were particularly high, according to their figures. Sales of face masks have also risen dramatically with many retailers in Beijing reporting that they had sold out stock during the city&apos;s most recent bout of smog. Chinese state media reported that 217,000 people bought masks in seven days on the online retail platform Tmall.com. One manufacturer, 3M, which sells its products on Tmall, sold out of 26 of its 29 products. Louie Cheng, president of PureLiving China, an indoor environmental consulting company based in Shanghai said his company&apos;s sales of face masks and air purifiers surged when air pollution levels reached off index levels in the city last December. &quot;After that particularly bad week at the beginning of December, over a two day period we probably had 300 clients pass though our office to buy filters and masks,&quot; Cheng said. &quot;We were sold out of things. There was a clearing of the shelves sort of response.&quot; This is echoed by Thomas Talhelm, founder of Smart Air, a company that sells budget air purifiers. &quot;It&apos;s very clear that things get kind of crazy whenever the air pollution gets bad,&quot; said Talhelm. &quot;Our sales doubled every day for three days when the air was really bad in Shanghai.&quot; However, there have been concerns raised at the lack of regulation in this lucrative market. &quot;There is no industry standard,&quot; said David-Experton. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision (SMBQTS) has previously said some companies that produce air purifiers are inaccurately describing the capabilities of their products. Recently there were calls for a national standard for anti-pollution face masks as some on the market claim to filter out PM2.5, tiny particulate pollution which is considered dangerous, but are not effective. The anti-pollution market is growing rapidly, said Cheng. &quot;As a whole the tide is rising, everyone is jumping in. It&apos;s kind of like green washing 10 years ago where everything was &apos;eco friendly&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a lot of marketing but there was not a lot of labelling control.     Commuters wear face masks in Beijing to avoid inhaling smog. Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;There is regulation but there is not a lot of enforcement around the regulation. People will put their trust and money into something and it may not be justified.&quot; It is not just at the lower end of the market, said Cheng. &quot;We see some very expensive systems and they are either employed incorrectly or they are just flat out ineffective.&quot; As Talhelm discovered, the technology behind air purifiers is not complicated and some of the price tags of up to 16,000 RMB (\u00a31,565) are not justified. He set up his company last September after he had found it difficult to buy a reasonably priced yet efficient air purifier to protect himself from the smog in Beijing. &quot;I set out to buy a recommended one and realised it was $1,000. I couldn&apos;t justify the cost,&quot; he said. After carrying out research, Talhelm discovered that a HEPA filter attached to a fan is as efficient as some of the more expensive models he could not afford. &quot;HEPA filters are not some crazy thing, in fact if you have a vacuum cleaner at home, it probably has a HEPA filter and you did not pay $1,000 for it.&quot; This week the Chinese premier Li Keqiang said China is &quot;declaring war&quot; on pollution, an indication of how serious the issue has become. While there were blue skies over Beijing as Li made his declaration, air pollution has become a persistant problem and last year the Chinese capital, Beijing, experienced a total of 189 polluted air days. This declaration was significant, said Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs and one of China&apos;s most wellknown environmentalists. &quot;There is great political will now to try and deal with the problem,&quot; he said. But economic growth &quot;still trumps everything,&quot; he added. &quot;Pollution is not just an environmental issue, it is an issue of livliehood and if unchecked it could become a political issue,&quot; Ma said. &quot;There is an understanding that this is not just about public health and resources but also about social stability.&quot;", "tags": ["Pollution", "Environment", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Health", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Travel and transport", "Fossil fuels", "Coal"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-07T12:09:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/07/whitney-biennial-armory-show-new-york-art-week", "sentences": ["There\u2019s a commissioned artwork from the Shanghai-born provocateur Xu Zhen, consisting of a white cube with performers locked inside, chucking sculptures into the air."], "title": "Whitney Biennial and the Armory Show: New York's busiest art week", "article": "New York is saturated with contemporary art in usual times, but this week it is full to bursting.  The Armory Show opened on Wednesday, on the piers of the Hudson River. A large crowd of collectors, curators, advisers and groupies charged through a notably strong edition of the city\u2019s largest art fair. Many, though, had already had a full helping of contemporary art across town, at the Whitney Museum of American Art.  The Whitney Biennial, the city\u2019s leading museum show of contemporary art, opened the day before \u2013 opening-night crowds for the perplexing, all-over-the-shop exhibition waited for half an hour or more to get inside. This is the first year since 2004 that New York\u2019s most prominent commercial and non-commercial platforms for contemporary art have fallen in the same week, However, while the Armory and the Whitney Biennial would pack an art-lover\u2019s schedule on their own, there is even more to choose from. The Armory Show is only the biggest of 10 fairs, including the blue-chip ADAA Art Show and the young, scruffy Independent. The Whitney Biennial has a spinoff in the form of the Brucennial, a rammed exhibition featuring around 600 female artists. (Women\u2019s representation had been getting better in recent Whitney Biennials, but they account for less than a third of the artists at the museum this year.)         Trailer for the Brucennial, which ends this year.    It keeps going. The week\u2019s openings have also included a Gauguin exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art; a vital show on art and civil rights in the 1960s at the Brooklyn Museum; three large solo presentations at PS1, MoMA\u2019s hipper kid sister in Queens; and untold numbers of openings at commercial galleries. Then there are auctions at Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips, for collectors who still have money to burn. The 2014 Whitney Biennial, the museum\u2019s 77th edition, is a relatively large one. It includes work by 103 participants, splashed across three floors plus the lobby, basement, stairwell and elevators, and sites around town. Diverse to the point of incoherence, it does gel around a few themes.  There\u2019s a good amount of abstract painting, such as from the Brooklyn-based artist Amy Sillman, as well as sculptures made of ceramic or fabric, such as a tumbling multi-colored tower of yarn from the 80-year-old Sheila Hicks. Numerous works involve archival research or presentations of historical material, such as a project by Joseph Grigley showcasing ephemera from a murdered art critic. There\u2019s also lots \u2013 really, lots \u2013 of sex and nudity, much of it homoerotic, most impressively in a nightmarish installation from the workaholic Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard (subject of a recent uproar involving Dasha Zhukova and racial insensitivity). There are a few oddball inclusions, such as the late author David Foster Wallace, whose notebooks for his novel The Pale King are displayed like relics.     Mother, by Amy Sillman. John Beren/Whitney Museum of American Art    Early reviews have not been kind. Unlike in previous iterations, the biennial\u2019s three curators did not collaborate on a single presentation but worked on discrete sections individually. That independence may have contributed to the wildly divergent quality of work on display, according to Joshua Decter, a curator and the author of a new book, Art is a Problem. \u201cIt probably would have been more productive for the three curators to have actually collaborated closely on one show, rather than each doing their own quasi-autonomous shows,\u201d said Decter, who has attended every biennial since 1977. \u201cThe result may have actually been similar, but a more rigorous collaborative process might have led to a refining of each curator\u2019s selections, and demanded of each to make useful edits and compromises.\u201d The Armory Show, by contrast, beat expectations. Hunted these past two years by the new Frieze New York fair, Armory has made a substantial push under its young director, Noah Horowitz, to refresh itself with a more rigorous selection process and a more international scope. The result is a fair finding its footing again after years of its future being in doubt. Several dealers have booths with just a single artist, often showing not evidently commercial work. The booth of Marianne Boesky Gallery, for example, is overtaken by a riotous construction of interconnected black wood planks by Serge Alain Nitegeka, an artist born in Burundi and based in South Africa. Alison Jacques, a London dealer, has given her booth over to the Brazilian artist Fernanda Gomes, whose art consists of minimal, almost offhand interventions in the gallery: a twig, a glass of water, a ping-pong ball. This year\u2019s Armory also includes a section devoted to Chinese art that features 17 galleries, nine of which have never shown outside of Asia. There\u2019s a commissioned artwork from the Shanghai-born provocateur Xu Zhen, consisting of a white cube with performers locked inside, chucking sculptures into the air. It works as a parody of the typical art fair experience, with the art glimpsed only for a second before disappearing again.     Xu Zhen's Art of Change installation. Photograph: The Armory Show    The China programming has been organized by Philip Tinari, the director of the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. It also includes an educational symposium on Chinese contemporary art. As recently as a few years ago, a museum director organizing part of an art fair would have felt bizarre. Today, with the market in perpetual boom, it feels almost conventional. \u201cI think we all have to learn how to make peace with the art fairs,\u201d Tinari says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you ally with them infinitely, but this felt to me like a productive insertion at this time. And what institutions are really going to show these artists in New York now?  \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great things about the fair in New York. It\u2019s unlike Dubai, or even Miami. It\u2019s not just the black-card holders. It\u2019s the rank and file of the profession, it\u2019s all these students. You have an audience that feels real.\u201d The overlapping of commercial and non-commercial, the market and the museum, has been the dominant theme of this art-saturated week. The Whitney Biennial\u2019s curators have positioned their show in opposition to the booming art market, with many works from artist collectives and almost nothing from the large galleries of Chelsea. Yet the simultaneous opening of Armory, and all the other shows and sales, has highlighted the ongoing convergence of the two sectors.     Basin Theology/Butterfly Wreck, by Sterling Ruby. Photograph: Robert Wedemeyer/Whitney Museum of American Art    The biennial, after all, is sponsored in part by Sotheby\u2019s, and many of the auction house\u2019s clients packed the Tuesday night opening while hundreds of others (including at least one former Whitney Biennial curator) queued in the cold outside. Works by several biennial artists, including Sterling Ruby and Channa Horwitz, could be bought at Armory or Independent; the biennial catalogue\u2019s acknowledgements section thanks dozens of galleries. Michelle Grabner, one of the three biennial curators, is herself a painter \u2013 her work is on sale at the Armory Show. The seemingly unstoppable proliferation of the art market, and the continued push of commercial enterprises into terrain that was once just for museums, has forced curators of biennials and other non-commercial shows to rethink their roles. But by the fifth day of New York\u2019s stuffed contemporary art week, it was unclear just what role the Whitney Biennial still played in defining American art in a global, money-soaked ecosystem.  \u201cThe Armory Show now deploys intellectual window-dressing to give it some cosmopolitan street cred,\u201d Decter observed. \u201cAnd the Whitney Biennial is still in search of itself.\u201d", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Culture", "World news", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-07T17:01:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/mar/07/city-links-the-best-of-the-web", "sentences": ["Shanghai\u2019s diaper store nail house This week we also want to nab a post from the Shanghai Street Stories blog, even if it is a couple of weeks old.", "The lone ranger that has yet to complete the negotiations on the final worth of his property.\u201d     The diaper store nail house in Shanghai.", "Photograph: /Sue Anne Tay/Shanghai Street Stories    6."], "title": "City links: the best of the web", "article": " 1. The importance of the past in going forward \u201cWe presume ways of life that must change for the better: greener, more inclusive and shareable; global in orientation; away from land use regulations that favor separation of uses, and towards healthier, less auto-dependent realms,\u201d and there\u2019s a risk that this can make us forget to look at our past, writes Chuck Wolfe. \u201cI do not believe for a moment that urban change is so simple. Without a longer view, we risk undervaluing lessons learned long ago,\u201d he argues. \u201cWe now tend to disfavor sprawl as a solution to overcrowded conditions, and stress instead old standby\u2019s of increased height, cooperative living spaces and smaller dwellings.\u201d In this piece for myurbanist, he uses the case of Edinburgh to explain why our ability to meet current goals safely is reflective of what we learned centuries ago.  2. A place and time for urban art  \u201cFor the arts to be an inclusive experience, where can we house it?\u201d asks Vidhya Mohankumar. \u201cArt galleries and museums, yes; but it\u2019s common knowledge that the foot-fall at these places is an insignificant percentage of a city\u2019s population. In other words, art galleries and museums haven\u2019t been very successful in their public outreach (or haven\u2019t tried at all) and the arts have therefore remained with a niche interest group,\u201d she continues. In this piece for Urban Design Collective, she describes the interesting urban art project that\u2019s being tried in a shopping mall in the Indian city of Chennai with the objective of making the public engage with art and compares it with other projects such as Anish Kapoor\u2019s Cloud Gate (also known as \u201dThe Bean\u201d) in Chicago.  3. Two years of underground trips, in data Matt Johnson tracked every single Metro trip he took in Washington DC over two years, and offers the results in the form of glossy graphs in this blogpost. Among the things he discovered is that he has ridden on fewer than 75% of the cars. \u201cOne question I\u2019ve been asked several times is whether the cars move between lines very often. Surprisingly, they seem to. Of the 495 cars I\u2019ve ridden more than once, 60.4% have been on different lines,\u201d he explains. This, however, has its downsides: now that he tracks his delays, he knows his delay rate has quadrupled, hence he is more frustrated than the average mortal. Johnson\u2019s idea is a great one that we hope will be replicated by underground users from other cities. 4. Our relationships with historical buildings, through social media Geo-tagged photos are creating a new world to explore, \u201ca world which could change how we think about the built environment and its heritage\u201d according this blogpost on the English Heritage website. About half the adult population in England visit an historical town or city in a given year, according to this story, but the details of these visits have always been a bit unclear. Now, thanks to social media data, new trends are emerging around how people interact with buildings. A study used two million geo-tagged photos from Flickr. Not surprisingly, the buildings with the highest profiles attracted more photographs, with Saint Paul\u2019s cathedral at the top of the list.

Shanghai\u2019s diaper store nail house This week we also want to nab a post from the Shanghai Street Stories blog, even if it is a couple of weeks old. In it, Sue Anne Tay recounts the story of an unyelding man and his diaper shop, resisting \u2013 and therefore becoming a nail house \u2013 in the middle of the lilong neighborhood of Xinping Lane, which was in the midst of demolition. Her introduction makes you want to keep on reading: \u201cBy late January, the whole area bound by Shunchang Lu, Fuxing Lu (\u590d\u5174\u8def) and Hefei Lu (\u5408\u80a5\u8def) had been flattened, now a giant dustbowl for remaining scraps of wood and brick to be hauled off for sale. A hastily built concrete wall ran the perimeter of the area in anticipation of its next lease on life: luxury apartment, office building, a high-end mall or a rumored international school. Except for a single thatched structure, a shop flanked by tightly boarded up rooms. The lone ranger that has yet to complete the negotiations on the final worth of his property.\u201d     The diaper store nail house in Shanghai.

The world\u2019s worst smog cities We\u2019ve heard a lot about heavy smog in Chinese cities lately, but ever wondered what the top cities are when it comes to air pollution? The Deutsche Welle site made this gallery this week with the world\u2019s \u201cworst smog cities\u201d, and it turns out that there\u2019s a few surprises: you probably wouldn\u2019t guess that Ahwaz, in Iran, ranks the worst on the WHO\u2019s list when it comes to dirty air because of the high amount of heavy industry it has. It\u2019s followed by Ulan Bator, Mongolia, but cities such as Moscow and Mexico City also have a big smog problem, not helped by factors such as their geographical location or the way the wind blows. 7. A view from \u201cthe top of America\u201d And as an extra, we loved this interactive piece by Josh Sanburn for Time magazine about the construction of what is sure to become an architectural landmark of New York City, 1 World Trade Center \u2013 including a 360-degree view from the top, which is on the magazine\u2019s cover and is made up of 567 images taken over the course of five hours and stitched together.

Over the years, inspection has held up an impartial mirror to schools and governments alike, identifying what works and what needs to improve. It&apos;s because of this that parents turn to Ofsted reports to help them make their choices about a school. Even our fiercest critics argue in favour of retaining an independent inspectorate. In my view, Ofsted has never been more necessary with schools enjoying so much more autonomy and greater freedom. I wrote an article recently that asked for schools&apos; views on how we might inspect in future. I&apos;m grateful for the many and varied responses, including the thoughtful response from the Association of School and College Leaders and some of the interesting suggestions from former Her Majesty&apos;s Inspector (HMI) professor Colin Richards. Of course, there will be those whose contribution to this debate serves a particular interest. But we will listen to any ideas that genuinely reflect the mood of staffrooms, governors, heads and parents across the country. Most notably, despite their differences, a common theme across most responses is the need for inspection to reflect our current educational landscape. I&apos;m not referring to the rather odd suggestion that we should have a system where different kinds of taxpayer-funded schools are inspected to diverse standards by different inspectorates; parents want a single system to report on state schools, whether it&apos;s a maintained, academy or free school. But in a system where so many schools perform so well, the real issue facing us is how we should inspect good schools. This chimes with questions I have been asking about how we can give parents more up-to-date information about how well their child&apos;s school is doing. It can be five years between inspections, or even seven if a good school converts to an academy at the end of the inspection cycle. Parents should be able to expect more from inspectors during their child&apos;s time at a school. But it would make little sense, and be an unnecessary burden, if we did more full inspections than we do now. For one thing, only a small proportion of the good schools that we inspect decline one or more grade. Inspectors can always find things that could be better, of course, but is a full inspection always needed to do that? Once a full school inspection begins there is no turning back. Perhaps understandably, the high stakes that accompany a full inspection can limit the honest dialogue that is often a forerunner of improvement. More fundamentally still, when we do find that a good school has declined I usually ask myself how might we have spotted this earlier or if something else could have been done to halt the drop. I also worry that some schools are far too cautious about innovating to raise standards because of the imminent arrival of Ofsted. As long as they do the basic things right, we need more schools to innovate not fewer; innovation is often, if not always, a feature of outstanding schools and school systems. Look at the way mathematics is taught in Shanghai \u2013 different and very successful. Although there are many advantages to it, a fixed but lengthy cycle of full school inspections also has its drawbacks \u2013 it only gives parents sporadic assurance, it can discourage schools from trying out new things to raise standards, and it means that too many schools are inspected only after they have started to slide backwards. Here&apos;s another reason for changing what we do: many headteachers tell me that good schools often have to wait far too long before they can demonstrate that they have improved to outstanding. Perhaps we need a system that allows swifter identification of outstanding schools, and their leaders. After all, it is on this that so much of the new school-led system depends. None of this means that we want our schools to be awash with squadrons of inspectors, or have schools on perpetual inspection alert. In fact, it&apos;s quite the opposite. We want proportionate but regular contact between schools and HMIs. Not more full inspection but constructive and expert professional dialogue, which can add considerable impetus to a school&apos;s improvement. So I think it is worth looking seriously at the possibility of HMIs conducting more frequent, but short, monitoring inspections to good schools rather than doing full inspections. Such visits could be constructive as well as challenging, and would be reported on briefly to parents by letter. In turn, I believe this would lead to many more schools thinking &quot;well, we know we will see them reasonably regularly so let&apos;s just let them see us as we are&quot;. Importantly, when we would need to carry out a full inspection, I&apos;d want to use current school leaders and build on what we have achieved already in recruiting so many excellent serving practitioners. It&apos;s often overlooked that more than half of all school inspections now have a serving leader on the team and a growing number are being led by National Leaders of Education. I am determined to add even more to our ranks in the months ahead. I&apos;m not alone in this. All of us at Ofsted are giving serious thought to a new blueprint for how good schools might be inspected in the future. In doing so, we are listening hard to those who have joined the debate that we started. I&apos;m grateful that so many have done so. We&apos;ll continue to listen after Her Majesty&apos;s Chief Inspector sets out our direction of travel in more detail later on this month.

Double points, powertrains and nose jobs", "article": "1. POWERTRAINS What used to be called an engine but is now a combined group of components. The major element is still the engine with the 2.4-litre V8 replaced by a turbo-charged and quieter 1.6-litre V6. It combines with the new Energy Recovery System. Similar in concept to last year&apos;s Kers, the ERS harnesses energy under braking and from the turbo to deliver a larger and longer return. Making the package work is key in 2014. Mercedes seem to have it cracked with Ferrari not too far behind but Renault are desperately struggling. 2. FUEL LIMITATIONS Likely to be second only to engine performance in importance for the new season and intrinsically linked due to the increased energy return from ERS, the weight of fuel to be carried has dropped from 150kg to 100kg. It is enough to make it to the chequered flag but will require careful management in-race, with drivers having to adapt their strategy while racing to ensure best performance. 3. DOUBLE POINTS Unloved, unwanted and unnecessary. The decision to award double points in the final race was derided by drivers and greeted with anger by fans, rightly suggesting it was a facile ploy that devalued the rest of the season. Nonetheless, in an embarrassing bid to try to make the season go to the wire, 50 points will be on offer in Abu Dhabi. 4. NEW BOYS Of which there are three but expect all the attention to fall on Kevin Magnussen, who was the surprise choice for McLaren over Sergio P\u00e9rez late last season. The 21-year-old was already part of the McLaren family in their young driver programme. He&apos;s quick and is a Formula Renault champion but the team will not only measure him on track; the importance of in-season development means technical feedback will be key. Red Bull promote Russian Daniil Kvyat from their junior driver programme to Toro Rosso, while Swede Marcus Ericsson brings a large sum of money to Caterham. 5.

His talk is headlined Housing in London: Population and the Economy. We can guess at its thesis with confidence.  The Conservative mayor will surely highlight the huge, persistent gap between the number of extra homes London urgently needs and the much smaller number built over the years. It seems impossible that he won&apos;t draw attention to the capital&apos;s prodigious, birth-led population boom and I would be very surprised if he&apos;s not tempted to include a passing, crowd-pleasing reference to his own contribution to this phenomenon (it wouldn&apos;t be the first time; or the second). But most important will be the message he sends to the great assemblage of footloose mega-wealth - choose London and I will take care of you. Johnson&apos;s eagerness to smooth the way for global financial interests in bricks, mortar and land is a defining strand of his second mayoral term and perhaps the purest expression of what lies behind its masthead theme of more jobs and growth. For Johnson, the housing crisis and the soaring value of London property are not reinforcing aspects of the same problem but a dream test case for his deep-dyed faith in the ability of unencumbered market forces to solve all ills.  His answer to objections that far too much of what&apos;s being built is far too expensive for those Londoners (and would-be Londoners) in greatest need is not to use his powers and influence to mitigate this but to facilitate an increase - his extraordinary intervention over the Mount Pleasant site is but the most public manifestation of this.  Of course, Ken Livingstone too wooed foreign investment  into London. He, though, took a different approach on housing. His &quot;50% rule,&quot; which signalled a readiness to stick his mayoral oar in should any borough consent to a major private sector housing scheme in which less than half the dwellings proposed were &quot;affordable&quot; in some shape or form, was neither fully observed nor always imposed. But at least it stated plainly that any bargain between the narrow interests of private capital and the broader, more important ones of London as a whole might be hard struck. We could do with a lot more of that attitude. Johnson, by contrast, wants the world so know that he is a soft touch. His fig leaf is the slow recovery from the credit crunch - better to get something built than nothing - but his readiness to see great lumps of the capital crushed and reconstructed as sterile wealth enclaves demonstrates yet again the shallowness of his vision for the city&apos;s evolution compared with that of his predecessor. But if Johnson recipe&apos;s a dud, where are the bold yet plausible alternatives? A demonstration was held outside City Hall last week protesting that the mayor, along with representatives from many London boroughs, will use MIPIM to set up yet more deals resulting in regeneration plans, often including the sale of public land, that produce posh shops and grand hotels but very few low cost homes, and which can entail the eviction and displacement of established communities. They have a point about MIPIM, but if they were in charge what would they be doing instead? If the answer is spending a lot more public money, where will it come from? Elsewhere, the debate about London&apos;s housing problems lacks consistency, precision and perspective. Today&apos;s Observer declaims the now familiar left-ish case that &quot;foreign wealth&quot; is &quot;pricing out&quot; even the affluent middle-class, with those on average salaries &quot;exiled from their own city.&quot;  Steady on. In the first place, the size of the effect of &quot;foreign wealth&quot; - is that of British wealth OK? - is contested. Savills, which lives and breathes this stuff, questions the scale of its effects on the mainstream part of the market (beyond &quot;prime central&quot;) and believes commonplace accusations that many overseas investors &quot;buy-to-leave&quot; are greatly overplayed, with most answering the capital&apos;s pressing need for more private rental stock. Spectacular examples of abandoned &quot;ghost mansions&quot; may scandalise, but shouldn&apos;t command undue attention. Even those who argue (persuasively) for a new tax on property speculation are careful not to overstate their case. A sense of scale is often abandoned in other areas too. The proportion of homes in the capital that are owner-occupied has fallen by about seven percent this century, but is still only slightly less than half. Occupants of most of those households aren&apos;t being &quot;exiled&quot; by rising prices, they&apos;re getting asset-rich. If they move out of the city it will mostly be from choice - and possibly into a small palace - just as Londoners have chosen to for decades. It is the would-be first time buyer who is struggling. Some are sceptical about share ownership schemes, but an enhanced expansion in availability of this type of &quot;intermediate&quot; home seems worth exploring.  As the parent of London-born, grown-up children, I know a bit about that. But, hey, comrades, aren&apos;t we supposed to be ditching our obsession with home ownership and embracing continental-style private renting? In any case, London may be becoming a private renting city, like it or not. There a strong case for fostering far more steady investment and introducing much better regulation in this part of the territory.  Discussion about social housing too is often short on context. Great campaigns are mounted against the destruction of symbolic estates where, for all the impact of right-to-buy, social rent has remained the dominant tenure. Yet while such &quot;regeneration&quot; exercises are often driven by questionable motives and too often cause more problems than they solve, it&apos;s important to remember that a quarter of all London&apos;s housing stock remains for social rent - barely a rounding error less than it was in 2000. Whatever the coalition might secretly wish, the vast majority of London&apos;s current social housing tenants are not going to be victims of &quot;social cleansing&quot; - a term that&apos;s losing force from over-use - any time soon.  Some boroughs, notably the Boris-friendly Hammersmith and Fulham, are dedicated to reducing the amount of such accommodation they possess. But in Labour-run Southwark and Hackney over 40% of homes are social rented ones, their secure tenants insulated against the raging heat of local market conditions and their councils committed to building more. A good thing too. In this part of the London housing crisis picture, tackling overcrowding should be the number one concern.  It will take a great deal more than denouncing the odd sale of a derelict council house or complaining about rich foreigners to produce the 50,000 extra homes London is reckoned to require each year for the foreseeable future, especially if (as Savills research underlines), the biggest demand for it is coming from households bringing in less than \u00a350,000 a year. At the same time, it is a stark fact that courting rich foreigners remains one of the better bets for cash-strapped boroughs wrestling with strained budgets, tired amenities, deep poverty and high unemployment.  Commenting on Newham&apos;s marketing pitch at the 2010 Shanghai Expo, which a spoke of a &quot;regeneration supernova&quot; exploding across the borough, Ben Campkin writes in his new book on the thinking that has informed regeneration efforts in London - which I&apos;ll be discussing with him at an event on Monday - that &quot;it is easy to understand the desperate tone of the marketing effort [when] local politicians and planners have to manage the borough&apos;s high levels of debt and its massive housing waiting list within the context of government welfare cuts.&quot; Only too easy, I&apos;m afraid.", "tags": ["Society", "Regeneration", "Social housing", "Boris Johnson", "London", "London politics", "Politics", "Ken Livingstone", "Property", "Money"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-09T16:46:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/mar/10/rolls-royce-deal-miners-down-china", "sentences": ["However the greater concern may well be debt, with Friday marking the first default in China&apos;s corporate bond market from Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy."], "title": "Rolls-Royce roars ahead after deal but mining shares hit by Chinese worries", "article": "After recent declines, leading shares are moving higher again, with Rolls-Royce roaring ahead after it took control of a power systems joint venture.

Daimler has exercised its right to sell its shareholding to Rolls, which will pay for the stake, said to be worth around \u00a31.9bn, with a mixture of cash and debt. Rolls has jumped 27p to \u00a310.53, but Finnish engine maker Wartsila has fallen back as analysts said Rolls was now less likely to bid for the business. In a buy note Liberum analysts said:  Rolls has ample liquidity to fund [the deal] from existing facilities.

Overall markets have shaken off a slide in Asian markets following poor export data from China over the weekend and continuing concerns about the situation in Ukraine. So despite the worries, the FTSE 100 is currently 31.29 points higher at 6743.96. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, said:  You might have expected more of a negative reaction from European markets this morning given the weekend&apos;s events, but equities remain defiant despite rising concerns in both China and the Ukraine.  Chinese stocks were down 3% overnight after suffering on more than one front from the weekend&apos;s news. Exports sank 18% in February against average estimates of a near 7.5% rise, casting further doubts over China&apos;s ability to hit the 7.5% growth target set by Premier Li. However the greater concern may well be debt, with Friday marking the first default in China&apos;s corporate bond market from Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy. Bulls will hope that the decision to allow the failure shows a hard stance from Beijing that might curb reckless lending, but &quot;debt crisis&quot; is a term that still strikes fear into the majority of investors and in the short term Chinese markets seem more that a little concerned of what is still to come.  Mining stocks have been hit by the concerns about a slowdown in China, a key consumer of commodities. Fresnillo has fallen 29p to \u00a313.76, while BHP Billiton is down 27p at 1821.5p and Antofagasta has lost 12p to 865p. Elsewhere Vodafone is 3.7p lower at 234.95p after reports it had offered \u20ac7bn for Spanish cable company Ono. Back with the risers, paper maker Mondi is up 27p at \u00a311.18 after Citigroup moved from neutral to buy and raised its price target from \u00a311 to \u00a312.60. Citi said:  Mondi continues to deliver rising returns (return on capital employed of 17% forecast for 2014), strong earnings growth (18% year on year underlying earnings per share growth and 7% EBITDA growth in 2014) and rising dividends at an attractive valuation, on our estimates.

While animal testing of cosmetics is still allowed in most countries, China is the only country that actually requires it. Because of this a number of companies have refused to sell their products in China, despite the lure of the $32bn market. Despite The Body Shop saying it does not operate in mainland China, for at least the past year Body Shop products have been on sale in at least two Chinese airports, according to Choice. A representative of The Body Shop Australia confirmed to Guardian Australia the company does now sell in Chinese airports. Duty-free cosmetics in China are free from the mandatory pre-market animal testing regulation, but they are subject to random spot tests by Chinese authorities after they hit the shelves. \u201cIt\u2019s a standard part of the Chinese cosmetic regulation process,\u201d Choice\u2019s chief executive, Alan Kirkland, told Guardian Australia. \u201cChinese officials have said to us there is no way that a product sold in airports could be guaranteed to be exempt from that. There is no way they can guarantee those products are not tested on animals.\u201d There are two types of post-market testing, Choice spokeswoman and investigator Zoya Sheftalovich told Guardian Australia. In one, the China Food and Drug Association takes samples from products on the shelves within six months of registration and tests them on animals to make sure they comply with regulations, Sheftalovich said.  \u201cThe second type of post-market testing, which is the type that can happen in airports, is when they just go in and randomly take products of the shelves and test them for various things,\u201d she said, adding that this was the testing The Body Shop would be subjected to. \u201cIn terms of how they\u2019re actually conducting the testing [that] is a question for the authorities themselves. They can conduct microbiological testing, or they can choose to conduct animal testing. \u201cThe risk is there, and I think in light of the strength of their statements they have made \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough that they\u2019re willing to take a risk of animal testing at all.\u201d The Body Shop has long marketed itself heavily on its ethical stance against animal testing, and has previously said it would never sell in mainland China because of the animal testing requirement. \u201cThis is the central claim on which the whole Body Shop brand has been built over time,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201c\u2018Against animal testing\u2019 was their tagline for many years, and it still is a central selling point for consumers. We just think you can\u2019t have it both ways. You can\u2019t be against animal testing and sell in China at the same time.\u201d The executive chairman of The Body Shop Australia, Graeme Wise, told Choice the company did not designate airports as \u201cin-country\u201d because of the lack of mandatory pre-market testing required. \u201cWe feel like The Body Shop is being shifty here because its statements are contradictory,\u201d Kirkland said. As recently as November, The Body Shop was named as a company which \u201cheld firm\u201d against animal testing by Cruelty Free International and is \u201cleaping bunny\u201d certified by the organisation. \u201cThe Body Shop believes passionately that no animal should be harmed because of the cosmetics industry and we have a long commitment to this cause,\u201d Paul McGreevy, International Values and R&amp;D director of The Body Shop, told CFI. CFI\u2019s policy director, Dr Nick Palmer, told Guardian Australia it objected to all animal testing. \u201cWe would oppose companies selling in China \u2013 whether in airports or elsewhere \u2013 in conditions that are likely to lead to animal testing, and welcome those companies who have decided not to export cosmetics to China for that reason,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not so far been approached by companies finding that their products are subject to post-marketing testing using animals.\u201d In June this year amendments to China\u2019s animal testing policies come into force, which would allow domestically manufactured products to avoid animal testing. However, the softening of regulation won\u2019t yet apply to international imports, and post-market testing is likely to be strengthened, Humane Society International predicts. The Body Shop said at the time of the announcement it would \u201cexplore opportunities\u201d in China once it had more details about the amendments. \u201cAs the first beauty company to take action against animal testing for cosmetics, these reports mark a truly historic moment,\u201d said Jeremy Schwartz, chief executive and chairman. The Body Shop was acquired by L\u2019Or\u00e9al in 2006 for \u00a3652m. About 19% of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s annual sales occur in China, according to Bloomberg. Travel retail news site The Moodie Report said in 2012 The Body Shop opened a number of new duty-free outlets, including in Shanghai. A L\u2019Or\u00e9al spokeswoman told Guardian Australia it had always felt animal testing of products in China was not needed. \u201cWe support the introduction of the alternative methods to animal testing that are already accepted internationally,\u201d she said. Choice told Guardian Australia it had also received reports of Body Shop products being sold in the Chinese high street market, but were unable to confirm if the products were legitimate imports or grey market.

On a working farm. In the rain. And rain. And mud. If a book can capture the attention of a 5 year old, 3 year old and 1 year old with prolonged cabin fever then it is a winner in my view. This book did just that for about 15 minutes... The Amazing Jobs book in the Lonely Planet World Search series selects a random choice of jobs and makes them very exciting by where the jobs are based: Vets in the jungle of Central Africa, roller-blading French police officers in Paris, Flying Doctors in Australia, Sherpas on Mount Everest, Bollywood movies and finally, Rangers in Yellowstone Park, USA. The locations of these jobs are a fantastic twist on your standard &apos;different type of jobs&apos; books, but I can&apos;t help but feel that these will be uber confusing for the kids when we see a policeman in the UK and he&apos;s not gliding on roller-blades or the doctor on call doesn&apos;t require a helipad. But hey. This is a family review, not just me. The books are good quality with clear text on the inside of each flap. The kids loved discovering the flaps (there&apos;s around 5 per page) and lifting them to reveal the fact. The illustrations are good (flag of each country is on the page - educational box ticked!) but not mind blowing. There&apos;s also a &apos;can you find&apos; picture - which the kids loved finding as well as free stickers (always a bonus). This book kept the children occupied for about 15 minutes (just below average). It wasn&apos;t enough to keep them going for any longer. Rosie (aged 5) was more interested in this book than Sam (age 3) so would recommend this for early school age. They enjoyed the bright colours but weren&apos;t as completely engrossed in it as I had hoped. A good book, not brilliant, but did the job :) 4 out of 5 Lonely Planet World Search: BUSY PLACES Busy Places, looks at various places around the world including the usual: Paris, New York and Sydney but also chucks in some different ones for good measure: Marrakech and Shanghai for example. Not necessarily ones you would find in a children&apos;s book about places so this makes a refreshing change.  Like the other books in the Lonely Planet series, there are plenty of flaps on each page which the kids love looking for and opening up. The illustrations in the book are very good with many landmarks included as well as the national flag. The pages are bright and busy and each different location provides a nice contrast. There&apos;s also tick boxes at the end of the book to go back and find the pictures as well as &apos;can you find&apos; on each page, giving this book an extra few minutes of reading with the children. Rosie, aged 5 was very inquisitive about the places and asked loads of questions about each location. I think this would be a great book if going on a family holiday abroad to one of the destinations. A really fun way of exploring different places around the world, definitely recommended. 5 out of 5 Lonely Planet World Search : INCREDIBLE ANIMALS Incredible Animals, looks at different habitats around the world and the animals which inhabit them. Whilst the locations are not your run of the mill locations, such as the rocky mountains of the Andes and the Australian Outback they do add a uniqueness to this book.  Like the other books in this series, the pages are busy with colourful pictures and lots of flaps for the children to lift and read. However, for a book concentrating on animals I would have liked the illustrations to be better. I&apos;m not professing to be Quentin Blake but I&apos;m sure I could draw something better and the animals could be a lot more detailed. A bit disappointing if I&apos;m honest.  That aside, the location choices are great, the &apos;find the&apos; section, stickers and checklist all provide for an interesting and engaging book. Better for early school years. Rosie (age 5) enjoyed this book and the others in the series and found the investigating flaps and learning about animals etc interesting. This book grabbed her attention for 10 minutes. I would have hoped she would have been more interested and I think the illustrations may have had something to do with that.

Every year many tangled sets of lights end up in recycling bins, but where do they go after that?  There is a very good chance that they ended up in a small town called Shijiao in Guangdong province in southern China where they are taken apart and used to make other things such as slipper soles. What happens to Christmas tree lights is just a very small part of a massive industry that makes its profits from making things out of stuff we throw out. The global recycling industry is the subject of Junkyard Planet: Travels in the Billion-Dollar Trash Trade by journalist Adam Minter.  Minter takes a look at how the industry, in which China plays a central role, transforms our rubbish back into things we want to buy. It is a business that Minter knows well. He is the son of a scrapyard owner in the United States and spent much time working in the family business. He remembers that a lot of the scrap at their yard would be sent to China and he felt that when he came to China he was &quot;hitching a ride on my family&apos;s junk&quot;. When he came to China working as a freelance journalist, he visited scrapyards and wrote about the industry and despite being many miles from home in a country with a different language and culture, he felt somewhat at home. &quot;As someone who has grown up in the industry and around people who work in it, knowing my great grandfather and my great grandmother who did the very basic things like breaking brass from steel plumbing and I would see it in China and I felt a very deep kinship with the workers as well, right away I felt that these were my people in a sense.&quot; In the book, Minter follows the journey of our unwanted stuff as it makes its way from being rubbish to being recycled into something new. He travels from a sorting plant in Texas in the United States to Guangdong Province in southern China, which he describes as the &quot;de facto headquarters of China&apos;s recycling industry&quot;. As China&apos;s economy has grown, so too has its need for raw materials to fuel the factories that make a vast array of products from smart phones to those slipper soles and the country&apos;s vast infrastructure from tower blocks to railways and roads.  China now leads in the world as the biggest consumer of metals but doesn&apos;t have the resources to fuel demand. There has been much publicity about China&apos;s hunt for resources abroad, mostly in developing countries but not so widely known is that recycling plays a huge role in quenching its thirst for raw materials. Minter tells me that approximately half of China&apos;s copper supply now comes from imported scrap metal. While China imports huge amounts of recycling from Europe and the US, its booming economic has also created a consumer society which, just like us generates a lot of rubbish. In Europe we consider recycling to be a good deed and feel virtuous when we put our Sunday newspapers in the green bin and bring our bottles to the bottle bank. However in China there are no green bins, no bottle banks and no centralised recycling system. But despite this, a higher volume of waste is recycled.  While there are no reliable statistics of how much of China&apos;s household waste is recycled, Minter tells me that nothing gets sent to landfill if it can possibly be recycled or reused. He says it comes down to money, recycling is driven by an economic imperative in China. This says Minter is why the recycling industry is so successful here and which is essential to ensure our rubbish is reused. &quot;Without financial incentives, no ethical system is going to transform an old beer can into a new one,&quot; he says. The recycling industry in China is informal but extremely lucrative and employs a lot of people, more than in any other industry except agriculture, says Minter. A walk along any street in Shanghai shows a booming recycling chain in operation. There may be someone pulling plastic take away boxes from the rubbish bin, while someone else cycles past on a bike pulling a small trailer ringing a bell, the call for people to bring out their recyclable goods for which he will pay the equivalent of a few pence for. When he has a full load he will then sell it onto someone with a bigger vehicle and up and up the chain goes, everyone making money along the way. As Minter and I talk rubbish in a small caf\u00e9 in the Former French Concession in Shanghai sure enough we hear the ubiquitous tinkle of a bell outside calling for recycling to buy. While ultimately it is providing an environmental service, recycling industries in China also have some negative impacts. In the book, Minter describes clouds of black smoke rising from junkyards as the plastic is melted to get to the wire inside. But he also points out that in his experience &quot;the worst, dirtiest recycling is still better than the very best clear-cut forest or the most up-to-date open pit mine&quot;. He does not try to downplay the negative impacts but says it is a very necessary industry. &quot;To be sure not every recycler is an environmentalist and not every recycling industry is the sort of place you would want to take kindergarteners for a field trip. But in an age of conspicuous consumption, the global recycling business has taken on the burden of cleaning up what you don&apos;t want and turning into something you can&apos;t wait to buy.&quot; There has been many media reports into recycling industries in Asia depicting toxic fumes and exploited workers. But Minter says this is a simplistic view and that rarely do these reports talk to the workers themselves about why they got into the industry. &quot;I&apos;ve been reporting a long time in China and I&apos;ve yet to find anyone who has been enslaved in a scrapyard. One of the primary reasons that people go and work in this business s that the wages tend to be higher than factory wages,&quot; he says. Minter says there is some &quot;ill feeling&quot; about the industry in the west and that comes from our notion that recycling is a good deed. &quot;I think people who look at recycling as this good deed find something really dirty about the idea that people want to make money from it. It&apos;s not supposed to be about making money from it, it&apos;s supposed to be about doing something from the earth. &quot;It&apos;s one of the central messages of the book, whether we like it or not, nothing is going to get recycled without an economic incentive. Who is going to do it? That&apos;s a hard message for some people to take.&quot;", "tags": ["Environment", "China", "World news", "Recycling", "Pollution"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-11T14:51:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/body-shop-removes-products-from-chinese-duty-free-stores", "sentences": ["Later that evening, the Body Shop released a statement in which it restated its policy of no animal testing and claimed the Beijing and Shanghai airport duty-free stores \u201care treated differently to mainland Chinese mandatory regulation\u201d."], "title": "Body Shop removes all its products from Chinese duty-free stores", "article": "The Body Shop has removed all its products from duty-free shelves in China after it was revealed the ethical company\u2019s products were at risk of testing on animals by the country\u2019s authorities.

Then late yesterday this statement comes out and it still fails to clarify their position.\u201d While airport-sold products are not subject to mandatory animal testing required for general sale in China, duty-free sales are still subject to random post-market testing, which can include tests on animals. Choice said this was too great a risk for a company that identifies itself by its ethical stance. \u201cChinese officials have said to us there is no way that a product sold in airports could be guaranteed to be exempt from that. There is no way they can guarantee those products are not tested on animals,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201c \u2018Against animal testing\u2019 was their tagline for many years, and it still is a central selling point for consumers.

The amendments will not apply to international imports, however, and the Humane Society International predicts post-market testing is likely to be strengthened. The Body Shop said at the time of the announcement of the new regulations that it would \u201cexplore opportunities\u201d in China once it had more details. \u201cAs the first beauty company to take action against animal testing for cosmetics, these reports mark a truly historic moment,\u201d its chief executive and chairman, Jeremy Schwartz, said.

Copper in particular is under pressure, since the metal is used for collateral for some of the opaque loans in China&apos;s shadow banking system, and if these go bad, the market could be flooded with selling. So Antofagasta is down 7p at 833p while BHP Billiton is 33p lower at \u00a317.79. Away from mining, one of the day&apos;s biggest fallers in the leading index is G4S, down 9.1p to 236.3p following lower than expected profits. The security group reported a 2.8% rise in underlying profits to \u00a3442m but this was below forecasts of \u00a3455m. But with a spate of charges including \u00a3136m relating to repayment to the UK government for overcharging on a tagging contract knocked profits back to \u00a356m, down 85%.

The FTSE 100 closed at 6620.90, down 64.62 points, its worst since 10 February, after disappointing trade data from China at the weekend pointed to a possible slowdown in the country, a key consumer of commodities. A bond default last week by a Chinese solar company raised concerns about the credit situation, with bonds in a similar business suspended on Tuesday on the Shanghai exchange. Copper in particular came under renewed pressure in early trading, since the metal is used for collateral for some of the opaque loans in China&apos;s shadow banking system, and if these go bad, the market could be flooded with selling. The metal made a slight recovery towards the end of the day but is still down sharply from recent levels. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG said:  Equity markets have come under pressure around the world as copper prices continue to fall following weak economic data from China. Although copper prices have bounced slightly today, the drop through three-year lows on Tuesday unnerved markets. Throw in some headlines about Russian movements in Crimea, and you have the recipe for a continuing selloff.    But gold seemed to regain some of its lustre as a safe haven, helping push precious metals miner Fresnillo 18p higher to 900p while African Barrick Gold added 10p to 260p. African Barrick was hit on Tuesday after a 10% stake sale by majority owner Barrick Corporation. Elsewhere Prudential put on 37p to \u00a313.98, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 after operating profits for 2013 jumped 17% to \u00a32.95bn, the top end of analyst forecasts, helped by double digit growth in Asian markets. The insurer was also boosted by news it was expanding a partnership with Standard Chartered to distribute its life assurance products. A Vodafone added 3.3p to 229.55p as the market awaits the outcome of the mobile phone group&apos;s reported \u20ac7bn offer for Spanish cable company Ono. The day&apos;s biggest faller in the leading index is G4S, down 12.9p to 232.5p following lower than expected profits. The security group reported a 2.8% rise in underlying profits to \u00a3442m but this was below forecasts of \u00a3455m.

International Airlines Group edged up 0.8p to 444.8p after a positive note from Liberum. The broker said:  British Airways will remain the main driver of IAG&apos;s performance. However, the turnaround at Iberia should not be underestimated. Although still loss-making, the path to profitability through better productivity, headcount reductions and long-term wage moderation is clear. An acceptable margin on \u20ac4bn of revenue at Iberia would add materially to the group result. We see scope for the group&apos;s 2015 \u20ac1.8bn operating profit target to be exceeded (our forecast is \u20ac1.96bn). Our recommendation remains buy with an increased target price of 550p (previously 450p).  British Gas owner Centrica, up 0.9p to 327.9p, was boosted by analysts at Berenberg. Lawson Steele and Andrew Fisher upgraded their recommendation from hold to buy with a 365p price target, saying:  We have to live with political risk in UK energy supply. We have to live with various other headwinds to growth, too. However, we also believe that Centrica&apos;s current valuation offers enough to take on these risks. This includes an estimated \u00a3200m per annum pre-tax impact from government intervention. Our resulting blue sky valuation range of 331p-399p also suggests a reasonable risk-reward balance. Yes, the group faces challenges and this is by no means a stock for the faint-hearted, but despite all else, Centrica has not suddenly become a bad business overnight. It still has a healthy balance sheet and good cash flow generation.  Meanwhile Credit Suisse issued a neutral recommendation, saying:  We believe self-help in the upstream gas and oil production is the key part of the turnaround. We also see an improving UK economy helping British Gas, and believe a price freeze by any future government will be unworkable without taking cost into general taxation.   Among the mid-caps, Kenmare Resources, which operates the Moma titanium minerals mine in Mozambique, fell 0.95p or 6.5% to 13.55p after reporting a $44m loss for 2013 compared to a $49.5m profit the previous year. It has completed its investment in Moma and restructured its debt, but commodity price falls hit cashflow and profitability and it suffered from power supply problems. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said:  Revenue and costs were below our forecasts due to accounting adjustments related to the expansion; adjusting for these brought revenues, costs and EBITDA in line with RBC. Kenmare is trading at a significant discount to our 36p a share net asset value because of soft product markets and the impact on output of erratic power. Resolving the latter with generation-sets could be a catalyst for stronger investment performance.  But Hikma Pharmaceuticals was 54p higher at \u00a315.27 after full year profits more than doubled, helped by strong demand and higher prices for doxycycline, an antibiotic to treat bacterial infections such as Lyme disease. In a busy day for retail news, online grocer Ocado fell 33p to 539p despite saying a rise in first quarter sales put it on track to make a maiden pretax profit this year. The company, which has a partnership with Waitrose and more recently signed a \u00a3200m deal to provide Morrisons&apos; online service, said sales had risen 18% to \u00a3218.8m in the twelve weeks to the end of February. But this was a slowdown from the 20% gain in the 16 weeks to December. Elsewhere French Connection added 0.25p to 63.25p after the fashion retailer reporting improved results, with an annual loss of \u00a34.4m compared to a deficit of \u00a37.2m a year earlier. It said expenses were lower and second half trading was stronger in its key UK and European markets. Two more retailers joined the stock market, with mixed results. Poundland priced its shares at 300p each and saw them rise to 370p in conditional dealings, but Pets at Home fell from its offer price of 245p to close at 238p.", "tags": ["Business", "Fresnillo", "African Barrick Gold", "Prudential", "Vodafone", "G4S", "British American Tobacco", "Hammerson", "International Airlines Group", "Centrica", "Hikma Pharmaceuticals", "Ocado", "Poundland", "Pets at Home"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-12T16:59:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/mar/12/agencies-closed-creative-ecosystem", "sentences": ["But, for those outside the AIC the idea of flying 26 global advertising creative leaders to Shanghai for a week of judging and celebration seems like an analogue artifact in a digital world.", "While I&apos;m sure many would love to go to Shanghai today&apos;s rising creatives and strategists don&apos;t have time."], "title": "Agencies are becoming a closed, shrinking creative system", "article": "I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s happened in the last few years but the agency business has becoming a closed, shrinking creative system. Every day the best and brightest young talent leaves the industry to join (or just bypass the industry all together) digital alternatives from start-ups to established digital players and other, more innovative established players in other industries (IDEO is an example). They might think of themselves in the marketing and advertising businesses but they don&apos;t want to take the traditional path. Working their way up through the creative ranks not only seems too slow but much too political and bureaucratic. Likewise, it&apos;s hard for many of the long timers in the Agency Industrial Complex (AIC) to understand. The long held and established career path with its rewards and perks seduces them. A great example of which came across the industry&apos;s social media feed with posts from the #Andys50 judging, a boondoggle of sorts for the industries creative elite. It looks like they had a blast and set a brass ring for those inside the AIC to grab for. But, for those outside the AIC the idea of flying 26 global advertising creative leaders to Shanghai for a week of judging and celebration seems like an analogue artifact in a digital world. While I&apos;m sure many would love to go to Shanghai today&apos;s rising creatives and strategists don&apos;t have time. They&apos;re busy building digital businesses and launching their own projects in the world of abundant and free media. The reality is that we&apos;re living in a flat world where everyone from everywhere has the same technology and, with that technology are gaining the same skills to compete with anyone else. You don&apos;t become conservative until you have something to conserve. And there are many folks in the AIC that have a lot to protect. Today why is a 54 year old (my age) creative director or strategist worth 5X more than an up and coming talent in Brazil or Asia? Especially, when they have thousands of followers and viewers on social media platforms. In this new paradigm, shouldn&apos;t it be a meritocracy? Shouldn&apos;t the best ideas win? That&apos;s what the industry talks about in award shows like the Andys. Maybe they should put asterisk after the award show names like Andys*, and explain that non-club members need not apply. Many times, the best marketing and advertising ideas are not produced by agencies. Not only do they not enter the award shows they don&apos;t even know they exist or care. If the ad industry is to stay relevant it must open to change. Clients want it. Consumers want it. It must let go and jump into this new world of abundance. Where ideas can come from anywhere. There are a few brave souls already pioneering the way. We&apos;ve been experimenting with lots of ways to apply open creativity and strategy and are constantly inspired by folks like Patagonia for asking the big questions and engaging their customers, Co: as they collectively help brands from storytelling to story doing and the Minneapolis, MN based agency, StoneArch that conduct 24 hour strategy and creative for local non-profits with their partners both inside and outside the walls of the agency. Innovation comes from the fringes and these are only a few, early movers that signal the rising tide of change. Creativity is a universal human desire. Why should anyone limit that? What right do we have, as an industry to be so small minded as to say that others can&apos;t participate. Instead of being angry and exclusive maybe we should celebrate the fact that great ideas do come from everywhere and show up in many forms. Let&apos;s stop being so conservative and conserving the AIC as it withers and start celebrating creativity from everywhere, injecting new blood into the industry allowing it to transform into something new and more relevant.

Premier Li Keqiang told lenders to China&apos;s private sector factories they should expect debt defaults as the world&apos;s second largest economy encounters &quot;serious challenges&quot; in the year ahead. Speaking after the annual session of the national people&apos;s congress, Li Keqiang said: &quot;We are going to confront serious challenges this year and some challenges may be even more complex.&quot; He told lenders to China&apos;s private sector factories they should expect debt defaults. Li said China must &quot;ensure steady growth, ensure employment, avert inflation and defuse risks&quot; while also fighting pollution, among other tasks. &quot;So we need to strike a proper balance amidst all these goals and objectives,&quot; he added. &quot;This is not going to be easy,&quot; he said. Li&apos;s warning followed the failure of Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy to make a payment on a 1bn yuan (\u00a3118m) bond last week. The default was the first of its kind for China and widely seen as pointing to the end of 11th-hour government bailouts for troubled enterprises. Some analysts said the decision to let some indebted firms collapse was a sign the authorities had learned from the Japanese boom and bust experience of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Tokyo was plunged into two &quot;lost&quot; decades of stagnation after it prevented zombie companies from declaring bankruptcy \u2013 even blocking petitions from bondholders in the courts - when a property collapse exposed debts many times the value of their businesses. However, figures this week revealed that Beijing is copying the Japanese tactic of ramping up public infrastructure spending to replace the steep slowdown in private sector investment. Fixed asset investment, a measure of government spending on infrastructure, expanded 17.9% during the first two months of 2014, the National Bureau of Statistics said. China&apos;s industrial production rose at its slowest pace in five years with surveys showing a faster slowdown than expected. Industrial output, which measures production at factories, workshops and mines, rose 8.6% in January and February year on year, which is the lowest pace of growth since the 7.3% annual growth figure recorded in April 2009. The figures covered a two-month period owing to China&apos;s lunar new year holiday week, which fell in both months. Retail sales gained 11.8% in the two months from the year before, the lowest since an 11.6% increase in February 2011. The pessimistic data surprised economists but followed indicators for manufacturing, trade and inflation that also suggested weakness in China&apos;s economy. China&apos;s GDP grew 7.7% in 2013, unchanged from the year before, the slowest growth since 1999. Li said this month that Beijing was targeting economic growth of about 7.5% in 2014, the same target as last year. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a research note that the results were a confirmation of &quot;fast deterioration of China&apos;s economic growth&quot;. But Julian Evans-Pritchard, Asia economist for Capital Economics, said officials were unlikely to intervene. &quot;Limited and seasonally distorted data over the last few weeks have made it difficult to make sense of what&apos;s really happening in China&apos;s economy,&quot; he said in a note. &quot;Despite this broad evidence of a slowdown, we don&apos;t think policymakers will necessarily step in to support growth,&quot; he said, adding that officials were &quot;comfortable with a moderate slowdown&quot;. The figures come as China&apos;s leadership says it wants to transform the growth model away from an over-reliance on often wasteful investment, making private demand the driver for the country&apos;s development. A reliance on public sector investment while the private sector rebalances away from low margin manufacturing relies for its success on the economy maintaining the government&apos;s growth target. Li said: &quot;Last year, without taking any additional short-term stimulus measures, we succeeded in meeting our target. Why can&apos;t we do this this year?&quot; He emphasised the target was approximate. &quot;This &apos;about&apos; shows that there is a level of flexibility here.&quot; At any rate, he said authorities were not focused on the figure itself, but how it contributes to improving livelihoods, saying growth &quot;needs to ensure fairly full employment and needs to help increase people&apos;s income&quot;.", "tags": ["China", "Li Keqiang", "Asia Pacific", "Bankruptcy and IVAs", "World news", "Business", "Money", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-13T20:29:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/mar/14/city-links-best-of-the-web", "sentences": ["Shipping containers reinvented as new homes for Shanghai\u2019s migrant workers  Many migrant workers in Shanghai have long been living in deplorable conditions \u2013 some of them even in homes built out of containers, and for years."], "title": "City links: the best of the web", "article": "1. Uncovering abandoned sex museums and decrepit amusement parks Urban exploration has been gaining adepts for a while now, and it seems to be the go-to-hobby for the adventurous souls who need tangible and risky thrills in city environments. Now, the Japanese have given it a name, haikyo, and are taking it to structures such as abandoned amusement parks and old sex museums. This CNN reportage follows the steps of German Florian Seidel, who has been seeking out and visiting crumbling Japanese infrastructures for five years. He visited two abandoned sex museums which have been deserted for a decade \u2013 after the advent of the Internet, he says \u2013 but still maintain quite a lot of their charm, so to speak. \u201cThe one in Hokkaido he remembers best for the bizarre shooting games and taxidermy animals in sexual positions -- horses and monkeys\u201d, writes Kate Whitehead.

Cities we lost This Al-Jazeera article follows the history of cities that were once pan-Mediterranean hubs such as Alexandria and which, in the last century, have been losing a lot of their character though demolition. In the context of political and economic crises in Turkey and Greece or the strife in Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere, \u201cwhy cry over the eradication of an era that is anyway irretrievably extinct?\u201d asks Iason Athanasiadis. \u201cI believe we should care because the story of how the cosmopolitan era ended allows us to uncover the threads of the narrative that brought us to the current precipice: a largely homogenised region facilitated by the expulsion of minorities and fostering of so-called \u2018pure\u2019 Turkish, Greek or Arab nations\u201d, he writes. A fascinating read.  3. Shipping containers reinvented as new homes for Shanghai\u2019s migrant workers  Many migrant workers in Shanghai have long been living in deplorable conditions \u2013 some of them even in homes built out of containers, and for years. While some of these communities have faced relocation, a new container village endorsed by the government and created by a non-profit company is ready to open. Dubbed Community Cube, this two-storey 150 square-metred structure was completed last year and is formed by a number of used shipping containers joined together by metal plates, as reported in Gizmag. These plates can actually be detached, explains Adam Williams, \u201callowing the separate containers to be transported more easily if the migrants need to move on\u201d. 4.

From 5.30am, a scheme of alternating driving days, based on odd and even number plates, will come into effect for cars and motorcycles after Paris pollution reached dangerous levels for five consecutive days. Even before the restrictions were announced, Parisians were given free travel on buses, metros and public bikes over the weekend. The smog hanging in a haze over the French capital is the result of a string of warm days and cold nights and has caused the worst pollution levels since 2007. A revolutionary streak runs through French society. Rules are made to be broken, as anyone who has tried to use a pedestrian crossing in Paris knows. Parisians interviewed on Sunday said that, particularly in the case of those working in the suburbs, their car is essential for travel and they would be prepared to defy the temporary ban and risk incurring a \u20ac22 (\u00a318) fine. Warehouse worker Jean Sanglier lives in the eastern Paris suburb of Chelles and drives to work in Neuilly-Plaisance, eight kilometres to the west. &quot;How will I get to work?&quot; he said. &quot;It takes 20 minutes by road, and one and a half hours on public transport.&quot; He added that if he is fined, &quot;it&apos;s my boss who&apos;s going to have to pay.&quot; Parked cars lined the roads running through the Bois de Vincennes \u2013 the city&apos;s largest park \u2013 on Sunday as Parisians enjoyed a glimpse of sunshine but a new spike of pollution is expected this morning. A market stall holder in Vincennes said he didn&apos;t know how he would be able to get to the wholesale market at Rungis on Monday without driving there. &quot;Twenty two euros isn&apos;t very much,&quot; he said, referring to the fine. A saleswoman from Nogent-sur-Marne also planned to defy the ban: &quot;I can&apos;t use mine on Tuesday and I can&apos;t get from one suburb to another on public transport.&quot; So would she take the car? &quot;You&apos;ve got it,&quot; she replied. Seven hundred police will be deployed in Paris and 22 surrounding areas to monitor the scheme, which will be enforced for the first time in 17 years. Last time, according to Pierre Chasseray, who is a member of a pressure group campaigning against the measure, it was a &quot;fiasco&quot;. &quot;This measure is worse than unjust, it&apos;s stupid,&quot; he said. The Automobile Club Association warned in a statement that the restrictions would cause chaos and added it would &quot;penalise low-income households and suburban families who need a car, and cause additional economic costs.&quot; The government scrambled to issue a list of exceptions, which include electric and hybrid cars, taxis, and cars with at least three people on board to encourage car-sharing. But all trucks will be banned. Minute PM10 particles (less than 10 micrometers in diameter) emitted by diesel exhausts, heating systems and industrial emissions, are blamed for the pollution. The safe limit is 80 microgrammes of PM10 particulates per cubic metre, but on Friday, the level peaked at 180 microgrammes prompting authorities to urge people to stay indoors as much as possible and to leave their cars at home. According to the Paris Air Quality Index, Friday&apos;s level was as bad as that in Beijing, one of the world&apos;s most polluted cities where policies of alternate driving are enforced during smog emergencies. A French television report pointed out that Rome has also introduced alternating driving, carrying penalties of \u20ac155. Clean Air in London tweeted on Friday morning that London&apos;s pollution level was &quot;worse than Shanghai (having a bad day) and over twice Beijing.&quot; By Sunday evening, French weather forecasts were predicting that although high pollution levels would return on Monday, they may not reach the records of last week. With municipal elections scheduled for next Sunday, the emergency smog-tackling measure brought in by the Socialist government and endorsed by their Green coalition partners risks becoming a political football in the polls.", "tags": ["Paris", "France", "World news", "Pollution", "Environment", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-16T18:54:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/17/clean-air-paris-pollution-crime-against-humanity", "sentences": ["In Shanghai, such is the oppressive smog, covering the city with a toxic cloud, that authorities have had to instal gigantic TV screens to broadcast the sunrise."], "title": "Without clean air, we have nothing | Luce Irigaray and Michael Marder", "article": "Air pollution is deteriorating in many places around the world. In Shanghai, such is the oppressive smog, covering the city with a toxic cloud, that authorities have had to instal gigantic TV screens to broadcast the sunrise. Salt Lake City has such poor air quality that chemicals in the atmosphere not only give it a different hue but leave residents with a foul, metallic taste in their mouths. Closer to home, Paris has experienced some of its worst air pollution in recent days, while in the EU as a whole, even at permitted concentrations, industrial and traffic-related pollution is harming cardiovascular health. Is clean air, along with drinkable water, becoming one of the most precious resources on the planet? Or should we reframe the question and challenge the kind of thinking that converts everything, including the very air we breathe, into economically measurable reserves and commodities? Today we live in a world so complicated and, moreover, organised so differently according to the cultures we belong to, that encountering each other as humans has become almost impossible. However, instead of asking what it means to be human, alleged experts in various domains discuss at great length how to establish coexistence among people. No doubt such an objective is both relevant and urgent, but in their debates, these experts in peace stray far from a solution, getting lost in technical detail without considering the universal sharing of life, from which we could start again. Even if it makes sceptics laugh, we have no viable solution other than to experience the universal human condition as that of a living being, standing naked in the garden that the earth is. After all, with every breath we take, we expose our lungs to the outside world, regardless of all the barriers we have erected between the environment and ourselves. The resistance to envisaging this alternative is due to a nihilistic preference for certain powers \u2013 be they material or spiritual, capitalist or cultural \u2013 over life itself. Such a stance is both suicidal and murderous, even though few people actually intend it to be so negative. How can they recover their taste for life and learn ways of cultivating it, in themselves, with others, and in the natural world? The fact that public parks in cities become crowded as soon as the sun shines proves that people long to breathe in green, open spaces. They do not all know what they are seeking but they flock there, nevertheless. And, in these surroundings, they are generally both peaceful and peaceable. It is rare to see people fighting in a garden. Perhaps struggle unfolds first, not at an economic or social level, but over the appropriation of air, essential to life itself. If human beings can breathe and share air, they don&apos;t need to struggle with one another. And consequently, it appears to be a basic crime against humanity to contribute to air pollution. Unfortunately, in our western tradition, neither materialist nor idealist theoreticians give enough consideration to this basic condition for life. As for politicians, despite proposing curbs on environmental pollution, they have not yet called for it to be made a crime. Wealthy countries are even allowed to pollute if they pay for it. But is our life worth anything other than money? Are we, then, still living? Or, do we only sense what life could be when we enjoy green spaces? The plant world shows us in silence what faithfulness to life consists of. It also helps us to a new beginning, urging us to care for our breath, not only at a vital but also at a spiritual level. We must, in turn, care for it, opposing any sort of pollution that destroys both our world and that of plants. The interdependence to which we must pay the closest attention is that which exists between ourselves and the vegetal world. Often described as &quot;the lungs of the planet&quot;, the woods that cover the earth offer us the gift of breathable air by releasing oxygen. But their capacity to renew the air polluted by industry has long reached its limit. If we lack the air necessary for a healthy life (or, indeed, for any kind of life), it is because we have filled it with chemicals and undercut the ability of plants to regenerate it. As we know, rapid deforestation combined with the massive burning of fossil fuels, which are largely the remnants of past plants, is an explosive recipe for an irreversible disaster. The fight over the appropriation of resources will lead the entire planet to an abyss unless humans learn to share life, both with each other and with plants. This task is simultaneously ethical and political because it can be discharged only when each takes it upon her \u2013 or himself \u2013 and only when it is accomplished together with others. The lesson taught by plants is that sharing life augments and enhances the sphere of the living, while dividing life into so-called natural or human resources diminishes it. We must come to view the air, the plants and ourselves as the contributors to the preservation of life and growth, rather than a mesh of quantifiable objects or productive potentialities at our disposal. Perhaps then we would finally begin to live, rather than being concerned with bare survival.", "tags": ["Pollution", "Environment", "China", "France", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-17T21:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/michelle-obama-visit-china-highlight-contrast-styles-first-ladies", "sentences": ["&quot;In the US, women enjoy equal rights as men in politics,&quot; said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai."], "title": "Michelle Obama's visit to China will highlight contrast in styles of first ladies", "article": "They share plenty of common ground, even beyond the stylish outfits and the proximity to power. Both grew up in modest circumstances, and both have daughters. They&apos;re nearly the same age. Yet when Michelle Obama, 50, arrives in China on Thursday to meet her 51-year-old Chinese counterpart Peng Liyuan, the two will also make a fascinating study in contrasts. If Obama&apos;s narrative is one of resilience, Peng&apos;s is one of restraint. While Obama&apos;s celebrity is a time-honoured tradition, Peng&apos;s is an uncomfortable experiment, a near-unprecedented PR move by a notoriously stern-faced regime. Obama will arrive in Beijing with her daughters Sasha and Malia, and her mother Marian Robinson, for a week of sightseeing and speeches about people-to-people exchange. Peng will accompany her during a visit to a Beijing school, a dinner and a performance. Obama will address American and Chinese students at the prestigious Peking University and then head south for a whirlwind tour through the cities of Xi&apos;an and Chengdu. When Obama&apos;s predecessors Laura Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited China during their husbands&apos; tenures, they grilled its leadership on difficult political topics such as human rights. Obama plans to focus on education and cultural exchange, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters on Monday. Yet Obama&apos;s personal narrative \u2013 one of &quot;someone [from] a disadvantaged economic background from a minority group&quot; making it to the top \u2013 would send a powerful message on its own, Rhodes said. &quot;That alone I think speaks to things like respect for human rights that are interwoven into the DNA of the US.&quot; Peng scaled the heights of fame long before her husband, President Xi Jinping. She spent two decades as a nationally renowned folksinger, known for belting out patriotic tunes on elaborate television specials. She began to dodge the limelight in 2007, to give precedence to Xi&apos;s political career. Last March, Peng sent shockwaves through Chinese social media when she appeared with Xi in Moscow wearing a sharp trench coat and handbag. One fan \u2013 a 34-year-old woman named Li who started a popular Peng Liyuan fan group online \u2013 described her hero as humble, friendly, and glamorous. &quot;Her influence means far more now than it could if she was just a singer,&quot; she said. &quot;She gives our people face \u2013 and she not only has traditional beauty, but also international charm.&quot; Yet the Chinese authorities have kept a firm grip on the conversation. Censors restricted discussion of Peng&apos;s fashion choices, apparently to avoid the emergence of a personality cult, or to prevent her from overshadowing her husband. Last year, a photograph of a young, uniform-wearing Peng singing to troops in Tiananmen Square in the wake of the 1989 massacre began to crop up on social media sites. Censors immediately scrubbed them clean. While Sasha and Malia Obama frequently appear in the US press, Peng&apos;s 21-year-old daughter Xi Mingze, who pseudonymously enrolled at Harvard University in 2010, is shrouded in a cloak of official secrecy. Even the notoriously prying Mail on Sunday was unable to discover much about her in a 2012 profile \u2013 &quot;she&apos;s a bookworm, very quiet and studious&quot;, an acquaintance told the paper. She&apos;s under constant protection by bodyguards, and she rarely parties. After the article ran, an innocuous picture of Xi Mingze \u2013 white sweater, shoulder-length hair \u2013 began to circulate online. That, too, was quickly deleted. Peng was born in Yuncheng, a rural county in coastal Shandong Province, in 1962. Her mother was a singer, and her father was a cultural bureaucrat, former neighbours told the Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao. She joined the People&apos;s Liberation Army at 18 as a civilian. By 1986, when she met her future husband Xi Jinping on a blind date, she was already a renowned soprano; he was a mid-level provincial official. While the tradition of a &quot;first lady&quot; isn&apos;t new to China, it&apos;s been long dormant. Sun Yatsen (a revolutionary who toppled the Qing Dynasty in 1911), Chiang Kai-Shek (China&apos;s top leader throughout much of the 1940s), and Liu Shaoqi (a head of state under Mao), all had glamorous wives who accompanied them on international trips. Yet Chinese history books paint Mao Zedong&apos;s wife Jiang Qing as a cold-blooded killer \u2013 in the early 1980s, she was convicted for engineering atrocities during the Cultural Revolution and committed suicide in jail. The wives of following top leaders \u2013 Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao \u2013 stayed largely in the shadows. &quot;In the US, women enjoy equal rights as men in politics,&quot; said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai. &quot;But in Chinese traditional culture, we have a saying: &apos;a woman without talent is virtuous&apos;.&quot; While female Chinese business leaders are common, he said, women barely appear at the highest levels of the country&apos;s political elite \u2013 only two rank among its 25 top officials. Yet Li, the fan club founder, has more pressing concerns \u2013 namely, whether Peng will sing for Obama. &quot;We hope that some time, Mama Peng will come out to sing for the public,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;d like to meet [her] someday.&quot; Additional research by Cecily Huang", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news", "Michelle Obama", "Barack Obama", "Xi Jinping", "Women in politics", "Gender", "Women", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-18T17:28:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/19/chinese-smog-insurance-ctrip-travel-agency-air-pollution-policies", "sentences": ["The insurance is focused on six cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Xi&apos;an, all of which are popular with tourists \u2013 and also suffer from poor air quality.", "The level of pollution that triggers an insurance claim varies between the cities but for visitors to Shanghai, claims can be made if the air pollution index exceeds 100.", "Tian Yiyi, a sales representative with a Shanghai-based furniture company, told China Daily that despite travelling widely she would not be buying the premium.", "&quot;I would like the money to be put to better use.&quot; Qian Yigang, 28, a technician at a Shanghai-based IT company told the paper: &quot;People travel around for fun."], "title": "Chinese smog insurance: travel agency offers air pollution policies", "article": "China&apos;s largest online travel agency is now offering tourists &quot;smog insurance&quot;, permitting travellers to claim financial compensation should their city break be blighted by bad air. Ctrip.com has created the &quot;haze-travel insurance package&quot; in collaboration with the Chinese insurance firm Ping An and has been selling the new product since Tuesday. The insurance is focused on six cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Xi&apos;an, all of which are popular with tourists \u2013 and also suffer from poor air quality. Pollution in China was recently described by scientists as like a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; and smog frequently grounds flights and keeps tourists at home. On one day during a recent bout of bad weather, Beijing&apos;s Forbidden City saw visitor numbers drop to 11,200: a quarter of its usual daily draw. Under the new insurance package, tourists who spend at least two days in the designated city while pollution levels are high will be able to file claims. The level of pollution that triggers an insurance claim varies between the cities but for visitors to Shanghai, claims can be made if the air pollution index exceeds 100. In the past month the city experienced 17 days over this level. Evidently aimed at domestic rather than international tourists, the premium comes to 10RMB (\u00a31) and travellers can claim 50RMB (\u00a35) per day. The data for the pollution will be measured using the China Air Quality Index app, which broadcasts the levels of all the country&apos;s major cities and is among the top 10 most popular weather apps in China. The popularity of the app is in itself an indication of the lengths Chinese people will go to avoid pollution. In Hong Kong, bad air quality and poor visibility has led visitors to pose for photos in front of a photo backdrop of the city&apos;s skyline. However, when it comes to smog insurance not all tourists in the country are convinced. Tian Yiyi, a sales representative with a Shanghai-based furniture company, told China Daily that despite travelling widely she would not be buying the premium. &quot;The premium does not go directly to tackle the heavily polluted air,&quot; she said. &quot;I would like the money to be put to better use.&quot; Qian Yigang, 28, a technician at a Shanghai-based IT company told the paper: &quot;People travel around for fun.

In an effort to reduce the number of coal-fired plants, the Chinese government has brought forward by 15 years the deadline to develop a nuclear power plant using the radioactive element thorium instead of uranium. A team of researchers in Shanghai has now been told it has 10 instead of 25 years to develop the world&apos;s first such plant. &quot;In the past, the government was interested in nuclear power because of the energy shortage. Now, they are more interested because of smog,&quot; Professor Li Zhong, a scientist working on the project, told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. An advanced research centre was set up in January by the Chinese Academy of Sciences with the aim of developing an industrial reactor using thorium molten salt technology, the newspaper reported. According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), China has 20 nuclear plants in operation and another 28 under construction, all uranium-fuelled reactors. China has been importing large quantities of uranium as it attempts to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. However, according to the WNA, thorium is much more abundant. The researchers on the project said they had come under considerable pressure from the government for it to be successful. Li said nuclear power was the &quot;only solution&quot; to replace coal, and thorium &quot;carries much hope&quot;. &quot;The problem of coal has become clear,&quot; he said: &quot;if the average energy consumption per person doubles, this country will be choked to death by polluted air.&quot; &quot;China has an ambitious nuclear-generation programme. It plans to have almost 60 gigawatts of nuclear energy by 2020 and up to 150gw by 2030, so the Chinese have plans to get a significant amount of nuclear into the energy mix,&quot; said Jonathan Cobb of the WNA. There is a lot that is still unknown about thorium but a lot of research is being carried out worldwide. Cobb said: &quot;Other countries around the world are looking at thorium. There is a fair bit of research going on at the moment into the use of thorium. And technology-wise, using thorium would not be too much of a leap. It is certainly something that is well under way in terms of research,&quot; said Cobb. The researchers on the project told the South China Morning Post their work would be likely to face some opposition from Chinese citizens after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima, in Japan. However, the national nuclear safety administration said the safety of China&apos;s nuclear power plants could be assured, and checks had been stepped up since Fukushima to avoid a similar accident.", "tags": ["Nuclear power", "China", "Pollution", "Coal", "Fossil fuels", "Energy", "Asia Pacific", "Fukushima", "Japan", "Japan disaster", "Environment", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-19T19:42:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/23/indonesia-forest-fires-pollution-asia", "sentences": ["In a separate report last month, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences claimed that Asian air pollution was now affecting climate around the world and making cities like Beijing uninhabitable and suggestive of what a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; might be like."], "title": "Indonesia's forest fires feed 'brown cloud' of pollution choking Asia's cities", "article": "High above the vast Indonesian island of Sumatra, satellites identify hundreds of plumes of smoke drifting over the oil palm plantations and rainforests. They look harmless as the monsoon winds sweep them north and east towards Singapore, Malaysia and deep into Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. But at ground level, south-east Asian cities have been choking for weeks, wreathed in an acrid, stinking blanket of half-burned vegetation mixed with industrial pollution, car exhaust fumes and ash. From Palangkarya in Borneo to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, the air has been thick, the sun a dull glow and face masks obligatory. Schools, airports and roads have been closed and visibility at times has been down to just a few yards. Communities have had to be evacuated and people advised to remain indoors, transport has been disrupted and more than 50,000 people have had to be treated for asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory illnesses in Sumatra alone. Last week more than 200 Malaysian schools were forced to close, and pollution twice reached officially hazardous levels. The Asian &quot;haze&quot;, which comes and goes with the wind and droughts, is back with a vengeance just eight months after an embarrassed Indonesian government promised it would never happen again and was forced to apologise to neighbouring countries for the pollution that blanketed the region in June 2013. Mixed with the dense photo-chemical smogs that regularly hang over most large traffic-choked Asian cities, south-east Asia&apos;s air pollution has become not just a major public health hazard but is said to be now threatening food production, tourism and economic expansion. In addition, say scientists, it may now be exacerbating climate change. According to Nasa satellite maps, more than 3,000 separate fires have been recorded across Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia since mid-January, more than in June 2013 when the pollution spiked to dangerous levels and became a regional diplomatic crisis. This time, the monsoon winds mostly spared Singapore but sent the thick smog from burning peat soils and vegetation over much of the region. Around 10 million people and an area the size of Britain and France have been affected. Just as in 2013, most of this year&apos;s fires appear to have been started in Riau province, northern Sumatra, the centre of the rampant Indonesian palm oil and pulp-paper industries. According to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, 70% of these fires were lit by landowners wanting to clear ground for more plantations. But while Indonesia is widely blamed for the air pollution, the latest satellite images show fires burning and haze spreading across Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos and as far away as the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. What has surprised observers is the timing: the burning season, when farmers clear land, does not usually start for many months. Monitoring groups such as Walhi, the World Resources Institute and Greenpeace say the fires are linked both to the worst drought seen in years and corruption and inaction at government level. So far, says the Riau government, only a handful of suspects have been held for setting the fires. Nearly half are burning on land managed by large pulpwood, palm oil and logging companies that have turned the rainforest into a giant fire-prone region by clearing millions of acres for plantations, says Nigel Sizer of the Washington-based World Resources Institute, which uses satellite data to pinpoint hot spots. The corporations have denied involvement, saying the latest fires are illegally set. &quot;The fires are starting outside our forest concessions but with the heavy, circular winds they&apos;re jumping everywhere,&quot; said Kusnan Rahmin, president director of the pulp and paper manufacturer April Indonesia. Sizer says: &quot;Even if they did not start the fires, they are responsible for massive and dramatic clearing of forests in the regions that have been burning, and to some extent for the conflicts with local communities that may be starting fires to stake their claim to land awarded in concessions to the companies.&quot; &quot;Once ignited, peat fires are extremely difficult to extinguish and generate massive air pollution that contributes to the choking haze now blanketing much of Sumatra,&quot; says Rhett Butler, editor of the international forest conservation website Mongabay. Scientists now fear that the Asian haze will intensify and become an annual event as the population of the region rises to an estimated five billion people and climate change bites over the next 30 years. This week&apos;s IPCC report on the expected impacts of climate change will warn of the cities becoming uninhabitable for millions as temperatures rise. Droughts are expected to become longer and more intense and the number of extremely hot days to grow. Still unclear is how far the haze from burning forests feeds into Asia&apos;s rapidly worsening urban air pollution to form a semi-permanent toxic cloud thick enough to disrupt monsoons and weather patterns across the world and reduce sunlight and crop yields. From being more or less accepted as the inevitable price of industrial development and poverty reduction just a few years ago, air pollution has risen dramatically up the region&apos;s political agenda as the costs are counted. Asia is now the centre of global air pollution, which along with obesity is the world&apos;s fastest growing cause of death. Every year, says a recent Lancet report, more than 2.1 million people in Asia die prematurely from air pollution, mostly from the minute particles of diesel soot and gases emitted by cars and lorries, as well as half-burned vegetation from forest burning. Of these deaths, 1.2 million were in east Asia and China, and 712,000 in south Asia, including India. According to the Lancet report, by a consortium of universities working in conjunction with the UN, Asia loses more than 50m years of healthy life from fine particle air pollution per year. Air pollution also contributes to higher rates of cognitive decline, strokes and heart attacks, it says. In a separate report last month, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences claimed that Asian air pollution was now affecting climate around the world and making cities like Beijing uninhabitable and suggestive of what a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; might be like. &quot;Pollution originating from Asia clearly has an impact on the upper atmosphere and it appears to make such storms or cyclones even stronger,&quot; says Renyi Zhang, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&amp;M University and a co-author of the study with Nasa scientists. &quot;This pollution affects cloud formations, precipitation, storm intensity, and other factors and eventually impacts climate. Most likely, pollution from Asia can have important consequences on the weather pattern here over North America&quot;, said Zhang. The study backs UN research that suggests a layer of air pollution, the &quot;brown cloud&quot;, regularly covers the upper atmosphere over Asia between January and March and could precipitate an environmental disaster that could affect billions of people. It is, says scientists, the result of forest fires, the burning of agricultural wastes, dramatic increases in the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, industries and power stations, and emissions from millions of inefficient cookers burning wood and cow dung. &quot;The effects of the &apos;Asian brown cloud&apos; have been linked to the retreat, over the last half a century, of glaciers in the Himalayas that supply water to major rivers, including the Yangtse, the Ganges and the Indus,&quot; says co-author Harshal T. Pandve. Asian leaders have been slow to understand and act on air pollution, but are now aware of people&apos;s anger. China, embarrassed by air pollution before the 2008 Olympics, says it is now costing its economy $400bn a year, or 6% of its GDP. Beijing last month pledged $1.6bn to reward cities for tackling it and said it planned to close 300 factories. Meanwhile, Singapore has proposed a law which would allow it to fine foreign companies for causing cross-border air pollution. But observers say passing new laws will not be enough. In the Philippines, where car numbers are predicted to quadruple within 20 years, a brown cloud hangs over the mega-city of Metro Manila most days, despite higher standards for vehicles and draconian laws. &quot;Most Asian governments are still concerned with economic development to the detriment of everything else,&quot; says Vicky Segovia, of Manila&apos;s Clean Air partnership. &quot;We are not impressed by any of them.&quot;", "tags": ["Pollution", "Environment", "Climate change", "Deforestation", "Conservation", "Trees and forests", "Indonesia", "China", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-22T21:52:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/mar/28/have-wu-tang-clan-produced-the-weirdest-album-yet", "sentences": ["The staff of the New Yorker performed &quot;Old Shanghai&quot; and Ed Harcourt did one, too."], "title": "Have Wu-Tang Clan produced the weirdest 'album' yet?", "article": "So, Wu-Tang Clan are to release their new album in a one-of\u2013a-kind, hand-carved nickel-silver box, which is apparently sitting in a Moroccan vault.

Why the lack of consultation?", "article": "When the appearance of a great city is about to be radically transformed, it is a good idea for its citizens to be shown what is going to happen and have a say in it. It is also a good idea if the city&apos;s government has a vision, or at least an overview, of what is happening. Neither of these applies to the wave of towers about to hit London. There are plans for more than 230, at the last count. They range in height from 20 storeys to more than 60, in central and suburban locations. Yet it has taken a privately funded organisation, New London Architecture, to discover this number. When Kit Malthouse, deputy mayor for business, was presented with this figure, he was not only ignorant of it, but denied it could be possible. On these pages we show the cumulative effect of these planned towers on key locations along the Thames, where several of the proposals are concentrated. The images are of those that are known: many more can be expected in the coming months and years. It is the first time that the future skyline has been shown to this extent, even though the technology is there to do so. Today we also publish a statement signed by scores of leading figures in culture, politics and business, and societies representing citizens. They include architects who have won the profession&apos;s highest awards, contemporary artists, property developers, MPs, authors and the heads of colleges and museums. These are not Luddites or fogeys, they are not enemies of business or of the new, but they share simple shock at the thoughtlessness with which change on this scale is happening. Here&apos;s another good idea: buildings in cities should not be designed in isolation, but in relation to the places in which they are set, whether these are views to and from world heritage sites, or the fabric of adjoining streets. Together with its present and future neighbours, new development should make accessible public spaces that are a pleasure to inhabit \u2013 the effects of tall buildings are as important at ground level as they are in the sky. And the larger and more prominently placed a building is, the greater the care that should be taken over its design. Nobody could go to the places already being shaped by towers \u2013 Elephant and Castle, Vauxhall or Stratford High Street, a discus-throw from the Olympic Park \u2013 and say that these are great places to linger, or that the tall buildings now rising there enhance the experience. Images of these places in the future, when further skyscrapers will jostle for attention, suggest more of the same. New urban zones are being created with no overall idea of how the parts contribute to the whole, of the places that are being made at their base. Rather, new London tower design tends to go out of its way to be as assertive and architecturally antisocial as possible. Strata SE1 in Elephant and Castle, with its slashed rooftop, randomised aluminium cladding patterns and bulbous form, seems to be setting out to be as hostile as possible to any future neighbour. In Stratford the fashion is for arbitrary clashing colours \u2013 another idea that kills the prospect of making coherent public places. Nor, when you get close to a building such as St George&apos;s Tower in Vauxhall, would you say that you are in the presence of quality. Its details clash and its cladding looks cheap and plasticky. There is no great reason to believe that these surfaces will age well. Images of proposed future projects, such as the Quill in Bermondsey and 1 Merchant Square in Paddington, suggest little improvement in the future. Combined with frantic attempts at individuality is a profound sameness. These projects tend to use the same type of cladding and floor layouts. It is sometimes said that London needs skyscrapers to make an &quot;iconic&quot; statement on the world stage, but these developments make it look less distinctive. And if the city tries to engage in the global race for height, it can only lose. It is outpaced by the likes of Shanghai and Dubai, the height of whose Burj Khalifa is 2.7 times that of the Shard. If towers can sometimes look dramatic and impressive, they also bring drawbacks. They are inflexible, expensive to run and maintain and consume money, space and resources on lifts, air conditioning and structure that lower buildings do not require. Above a certain height such simple pleasures as opening windows and outdoor space become difficult. Towers disconnect residents from their surroundings. Overcoming these issues requires effort in design, effort that is hard to see here. It was decided in the 1970s that councils should no longer build high-rise blocks for families, particularly where there were not enough open spaces and communal facilities. Those now being built are for the higher end of the market, but the lessons of the past have not been learned. The majority of the tall buildings now proposed are residential. There is, of course, an acute shortage of homes in London, but stacks of high-rise, high-price flats are not what the city needs. In a recent Ipsos Mori poll commissioned by New London Architecture, a majority of Londoners said they would not want to live in towers. The transformation of the skyline is not driven by serving their needs, but by a bubble of overseas investment in high-end residential property. Many of these flats are likely to be left empty. The best thing about these buildings is that, under existing planning policy, developers must make a contribution to affordable housing, which can be spent at another location. But it would be possible to build developments that are both lower and better-designed and still achieve this benefit. We have got to this point through several factors. Early in Tony Blair&apos;s government, a taskforce led by Lord Rogers of Riverside produced a report on the &quot;Urban Renaissance&quot;, arguing for using land more effectively and making cities more vibrant through higher densities, achieved with the help of good design and quality public spaces. As mayor of London, Ken Livingstone employed Rogers as an adviser and built these ideas into the London Plan, which guides development. The plan, and other policy statements, stress that towers are acceptable only if they &quot;are well-designed and in the right place&quot;. What we have now is a bastardisation of Rogers&apos;s ideas. &quot;Density&quot; has been translated into height, and the pieties about design and siting are almost meaningless. Significant decisions have blown holes in such policies as exist. John Prescott and Hazel Blears, when they were the ministers responsible, overturned the advice of planning inquiries into key projects. The City of London, which had a plan to confine tall buildings in a cluster around the Bank of England, permitted 20 Fenchurch Street, aka the Walkie Talkie, which stands outside it. Boris Johnson, when first running for London mayor, vowed he would reverse Livingstone&apos;s friendliness to building high and prevent a &quot;Dubai-on-Thames&quot;, but its creation has accelerated on his watch. The communities secretary, Eric Pickles, has told the Architects Journal: &quot;We attach great importance to good design of buildings and neighbourhoods and have empowered communities so they can shape developments to reflect local needs.&quot; What this means in practice is that south London boroughs such as Southwark, Lambeth and Wandsworth readily give permission for tall buildings south of the river. They do this so they can collect contributions to affordable housing and because they lack the resources to argue for long with well-financed developers. The wall of towers forming along the river is a direct expression of this. But buildings of this prominence are a matter not just for boroughs, but for the city, the country and, given London&apos;s international importance, the world. For this reason Johnson has the power to intervene, but doesn&apos;t, much. Pickles pleads his love of communities, but, wanting to favour developers, he stands back. So what should be done now? Peter Murray of New London Architecture has proposed a mayoral London Skyline Commission, in which experts would scrutinise the quality of new proposals and guide developers. He also wants a publicly accessible digital model of the city, which would enable everyone to see the effects of any planning application. Both would be welcome steps, but they don&apos;t go far enough. Murray&apos;s commission sounds like a (possibly improved) version of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, which has existed for 15 years and is now part of the Design Council, during which London&apos;s planning has got into this state. The city needs a clearer, more precise framework, one that states where height is acceptable and where not. It can identify opportunities for vertical growth as well as restrictions. Something like this exists already, in the rules controlling strategic views of St Paul&apos;s and the Palace of Westminster. The problem is that, where these rules do not prevail, there is often havoc. Such a framework would be more efficient than the current system, where it has taken 10 years, three architectural practices, and untold millions of professional and legal fees, for the proposed rebuilding of Elizabeth House in Waterloo to be permitted. New York has applied strict rules to the building of skyscrapers for nearly a century, during which it became the world&apos;s most dynamic city \u2013 so rules are not bad for business. It is not easy to work out the right policies for London. In the coming weeks the Observer, our Cities website and the Architects&apos; Journal will develop the debate. But this effort is essential: the alternative is to accept that civic democracy is powerless to influence the effects of financial speculation.", "tags": ["London", "UK news", "Architecture", "Art and design", "Planning policy", "Politics", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-29T21:46:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/30/world-pollutionwatch-air-quality-china-satellites", "sentences": ["The US embassy service has extended their pollution information in China; you can now follow tweets from the roof of their embassy in Shanghai."], "title": "World Pollutionwatch", "article": "The twitter feed from the pollution monitor on the roof of the US embassy keeps Beijing&apos;s air pollution in the international spotlight.

Last August their two-bedroom flat in Manila was flooded when severe tropical storm Trami dumped 15 inches of rain (380mm) in a few hours and the local reservoir overflowed. They fled to a flyover with thousands of others as five large areas of the capital were inundated with muddy waters up to three metres deep and a state of calamity was declared in three Philippine provinces. In 2012, typhoon Haikui battered the megacity of 12 million people for eight days, but when tropical storm Ondoy hit Manila in 2009 and a month&apos;s worth of rain fell in a few hours, the city came close to catastrophe. Nearly 80% was flooded, 246 people died and hundreds of thousands had to be evacuated. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN&apos;s climate science panel, life in the world&apos;s coastal cities is about to get much worse as temperatures rise a further 4C over the century. Manila, Guangzhou, Lagos, Ho Chi Minh City, Kolkata, Shanghai, Mumbai, Tianjin, Rangoon, Bangkok and 100 others in high-risk tropical and subtropical regions are most vulnerable. They can expect to be swamped more often by tidal surges, battered by ever stronger typhoons and storms, and hit by deeper droughts. Not only will food in cities become more expensive as crops are hit by weather extremes, but cities such as Manila can expect more power shortages, disease and interruption of water supply; nights will become hotter and they will have fewer cool days. Add to that the pollution cloud that already hangs over most Asian cities, and urban life may become unhealthy, unpalatable and more unpredictable, the report suggests. &quot;Heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, as well as drought and water scarcity pose risks in urban areas, with risks amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in exposed areas,&quot; says the report, which makes this forecast with &quot;very high confidence&quot;.

Photograph: Philippines Department Of National Defense/AP    As the Philippines recovers from the estimated $36bn (\u00a322bn) of damage caused last November by super-typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) \u2013 the most powerful storm ever to have made landfall \u2013 the state meteorological office, Pagasa, says that climate change is already hitting the country hard. &quot;There has been a significant increase [in the last 30 years] in the number of hot days and warm nights and a decreasing trend in the number of cold days and cold nights. Both maximum and minimum temperatures are getting warmer. Extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent. In most parts \u2026 the intensity of rainfall is increasing. The number of cyclones is less than it was, but they are getting stronger,&quot; said a Pagasa spokesman. &quot;We had a foretaste with Yolanda. No one had experienced winds of 300 kilometres per hour before. The whole city of Tacloban was destroyed. Now we know we can expect more aggressive Yolandas coming our way,&quot; said Alicia Ilaga, head of climate change in the government&apos;s agriculture department. &quot;We had never seen anything like Yolanda before, but we see typhoons coming to areas where they were never experienced before. It&apos;s an early warning. It has taken a disaster like that for people to realise that these extremes are not natural. If we are hit by extremes every year we will go back to square one,&quot; she said. &quot;Every city and every sector of our country and society is at risk,&quot; said Yeb Sano, the Philippine government&apos;s climate change commissioner. &quot;The IPCC tells us it will probably get 4C warmer. That means everything will be compromised, from food and energy to settlements. We are not ready. The challenge is too huge. I cannot imagine what would happen if a typhoon the strength of Yolanda hit Manila or the second city, Cebu. It would be a global disaster. It will take us 20 years to recover from Yolanda as it is. We lost 1m homes then. We are very vulnerable.&quot;     A group of Filipino farm workers huddle beneath a bridge to seek shelter from rains and rising floodwaters.

We agree, but who pays? We have received possibly $5m, from the World Bank for studies to adapt to climate change, and that is all,&quot; said Ilaga. Dennis Posadas, Manila-based fellow of the Climate Institute in Washington and Philippine technology consultant, said climate change would bring ill-health and water rationing to cities such as Manila and Cebu, along with more intestinal and mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis and chikungunya fever. &quot;If temperatures go up 3-4C as the IPCC expects, then evaporation will be greater in reservoirs, which will mean less water, and diseases like dengue will increase. Mosquitoes will breed more easily. People will get heatstroke.&quot; Manila, he says, is already several degrees warmer than surrounding areas in the day and is stifling at night because of the urban heat-island effect, which releases the heat stored in concrete, roads and buildings at night. &quot;A 4C rise in temperature will make life unbearable and air conditioning an absolute necessity,&quot; he said.     Edna Mendoza stands with her daughter at the door of their home as they clean up the mud and debris from the floods   in Manila, Philippines. Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images    Posadas, who has moved his family out of the city for health reasons, says climate change will hit the poorest hardest. &quot;Tens of thousands of people in Manila live in shanty towns that are in the way of the floods. These people will be the most vulnerable. What the IPCC report means is that those areas that are not already flooded when it rains heavily will be in future. Everything will become more extreme. Subsidence will be exacerbated, high temperatures will become unbearable. These days 32C (90F) is common and lots of people still do not have fridges \u2013 so food will go off. Climate change will slow down economic growth, further erode food security, trigger new poverty traps and create hotspots of hunger.&quot; Dante Dalabajan, Oxfam&apos;s programme co-ordinator in Mindanao, who worked on the Yolanda emergency, said: &quot;The danger is that Filipinos will be trapped in a vicious cycle where the more the planet heats up the more they adopt the technologies they think will help, but will actually exacerbate the problems. The potential for epidemics in cities is huge. You cannot just evacuate millions of people.&quot; Alvarez said: &quot;We expect catastrophe now. But what can we do?

The results suggest that pupils in England are better equipped to overcome difficulties by applying their skills dynamically than they are able to perform in traditional examinations that simply test retained knowledge. The OECD&apos;s head of early childhood and schools division, Michael Davidson, said: &quot;Problem solving is where England comes out relatively strong. If you value those skills \u2013 and they are obviously valued by employers \u2013 the demand for those problem-solving skills is strong and growing, then clearly England is producing skills for students that match what the growing demand of the labour market is.&quot; The results placed England at 11th out of 28 countries in successful problem solving, with only Finland ahead of it among European countries, while the United States was ranked 18th. Singapore, South Korea and Japan were at the top of the table, while Australia and Canada ranked eighth and ninth respectively and Germany placed 17th. The results are in contrast to the main 2012 Pisa subject tests, which put the UK \u2013 including Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland \u2013 in 26th place for maths, 23rd for reading and 21st for science, compared with 15-year-olds in 44 countries.

The company on Wednesday reported a 22% dive in pre-tax profits to \u00a320m for the six months to the end of February despite increasing sales by more than a third, as the cost of expansion weighed on its business. The fall in profits was widely expected after the retailer warned in March that higher warehouse costs and start-up losses in China would hit its bottom line, slashing more than \u00a3400m off its stock market value as shares fell. Nick Robertson, chief executive, said Asos had struggled with complex restrictions on the clothing trade in China which meant in some cases it was easier to send garments made locally to and from the UK rather than transport them down the road. Other items had to be re-labelled by hand to meet Chinese requirements on washing instructions. Such difficulties meant that introducing new brands to China to complement Asos&apos;s own-label ranges has been slow. Asked if the experience had been tougher than expected, Robertson said: &quot;Yes, we have had to learn a lot.&quot; He added: &quot;We are going to have a pause on new websites for the next six to 12 months.&quot; But he said the company would then look at a second wave of international development, likely to start with Japan and Korea followed by Brazil and India. With that in mind, the company announced a sales target of \u00a32.5bn &quot;as the next staging post of our journey&quot;. It is spending \u00a368m this year to help meet this target, including further investment in its China start-up, expansion of its main UK warehouse in Barnsley, and new facilities in Berlin and Shanghai, and expansion of a warehouse in Ohio. &quot;This increased pace of investment has reduced our profitability in the period, but will deliver significantly increased capacity as well as efficiencies in the longer term,&quot; said Robertson. &quot;Asos is not and has never been about the short-term; the scale of the global opportunity remains as exciting as ever and we are investing for the many opportunities ahead.&quot; But he made clear that there was still plenty of opportunity for growth in the UK, where sales rose 32% in the period. &quot;We&apos;re still spanking it,&quot; he said. Here, the company is trying out a range of new ideas to drive sales including collection lockers. Robertson said Asos was currently testing these on staff at its head office and might look at operating them with partners in locations such as tube stations and car parks. Overseas, Asos is hoping to gain from being able to adapt its prices to different markets from May. That will help it compete with local players when there are swings in currency exchange rates and to export more brands which charge premium prices in certain countries.

It should achieve \u00a31bn sales this year and it is the trailblazer for a new breed of UK retailer that sees expansion overseas as a task to be tackled early in life. But read yesterday&apos;s half-year numbers and you&apos;ll be struck by how ordinary Asos is in two important ways. First, there is no cheap route to growth. The cost of upgrading warehouses, IT systems and websites was the prime reason why pretax profits fell 22% to \u00a320.1m despite a one-third advance in sales to \u00a3481m. All that investment is necessary if Asos is serious about being able to handle sales of \u00a32.5bn a year one day. But it&apos;s a reminder that internet-only retailers of clothes do not enjoy miraculous economics. Asos&apos;s capital expenditure bill of \u00a368m this year will be substantially larger than last year&apos;s net income of \u00a341m. Second, profit margins of 7% (last year&apos;s figure) are good but not exceptional. Nor does Asos expect a big leap forward: the medium-term ambition is 8%. So crunch the numbers and assume that the \u00a32.5bn sales target is achieved four or five years from now. Asos would be making profits of about \u00a3200m, or about \u00a3150m after tax. On today&apos;s share price, that would be about 28 times earnings, which sounds more sober than the current rating of 85 times 2014&apos;s expected earnings. But it&apos;s a ratio for several years away and assumes the global rollout runs perfectly, which is far from guaranteed. When you&apos;re selling everywhere from Shanghai to St Petersburg to Seattle, there will be hiccups.

At the urging of the education secretary, Michael Gove, Ofqual has unveiled a plan to link GCSE grades to levels achieved by pupils in China, Singapore and other countries deemed to be high-performing. Glenys Stacey, Ofqual chief regulator, conceded that the watchdog was responding to a written request from Gove that exams should be more demanding because international tables suggest the UK has fallen behind even as results appear to have improved. But the idea of an international educational currency prompted concern from teaching unions, who said some countries excluded certain types of children to boost their scores in international tests. Ofqual&apos;s proposal is that the midpoint for the new GCSE grading system \u2013 five, on its new scale of results running upwards from one to nine \u2013 should be much higher than those currently needed to earn a GCSE C grade, based on its analysis of test results submitted by pupils from the world&apos;s leading economies. Stacey said the new benchmark grade 5 &quot;should be more demanding and in line with high-performing countries&quot; and added: &quot;In simple terms and put crudely, that means grade five will be set about a half to two-thirds higher than where current grade C boundaries are set at the moment.&quot; The performance of students in England has recently lagged behind cities and countries such as Shanghai in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, as measured by the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) education survey from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. However, Shanghai&apos;s ranking is distorted as the city excludes migrant children from official schools. Brian Lightman, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said Pisa \u2013 which surveys a small sample of 15-year-olds in each country taking part \u2013 was not an appropriate benchmark to use for a reform of GCSEs. &quot;While we understand the government&apos;s wish to raise the bar by aligning some grades to Pisa, this raises all kinds of issues. Pisa is a completely different kind of exam than the new GCSEs,&quot; he said. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said that while he broadly welcomed the reforms introduced by Ofqual, its use of Pisa results was worrying. &quot;There are some technical issues that cause us concern, a notable example being the proposed use of Pisa data to set the standard for the new grade five, which, regrettably in NAHT&apos;s view, has come to be known as the &apos;pass&apos; grade,&quot; Hobby said. In the most recent Pisa survey, published last year, English students achieved marks of 500 in reading and 495 in maths. By contrast, Shanghai students scored 570 in reading and 613 in maths, and Hong Kong 545 and 561 respectively. The move is the latest step in the overhaul of GCSE and A-level exams and course content ordered by Gove two years ago, which has seen course modules and the use of assessment either curtailed or abolished in favour of more traditional, exam-based results. Pegging the standard for specific GCSE grades to countries that do well in Pisa follows the modelling of the new mathematics course content on that used in Singapore \u2013 a country where students still sit O-levels, set by an examinations board in England. Stacey said Ofqual&apos;s proposals were open to change, and it would be conducting regional consultations to gauge public opinion, especially from teachers and parents. &quot;I&apos;ll be very interested there to see how people respond to that. &quot;I&apos;ll be very interested to see if people have got any other ideas as to how one actually does an international benchmark.&quot; Under the new GCSE marking regime proposed by Ofqual, the grade of four will equate to a C under the current system, while seven, eight and nine would be equivalent to existing A and A* results. Ofqual said that while the same proportion of pupils would get seven or above as currently get A or above, the top grade of nine will be awarded to half those students who currently achieve the highest grade of A*. In 2013, 3.6% of students gained an A* in English \u2013 meaning that only the top 1.8% of candidates would achieve the new nine grade to be awarded in 2017. Stacey said: &quot;It is vital that people engage with these issues, as many will need to think about how they will use the new grading structure to make decisions about students applying for work or\u00a0education.&quot; The Department for Education declined to directly respond to Ofqual&apos;s consultation document, but a DfE source said: &quot;Rising results year after year masked the fact that standards were stagnating. In future the top grade will be awarded only for top performance. &quot;We hope these reforms will raise standards and restore trust in the exam system for families, for employers and for the pupils themselves.&quot; Ofqual is also seeking views on whether the very bottom grade \u2013 currently a G \u2013 should be abolished entirely and replaced by unclassified, so that the current grade of F would equate to the new 1 grade. The watchdog also announced that a new national reference test would be introduced to provide extra information about the performance of the year group in order to calibrate GCSE grades. This test would only be applied to a nationally representative sample of pupils around the same time as they were about to sit GCSEs. Ofqual would analyse the results to check that its statistical models fitted the pattern of grades that each year group could earn, allowing it to adjust grade boundaries if a year group performed better or worse than expected.

From 2000-2012, the company reduced its global manufacturing waste by 62% as a ratio to production. The Manaus, Brazil site is the company&apos;s eighth zero landfill facility, and over the last few years it implemented several initiatives that increased recycling rates, reduced packaging and expanded access to environmental education. SC Johnson&apos;s other zero landfill facilities include two in China and one each in Pakistan, The Netherlands, the US, Poland and Canada. Through 2012, 10 of SC Johnson&apos;s global manufacturing facilities achieved waste diversion rates of at least 90%.\u00a0&quot;As each of us looks to reduce the amount of waste we generate and increase recycling rates both at home and within our community, SC Johnson is committed to identifying innovative and scalable ways to minimize our global manufacturing footprint,&quot; said Kelly M. Semrau, chief sustainability officer at SC Johnson.  &quot;Waste reduction \u2013 and achieving zero landfill \u2013 is a key role in our business strategy to continuously innovate, making even better products in the most sustainable way possible.&quot;  SC Johnson&apos;s global commitment to waste reduction SC Johnson aspires to eliminate waste altogether at each of its manufacturing facilities worldwide. As the company makes continual progress toward reaching this goal, it aims to decrease the amount of waste that is sent to landfills. By fostering a culture of sustainable behavior change throughout its manufacturing facilities and offices worldwide, SC Johnson seeks the proficiency and participation of its employees to identify innovative and scalable solutions to decrease waste.  Examples of SC Johnson&apos;s achievements to reduce waste include: \u2022 Onsite leaders at the Manaus facility in Brazil examined the site&apos;s entire production chain to identify its primary sources of waste, to develop a revised material separation process and an innovative packaging reduction system, and launched an internal campaign to increase awareness around the environmental impact of employees&apos; waste. Since 2012, the facility has prevented an average of 91 tons of waste per year from being sent to landfills and has increased its amount of recycled products by 16%.  \u2022 Europlant, SC Johnson&apos;s manufacturing facility in Mijdrecht, The Netherlands, has been a zero landfill site for over a decade. Employees and an onsite robot ensure that waste and packaging materials are separated throughout the manufacturing process to be reused or recycled. The site recycled almost 800 tons of its waste last year.\u00a0 \u2022 At the Brantford, Canada facility, employees formed teams to identify and remove process steps that create waste. The facility also eliminated garbage cans and introduced centrally located recycling stations, which makes it easy for employees to place all recycling in the appropriate container and reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills. \u2022 At the Shanghai, China facility, employees have identified several solutions to reducing waste after analyzing the makeup of containers and labels along with delivery alternatives.  At the company&apos;s largest manufacturing facility in Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin, employees recycled 8.6m pounds of waste in 2012. This included used oil, light bulbs, batteries, and kitchen grease. Across the company&apos;s Wisconsin facilities, employees have recycled 615,000 pounds of paper, equal to saving more than 3,600 trees. In addition, company cafeterias use plant-based cold beverage cups, corn-based disposable forks, knives and spoons, and compostable containers for to-go items.  The Bay City, Michigan manufacturing facility recycled more than 6.3m pounds of waste from 2012-2013 and has diverted 100% of its waste from landfills since November 2011.

The overall search area has narrowed, but only to a vast expanse of 217,000 sq km. Members of the international operation have vowed to continue the hunt for the Boeing 777, yet the black box \u2013 or flight data recorder \u2013 is only expected to emit signals for a few more days, making the task ever more urgent. With no secrets from the black box and little hard information, a welter of theories has sprung up. Even the more plausible throw up further questions, none neatly fitting the known facts, while the head of security at a major British airline admits privately to changing his mind daily. All sound unlikely \u2013 but so is the incontestable disappearance of a passenger plane with 239 people aboard. An act of piracy The Malaysian investigating authorities say all explanations are being considered, but the strongest indication of any line of inquiry was the statement that the movements of the plane and the cutting of communication was &quot;consistent with deliberate action&quot;. The transponder was apparently turned off and the plane made sharp changes of course and altitude at moments in the flight that might have been opportune for someone with a knowledge of flying and a motive. Apart from the pilots, who? Only one passenger aboard, a Malaysian aviation engineer, was reported to have any relevant technical knowledge, but investigations have not pointed to any suspects (two Iranians on false passports were discounted as unfortunate asylum seekers). Satellite evidence that led Malaysia to announce that the plane crashed in the southern Indian Ocean ended some more unlikely theories of a traditional hijacking, with the aircraft landing in an unknown location, to the grief of relatives. However, other would-be hijackers have aimed only to crash a plane in a specific spot: David Mark Robinson, diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, attempted to hijack Qantas flight 1737 in 2003 to bring about Armageddon by crashing into Tasmania&apos;s Walls of Jerusalem park. Security specialist Philip Baum calls the case an excellent study of risks beyond terrorism.Baum also cites known two incidents of stowaways who dressed as aircraft staff and boarded planes as recently in 2012: two in Iceland, and another who went from Shanghai to San Francisco hiding in an electrical compartment. He says: &quot;At almost every major international airport, criminal activity of one type or another takes place in what are supposed to be sterile zones. It is certainly a possibility that, in an airport the size of Kuala Lumpur&apos;s, individuals, with or without the knowledge of the crew, could have managed to secrete themselves on board.&quot; Pilot suicide With the known facts suggesting someone on board deliberately changed the plane&apos;s course, the pilots have come under greatest suspicion \u2013 although some hesitate to point fingers at crew who may have been heroically trying to avert catastrophe, in other theories (see\u00a0below). While the cockpit door is not always closed or secure \u2013 as images of co-pilot Fariq Ab Hamid posing with passengers during a previous flight showed \u2013 since 9/11, planes have lockable, bulletproof doors designed to keep intruders out. But that also gives a pilot the opportunity to lock out his colleague should he exit for the toilet or any routine break. Previous pilot suicide, as presumed in the 1999 crash of EgyptAir flight 1990, has taken the form of a rapid plunge \u2013 nothing in the final conversations reveals anything abnormal. But the personal lives of the MH370 pilots have come under the spotlight, particularly that of captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, whose YouTube clips and homemade flight simulator appeared unusual. His likely political disaffection with the Malaysian regime following the jailing of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and reported domestic upheavals have also been cited. A problem with the plane The flight patterns that emerged after eight days via Inmarsat and military radar relegated focus on potential technical problems, as the plane evidently continued to fly rather than suffering some catastrophic failure. However, in one theory proposed by former pilots and air investigators, a cockpit fire could have potentially knocked out the communications systems and/or forced the pilots to take instant emergency action. A fire destroyed the cockpit of a Boeing 777 operated by EgyptAir in 2011, on the runway at Cairo. A similar fire in midair might see the pilots try to tackle the blaze and turn sharply to head for an airstrip to land; they may then have been overcome by smoke, but the plane continued on autopilot. The lack of publication of a full cargo manifest has fuelled speculation that there may have been something on board that was potentially flammable or explosive. Investigators are tracking the orders of the one known cargo: crates of mangosteens, an Asian fruit. Manufacturer Boeing has teams assisting the investigation but has dismissed the possibility of cyber attack. Hugo Teso, a Spanish computer expert who caused a stir in 2013 by claiming he could hijack a plane with his Android device, has said he doesn&apos;t believe MH370 was hijacked. Neither does Chris Yates, an independent aviation analyst \u2013 but, he says, everything remains a possible issue: &quot;The e-enablement of aircraft has stolen a march on the e-security of aircraft. There&apos;s a rush to bring iPads and electronic flight bags into the cockpit and there has been questions asked about the possibility of introducing a malicious code into a flight management system.&quot; Last November the FAA said that the Boeing 777 onboard electronics &quot;may result in security vulnerabilities from intentional or unintentional corruption of data and systems critical to the safety and maintenance of the airplane&quot;. There is, says Yates, &quot;an awful lot hanging on whether we find the wreckage.&quot; Until then, the aviation industry is remaining tightlipped on possible causes. Tony Concil, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Assocation, says: &quot;We&apos;ve seen so many accidents where the initial speculation was so different from the ultimate conclusion - and that&apos;s why we need to find the plane before making any recommendation.&quot;", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "World news", "Air transport", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-04T22:56:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/apr/06/buildings-construction-skyline-teaching-lesson-resources", "sentences": ["What about Shanghai&apos;s World Financial Centre?"], "title": "Buildings, construction and skylines \u2013 news and resources round up", "article": "In 1931 the Empire State Building in New York became the world&apos;s tallest building.

Over five years and counting. What&apos;s your day job? I manage strategy and planning for a foreign bank, specifically looking at our rural banking business in China. People have this misconception that these areas are desperately poor or overly agrarian \u2013 but some counties are more similar to Tier 4 or 5 cities, with lively manufacturing industries and substantial husbandry and farming operations. Nevertheless, travelling to China&apos;s hinterland, you can definitely feel a huge contrast with megacities like Shanghai and Beijing. What was your first blog post \u2013 and how do you feel about it now? It was quite a poetic experience really. Entitled &quot;The White Rabbit(s)&quot; (in reference to Alice in Wonderland), it was a story of a pair of similarly dressed sisters running through the labyrinth of small alleys in Old Town Shanghai, and their lives as children of migrant workers in the city. I ended up gifting them a framed portrait. My interest in documenting community living and architecture in Shanghai\u2019s lilong (lane neighborhoods) stemmed from there. I like to think it continues to be the core of what I photograph and write for Shanghai Street Stories. What do you consider a perfect day in Shanghai? Any kind of sunny weather that brings out the crowds. I\u2019d strap on my camera and tripod and just walk from one old neighbourhood to another for hours on end. There is always something new to discover, like pockets of shikumen \u2013 public row houses built in the earlier 20th century that combine European architecture style with Chinese feng shui interiors. I like striking up conversations with local residents, who may regale you with tales that range from amusing to poignant \u2013 while I type copious notes into my iPhone. Perfect and productive! What is your favorite cuisine in the city? Shanghai is a haven for dining. You have the best Chinese regional cuisine on your doorstep, from the cheap and cheerful to the refined and expensive. Depending on your taste buds, you can\u2019t go wrong with Cantonese food; Shanghainese fare tends to be sweeter; Yunnan and Xinjiang cuisine is heavier and well-spiced \u2013 the list is endless. My favorite is Sichuan hotpot, a bubbling caldron of slow-cooked broth infused with fiery peppers and chili oil which you cook fresh meat and vegetables in. Think of it as Chinese fondue. Perfect with a large group of friends on a cold, damp evening. What are your neighbours like? I live in an apartment compound near the financial district which has a mix of local Shanghainese families, non-Shanghainese working professionals and expats. Sadly I rarely see my neighbours as they tend to keep to themselves. Living in these huge complexes, Chinese people barely acknowledge one another in a lift if they don\u2019t know each other. But once the barriers come down, they can be warm, helpful and, eventually, very inquisitive. They\u2019re pretty unabashed about asking how much you pay in rent, your salary and marital status! Tell us a secret only you know about your city I sometimes get readers \u2013 foreigners and Shanghainese \u2013 asking for recommendations of beautiful shikumen to visit. These are &quot;stone hedge&quot; entrances of old row houses that have beautifully carved pediments with European or Chinese motifs. Here are three located around downtown Shanghai that you won\u2019t find in any guidebook: 1. Zhang Garden: a lane neighbourhood with the best preserved collection of shikumen architecture, right next to Nanjing West Road metro exit (map location here). 2. A pair of Chinese lions guarding Jiuan Lane near Yuyuan Garden (map location here; photo here).  3. A beautiful elephant sculpture on Kongjia (or Confucius) Lane (map location here; photo here).

The move comes months after the company promised to crackdown on illegal practices in the wake of another emerging markets scandal that involved the company bribing doctors with cash and sexual favours in China. GSK, which promised to &quot;root out corruption wherever it exists&quot; in the wake of the Chinese revelations, was on Monday forced to admit that it was &quot;investigating allegations of improper conduct in our Iraq business&quot;. The FTSE 100 company said it was urgently looking into whistleblower claims that it hired 16 Iraqi government doctors and pharmacists to act as sales representatives and improperly boost its sales. Details of the allegations, which are said to have originated in 2012 but continue to this day, were sent to company executives by a whistleblower, according to the Wall Street Journal. The emails claim the alleged malpractice breaches the UK&apos;s Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which ban bribery of foreign officials. A GSK spokesman said: &quot;We have zero tolerance for unethical or illegal behaviour. We employ fewer than 60 people in Iraq in our pharmaceutical operation and these allegations relate to a small number of individuals in the country. &quot;However, we are investigating whether there have been any improper conduct and these investigations are ongoing.&quot; The move comes as the Chinese authorities continue to investigate allegations that some senior GSK Chinese executives broke the law in a \u00a3320m cash and sexual favours bribery scandal. GSK&apos;s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, has described the Chinese allegations as shameful and said: &quot;To be crystal clear, we have zero tolerance to this sort of behaviour.&quot; Witty, who was paid \u00a36.5m last year, had promised to root out corruption and said the company would stop paying doctors to promote drugs. Witty dispatched Abbas Hussain, the drugmaker&apos;s head of emerging markets, to Shanghai last year to apologise to the Chinese authorities for the scandal and promised the company was taking the charges extremely seriously. Hussain, the brother of former England cricketer Nasser Hussain, said: &quot;Certain senior executives of GSK China who know our systems well appear to have acted outside of our processes and controls which breaches Chinese law.&quot; GSK&apos;s eventual admission of guilt last July came a month after the company said a four-month internal investigation had found &quot;no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business&quot;. The UK&apos;s Serious Fraud Office and the US justice department are being kept informed of the Chinese investigation. In December, Witty promised a change of corporate culture in the wake of the scandal. He said pharmaceutical firms must end the decades-long standard practice of paying independent doctors to promote drugs, and make sure patients&apos; interests come first. &quot;We recognise that we have an important role to play in providing doctors with information about our medicines, but this must be done clearly, transparently and without any perception of conflict of interest,&quot; he said.

Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    In 2008, a group of Shanghai urban planning academics and advisers, led by the respected preservationist Professor Ruan Yisan (responsible for championing the Bund restoration), proposed to local authorities to preserve 111 historically significant shikumen neighbourhoods. Since then, a third of them have been demolished, some of which I\u2019ve documented on my blog. Some of the flattened shikumen neighbourhoods were in fine condition, nothing that a bit of sprucing up could not fix. So it\u2019s a bit of a shock when you see a bulldozer just ripping them through. But the worst are shikumens, no matter how historically significant or beautiful, that have become so decrepit and grimy from decades of overcrowding, heavy communal usage and minimal infrastructural investment by residents and local authorities. These buildings never stood a chance; demolition seemed inevitable because any historical value they had was diminished and the cost of preservation was deemed unworthy. And so, a generation of Shanghainese continues to lament the growing loss of their living history. How clean is Shanghai?     A sign proclaiming Shanghai to be clean and beautiful. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Overall, I\u2019d say Shanghai is quite clean thanks to the sheer number of street cleaners working round the clock. Civic awareness is slowly improving with ongoing government campaigns against spitting, littering and promoting better personal hygiene. But old habits die hard: you still hear the hair-raising sound of someone clearing their throat and projectile phlegm on the sidewalk. That gets to me every time. In terms of air quality, Shanghai had its worst pollution this past winter when the city was trapped by a thick layer of smog - you could feel the dirt particles lodged in the back of your throat. Expats started talking about moving their families out of the city; more middle class Chinese were contemplating migrating abroad. The air is back to \u201cnormal\u201d now, which is a light haze every other week. What&apos;s the best way to get around?     Bikes are still ubiquitous in the city. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Shanghai\u2019s metro system is the best way to navigate the city as it\u2019s fast and reliable. It is now the longest in the world with 14 metro lines, 540 kilometres in length, covering 300 stations. Fares start at three yuan (around 30p). But mind you, the crowds are positively heaving at peak hours. Daily ridership is over 8 million on average and has gone as high as 9 million. That\u2019s like a small country on the move! Taxis are a steal if you compare them to London or Tokyo, fares start at 14 yuan, which is the most expensive in China. Buses are an even cheaper option at one or two yuan per ride. Bikes are still ubiquitous and a favoured mode of transportation for everyone from migrant worker to hip advertising executive. Unfortunately, you\u2019ll have to watch out for aggressive motorists if you\u2019re not used to driving habits in China. The unspoken rule is that pedestrians and bikes give way to cars even at a zebra crossing \u2013 which is obnoxious, not to mention dangerous. What does Shanghai sound like?     Community living in Shanghai's lane neighbourhoods. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Cacophonous and comforting all at the same time. This is a city of business. At its worst, you have this ubiquitous mix of honking, heavy construction, loud individuals shouting on mobile phones or at each other, blaring commercials in the metro, on public buses and in the streets. It can be quite an assault on the senses but how is that any different from any major urban city? But the unique (and my favourite) soundtrack of Shanghai is in the lane neighborhoods where the rest of the city melts away a little. Residents usually keep their doors or windows open when they are at home so you can hear life happening: Mahjong tiles being shuffled, the latest variety show on TV, the strains of Chinese opera on the radio or someone practicing the violin. The squeals of children and their pattering feet up and down the alleys are normal and welcome. As the sun slowly sets, you can catch pockets of chatter as neighbours catch up with the local gossip, the sound of running taps as they rinse vegetables in public sinks, and woks being fired up for dinner. Best place for a conversation     An elderly man exercises in a park downtown. Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters    With close friends, a chat while meandering through the idyllic and leafy former French Concession area is very ideal. I\u2019d end the day on the cozy patio of the cafe Ginger by The Park which is in the quiet part of town. I\u2019ve also written up a list of stand out cafes and teahouses around Shanghai here. But if you want to interact with older Chinese folks to gain a better insight into local culture, I\u2019d head to any large public park at dusk like People\u2019s Park or Lu Xun Park. They might be singing in groups, dancing the waltz or fox-trot, or practising calisthenics, and are very open to newcomers. What one thing is indispensable for life in Shanghai?     A Shanghai street with the Pearl Tower behind it. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Patience, ironically because most people here don\u2019t seem to have enough of it. In Shanghai, everybody wants everything done and delivered not now but yesterday. They are always in a rush, pushing and prodding when they don\u2019t get what they want now. As a result, manners tend to fall to the wayside and it\u2019s easy to start behaving as rudely as the harried person you\u2019re dealing with. A little bit of patience will go a long way for all of us in this city.  Are you optimistic about Shanghai&apos;s future?     Shanghai hosted the World Expo. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Yes, it\u2019s hard to contemplate otherwise. China\u2019s ongoing financial liberalisation will only benefit Shanghai in its long-term ambitions to be a global financial city on par with New York and London. No doubt the opportunities will translate into larger talent and migration flows into Shanghai, a higher standard (and therefore cost) of living, and even greater pressure on the use of land in prime areas. In my view, Shanghai as a city has always been very confident about looking forward, which is why the local authorities should be very aware of the socio-economic and urban planning challenges that will accompany their successes.

In remarks that are a clear attempt to move past recent frictions in the relationship, and to segue from his warm reception in Japan and South Korea to a round of intense diplomacy in the People\u2019s Republic, he told a major business forum in Boao: \u201cAustralia is not in China to do a deal, but to be a friend. \u201cWe don\u2019t just visit because we need to, but because we want to.\u201d  Abbott again emphasised the regional effort to find the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 as an example of practical co-operation overcoming the reflexive \u201cstrategic pessimism that sometimes clouds discussions of our region\u2019s future\u201d. He emphasised Australia\u2019s co-operative disposition. \u201cAustralia\u2019s preference is always to look forwards rather than backwards; to win friends rather than to find fault; to be helpful, not difficult.\u201d With defence collaboration with Japan a point of sensitivity in Beijing, Abbott noted: \u201cWe have first-class military forces that regularly operate with the world\u2019s best. Australia is strong enough to be a valuable partner, but not a dominant one.\u201d Foreign investment is a key point of sensitivity in negotiations about a free trade deal with China. Both sides have signalled they want the trade pact concluded by year\u2019s end. China is conscious Australia has offered preferential foreign investment regimes to the US, Japan and South Korea through bilateral trade pacts. It seems logical that Australian negotiators will offer the Chinese a similar screening threshold for foreign direct investment, an increase from $248m to $1.08bn for a private entity.  China wants more scope to invest in Australia, but the situation is complicated politically for Abbott because much of the investment will come through state-owned enterprises, not from the private sector. Because of National party sensitivities, Abbott will also want to preserve curbs on investments in farmland and agribusinesses. Australia\u2019s foreign investment rules require that all investments from state-owned enterprises be screened. The trade minister, Andrew Robb, at a separate event in Shanghai, signalled Australia was looking for a way of accommodating investment from SOEs. \u201cBecause of the predominance of state-owned enterprises in somewhere like China, and because of the effective and hugely meaningful relationship we\u2019ve got here ... we are starting to very seriously consider, as we progress on the FTA negotiations, how we can meet the desire of many Chinese companies to invest in Australia,\u201d Robb told a business breakfast. China will be looking for more flexibility on investment, and for Australia to drop its remaining tariff protection for clothing and footwear. But in return, Australia will want more access to the Chinese market, both for investment, services exports and agriculture. Abbott opened his public sortie in China by noting the recent conclusion of the Japanese and South Korean FTAs, and saying he was hopeful of accelerating the trade talks with China. The prime minister said \u201cteam Australia\u201d was fully committed to building the Asian century, and he moved to temper previous statements in which he had highlighted the liberal democratic values of Japan and South Korea as a specific point of contrast with the different system of government in China. The pitch on Thursday was about friendship. Chinese state media praised the trip, prominently displaying pictures of Abbott and Chinese premier Li Keqiang standing shoulder to shoulder behind Australian and Chinese flags. Other images circulating online show Abbott slightly hunched, his hands steepled, speaking to a calmly receptive Li. Many Chinese articles focused primarily on the joint search effort for the lost plane, while skimming over or omitting entirely the controversies surrounding China\u2019s maritime ambitions. \u201cThe soon-to-be-signed China-Australia free trade agreement marks an important bilateral consensus\u201d Li said, according to the website of the People\u2019s Daily, a Communist party mouthpiece. \u201cI hope that both sides take a cooperative, pragmatic spirit towards advancing relevant discussions.\u201d Abbott has called the mission \u201cone of the most important delegations ever to leave Australia.\u201d  He emphasised not the communism of old, but China\u2019s economic transformation and its embrace of wealth and markets that began with Deng Xiaoping\u2019s reforms that renounced Maoism and embraced the concept of a socialist market economy. China was opened to foreign investment during Deng\u2019s leadership. \u201cChina, after all, has taken to heart Deng Xiaoping\u2019s advice that \u2018to get rich is glorious\u2019. And China should be richer still, thanks to premier Li\u2019s reforms,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cTo be rich is indeed glorious, but to be a true friend is sublime,\u201d he said. But Abbott continued to emphasise that regional harmony should be predicated on \u201cinternational law and mutual respect\u201d.

Its shares have fallen 5.5p to 509.5p, its lowest level since 22 October. The company warned on Wednesday that an investigation into wholesale mail price rises would create a period of uncertainty. Ofcom said on Wednesday it would investigate a complaint from rival TNT Post. Analyst Robin Byde at Cantor Fitzgerald issued a sell note, saying:  This is potentially a nasty battle between Ofcom, Royal Mail and TNT Post on access mail, direct delivery services etc. The threat to Royal Mail&apos;s revenues from [a] new TNT Post joint venture [with Lloyd&apos;s Bank&apos;s private equity arm LDC] is clear. This is a small story for the moment but will gather momentum in the [coming] 12 months.   UBS also issued a sell note, with a price target of 450p. The bank said:  We do not believe it is the case that Royal Mail has done anything wrong but rather it is clear the market is changing and to expect parties always to agree is overly optimistic. Therefore we expect some clarification of what terms and conditions Royal Mail can change unilaterally and what will require regulatory or other approval. Unfortunately this does add uncertainty to the outlook for Royal Mail but is a reminder of why we believe the market is being too sanguine about the challenges the company faces.  This week also saw the expiry of the government&apos;s lock-up on its near 30% stake in Royal Mail, but any sale by UK authorities ahead of May&apos;s final results would not be taken well. Overall, markets rallied despite disappointing Chinese trade data, which showed exports falling by 6.6% in March. This was below expectations of a 4% rise but better than February&apos;s 18.1% decline. News of a link-up between Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges to widen access to overseas investors also helped sentiment. So the FTSE 100 has climbed 36.22 points to 6671.83, still slightly down on the week after the falls on Monday and Tuesday. Investors have been buoyed by the latest minutes from the US Federal Reserve, which showed no inclination to raise interest rates in the immediate future. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:  Last night&apos;s Fed minutes didn&apos;t provide too much in the way of surprises, reinforcing the dovish tone articulated by Janet Yellen in remarks over a week ago when she clarified her &quot;about six months&quot; remark in the post meeting press conference on 19 March.  One thing that did come across was that officials were in no hurry to raise rates.  The recent sell-off in equity markets wasn&apos;t really as a result of concerns about Fed tightening, but more about concern about over pricey valuations, and this hasn&apos;t changed.

Amazon lists more than 100 volumes published in just the last six months, on subjects ranging from the leadership to the sex lives of the so-called &quot;little emperors&quot; born under the one-child policy, from the legacy of Fu Manchu to strategies for multinational companies wanting a slice of China&apos;s huge market. This flood of books has brought with it doctrinal disputes worthy of medieval theology, despite the uncertain nature of much of the data on which the arguments are based \u2013 even China&apos;s prime minister has described its statistics as &quot;manmade&quot;. For some American writers, China is a malevolent force, allied with Russia and determined to impose itself on the world. For former supporters of the Soviet Union it represents the great new chance of humbling the US. &quot;China bulls&quot; confidently forecast that the last major state ruled by a communist party will dominate the globe, while &quot;China bears&quot; see the regime heading towards implosion \u2013 &quot;on a treadmill to hell&quot;, as one prominent short-seller, Jim Chanos, puts it. Both are almost certainly wrong; but both sides have powerful evidence to put forward. China&apos;s economic development has been the most important global phenomenon since the end of the cold war, fundamentally altering the economic balance between east and west, and affecting the flow of world trade. This was first recognised two decades ago by the former Economist journalist and banker, the late Jim Rohwer, when he published Asia Rising (1995). His timing was unfortunate \u2013 the book was published just before the Asian financial crisis of 1997 \u2013 but his argument remained valid into the new century. In 2006 Goldman Sachs forecast that China&apos;s economy would equal and then overtake that of the US by 2025 \u2013 others say it will happen sooner. The investment bank&apos;s chief economist at the time, Jim O&apos;Neill, welcomed the return to double-digit growth after a short downturn in the world financial crisis of 2008 by throwing one arm in the air and calling out &quot;now the sky&apos;s the limit!&quot; The historian Niall Ferguson has argued that the 21st century belongs to the People&apos;s Republic of China, and Martin Jacques&apos;s 2009 book When China Rules the World memorably asserts that the China will dominate thanks not only to its economic prowess but to its &quot;civilisation state&quot; and Confucian heritage. Along with the awe induced by China&apos;s transformation since Mao Zedong&apos;s death (in 1976), runs the popular argument that China&apos;s one-party system is more efficient at implementing policy than fumbling democracies. &quot;Unlike the west, which is trapped in a dysfunctional political quagmire, China has both the commitment and the wherewithal to deliver,&quot; wrote Stephen Roach of investment bank Morgan Stanley. Political scientists Francis Fukuyama and Nancy Birdsell have interpreted the system&apos;s upper bureaucracy as &quot;capable of managing and co-ordinating sophisticated policies&quot; in ways that &quot;avoid the delays of a messy democratic process&quot;. For the financier George Soros, China has &quot;not only a more vigorous economy, but actually a better-functioning government than the US&quot;, while the author and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman has argued that the Chinese system &quot;can impose the politically difficult but critically important policies needed to move a society forward in the 21st century&quot;. From the other side, the Chinese-American lawyer Gordon Chang took a bearish position long ago in his 2001 book, The Coming Collapse of China. The eminent Harvard historian Roderick MacFarquhar has claimed that China sits on a political and social San Andreas Fault. And another scholar, Minxin Pei has depicted it as in a &quot;trapped transition&quot;, with its political system preventing progress. On the economic and financial front, the huge build-up of debt as a result of the 2008 stimulus programme and the explosive growth of &quot;shadow banking&quot; carried on outside the big state banks has given rise to bearish warnings that the whole edifice may come tumbling down \u2013 or at least become unstable. Carl Walter and Fraser Howie have pointed to the fragile, boom-bust nature of China&apos;s financial system in\u00a0their trenchant 2011 book Red Capitalism. In Avoiding the Fall, published last year, Michael Pettis developed a powerful analysis of the dangers of a growth model based on artificially inflating domestic savings rates to support extremely high levels of investment. Financier Timothy Beardson drew on 35 years of experience to present a full analysis of &quot;the\u00a0threats to China&apos;s future&quot; in his book Stumbling Giant; and the BBC&apos;s Robert Peston told us in February that the&quot;economic miracle is apparently drawing to a close&quot;, and that &quot;there is a serious risk of a calamitous crash&quot;. Such jeremiads and the steady decline in Chinese share prices in recent years have been the cue for contrarians to step forward with the argument that stocks are so cheap on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges that they represent a not-to-be missed buying opportunity, provided you believe that the new leadership in Beijing headed by Communist party general secretary and state president Xi Jinping will be able to keep the economy ticking over at 7% annual growth. &quot;If a more upbeat mood continues bargain-seeking could become as fashionable as China-bashing has been,&quot; the Financial Times&apos;s Lex column noted recently. No doubt somebody is hard at work on a book forecasting a new boom in which the &quot;China Dream&quot; laid out by Xi will be fulfilled to the renewed surprise of the watching world. However, even some such enthusiasts have recently tempered their ardour, in the knowledge that China is dealing not only with its debt overhang, but with a major pollution crisis and antagonisms in east Asia, especially its rivalry with Japan. After a trip round China during which he was struck by the extent of the country&apos;s property bubble and the size of its bank loans, Ferguson changed his position and came to wonder whether China might be heading for a collapse of its own. Against this backdrop, a third interpretation has emerged \u2013 one that rejects the views of the uber-bulls and perma-bears to try to chart a more realistic path for China, especially given that once-confident predictions of inevitable American decline are now less frequently heard. The starting point is to recognise that, for all China&apos;s achievements since Deng Xiaoping launched economic reform in 1978, such strong growth has brought with it important challenges. Though the economy is unlikely to come to a juddering halt, it faces a range of problems including the nature of its financial system, vast excess capacity in key industries such as steel, backward agriculture coupled with rising food demand and the competition offered by the world&apos;s other cheap manufacturing centres. Dealing with these difficulties, not dominating the world, is going to be the prime concern of the new leadership that took over at the end of 2012 and, barring a political earthquake, will be in office till 2022. As for the team of wise mandarins, China&apos;s rulers have in fact a poor record on such vital issues as economic balance, wealth disparities, capital allocation and the legal system, not to mention human rights \u2013 the 2010 Nobel peace prize winner, Liu Xiaobo, is in jail for 11 years for having circulated a petition calling for democracy. Foreign policy is fragmented and lacks cohesion. Beijing rightly complains at having to live by rules made by others but has failed to put forward alternatives or evolve a global approach commensurate with the importance of its economy. It runs its foreign policy on bilateral lines and has just one treaty ally \u2013 North Korea. Its claims in east Asia have pushed neighbours into the arms of the US. China now faces being isolated by an American-promoted free-trade zone in the Pacific, and by a US-EU pact. Xi seems to sense the danger. He has formed a national security council, which he heads, to co-ordinate the many different bodies involved in foreign policy, and was in Brussels a few weeks ago to see the EU commission in search of an agreement. The crisis in Ukraine has been tricky: China would never be in favour of a popular rebellion, yet one of its cardinal objectives is to assert the principle of nonintervention in the domestic affairs of sovereign states. It has maintained an embarrassed silence, abstaining at the UN, this discomfort sharpened by $6bn sunk into loans-for-food deals with the previous regime in Kiev, which have brought scant return. For all the spending on Confucius Institutes and cultural projection, China&apos;s &quot;soft power&quot; is also far from persuasive. There are far more signs of\u00a0westernisation in China&apos;s mainland cities than of Chinese influences on the high streets of Europe or the US. People still demonstrate for western-style democracy; I am not aware of anybody marching in favour of the installation of the Chinese political system. All of this leads to the conclusion of Arne Westad in his excellent 2012 book Restless Empire: &quot;Though China&apos;s output has soared over the last 30 years, its history indicates that the march into the future may be less unilinear than some experts would have us believe.&quot; Last year, the scholar David Shambaugh depicted China as a &quot;partial power&quot; in a book with that phrase in its subtitle. &quot;China is not as important, and it is certainly not as influential, as conventional wisdom holds,&quot; he argued. The latest book to appear in this realistic canon is the lucid, well-argued Contest of the Century by FT journalist Geoff Dyer, which in particular assesses the relationship between the US and China in the Pacific \u2013 the contest of the\u00a0title. Formerly the newspaper&apos;s bureau\u00a0chief in Beijing, Dyer now covers American foreign policy in Washington. With telling anecdotes and reported conversations, he shows how China&apos;s foreign policy has misfired in east Asia, &quot;doing a lot of America&apos;s diplomatic work for it&quot; by frightening its neighbours. And he traces the limits of China&apos;s expansion into the Indian Ocean and its vulnerabilities given its dependency on imports of raw materials. But his is far from an America-triumphant story. China is not\u00a0going to go away as\u00a0a\u00a0major global player, and Dyer concludes that, over time, it and the US will have to find a way to live together, particularly in the ocean between them. What do the Chinese authorities themselves think of all this? There are signs that realism may be alive and well behind the vermilion walls of the leadership compound in Beijing. Wen Jiabao, prime minister from 2003 to 2013, described the economy as unstable, unbalanced, unco-ordinated and ultimately unsustainable. Xi has warned that, unless checked, the spread of corruption will &quot;doom the party and the state&quot; \u2013 the anti-graft campaign he launched on taking power is reported to have netted 180,000 people last year and has gone for some high-profile targets, including former security chief Zhou Yongkang: though he has not been charged, 300 of his associates have been detained and assets worth $150m seized. A 60-point reform programme stretching to 2020 was set out at a\u00a0Communist party plenum last November. If implemented it would bring the most important changes since Deng&apos;s economic reform. But, as Xi has acknowledged, it faces opposition from an array of powerful vested interests and contains the inherent danger of shaking the political system that has held sway since 1949. This leaves unaddressed the basic systemic problem of a one-party state and a regime that fears change will weaken its grip on power \u2013 which is why Mikhail Gorbachev is a bogey figure for the Chinese leadership and why its high-ups have been studying Alexis de Tocqueville&apos;s account of the fall of the Bourbon monarchy in France. Political reform is off any agenda \u2013 those who call for the constitution to be reformed are lambasted in the official press for spreading subversive western propaganda. I recently found myself involved in\u00a0the debate as to the new realism of\u00a0China&apos;s leadership. Though I argue in\u00a0my most recent book that domestic problems will prevent China from dominating the world this century, the\u00a0state newspaper, China Daily, devoted much attention to it. The party tabloid, Global Times, normally a\u00a0strident nationalist cheerleader, ran an article that said such an argument was &quot;a reminder that it is still too early to position the world at the dawn of a Chinese century&quot; and urging readers to\u00a0&quot;forget the unrealistic &apos;Chinese 21st\u00a0century&apos;.&quot; Cynics would, no doubt, see this as a Beijing plot to lull the west into complacency. But it may also suggest that overblown hopes and fears are now being pushed aside in China by a greater realisation of just how complex\u00a0the story has become \u2013 and how much its outcome matters to the rest of the world. \u2022 Jonathan Fenby&apos;s Will China Dominate the 21st Century?, is out from Polity.", "tags": ["Politics", "Business and finance", "Books", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-10T09:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/11/abbott-says-china-trade-pact-would-be-a-historic-win", "sentences": ["Abbott has emphasised thus far during his China visit that he is in the People\u2019s Republic to deepen the friendship, not simply cut a trade deal, but kicking off the Shanghai leg of the trip on Friday, Abbott told business leaders there was \u201cextraordinary potential\u201d in the bilateral free trade pact with Beijing.", "Abbott will deliver a speech in Shanghai at lunchtime Friday before travelling to Beijing for talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and a dinner at the Great Hall of the People."], "title": "Tony Abbott says China trade pact would be a historic win for Australia", "article": "Tony Abbott has compared his free trade negotiations with China with a World Cup final.

The prime minister has used a speech in Shanghai to confirm that Australia will offer the Chinese the same preferential deal on foreign investment by private firms as it has already granted America, Japan and South Korea in bilateral free trade pacts. Those deals create a new investment threshold of $1.08bn before Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb) scrutiny is triggered (up from $248m). But given that most Chinese investment is from state-owned enterprises, and the Firb scrutinises all of those investments regardless of monetary value, the preferential $1.08bn threshold in the other major FTAs is not practically beneficial. A key difficulty in the current negotiations between Canberra and Beijing is crafting a provision which would allow more unfettered investment by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), a development that remains politically sensitive in Australia. Abbott offered the following positive formulation on SOEs in Shanghai on Friday, a clear signal about Australia\u2019s disposition in the talks.  \u201cWe now appreciate that most Chinese state-owned enterprises have a highly commercial culture. They\u2019re not the nationalised industries that we used to have in Australia.\u201d Abbott also repeated a message he has been trying to send to Chinese officials throughout his north Asian visit: the coalition government has not rebuffed any specific proposals from Chinese SOEs, and remains positively disposed to Chinese investments in infrastructure. \u201cAustralia has never rejected any investment application from a Chinese SOE and recently approved a large SOE investment in critical infrastructure,\u201d Abbott said on Friday. The prime minister said he welcomed China\u2019s commitment to accelerate the FTA talks, and said he hoped they might be concluded by the time China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, visits Australia in November.

Much was made of the fact that on a particular day, air pollution levels in some parts of London were higher than those in Beijing, a city plagued with air pollution problems. However, while London&apos;s smog was of serious concern and something that the government should take measures to prevent, it cannot be compared to the high levels of air pollution that routinely afflict China&apos;s big cities. The comparisons were made on what was a good day in Beijing. The levels of around 150 on the Air Quality Index which were experienced in London are an average day for many of China&apos;s cities.  Upon reading the headlines about the smog in London, some in China scoffed. Even us expatriates, who are used to decent air quality in our home countries, joked that the levels in London are what we would consider jogging weather. This may sound flippant but when you live with consistently bad air, you tend to become somewhat unmoved by it. While the levels of pollution in the UK and China are not comparable, the smog did perhaps give Londoners a glimpse into what it&apos;s like to live in a Chinese city.  Shanghai is by no means China&apos;s most polluted city, in fact it doesn&apos;t even make it into the top ten, but the city&apos;s residents haven&apos;t experienced a &quot;good&quot; air day since last October. A &quot;good&quot; air reading would be of 50 AQI or less. In general the pollution levels in Shanghai these days lingers between the &quot;unhealthy for sensitive groups&quot; to &quot;unhealthy&quot; ranges.  The weather now has little concern for people, it&apos;s the air pollution that everyone talks about. The same way people in other countries check the weather forecast to see if it will rain in case they need to bring an umbrella, we start the day by checking an air pollution smart app to see if we need to wear a face mask.  Small talk does not revolve around the weather anymore but instead the air quality. &quot;The air is good today&quot; has replaced &quot;it&apos;s a nice day&quot;. Scientific terms relating to pollution such as PM2.5, fine particulate matter that is considered to be dangerous as it lodges deep in the lungs and enters the blood stream, have become part of everyday conversation. Sales of air purifiers, face masks and related products and services have soared as people try to protect themselves and their families. Air purifiers have become a must-have item and a status symbol. Like designer handbags the more expensive the price tag, the more desirable. Face mask companies sell masks with colourful designs and in sizes for children and babies.  A baby&apos;s important &apos;firsts&apos; now includes baby&apos;s first face mask, something I recently purchased for my nine-month old son but struggle to get him to wear. This winter there have been weeks at a time when, apart from a quick dash into a taxi, he remains indoors breathing air that has been recycled through an air purifier.  In Shanghai we tend to console ourselves that, while the air isn&apos;t always up to World Health Organisation (WHO) standards, at least it&apos;s not as bad as Beijing. However, this winter we experienced our own airpocalypse with the smog reaching hazardous and off the chart levels of over 600 AQI. Air is not something you imagine has a taste but when the pollution levels get that high, it has metallic bitter taste and tickles the back of your throat. Hospitals reported high numbers of patients with respiratory issues. Many friends said they had trouble breathing, itchy skin and headaches.  The smog clings to the city like a shroud, giving it a ghostly air. Skyscrapers disappear and people move along the streets like shadows. It&apos;s what I imagine Mordor must be like, inhabited by a colony of face mask wearing Darth Vaders. Ironically, the grey soupy sky creates beautiful sunsets. Air pollution is nothing to be scoffed at. It is a very serious health issue, killing as many as seven million people a year. Authorities in the UK and China should take tackling it seriously. There is little doubt that China&apos;s bad air now is storing up a host of health problems for it&apos;s population into the future.", "tags": ["Environment", "China", "World news", "Pollution"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-11T10:48:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/11/cities-solution-climate-change-ipcc", "sentences": ["It is already taking shape as the 21st century urban nightmare: a big storm hits a city like Shanghai, Mumbai, Miami or New York, knocking out power supply and waste treatment plants, washing out entire neighbourhoods and marooning the survivors in a toxic and foul-smelling swamp."], "title": "At-risk cities hold solutions to climate change: UN report", "article": "It is already taking shape as the 21st century urban nightmare: a big storm hits a city like Shanghai, Mumbai, Miami or New York, knocking out power supply and waste treatment plants, washing out entire neighbourhoods and marooning the survivors in a toxic and foul-smelling swamp.

The draft is due for release in Berlin on Sunday, the third and final instalment of the IPCC&apos;s authoritative report on climate change. &quot;The next two decades present a window of opportunity for urban mitigation as most of the world&apos;s urban areas and their infrastructure have yet to be constructed,&quot; the draft said.

Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images    Around 1 billion people live in cities and coastal areas at risk of sea-level rise and coastal flooding \u2013 and those figures are expected to rise in the coming decades. Most of the high-risk areas are in Asia, but the US east coast, where the rate of sea level rise is three or four times faster than the global average, is also a &quot;hotspot&quot;, with cities, beaches and wetlands exposed to flooding.

Planners in four south-eastern counties are preparing for 24 inches of sea-level rise by 2060 \u2013 which could put a large area around Miami underwater. Beaches and barrier islands are already starting to disappear. Miami and other towns flood during heavy rain storms and full-moon high tides, and saltwater is already seeping into the network of canals in the Everglades. &quot;Sometimes it is tempting to think those impacts just occur in small coastal areas, but they are more extensive than that,&quot; said Jennifer Jurado, director of natural resources for Broward county. Her nightmare scenario in a future of rising sea level would be flooding from both directions \u2013 the coast and inland \u2013 with saltwater contaminating groundwater reserves, and saturating farmland. Jurado and officials in three other south-eastern counties of Florida have teamed up on a plan to cut emissions and protect populations from future sea-level rise. Officials started with computer modelling to draw up details plans of what Florida would look like under future sea-level rise. Broward county is now restricting development in areas at risk of two feet of sea-level rise. Water districts in Sweetwater and other towns south of Miami are installing pumps at $70m each to divert storm run off water and pump it back into the ocean. And while Florida&apos;s Republican governor, Rick Scott, has put climate change efforts on hold, Broward county last month committed to getting 20% of electricity for county from renewable sources and increasing energy efficiency by 20%. Homeowners are being offered rebates on their property taxes to install solar panels. The county has also pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050. Across the country in another Republican-controlled state, Salt Lake City in Utah has also been dealing with climate change. Salt Lake City, which is at risk of running out of water because of climate change, set ambitious targets to cut emissions, and was the first city in America to commit to offsetting emissions from official travel. Meanwhile, Utah&apos;s state legislature this month passed bills offering new financial incentives for solar panels and plug-in vehicles. The bills also require Utah to convert 50% of state transport vehicles to alternative fuels or plug-ins by 2018. Such initiatives are becoming more common across America as city officials take future climate change into account for planning, zoning and land use, said Christina DeConcini, director of government affairs for the World Resources Institute. &quot;I think there is a growing focus on climate change,&quot; she said. &quot;A lot of cities have sustainability departments and people focusing on it, and more and more of the work they are doing is focused on climate and climate impacts.&quot; The reason, she said, was transparent. &quot;Cities that are more at risk are definitely paying more attention.&quot;", "tags": ["Climate change", "Sea level", "Water", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "Global climate talks", "Environment", "Cities", "Florida", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-11T11:02:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/13/barnaby-joyce-will-oppose-asset-sales-to-foreign-government-owned-companies", "sentences": ["During his visit to Shanghai last week, the prime minister, Tony Abbott, talked about easier access for Chinese state-owned enterprises wanting to invest in Australia."], "title": "Barnaby Joyce will oppose asset sales to foreign government-owned companies", "article": "Australians are naturally concerned about foreign government-owned companies buying local assets, agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce says.

He loves the space and relatively clean air. Photograph: Jonathan Kaiman    Last month, China announced its new urbanisation plan, a massive feat of technical and social engineering which will move more than 100 million country-dwellers into cities over the next six years. The question is how. China\u2019s current development model has proved environmentally disastrous; ghost cities and towns have triggered fears of an impending real-estate meltdown. Chinese authorities began encouraging the construction of \u201ceco-cities\u201d in the middle of the last decade; since then, hundreds have sprouted across the country. While the concept is vaguely defined, most eco-cities are built on once-polluted or non-arable land, comply with stringent green architectural standards, and experiment with progressive urban planning and transportation infrastructure. The catch is that they simply may not work \u2013 if, indeed, they get finished at all. According to Neville Mars, a Shanghai-based architect who is writing a book about eco-cities, Tianjin has an advantage because of its proximity to a major metropolis and shipping hub: \u201cIt\u2019s already proving to be successful, because it\u2019s still building.\u201d Many other ambitious eco-city projects \u2013 including Hebei province\u2019s Caofeidian, once considered the crown jewel of the movement \u2013 have ground to a halt. The problem, says Mars, is the \u201cnew city model\u201d \u2013 the goal of building a whole city from the ground up rather than letting it develop organically. \u201cYou can want to design your urban landscape, but in reality, on a fundamental level, that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that it&apos;s extremely hard to build a regular city from scratch.\u201d Furthermore, some experts say that certified green buildings and pedestrian-friendly roads are a worthless patch for China\u2019s environmental woes, not a solution. \u201cChinese people use a lot of coal because it\u2019s very cheap,\u201d says Tao Ran, acting director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Centre for Public Policy. \u201cIf coal doesn\u2019t become much more expensive, then enterprises won\u2019t use more green energy.\u201d     Visitors look at a model of Tianjin Eco-city. Once finished it will cover 30 km sq and house 350,000 people. Photograph: Allison Jackson/AFP/Getty Images    At present, the Tianjin Eco-city feels more like a simulacrum of a viable community than the real thing. Its buildings are designed to the world\u2019s most stringent environmental standards, but they stand mostly unused.  \u201cThe idea is to ensure that what we build here is commercially viable,\u201d says Ho Tong Yen, chief executive of the city\u2019s master developer. \u201cIt should not be an expensive project funded mainly through government subsidies.\u201d Over the past year, he says the project has made strides, selling about 400 housing units a month \u2013 a rate which Ho describes as \u201chealthy\u201d. President Xi Jinping visited last May; in January, the city\u2019s developers presented to the United Nations in New York.  \u201cIf you ask me what is most unique about Tianjin Eco-city,&quot; Ho adds, &quot;it is the comprehensiveness with which we are tackling the question of sustainability in the development of a city.\u201d  On an official city tour, assistant public relations manager Gang Wei walks through a sparkling \u2013 yet unoccupied \u2013 glass-and-steel office building, enumerating its environmental advantages. Nearly a third of its energy comes from turbines and solar panels, he says; its stairs wind up through the centre of the building, encouraging occupants to shun the elevator. Yet while the developer claims that more than 1,000 companies have registered in the city, many storefronts on its main shopping plaza stand empty; two frozen escalators lead to a mostly-vacant upper floor. In the middle of the afternoon its few occupants \u2013 a noodle joint, a coffee shop, a Japanese restaurant advertising \u201csuisi\u201d\u2013 are padlocked. Although the city\u2019s first food market opened last November, it\u2019s still limited to a few well-stocked produce stalls. The massive space echoes like a gymnasium.

Photograph: Jonathan Kaiman    At one of the city\u2019s three schools, the red-brick Ivy Mi Kindergarten and Primary School, office manager Xu Wenjiao stands in a sun-drenched front lobby more befitting a wealthy tech startup than an educational institution. Xu says that tuition costs only about \u00a340 a month, compared with more than twice that in central Tianjin. \u201cIt\u2019s to encourage people to move here,\u201d she says. \u201cInvestors want homes occupied.\u201d Xu strides through pristine hallways, opening doors to a music room, a spacious kitchen, a library furnished with beanbag chairs and potted plants. \u201cThis is our garden,\u201d she says, pointing out of a window at the school\u2019s backyard \u2013 a small brick terrace dotted with dry plots of brown earth. Behind the garden is a low wall, plastered with English phrases like \u201cthe seeds of fresh life, new bungalow\u201d and \u201cfresh air, bright sunshine, broad view, free breath\u201d. Beyond that, a construction yard stretches into the distance. The air reverberates with the thwacking sound of a pile driver. It is a familiar sound in Tianjin. With support from the central Chinese authorities, the municipality has shaped its outlying areas into an endless sprawl of showcase projects. Beyond the eco-city lies an ersatz ancient town, a free market zone with its own football team, and a half-built financial centre which, according to its developers, will someday rival Manhattan. Construction is everywhere; people are scarce. Xu turns around and opens a door into a classroom, where brightly-dressed primary school children are busy finger-painting, reading books and building block castles. \u201cNotice that they\u2019re all doing their own activities,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know it\u2019s best to let every child develop in her own way.\u201d In Tianjin Eco-city, the future is a blank slate. \u2022 Interactive photographs: the rise, fall (and rebirth?) of Detroit", "tags": ["Urbanisation", "Cities", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-14T05:00:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/14/london-oligarch-city-capital-cost-of-living", "sentences": ["And I sense a fundamental tension that will sooner or later explode \u2013 between London&apos;s place in the same swath of the world economy as New York and Shanghai, and the fact that even its most elevated corners are part of the same country as Leith, Skegness and Pontypridd."], "title": "London has become a citadel, sealed off from the rest of Britain | John Harris", "article": "Last week, an empty if sizable garage in Camberwell \u2013 somewhere to put a car, that is, not a repair business or petrol station \u2013 was sold at auction for \u00a3550,000, having been put on the market by Southwark council as a &quot;development opportunity&quot;. A man from property website Zoopla told the Financial Times that &quot;the buyer could create a significant return despite paying what seems like an extortionate premium today&quot;. In other words: bring us your sheds, kennels and cupboards, and watch the capital&apos;s globalised alchemy turn them to gold. This much we know: even if George Osborne&apos;s property bubble is lifting prices all over the UK, London has long since left everywhere else behind. Over the past year, property values in the capital have risen by 18% and the gap between prices there and the rest of the UK is the biggest since records began. The average monthly London rent is now \u00a31,126. Having moved out in 2004, I know what this means: unless you are an international plutocrat, a highly paid City type or someone either clinging on in social housing or putting up with life in a shared hovel, it is an increasingly impossible place to live. Although the inequality London embodies is felt just as keenly inside its boundaries as outside them, the obstacles to living in the capital harden a view of it as a cut-off citadel \u2013 somewhere that not only fixes economic policy in its own interests but hoovers up public investment. The dire political consequences of this are all around us, though a capital-focused media often fails to see them. Nevertheless, London&apos;s mixture of economic isolation and huge political power are integral to the two biggest domestic stories of the year. First, Scotland. At the core of the momentous debate that has seized that country is a justified resentment of how much power has been amassed by the distant UK capital. Alex Salmond recently spoke of London as the &quot;dark star of the economy, inexorably sucking in resources, people and energy&quot;; the influential Jimmy Reid Foundation&apos;s Common Weal project contrasts many Scots&apos; ingrained belief in an essentially social-democratic society with what it calls &quot;London orthodoxy&quot;. And then there is Ukip \u2013 an anti-metropolitan revolt rooted in parts of southern and eastern England that often feel peripheral relative to London. Such divides are always favourable to the populism of the right, as evidenced by Paris&apos;s place in the demonology of the 1950s&apos; French Poujadistes, and the latter-day National Front. Here, although he was educated in Dulwich and cut his teeth in the City, what is Nigel Farage&apos;s entire act if not a huge raspberry blown at the values and privileges of the more elevated parts of the capital, and most loudly heard from counties such as Sussex, Kent, Norfolk, Hampshire and Lincolnshire? Plenty of numbers suggest that people there are right to be angry. In Ukip&apos;s heartland of the east of England, for instance, people talk endlessly about the state of the roads and railways and how difficult it is to get around. At the last count annual transport spending there was put at \u00a330 per head; in London it was \u00a32,600. Think about all this and you begin to arrive at a political theory of everything. In Peter Oborne&apos;s prescient book The Triumph of the Political Class (2007), he nailed the cliques that have taken over the three main political parties as follows: &quot;Their outlook is often metropolitan and London-based. They perceive life through the eyes of an affluent member of London&apos;s middle and upper-middle classes. This converts them into a separate, privileged elite, isolated from the aspirations and problems of provincial, rural and suburban Britain.&quot; Quite so, and if its insane cost of living makes London a closed shop to all but the most privileged, this will only get worse. Only one thing could counter it: moving the machinery of government elsewhere \u2013 a step that would count as one of the most democratic reforms in British history. The prickly feeling of futility as I wrote that last bit was unavoidable: fat chance, obviously. Like all the best political questions, this one has a strong cultural aspect. Maybe, as long as London was open to Britons who wanted to move there, the rest of the country could forgive its\u00a0overweening dominance and understand the capital as a turbocharged Britain in microcosm, where there was a constant creative ferment and regional accents could be heard loud and clear. As with Manhattan, though, soaring living costs seem to have killed old sources of cultural excitement while also sealing off politics, law and the rest. What hope for the provincial hotshot when London life will load them with yet more debt? Even if they somehow make it, what will they do when the time comes to start a family? A few things usually strike me when I\u00a0come to the city I left a decade ago. I like its futuristic flash and amazing diversity but I miss its old bohemia.

Walking closer, the chorus swept into a rousing crescendo:  The Communist party is like the sun / Wherever it shines, it is bright / Wherever the Communist party is / Hurrah, there the people are liberated!  East Is Red, the anthem of China&apos;s tumultuous Cultural Revolution, was being piped out of the second-storey window of an old house located a few streets south of Xintiandi, Shanghai&apos;s affluent downtown shopping district. The house was part of an old neighbourhood that was being demolished to accommodate the next phase of high-end real estate expansion. But it was the slogans on the two banners hung outside the house which really caught the attention of the crowd gathered across the street. Angry over the pending loss of his home, one resident had scrawled &quot;democracy begins with rights&quot; on one banner \u2013 and launched a nostalgic call back to Maoism on the other: &quot;Chairman Mao, the people miss you! Corrupt officials are scared of you!&quot; Shanghai, long regarded as the beating heart of capitalism in China, has built more than 400 skyscrapers since 1990, outpacing New York and Tokyo.

Protest banners on a Shanghai house. 'Chairman Mao, the people miss you. Corrupt officials are scared of you,' reads one. Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    The process of demolishing an old neighbourhood can take several years from notification to the first swing of the wrecking ball. Local district officials hire relocation companies to negotiate with residents to arrive at acceptable compensation, which can be used to acquire alternative new housing in distant suburbs. Surrounded by the daily reminder of the gulf between rich and poor in Shanghai, where Louis Vuitton stores and Ferraris are common, residents lament that the compensation they receive is paltry. Among the older generation, many retired on modest pensions or running small businesses, a handful have resorted to open protest about being short-changed, refusing to vacate their premises even as neighbouring houses begin to be taken apart. Eventually, their homes become lone structures, like small boats in a sea of rubble. The local media coined the term &quot;nail houses&quot;, similar to obtrusive nails that are stuck and irremovable in wood \u2013 or, as some citizens point out darkly, to be pounded into submission with a hammer. Intimidation and forced evictions of nail-house residents by hired thugs or employees of demolition companies are not uncommon. Sometimes they even result in deaths. A few years ago, the central government passed laws prohibiting the use of violence in the housing relocation process; in larger cities like Shanghai, residents who are more likely to be well-versed in their constitutional rights have involved the police and courts to guard against any unlawful action. But intimidation and forced seizure are frequently reported. The issue of relocation is complex, and the choice to protest is sometimes frowned upon by surrounding neighbours who have been bought out. There is a clear generational divide over how residents feel about relocating homes. Younger Shanghainese tend to be more eager to upgrade from crumbling stairs, poorly lit communal kitchens and public toilets for more spacious and modern apartments in fresh-aired suburbs. The older generation, having adapted to decades of cramped living conditions and the convenience of nearby hospitals and parks, are more reticent about leaving the tight-knit communities they grew up in. Taking a stand All afternoon, crowds came and went as a repertoire of old Communist party songs played on a loop from the old house. A man in his 50s shrugged when asked how long the homeowner had been protesting, as if inured to such developments. &quot;Weeks now, months \u2026 maybe a year? This isn\u2019t the only nail house in the neighbourhood.&quot; An old man in a Mao cap, who had relocated from this area to the eastern suburbs a year earlier, told me he still returned weekly to his old local barbershop to chat with his former neighbours. Pointing to the banners, he said: \u201cOrdinary people like us will never prevail against the [real estate] developers. These residents take a stand to make a point, but in the end they inevitably have to accept reality and move on.\u201d His words captured the common dilemma of Shanghai\u2019s lower urban classes, left behind during Shanghai\u2019s boom years. They are stuck living around a modern city they cannot afford and which them out of the way.     Some older Shanghainese  are reluctant to leave the cramped but well-connected inner city areas they grew up in.

To cope with neglect and injustice, some of Shanghai\u2019s older generation are harking back to old symbols of authority to remind people of the party\u2019s once-utopian roots of class equality, social harmony and corruption-free society as championed by the Great Helmsman himself, Mao Zedong. The death and violence caused by the Cultural Revolution is a blind spot; instead, these residents focus on the nostalgia of what they believe to be fairer and better days from socialism\u2019s past.

The horrors and costs of nuclear aside, fracking is not a sensible option, as it has been shown that gas generation is more greenhouse-gas intensive than the burning of coal. A lot of energy is expended by extracting gas by fracking, the wells leak insidious greenhouse gases and tonnes of water, and fracking fluids are required in the extraction process that can leak into the environment and pollute water sources. The transportation of gas involves the burning of even more fossil fuels; this is aside from the actual gas generation process itself. Fracking and gas generation of electricity represent the burning of fossil fuels at a time when we should be urgently cutting back on their use. We need to invest in sustainable, secure and independent energy supplies and more actively encourage reductions in our use of fossil fuels.Seona GunnDeans Marsh, Victoria, Australia \u2022 I wonder how many readers were disappointed and puzzled by the very obvious playing down by the Guardian Weekly of the latest IPCC report on global warming issues (4\u00a0April)?

Now there really is no hope!Hilary CadmanBellingen, NSW, Australia China&apos;s threat to Russia In 2011, I spent a month visiting China to see the world&apos;s most populous nation on the march. I had an interesting discussion with a fluently English-speaking graduate student at Shanghai University. We talked about China&apos;s meteoric rise as an economic superpower. He was very upbeat and told me that China&apos;s rise has been peaceful. When I asked him what did he think about China&apos;s relations with Russia, which was a communist country before, he told me they are very good and getting better. China is already Russia&apos;s biggest trading partner. Then he told me that despite its one-child policy, China is an overpopulated country and needs land to expand, and Russia should sell its vast and largely underpopulated areas in the far east in the same way it sold Alaska to the US in the 19th century. I told him it seems to be good idea, provided Russia agrees to it. He replied it is inevitable as Russia, with a population of only 140 million, simply doesn&apos;t have the manpower to develop the world&apos;s largest landmass. The student pointed out that in the 19th century, China was forced to cede vast territories to Russia. China has not forgotten this humiliation. By annexing Crimea, Putin has created a precedent for a powerful China to reclaim its vast far eastern territories (21 March). The European Union can sit back and let Putin go down in its folly. As Napoleon remarked: &quot;Don&apos;t interrupt the enemy when he is making a false move.&quot;Mahmood ElahiOttawa, Canada The safety of statins Medical experts clash over statin safety (28 March) provides a valuable public service, and calls for further discussion. Should anti-cholesterol drugs should be used at all? If cholesterol is toxic to the walls of blood vessels, why does it attack only arteries? And why does it attack the hardest-working arteries (those in the heart) most of all? Veins are attacked only when they are put in the arterial system. I once did an autopsy on a 50-year-old diabetic woman, two of whose leg veins were moved, one year earlier, to her coronary arterial system. The walls of both veins were markedly increased in thickness, leading to her death. These findings are consistent with the &quot;wear-and-tear&quot; hypothesis of arterial disease, and unrelated to cholesterol. They have serious implications for the way we live, and should lead to shorter working weeks, especially for manual labourers and all who are stressed by work. As transplantation of veins into the heart was frequent, there must have been many similar autopsy findings. In 40 years I have seen none. On the other hand, soon after the American nutritionist Ancel Keys alleged in 1953 that dietary cholesterol was producing coronary heart disease, anti-cholesterol drugs, of which the statins are the most recent, appeared. Promotion of anti-cholesterol drugs has been successful. The use of statins makes big bucks for big companies. Is it surprising that, in capitalist society, the theory that makes money for big companies is accepted, while the theory that could benefit workers is ignored? Is this one of Marx&apos;s &quot;contradictions of capitalism&quot;?Ken RanneyPeterborough, Ontario, Canada Chandler remembered While reading John Banville&apos;s interesting account of his attempt to carry on the Raymond Chandler tradition (11 April), I was reminded of the day when Chandler appeared to be attempting suicide. I worked for 11 years for Hamish Hamilton at 90 Great Russell Street in Bloomsbury, and one morning about 1957, Jamie Hamilton said he had been woken in the night by Chandler, calling from California. Such a call was most unusual in those days and Hamilton was alarmed because it appeared that Chandler was making a sentimental goodbye. Hamilton decided to contact the nearest police station to Chandler&apos;s home, explained the situation and suggested they send someone to Chandler&apos;s apartment. A few hours later the message came through that Chandler had been discovered standing in the shower with a gun in his hand. Thanks to this intervention, Chandler survived. A few months later, he came to London and we gave a party for him in the office. He appeared in a suit of electric blue, a brilliant white shirt and a tie no Englishman would have been seen dead wearing. With him was a woman who appeared to be playing the role of nurse and companion, as he was obviously fragile. He charmed the guests, all of whom were delighted to meet the famous creator of Philip Marlowe, who moved around the room with a glass of whisky in his hand from which he was drinking deeply and which his companion was assiduously refilling. This worried me. I shared my concern with his companion. She replied,&quot; Not to worry, honey. It&apos;s cold tea and he don&apos;t know the difference.&quot;Ken WilderBowral, NSW, Australia A breath of fresh air? Linda Woodhead, professor of the sociology of religion at Lancaster University, is right (A breath of fresh air, 21 March). This pope so far has done nothing but use cheap gestures. Has he agreed to opening the Vatican&apos;s books on sexual abuse, so that victims can at last see exposure of the crimes committed against them? What about handing over paedophile priests to the law? What about putting the Vatican&apos;s artworks up for auction and using the money to build houses in the poorest parts of the poorest countries? What about standing up for equal respect for people who differ physically? It takes my breath away to hear Jon O&apos;Brien, chief executive for Catholics for Choice in the US, say &quot;he has brought about real change&quot;. Driving a Ford Focus? Wearing black boots instead of red shoes? This constitutes &quot;real&quot; change? The suffering of people everywhere because of the church&apos;s ruling on abortion, gay rights and female priests has not been alleviated one tiny bit by this pope&apos;s trivial exercising of his personal preferences.Susan GrimsdellAuckland, New Zealand Briefly \u2022 The Italian court&apos;s decision (28\u00a0March) to grant &quot;short-term private interests&quot; an injunction against a law to safeguard Venice&apos;s heritage reflects the damage caused by out-of-control corporate interests.

For many, a table with just ourselves as company, with no obligatory conversation except ordering and the odd chat with staff, no sharing bites or discussing anything, is a glorious state of being. But what makes some places better than others to eat alone in? Solo diners are often judged for the very fact they are alone. It must mean they have no friends, no social skills, no life. Rubbish, of course. Dining alone is for those who enjoy their own company or who want to eat out whether their friends and partners do or not.  Where a solo diner chooses to dine depends on a personal list of likes and dislikes considering comfort, noise level, interaction with the staff and menu offerings. Somewhere with some noise and a constant buzz may appeal after a solid day in front of a computer, communicating only via email and messaging. Chin Chin on Flinders Lane in Melbourne fits the bill. It\u2019s a bustling cavern of a room and usually full, but there\u2019s often a solo seat at the bar that doesn\u2019t demand any waiting time. Jump the infamous queue and sidle up to kingfish sashimi while watching the swift service skills of the hip, vintage-clad staff.  Cumulus Up just up the road has banquette seating if a quiet corner is desired. At night time the brooding, dark lighting lets you slip on your cloak of invisibility but still offers decent views for people watching. You see, dining alone is a wonderful time for contemplation and observation, if you don\u2019t want to read or catch up on work. Seeing how staff interact with customers and each other, watching the kitchen rhythm, taking in the noises, the clutter and clang and tinkling of glasses are often missed when deep in conversation, but when alone they can be theatre.  A suitable venue is one that welcomes the lone diner. If seated at the bar, check that the full restaurant menu is available, not just the bar menu of smaller bites. Finding this style of eating isn\u2019t difficult in Melbourne: the dining landscape is a terrain of share plates, small bites and main dishes to satisfy the depth of the solo diner\u2019s appetite.  Most menus have a few dishes of tastes to start and one or two may be enough for one person. A Cape Grim steak tartare in Collingwood\u2019s Gorski and Jones, a plate of whiskey-cured salmon with soda bread at West Melbourne pub The Last Jar, a dish of grilled octopus with kimchi in Fitzroy\u2019s Hammer and Tong or a basket of steamed pork dumplings on a communal table in the chaos that is Shanghai Street in the city.  But the key to any solo dining experience is the service, intelligent and sensitive staff who gauge almost immediately if you&apos;re open to chatting or are dining alone to be alone. Thanks to their knowledge and sensitivity to the dining experience, the staff at Cafe Di Stasio in St Kilda are brilliant at this.  Dining alone can be a break from a madding crowd, some peace from a busy day or just a way to get fed. Pay no mind to the perceptions of others \u2013 it\u2019s a wonderful luxury.

Ahrendts is free to leave Burberry this month, having worked her six-month notice period, but the American promised to stay on until the middle of this year to smooth a handover to her successor Christopher Bailey, currently chief creative officer. Remaining until 6 June would also allow her to collect two multimillion pound share bonuses relating to performance over the last few years. However, it is thought Ahrendts wants to leave next month to take up her new post and some have suggested the most likely reason no leaving date has been confirmed is that she is wrangling with Burberry and Apple over compensation for the payout in June. &quot;It&apos;s a big sum of money. In some ways it would be good to see the business moving on after six months of handover time. You want to see clarity,&quot; said Rahul Sharma, an analyst at Neev Capital. But he said investors were also likely to feel reassured by Ahrendt&apos;s presence ahead of some big moves for Burberry and continuing concerns about Bailey&apos;s ability to combine his creative role with that of a chief executive. &quot;That is a big concern in the back of investors&apos; minds and Ahrendt&apos;s presence delays that point of judgment,&quot; he said. Ahrendts&apos; exit may also be delayed as she helps put the final flourishes to Burberry&apos;s plan to take back its Japanese licence in-house when it comes up for renewal next year. The move, expected to be confirmed at Burberry&apos;s full-year results announcement next month, would be a major change for one of the company&apos;s most important markets which currently sells a rather different range of products from those in Europe and even China. Burberry on Wednesday said it had seen no let-up in Chinese demand for its handbags, perfumes and raincoats featuring its distinctive check, with double-digit growth across Asia boosting its sales figures. The company reported 19% growth in sales to \u00a31.3bn for the six months to the end of March, fuelled by 19% growth across the Asia region. Burberry recently opened a flagship store in Shanghai, its largest store in Asia, modelled on one of its London shops. Asia now accounts for 40% of Burberry revenues, but the company also reported 21% revenue growth in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa. In the Americas, where it has a smaller presence, revenues were up 27% to \u00a3320m, led by improved sales of its new beauty ranges. Underlying sales rose 12% as more shoppers were persuaded to spend via customer services including the ability to pick up online orders in stores, helping drive up digital sales by more than 27%. But during the period the company closed almost as many stores as it opened and admitted that the number of visitors to its stores was in decline. It was upbeat about growth prospects for its beauty division, with sales worth \u00a397m in the last six months, a period when it opened its first dedicated makeup and perfume shop in Covent Garden, London. Beauty sales are expected to rise by 25% in the current financial year as more standalone beauty stores are opened and a new fragrance launches this autumn. The strong numbers will further raise expectations on Bailey. Ahrendts said: &quot;With the management transition well under way, Burberry begins a new year with beauty firmly established as the fifth product division and investment in flagship markets, such as Shanghai, further increasing the brand&apos;s appeal to the core luxury customer at home and when travelling.&quot; However, the company also warned that currency fluctuations could hit 2015 profits, with exchange rates a &quot;material headwind in what remains an uncertain macro environment&quot;.

These range from economic downturns and changing demographic trends, to deepening social divisions and a growing strain on the environment. Local citizens increasingly expect and demand local authorities to address such challenges proactively. And while some cities have embraced long-lasting and impactful changes such as mobility sensors, energy efficiency systems and new telecommunications architectures, others have fallen short by only focusing on band-aid strategies. To help cities develop more effective solutions, we created an index that captures the dimensions in a single indicator and ranks 135 cities around the world. The IESE Cities in Motion Index looks at 10 key dimensions that define a city: governance, public management, urban planning, technology, the environment, international outreach, social cohesion, human capital and the economy. The ranking analyses the dimensions, which encompass a wide and integrated vision of how well a city is performing overall, and identifies strong and weak aspects. The 2014 index reveals that successful cases are scant due to the short-term and piecemeal approach of many institutions expected to drive change. But there was good news for some of the world&apos;s urban hubs: Tokyo (1), London (2) and NYC (3) rise victorious in the test of being cities ready to embrace the future. The three global centres have a good understanding of their current situation, a clear vision and consistent implementation of their strategic urban plans. At the bottom of the list were cities struggling in these areas. Key challenges faced by many of those ranked poorly include a lack of collaboration among public and private entities, civic institutions and citizens; the inability to promote new business models that provide financing for new enterprises; and a myopic view of smart cities. Many civic leaders still see technology as the main ingredient of an intelligent city and fail to consider other critical dimensions that define the reality of a city. We also looked at key challenges and risks cities are facing in the near and distant future. For example, although London excelled in the overall ranking, could social upheaval be a threat to its position? Should Londoners worry that their governments are not doing enough to ease social divisions? The answer is yes. Our index traces where some cities could be if authorities took the right decisions or if, in the contrary, they rested on their laurels. We categorised the cities in the ranking into four distinct groups: High potential: cities showing a very fast-paced rate of positive change, although they depart from a relatively low position. In the first set, we can find Latin American capitals such as Buenos Aires, Quito or Lima, as well as Asian cities like Shanghai or Guangzhou. Challenger: Beijing, Toronto and Barcelona are included in this group. These cities show a rapid rate of improvement and have already reached the upper to high zone of the ranking. Vulnerable: The lower-left quadrant shows cities growing at a slower pace and being at the medium to low position within the overall ranking. Cities in this group include Caracas, Cairo and Athens. Consolidated: The last quadrant is that of consolidated cities such as New York, Paris, London, Oslo, Tokyo and Seoul. These are cities with a generally medium to high positions, but whose growth rate has remained relatively low. So what can be learned from the study? First, there is no single model for success. Even though successful cities have some common features, the same strategy will not work for all cities. It is not enough to be good in just one dimension. Some cities rank at the top in certain dimensions, yet don&apos;t meet acceptable minimums in the full set of dimensions. It is vital to understand the different criteria examined in the ranking and how they interrelate. Unfortunately, the perfect city still does not exist. Even those that are placed in the top ranks have weaknesses. As we have seen, the top three cities in our ranking (Tokyo, London and New York) have a long way to go in terms of social cohesion. Finally, change is slow. Time-based analysis indicates that changes in a city&apos;s placement within the ranking were not significant from one year to the next. This is because major projects usually take significant time to take hold. Cities that want to become smart and sustainable should adopt long-term policies as soon as possible. The overarching goal should be to develop urban spaces where people can live and carry out their activities with the greatest opportunity and probabilities of success, within a liveable, creative and socially responsible environment.

Australia will be only the third western country with broadcasting rights in China after the UK and the US, but unlike the BBC and CNN the ABC will be available widely and not only at international hotels. The chief executive of ABC International, Lynley Marshall, said the full range of Australia Network programming as well as content from other Australian media would now be widely available through a partnership with the Shanghai Media Group. \u201cMost importantly, the agreement will provide opportunities for promotion of Australian business, tourism, entertainment, culture and education,\u201d Marshall said. The agreement, to be signed in May just before the federal budget is handed down, comes at a crucial time for the ABC-run Australia Network, which is at risk of being de-funded by the coalition government. Sources say the deal makes it harder for the government to strip the ABC of the foreign broadcaster and to walk away from what is an extraordinary diplomatic opportunity, only made possible by the public broadcaster. \u201cIt would send the strangest message to China if the government was seen to be walking way,\u201d an Australia Network source said. Former prime minister Julia Gillard awarded the $223m Australia Network contract to the ABC in 2011, sparking outrage from a competitor for the tender, Sky News Australia, and Murdoch\u2019s News Corp which had lobbied the coalition to have the ABC\u2019s contract dumped. Sky is part-owned by BSkyB, a British company controlled by 21st Century Fox, a sister company to Australia\u2019s News Corp. &apos;&apos;It&apos;s well known that the coalition had enormous concerns about probity issues under the former government when the Australia Network tender was awarded,&apos;&apos; the prime minister, Tony Abbott, said in January. &apos;&apos;I think it was a particularly dodgy piece of work by the former government.&apos;&apos; The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has also indicated she is unhappy with the performance of the network under the ABC. &apos;&apos;It is meant to be a tool of public diplomacy and I am concerned by the level of negative feedback I receive from overseas,&apos;&apos; she said. With support from the Chinese government in Shanghai, the Australia Network struck a deal for a long-term international relationship with China\u2019s media powerhouse, the Shanghai Media Group, which will offer content to partner Chinese media organisations. The ABC will be able to establish a base in Shanghai and has official approval to represent and sell media content across China, including international co-productions. \u201cThis historic agreement opens up a whole new world of television and online cooperation between Australia and China,\u201d the ABC managing director, Mark Scott, said. \u201cIt provides a truly unique window for all Australian media to build a friendly and mutually co-operative relationship with China.\u201d The executive director of the Shanghai Media Group\u2019s International Channel Shanghai, Sun Wei, said the group was China\u2019s second largest media organisation and its recent restructure ensured an opportunity for international media partnerships. \u201cGroundbreaking international broadcasts such as [a recent episode of] Q&amp;A, which was produced as a collaboration between Australian and Chinese television crews, pave the way for bigger and better international media co-operation and cultural connections in the future,\u201d Sun Wei said.", "tags": ["Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "China", "Australia news", "Television industry"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-17T06:51:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/17/abc-internationals-chinese-deal-a-visionary-excercise-in-soft-diplomacy", "sentences": ["The consensus from the panelists, who were part of a special episode live from Shanghai, was that relaxing China&apos;s censorship laws to allow for the television broadcast of such a frank, public discussion takes time, but also that that time will come.", "While other foreign media brands such as BBC International and CNN International have limited broadcasting rights in China, the ABC are reporting this deal as &quot;the most extensive access to Chinese audiences by any Western broadcaster.&quot; The agreement is being made with Shanghai Media Group, one of the country&apos;s major media players, and the same group that collaborated with the ABC to produce the recent Q&amp;A episode from China.", "John Woodward from ABC International says there are plans for a Chinese-language site offering Australian media content and a new commercial office in Shanghai, from which programmes will be sold and distributed across the country along with the potential for international co-productions.", "The episode was broadcast to Chinese viewers with subtitles on the International Channel Shanghai network, six days after the Australian airing."], "title": "ABC International's Chinese deal: a visionary exercise in soft diplomacy", "article": "Earlier this month an audience member from ABC&apos;s panel discussion program Q&amp;A posed the question: how many years will it take before China can have its own Q&amp;A-style program? The consensus from the panelists, who were part of a special episode live from Shanghai, was that relaxing China&apos;s censorship laws to allow for the television broadcast of such a frank, public discussion takes time, but also that that time will come. The question seemed to preticipate a new landmark deal that was announced on Wednesday, in which the overseas arm of the broadcaster, called ABC International, will begin airing ABC shows and content in China. While other foreign media brands such as BBC International and CNN International have limited broadcasting rights in China, the ABC are reporting this deal as &quot;the most extensive access to Chinese audiences by any Western broadcaster.&quot; The agreement is being made with Shanghai Media Group, one of the country&apos;s major media players, and the same group that collaborated with the ABC to produce the recent Q&amp;A episode from China. John Woodward from ABC International says there are plans for a Chinese-language site offering Australian media content and a new commercial office in Shanghai, from which programmes will be sold and distributed across the country along with the potential for international co-productions. Woodward has made clear the type of content in demand by Chinese audiences include travel, business, education and English-learning programmes. The relationship is also one of exchange, with the company identifying Chinese programmes suitable to air in Australia. Absent from that list is more hard hitting news programming, and when I asked whether stories that critique China would be forced to toe the same censorship lines that restrict Chinese news media, Woodward concluded all media broadcasts in China are subject to the same censorship regulations. Still, soft diplomacy is better than no diplomacy at all, and opens the door to further dialogue, something Woodward was eager to point out. &quot;China is changing and opening up, and we&apos;ve been doing a lot of work opening those channels up. The recent broadcast of that Q&amp;A episode in China is proof of that,&quot; he said. The episode was broadcast to Chinese viewers with subtitles on the International Channel Shanghai network, six days after the Australian airing. There have already been a couple of hit dating shows in China that have aired Australian specials, allowing for a prime-time look into Australian life (albeit seen through a Chinese lens). Likewise, Australian audiences have been privy to a slice of Chinese dating culture after SBS began airing If You Are the One last year. A hit show has the potential to drive up tourism numbers for either country. Earlier this year the Wall Street Journal reported a 90% rise in visitor numbers to Seattle after the Chinese romantic comedy Finding Mr Right, set in the American city, became a movie blockbuster. In the tightly walled-up world of official Chinese media, this is a deal that&apos;s breaking new ground. Audiences in China have been streaming \u2013 with questionable legality \u2013 select foreign television shows for years now (incredibly popular: The Big Bang Theory), so perhaps this is simply the monetisation of an existing, and inevitable, trend. But by throwing in more international content into the mix of official Chinese media, the nation instantly raises their participation in a global conversation.

All citizens are linked to each other and to civic facilities in real time. The city uses renewable energy and its transport systems are controlled via central command centres to reduce traffic and pollution. In this city, there are no offensive smells, no noise, no dust, no heaving crowds. It is a smart city, the ideal city. And it exists: on paper. Its name is Dholera, and it is a key part of what you might call India\u2019s 21st-century utopian urban experiment. Economists argue that the country desperately needs new cities: its urban population is expected to rise from 28% in 2001 to almost 36% in 2026, bringing the total number of people living in its cities and urban regions to 590 million. To accommodate this growth, suggests a McKinsey report, India will need 20 to 30 new cities in the next decade alone. The state\u2019s solution has been to push for 24 new &quot;smart cities&quot; along high-speed regional transport networks. Dholera is one of these. At 903 sq km, it would be twice the size of Mumbai. It is planned in the &quot;influence zone&quot; of a mega-infrastructure project, the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, which will link India\u2019s political capital Delhi with its economic capital Mumbai, and therefore, so the thinking goes, spur economic growth in the region. The Dholera that actually exists, however, is something else entirely. A casual visitor might see the small sign along the highway pointing in the direction of Dholera. But they might also, if they take the turn-off, be disappointed: for several months of the year, they will find a vast, low-lying area, mostly submerged under seawater. The rest of the year, they will see the classic cracked-earth look of salt flats. Dotting this landscape are farm buildings, village huts and small reservoirs storing rainwater that is used to irrigate fields of cumin, millet, wheat and cotton. They will see a vast landscape with about 40,000 people living in an ecological region that loses 1cm of its coastline to the sea every day. They might then understand that Dholera is not yet a &quot;place&quot;: it is still a terrain of possibilities.          Dholera smart city's glossy promotional video    Yet these possibilities loom large in the future of Indian urbanisation, which is expected to provide the country with its planned economic growth of 9%. Dholera was mentioned in the Indian finance minister\u2019s budget speech in 2013 as one of the state&apos;s key investments to induce growth along the Delhi-Mumbai corridor \u2013 and indeed, Dholera will play an important role in the Indian elections currently unfolding across the country. The chief minister of the regional state of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, is running for prime minister. He has declared Dholera and other proposed smart cities in the region to be &quot;building blocks of a global Gujarat&quot;, envisioned on the lines of Shanghai. And to make sure it happens, he shepherded in a new Special Investment Region (SIR) Act in March 2009. The act gives more power to the state to acquire land for building smart cities like Dholera. Many locals see it as a way to bypass India\u2019s Land Acquisition Act, with its pesky mandatory requirements of consent and compensation. Indeed, the proposals for Dholera have sparked several protests. A grassroots movement for land rights called Jameen Adhikar Andolan Gujarat (JAAG) has been at the forefront: organising peaceful demonstrations against Dholera and other &quot;smart cities&quot; with farmers, activists and opposition leaders across the region.  JAAG has had some success, including the recent downsizing of another proposed industrial township nearby. But the state has taken notice. Police have been refusing permission for peaceful protests; JAAG members have been arrested during demonstrations. Matters came to a head in January during the public hearing and consultation over the environmental impact assessment of Dholera. Nearly 500 JAAG activists, environmentalists and farmers showed up to voice their concerns. They argued that the impact assessment included several instances of misinformation and factual misrepresentation. They claimed that Dholera will dispossess the area&apos;s small-scale subsistence and landless farmers.  Their complaints fell on deaf ears: the plans for Dholera were sanctioned. JAAG activists say this is likely to be the beginning of a protracted battle, even as urbanisation of the region appears inevitable: the ruling political party has already made huge investments in Dholera, and would lose face if it does not materialise.     Local residents in the village of Khun near Dholera. Photograph: Amit Dave/Reuters    Activists make other arguments against building Dholera. One is that the city faces a massive engineering obstacle, due to the high risk of flooding \u2013 meaning the final expense is likely to be much higher than what has been accounted for. Moreover, plans to build a seaport in Dholera have been shelved. Critics note that without the seaport, it will be very difficult for Dholera to become a global player, as it is port cities that will ultimately succeed in spurring trade and industrial growth. But the biggest blow thus far has been the recent withdrawal of major private investors after they defaulted on payments.  What then is the future of Dholera and other potential smart cities in India? Will Dholera even be built? Much of this depends on who wins the Indian general election. One scenario is that the smart city of Dholera does get built, but only after a phenomenally high amount of state investment, inducing an economic crisis in the region. Faced with years of debt and austerity, Dholera over time proves unable to maintain its smart credentials. Its smart metering system is not upgraded, its smart networks malfunction, and the city falls back upon conventional forms of city governance that are more ordinary than smart.  Another scenario is that Dholera is significantly downsized due to a lack of investors and stripped of its &quot;smart&quot; credentials, to become just another industrial township along the Delhi-Mumbai corridor. It becomes one of those backdoor cities to India\u2019s urbanisation and economic growth, where polluting industries are located to keep them away from Delhi and Mumbai. It remains, in other words, a far cry from the smart city presented in the glossy marketing images. The final scenario is that the Dholera smart city project is abandoned. Instead, the investment previously ringfenced for it is used to improve soil fertility, provide water for agricultural irrigation and empower farmers in the region to become self-sufficient. This is what those farmers hope for: a victory in their fight against land grabs, the loss of their livelihoods and eviction from their traditional homes. In a neoliberal state, this might seem a utopian social dream. But JAAG activists see it as social and environmental justice, and say they will continue to fight peacefully to make this unlikely scenario a reality. For some Indians, the only way Dholera can be a smart city is if it never gets built at all.

The pigs were found in a tributary of the Yellow River, China&apos;s second longest river, in Qinghai Province by local residents last week but it was not yet known where the pigs came from and what killed them.  According to the state news agency, Xinhua, the pigs tested negative for an infectious disease. The center of animal disease control and prevention said it will carry out further tests. The pigs were found in a section of the Huangshui River which is a major source of water for irrigation for the surrounding regions.  There have been a number of incidents where dead pigs have been found floating in Chinese rivers. Last month, over 150 pig carcasses were found in the Gan River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, in Jiangxi province. And Chinese state media reported in March that nearly 500 dead pigs have been removed from a reservoir in Sichuan province every month.  The biggest dead pig scandal took place last March when 16,000 dead pigs were found floating in the Huangpu River in Shanghai which supplies drinking water to many of the city&apos;s 26 million residents, leading to concerns about water and food safety in the city. Grim photos of the city&apos;s sanitation works pulling bloated decomposing pig carcasses out of the river circulated online and in the media.  It is not always easy to find where the dead pigs come from or their cause of death. However, it is thought that farmers frequently dump pigs that have died into rivers to avoid paying for them to disposed of properly. There has also been a crackdown in recent years on the illegal sale of dead or sick pigs for processing and it is believed that because of this, farmers are instead resorting to dumping dead pigs into rivers.  Meanwhile, authorities in the city of Lanzhou in Gansu province have said the city is to get a second water supply after excessive levels of the chemical benzene was found in the tap water.  The city&apos;s more than 3 million residents were warned not to drink tap water after levels of the carcinogenic chemical were found to be more than 20 times above national safety levels.

We&apos;re competing with other sports and we&apos;ve got to make it successful. We should promote the great things we&apos;ve done.&quot; The season, which this weekend has now reached Shanghai for the Chinese Grand Prix, has been dominated by Ferrari talking about &quot;taxi-cab&quot; driving and shorter races (as they replaced the team principal, Stefano Domenicali, whose fundamental problem was an inability to make fast cars), Red Bull wanting to do away with the fuel-flow limits and, notably, Ecclestone complaining about the lack of noise from the more efficient cars. Lowe feels a car that produces more power, more torque and better straight-line speed, yet is 30% more efficient, is something worthy of celebration. &quot;It&apos;s like having a road car doing 30 miles to the gallon and suddenly you&apos;re doing 40, or 45,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s what we&apos;ve done overnight, and it&apos;s completely remarkable. And this will feed back into the automotive world. &quot;Red Bull&apos;s positioning about the new engine formula seems strange, given that it&apos;s been in discussion for three years or more, and all of the teams have been involved in the formulation of those regulations. The top teams have a particular duty to influence the concepts that are delivered. One would imagine that Red Bull and Ferrari had the opportunity to create a works team-like relationship [like Mercedes].&quot; Lowe conducted his own celebration after the Bahrain Grand Prix \u2013 in which Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg completed a Mercedes one-two finish \u2013 by taking his family to a Chinese restaurant in Oxford, to also mark his 52nd birthday. That race at the Sakhir circuit has provided Lowe with an immortal memory. &quot;It is the final 10 laps; the image of the two Silver Arrows streaking away from the pack, in close battle with each other,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s something I will remember for ever.&quot; Like most team headquarters, the Mercedes base is an intense operation but it looked almost serene in the spring sunshine as the staff arrived for work last week, chattering about the three wins out of three that have propelled them to the top of both world championships. While Mercedes&apos; executive director, Toto Wolff, is the impressive public face of the team, Lowe is its technical heartbeat. The executive director (technical) has had his brief widened to absorb the duties of the technical director, Bob Bell, whose departure was announced last week. &quot;I&apos;m not in Formula One to get on TV,&quot; Lowe says. &quot;It&apos;s not a big deal for me. Toto&apos;s very good with the press, a very personable guy. It&apos;s not an area in which we compete for space.&quot; In his large office, Lowe expands on how Mercedes decided to get real about becoming the best team: &quot;The old Ross Brawn team had been downsized in the face of the thin budget they had. And then we had RRA [resource restriction agreement], which came in and gave the illusion of restricting resources. So this team was a little bit slow to appreciate the level of commitment being made by their competitors. I&apos;m talking about 2010-2011. Ross [the former team principal who left Mercedes at the end of last year] then progressively built the team up. &quot;The next push came when Toto and Niki Lauda arrived at the end of 2012, bringing in Lewis Hamilton, all working with Ross \u2013 who should take a lot of credit for the culture and approach that&apos;s still here \u2013 to go to the next stage by ramping up the resources we had to take on because of the challenge of the new rules, but also the challenge of Red Bull and Ferrari. We&apos;re still smaller, in terms of our expenditure, than those two teams.&quot; Mercedes, like Renault, would have left F1 but for the introduction of the new 1.6-litre hybrid engines. &quot;You have to change to move forward and the formula we have created is going in the right direction,&quot; Lowe says. &quot;We have to take note of the world around us and push technology in the direction that the automotives and the public want to see us go. &quot;We have a role in Formula One, to show the way to the public. We&apos;re putting the word &apos;hybrid&apos; into the mainstream, so people can understand it, and see the point of it.&quot; There are four reasons for Mercedes&apos; success this season, according to Lowe. They have the &quot;best power unit&quot; and &quot;one of the best cars&quot; in terms of chassis, suspension and aerodynamics. Third, they have the advantage of a works team, &quot;allowing us to integrate the power unit and chassis to optimal effect&quot;. And, fourth, &quot;we have the drivers to make the most of it all&quot;. As the man responsible for the development of the power unit at Mercedes&apos; engine base across Northamptonshire at Brixworth, Andy Cowell is probably just as important as Lowe. &quot;The engineering groups at Brackley and Brixworth have worked together exceptionally closely to produce what we have,&quot; Cowell says. &quot;There are lots of complex systems and to see that coming together in harmony was an exceptional feeling. We&apos;re all schoolboys and to see that car pull out of the garage at the first Silverstone shakedown was a very emotional moment for all of us.&quot; Lowe arrived in China full of optimism. &quot;I think we certainly have a good margin to manage in qualifying and the race. One circuit can be a one-off but we&apos;ve had some variety in tracks and the car is proving to be strong. So we should be strong in China, although it&apos;s more of a front-limiting circuit than a rear-limiting circuit, so there will be a change to the balance.&quot; For some, Lowe&apos;s pitwall instruction to allow Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg to race in Bahrain was a defining moment. &quot;In terms of the sporting aspect, I&apos;m in charge,&quot; he says. &quot;If there is a call to be made, that&apos;s down to me but our approach and philosophy is something Toto and I had agreed on in advance. &quot;Some people in the team got a little bit wobbly with the drivers competing but I&apos;m more OK with it. If one of our drivers was going to overtake a car from another team you wouldn&apos;t be trying to control them in any way. You would rely on their skill and judgement to find the right line and it should be the same between the two drivers, provided they&apos;re top-class drivers. &quot;We&apos;ve already seen signs of [their rivalry] because they&apos;ve got a winning car and they both want to win. I think it will require careful management through the year. It will require all of us to maintain trust between ourselves, with the key team being Toto, myself and the two drivers. We need to stick together. There will be difficult times but we all respect each other enough to get through it.&quot;", "tags": ["Mercedes GP", "Formula One 2014", "Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Nico Rosberg", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-18T12:24:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/18/ferrari-enzo-marco-mattiacci-formula-one", "sentences": ["Speaking to journalists in Shanghai on Friday, Mattiacci referred to his experience in &quot;benchmarking business structures&quot;."], "title": "Ferrari use Enzo's old method to recruit much-needed new broom | Richard Williams", "article": "Everyone liked Stefano Domenicali. That was the problem. Ferrari&apos;s team principal was a nice man in a world where niceness, even when accompanied by extreme competence, is usually considered to be the virtue of losers. Domenicali, who resigned suddenly at the start of this week, had been in the job for six years, before which he had served as Jean Todt&apos;s deputy. Taking over the top job from Todt was like succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United: the wily Frenchman had spent 15 years assembling and supervising a team of brilliant designers and engineers who secured the unprecedented run of five consecutive drivers&apos; titles for Michael Schumacher \u2013 plus one for Kimi Raikkonen \u2013 and eight constructors&apos; titles. At the time, Domenicali seemed to be exactly what Formula One needed: a 42\u2011year\u2011old of intelligence, integrity and fresh perspectives, capable of blowing away some of the noxious clouds of cynicism that had long since polluted the sport. There were similar hopes when Martin Whitmarsh took over the running of McLaren&apos;s F1 operation from the veteran Ron Dennis, the younger newcomer warming up a previously austere organisation and dispelling its air of pomposity. To outsiders, these were two men whose word could be trusted, who did not make a fetish of concealing the truth about anything but the most necessarily confidential technical matters. It seemed that Formula One, entering the final phase of the Bernie Ecclestone era, would be emerging from a long period in which obsessive secrecy and political chicanery were the dominant modes of behaviour. In that sense, Domenicali and Whitmarsh were symbolic figures. Now they are both gone, and we can probably say goodbye to those hopes. Formula One has lost two senior figures who commanded universal respect for their personal qualities but failed by the only yardstick that matters in sport, that of results. Two teams who have both enjoyed long periods of near-invincibility in the past quarter of a century found themselves traipsing around in midfield, struggling to adapt to a new set of technical regulations, testing the patience of the men at the very top. The sudden upheaval at Ferrari is a reminder of the days when the Italian team changed managers from season to season in a restless and often self-defeating search for success. After a long period of relative stability, Luca di Montezemolo \u2013 the current president \u2013 seems to have adopted the approach of Enzo Ferrari, the man who gave him the job of running the team back in 1973. His choice of a replacement for Domenicali is not a figure from within the racing team, or even the racing world, but a 43-year-old executive whose success in increasing Ferrari&apos;s sales of road cars in the US and Chinese markets has made him a golden boy inside the company. The arrival of Marco Mattiacci is a reminder that Enzo Ferrari sourced his team managers from all over the place. Nello Ugolini, one of the first, had managed football teams. Eugenio Dragoni was the heir to a cosmetics and pharmaceuticals business. Franco Gozzi was his barber&apos;s son-in-law. Marco Piccinini was a member of a banking family. Improbably enough, two of them, Franco Lini and Romolo Tavoni, were journalists \u2013 and it was Tavoni who took the punch thrown by a driver, Jean Behra, after the volatile Frenchman had blown up his engine on purpose during the French Grand Prix at Rheims in 1959. Behra believed that he was being given equipment inferior to that of the team&apos;s other drivers, and the blow cost him his job. Enzo Ferrari, who stayed away from the circuits, relied on his managers to feed him information, and the drivers often suspected, with good reason, that he was not being given the whole truth. Two years after John Surtees had won the 1964 title for Ferrari, a series of battles with Dragoni \u2013 who accused him of industrial espionage \u2013 led to the sacking of the great Englishman, a disastrous decision. But the turnover of managers almost matched that of drivers: few lasted more than a season or two, and the team endured long spells \u2013 from 1965 to 1974, for instance, or 1980 to 1998 \u2013 when the prospect of another title seemed a distant mirage. This is a more professional era, and when Montezemolo appointed Todt in 1993, after another period of turmoil following Enzo Ferrari&apos;s death, he chose a man steeped in motor sport, a successful rally co-driver and the mastermind of Peugot&apos;s successful Le Mans campaign. Domenicali, an economics graduate, had spent many years with the company, most of them at the sharp end of the racing team, before accepting the ultimate promotion. As with Whitmarsh at McLaren, however, there was a sense that Ferrari under Domenicali lacked the vital ingredient to transform them into winners once again: the equivalent of the sliver of ice in the heart that Graham Greene once said was indispensable to a writer. The right things were being done. Domenicali took the difficult decision to shut down the wind tunnel for a year while rebuilding it in order to obtain more accurate results, and having begun his reign by promoting Italians to jobs previously held by engineers of many nations, he was not too proud to reinvigorate the technical side by giving senior roles to McLaren&apos;s Pat Fry and Lotus&apos;s James Allison. But with just 20 race wins in the past seven seasons and only two last year, the team seemed to be finding it impossible to get even a glimpse of the sort of dominance they enjoyed in the era when Todt, Schumacher and Ross Brawn held sway. Perhaps Montezemolo is right to conclude that, rather than rehiring Brawn or bringing in Flavio Briatore to shake up things, an outsider with keen managerial instincts is more likely to bring the necessary critical eye to bear on the team&apos;s structure and performance. Speaking to journalists in Shanghai on Friday, Mattiacci referred to his experience in &quot;benchmarking business structures&quot;. The fact that he almost certainly lacks an intimate knowledge of aerodynamic theory or tyre degradation rates will be unimportant if he knows how to get a group of talented people firing on all cylinders. &quot;I come with a lot of humility,&quot; the new man added but he will find that quality not much in demand in Formula One. Someone, perhaps Montezemolo, will already have reminded him of one of Enzo Ferrari&apos;s most famous sayings. &quot;I am not an engineer,&quot; the old man said. &quot;I am an agitator of men and machines.&quot; That is one tradition Mattiacci will be expected to honour as he tries to restore the lustre of the sport&apos;s most charismatic name. \u2022 This article was corrected on 18 April 2014 to reflect the fact that Ferrari won two races in 2013 rather than none", "tags": ["Ferrari", "Formula One 2014", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-18T13:32:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/apr/22/keep-teachers-teaching-profession", "sentences": ["Stone said that other countries devoted far more time to CPD than the UK: in Shanghai, for example, teachers are required to spend 240 hours on CPD in the first five years of their working life."], "title": "How can we keep teachers teaching?", "article": "One of the most memorable television moments of last year was on Channel 4&apos;s Educating Yorkshire, when 16-year old Musharaf Asghar was helped to overcome his disabling stammer through the efforts of his English teacher, Mr Burton. It demonstrated that, despite the long hours, heavy workload and high levels of external scrutiny, teaching can be one of the most rewarding professions. Yet many teachers do not stay the course. Department for Education figures show that nearly half of teachers leave the maintained sector within five years of qualifying. At a time when the school population is growing, this is a worrying trend. A recent roundtable sponsored by Randstad Education, a recruitment agency that specialises in education, brought together teachers and experts to discuss how we can recruit, motivate and retain teaching staff. John Howson, managing director of the research company DataForEducation.info, began by providing a context for the discussion. Immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, he said, 30,000 people re-activated their registration with the General Teaching Council, and teaching places became relatively easy to fill. As the effects of recession have diminished, however, the trend has reversed: &quot;Last year was the first year where we failed to recruit enough people into training in a number of subjects.&quot; The biggest shortfall was in design and technology, and the second in physics. Numbers applying for computer science places were also dropping as the IT industry grew. A further challenge, said Howson, was that almost half the teachers now working in the maintained sector are under 35 and in the first ten years of their career: &quot;That has significant implications for continuing professional development (CPD), compared to seven or eight years ago when we had a very large number of very experienced teachers coming towards the end of their teaching careers.&quot; Recruiting new teachers into the profession is the first hurdle. There was frustration among some attendees that the media gave mixed \u2013 and often misleading \u2013 messages about teachers, such as scare stories about over-zealous health and safety rules. Paul Stone, headteacher of Kibworth CE School, argued that teachers were their own worst enemy: &quot;People will listen to teachers about how hard it is to be a teacher. We need to equip teachers with the resilience to stay in the job.&quot; Teaching could learn from the way recruitment is managed in other professions, argued Jon Coles, chief executive of United Learning: &quot;In most professions, a few major recruiters really drive recruitment for an industry. If you look at the numbers of people who are recruited by the big four accounting firms or the big solicitors&apos; firms, you see big national targeted campaigns focused on milk rounds and other forms of recruitment. Those people oversupply trainees to their profession and provide a very large number of people who need to be trained for a particular profession, well beyond what they need for their own business.&quot; Extended training Coles added that these professions have periods of extended training, driven by examinations or a portfolio of assessment, leading to chartered status and membership of a professional body. He is a &quot;strong advocate&quot; of the introduction of a royal college of teaching that would play a similar role: &quot;I think we badly need to have that extended early period of professional development, in which people focus on achieving a higher standard of professional competence associated with fellowship or chartered status.&quot; Currently, the roundtable heard, there was a lack of clear career development pathways for teachers. While initial teacher training has, since the 1960s, been provided mostly by higher education institutions, the Schools Direct and Teach First initiatives have enabled some teachers to be trained in schools. Toby Greany, professor of leadership and innovation at the Institute of Education, argued that there was a risk of universities being sidelined: &quot;We&apos;re in danger of destructing the role of universities in the role of teacher education because we&apos;re going hell for leather for Schools Direct. Having good initial teacher training is a really strong component of a good, healthy schools system.&quot; He was worried that the move to a school-led system was not being accompanied by &quot;the organisational infrastructure to support people&apos;s careers&quot;, and believed that schools and universities should work together to &quot;agree a common framework&quot; for teacher training and development. There was a consensus around the table that there was not enough emphasis on CPD in the early stages of a teacher&apos;s career. Stone said that other countries devoted far more time to CPD than the UK: in Shanghai, for example, teachers are required to spend 240 hours on CPD in the first five years of their working life. He had introduced a project to give some poorly performing teachers an extra six hours a week of non-contact time in a state primary, with the result that all nine are now achieving outstanding outcomes. Caroline Hoare, director of people at the Girls Day School Trust, pointed out that, compared with many other countries, teachers in the UK spend a lot of time teaching, with little time for developing their practice: &quot;In surveys, the thing that comes back time and again is time: people want the time to think, reflect and prepare \u2013 not just doing the marking, but reflecting and collaborating.&quot; It is not just the quantity of CPD that is important, but the quality, the roundtable heard. Ty Goddard, co-founder of the Education Foundation, said: &quot;Often you need to practise your pedagogy and there are too few opportunities to practise the craft of the classroom. The majority of CPD is passive learning: &apos;Let&apos;s get the guru in to give our teachers a PowerPoint presentation.&apos; But adults do not learn best in those passive environments.&quot; Attendees agreed that CPD should focus principally on peer review and observation of classroom practice. Graham Lacey, executive principal of Southbank International School, said that the school had introduced an enhanced appraisal process where everybody is appraised three times a year: &quot;By far the most important form of professional development is observing them teach and them recognising that they&apos;re open to improvement.&quot; Time to think Greany argued that CPD should include &quot;creating time for colleagues to work together and think, &apos;How do I get better?&apos;&quot; The evidence, he said, was that &quot;high-performance workplaces are learning organisations \u2013 you&apos;re excited about coming to work, it&apos;s collaborative, they make you feel valued, there are opportunities to have your say and make a difference.&quot; He acknowledged, however, that &quot;creating those high-performance workplaces is a challenge across 21,000 schools.&quot; One suggested solution was to have greater collaboration between schools in developing CPD models. Goddard said he would like to see the profession &quot;taking ownership of its own development&quot;. He felt that funding from the pupil premium or the Education Endowment Foundation could be used to develop good CPD practices. Goddard suggested that different models of CPD practices could become associated with particular schools or regions \u2013 a Manchester CPD model or a London CPD model, for example. The roundtable also discussed how to tackle teacher attrition. Phil Bourne, development director of the Teacher Development Trust, argued for making retention an accountability measure: &quot;If Ofsted adopted a framework with a focus around retention and engagement we would see massive improvements quickly.&quot; Some participants felt schools needed better strategies to cope with the fact the profession was increasingly dominated by women, many of whom needed to take maternity leave. Coles said that schools needed to encourage part-time working and job sharing, and found it &quot;shocking&quot; that so many headteachers often had negative attitudes to flexible working. There was a feeling in the roundtable that academy chains or schools in other collaborative arrangements were much better placed to do this than other schools. &quot;Individual schools are machines where the timetable drives everything and the accountability regime drives everyone&apos;s thinking,&quot; said Greaney. The introduction of performance-related pay (PRP) was a wild card that could change everything, however, leading perhaps to divergence in pay between different subject teachers and a squeeze on expenditure in other areas. &quot;The cultural change is going to be so profound that it will develop in ways that are entirely unpredictable,&quot; said Lacey. Despite some lively debate, there was broad agreement around the table about the need for greater collaboration between schools, more structured professional development and an increased emphasis on mentoring and coaching. There was also agreement that teaching offered a unique opportunity to change people&apos;s lives and shape the future. As Coles put it: &quot;The absolute differentiator is the opportunity to work with the most inspiring people in the country \u2013 young people. It&apos;s all about the direct feedback of having made a positive difference to an individual and seen the change in them.&quot; At the table Kerry Eustice (Chair) Head of education and society networks, Guardian News and Media Phil Bourne Development director, Teacher Development Trust Jon Coles Chief executive officer, United Learning Amy Haddow Content development manager, Randstad Education Ty Goddard Co-founder, The Education Foundation Chris Wheatley Chief executive officer, Flying High Trust Prof Toby Greany Professor of leadership and innovation, Institute of Education Paul Stone Head teacher, Kibworth CE primary school Caroline Hoare Director of people, Girls Day School Trust John Howson Managing director, DataforEducation.info Graham Lacey Executive principal, Southbank International School Stewart McCoy Strategic operations manager, Randstad Education Credits Seminar report/discussion commissioned and controlled by the Guardian.

Pei-Shen Qian was on Monday indicted on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and lying to the FBI. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan allege that he produced dozens of worthless fakes that were eventually sold by prestigious galleries for tens of millions of dollars. Accusing Qian and a pair of Spanish art dealers of being \u201cmodern masters of forgery and deceit\u201d, US attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement that the charges against the trio \u201cpaint a picture of perpetual lies and greed\u201d. The dealers \u2013 brothers Jose Carlos and Jesus Angel Bergantinos Diaz, 58 and 65 \u2013 are awaiting likely extradition proceedings, after being arrested and bailed in Spain last week. However, prosecutors could only say that Qian, who previously lived in Queens with his wife, was \u201cbelieved to be located in China\u201d, which has no extradition treaty with the US. The Obama administration has little chance of extracting Qian, who has both Chinese and American citizenship, even if it were willing to devote diplomatic efforts to doing so, according to Professor Julian Ku, an expert on China and international law at Hofstra University. \u201cThere is almost no chance that China would turn their own citizen over,\u201d said Ku. \u201cThey generally don\u2019t have a policy of co-operating, and don\u2019t have any reason to turn anyone over, because the US won\u2019t turn anyone over to China.\u201d An FBI spokesperson would only say on Tuesday: \u201cWe do hope to make an arrest, but he is in China, so \u2026\u201d before referring the Guardian to the US attorney\u2019s office. A spokeswoman there said: \u201cUnfortunately we wouldn\u2019t have anything further to add.\u201d Interviewed in Shanghai by Bloomberg News in December last year, Qian said that he was the innocent victim of a \u201cvery big misunderstanding\u201d and had never intended to pass off his paintings as the genuine works of modern masters. \u201cI made a knife to cut fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if others use it to kill, blaming me is unfair.\u201d A 42-page indictment unsealed on Monday, however, alleges that he knowingly participated in a fraud plot with the Bergantinos Diaz brothers and Glafira Rosales, an art dealer who is also Jose Carlos Bergantinos Diaz\u2019s former girlfriend. Rosales, 57, pleaded guilty last year to crimes related to selling 60 fraudulent artworks, and has been cooperating with authorities. Qian, who once painted portraits of Chairman Mao for display in Chinese workplaces and schools, arrived in the US on a student visa in 1981. He is said to have been discovered by Jose Carlos later that decade as he was painting at an easel on a lower Manhattan street corner. According to the indictment, he began copying works by artists such as Keith Haring and Jean Michel Basquiat, and forging the artists\u2019 signatures; then, despite knowing \u201cthey were essentially worthless imitations,\u201d Jose Carlos would sell the copies to galleries. By the early 1990s, prosecutors say, Qian was churning out signed fakes from his home studio in Queens under instructions from the Bergantinos Diaz brothers and Rosales. In pursuit of authentic-looking forgeries, Jose Carlos is said to have bought Qian old canvases at flea markets and auctions, and supplied him with old paint. He also \u201cstained newer canvases with tea bags to give them the false appearance of being older than they really were\u201d, said the indictment, which also claimed that some works were subjected to the heat of a blow dryer, while others were left outside and exposed to the elements. Works by other modern artists such as Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman, Sam Francis and Franz Kline were also ripped off by Qian, according to prosecutors, who said he was found to own books and auction catalogues about the artists he copied. They allege that throughout the 1990s, Qian was sometimes paid as little as \u201cseveral hundred\u201d dollars for each forgery, but that after spotting one of his creations priced far higher in a Manhattan art show, he \u201cdemanded more money\u201d \u2013 and got it. By February 2008, Jose Carlos was allegedly writing Qian cheques for up to $7,000 per painting. Far bigger sums of money, however, were involved when the trio of dealers allegedly sold the forgeries on to respected New York galleries. The prestigious Knoedler &amp; Co, referred to as \u201cGallery 1\u201d in the indictment, is alleged to have paid $20.7m for Qian\u2019s forgeries \u2013 and then made $43m in profit by selling them to wealthy collectors. A second gallery is said to have made $4.5m selling Qian fakes that it bought for $12.5m. Knoedler, which closed in 2011, is being sued for millions of dollars in lawsuits brought by disgruntled buyers. The gallery and its former executives have always denied committing any fraud and insisted that they made comprehensive efforts to authenticate Qian\u2019s paintings. The Bergantinos Diaz brothers and Rosales are accused of faking detailed backstories of the paintings and falsely claiming to represent clients in Europe. Rosales pleaded guilty to nine criminal charges in September last year and faces up to 99 years in prison when she is sentenced later this year. She was also ordered to forfeit $33.2m in property and wealth and may face further penalties. The brothers are charged with conspiring to commit wire fraud and money-laundering. Jose Carlos, who lived in New York, is also accused of defrauding the IRS and filing false tax returns to hide more than $7m in income from the scheme. If he is convicted of all the charges against him, he could be sentenced to as much as 114 years in prison. His brother faces a sentence of up to 80 years. An official from the Spanish interior ministry told the New York Times last week that, after he was arrested at a hotel in Seville last Friday, Jose Carlos suffered an anxiety attack and was hospitalised. His brother had been arrested in Spain four days earlier, according to US prosecutors. Neither could be reached for comment on Tuesday. The US is expected to request their extradition by Spanish authorities under a treaty agreed to by the two countries in 1970. Qian, however, is likely to prove more elusive. He and his wife are believed to have left for China several months before he was named as \u201cthe painter\u201d at the centre of the scandal in August last year. At some point before that, US prosecutors confirm, he was questioned by the FBI. However, he claimed not to know Rosales or the names of artists whose work and signatures he is accused of forging, and insisted he had not faked their style.  \u201cThe downside for him will be that he can\u2019t travel to the States any more, or to other countries with which the US does have an extradition treaty \u2013 most of Europe, many countries in South America and Hong Kong,\u201d said Ku. \u201cBut China is a good place to run if you are fearing prosecution in the US.\u201d", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "US crime", "US news", "World news", "China", "Spain", "The art market"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-22T19:55:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/24/is-perth-really-a-sports-graveyard", "sentences": ["The WA tourism minister, Liza Harvey, told Guardian Australia that Perth would take advantage of its geographical positioning  \u201cPerth is in close proximity to South East Asia and shares a similar time zone to many major Asian cities including Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul,\u201d she said."], "title": "Is Perth really a sports graveyard?", "article": "I was in the middle of a long drive to Perth\u2019s outer suburbs when I was snapped out of my reverie by sudden excitement emanating from the radio.

Woo hoo, Australian darts champion Simon &quot;The Wizard&quot; Whitlock \u2013 that dude with the mullet and goatee \u2013 will be making the trek to the Wild West in August! I shouldn\u2019t be so flippant. It\u2019s great that Perth is starting to attract international sports events. And smaller sports are probably a way for Perth to gain much-needed credibility as a destination for major spectacles. In July, two ice hockey matches between Canada and USA will be staged in Perth. True, the teams will be lacking most of their NHL firepower but there\u2019s already been sufficient public interest, the first scheduled game a sell-out.  Left-field initiatives are emerging, including a proposal to redevelop Perth\u2019s dilapidated baseball stadium \u2013 called, funnily enough, Baseball Park \u00ad\u2013 situated on the fringes of the metropolitan area. It has fuelled hopes international games could be held there in the future. The World Baseball Classic \u2013 basically the sport\u2019s world cup \u2013 is scheduled for 2017 and Australian Baseball League (ABL) officials plan to bid for matches to be held at a revamped Baseball Park. It seems like a pipedream but the WA government has put forward $1.5m for phase one of the master plan to redevelop the venue, with costs rising to $20m over eight years.  Other events in Perth\u2019s not-so-congested sports calendar include the Margaret River Pro, held in WA\u2019s south-west and featuring some of the world\u2019s best surfers, the V8 Supercar event and Australia\u2019s richest annual golf tournament, the Perth International.  Of course, there\u2019s also the summer mainstay, the Hopman Cup, which has been Perth\u2019s crown jewel because of its ability to attract tennis royalty. Unfortunately, the event\u2019s shine is fading with attendances dropping 20% during the last tournament in January. The Brisbane International has started to lure the big names \u2013 Roger Federer and Serena Williams headlined this year. Fears linger in the west on the tournament\u2019s viability and whether it will eventually find a new home on the east coast.  And that\u2019s Perth\u2019s constant bane. It has to battle with the east. Melbourne and Sydney are internationally renowned cities. The former is one of the premier sports destinations in the world, while the latter still radiates from its Olympics success 14 years ago.  Perth sports fans would not be startled if it lost another high-profile event. But some of Perth\u2019s woes have been self-inflicted. After all, in recent years the WA government did not rebid for the Red Bull Air Race and Rally Australia. It also balked at the chance to host Liverpool and Manchester United last year. Even worse, next summer Perth will not stage a Test match, although it was Cricket Australia who pulled the trigger on that decision.  Western Australians are notoriously one-eyed. It\u2019s a place where secession talk ludicrously becomes fodder for shock jocks on talkback. Yep, isolation can make some folk stir crazy. But even the most ardent Sandgroper isn\u2019t delusional when it comes to the state\u2019s sports infrastructure. Patersons Stadium \u2013 nee Subiaco Oval - is an aged facility. And I\u2019m being kind, I could unleash invective but there\u2019s no point because AFL matches will be moving to Perth Stadium in Burswood, apparently in 2018. The seats are uncomfortable, there\u2019s barely any leg room \u2013 it\u2019s worse than a budget airline. Fortunately, I\u2019m relatively young and emaciated, yet I still loathe sitting through hours of discomfort. I cringe seeing the pain the elderly and rotund people endure. Perth\u2019s other prominent sport venue is the Waca. A ground famous for producing pitches that made Dennis Lillee, a bevy of West Indian quicks and Mitch Johnson salivate. Regrettably, it\u2019s a horrible destination for spectators. Basic amenities \u2013 ahem, toilets \u2013 are inadequate and there\u2019s barely any shade provided for the bulk of the ground. That\u2019s unfortunate, considering the uncanny knack of interminable sweltering weather coinciding with Tests. During the Ashes last December, I remember wincing at the sight of English (and Aussie) fans walking around the city. Most supporters\u2019 faces were akin to WA\u2019s outback terrain of red dust. Sunburnt and dishevelled figures trudged around with second-degree burns. It was the catalyst for me having to turn down a ticket to Australia\u2019s final day triumph. Even the chance of watching Australia reclaim the urn wasn\u2019t going to propel me to bake under 40C heat.  Traditionalists may complain, but cricket needs to be moved to the Burswood locale. Despite the scepticism, the future for Perth sport lovers looks relatively promising. Perth Stadium is expected to have a capacity of about 60,000 (Patersons Stadium holds an underwhelming 43,000) and it is hoped it will finally become the international calibre stadium the city desperately craves. Perth Arena, which opened in 2012, has created a vibrant atmosphere during Perth Wildcats games. China v Australia basketball matches, exclusive to WA, were played there last year.  Perth does have one crucial geographical advantage over its eastern counterparts, and that&apos;s Asia. China is an obvious market to court, but south-east Asia is appealing too. Singapore\u2019s Sports Hub, with its centrepiece 55,000 seat stadium, is set to open mid-year and is expected to attract high-profile events. Kuala Lumpur is also emerging, which was highlighted when the city staged the Laureus World Sports Awards last month.  There should be enough scope for Perth to piggyback on these cities, and the state government seems to be heeding the message. The WA tourism minister, Liza Harvey, told Guardian Australia that Perth would take advantage of its geographical positioning  \u201cPerth is in close proximity to South East Asia and shares a similar time zone to many major Asian cities including Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul,\u201d she said. \u201cThis provides many benefits.\u201d Perth is smeared with a dubious perception nationwide. For the uninitiated, &apos;Dullsville&apos; is Perth&apos;s ignominious moniker. Despite boasting beautiful beaches, lush greenery dotting its sprawling landscape and pristine weather, Perth can&apos;t unshackle its staid stereotype. Maybe, just maybe, it can through the power of sports.

Is he based here in Shenzhen, we ask? No, in Beijing, but like many of the other companies exhibiting, all of his factories are based in the city.   In early April, Shenzhen hosted its first major Maker Faire. These events started out in 2006 in San Mateo, California, featuring a range of workshops, exhibitors, and demonstrations which all fell under the general umbrella of DIY culture. Many more followed in the US and overseas, both as large flagship events and as independently produced &quot;Mini Maker Faires&quot; hosted by local community groups (full disclosure: I\u2019ve helped to run the Brighton events for the past two years). Playing host to a mix of the fanciful, the fantastic and the practical \u2013 previous events have included fire-breathing horses, soldering workshops, and performers who play music through massive modified Tesla coils \u2013 Maker Faires are a &quot;festival of invention, creativity and resourcefulness&quot; according to their founders at Maker Media; fun, noisy, intentionally family-friendly spaces which are a little more anarchic than the sometimes po-faced science fairs, and where something, somewhere, is usually being set on fire, or being rigged up to the internet, or both.   Maker Faires also celebrate, and are foundational in shaping, the modern &quot;Maker Movement&quot; who comprise a &quot;well-spring of innovation, creative new products and producing value in the community&quot; as Maker Media describe them. Under this general ethos of &quot;maker culture&quot;, Maker Faires also take on the characteristics and politics of their host regions. In 2015, London plays host to one of the flagship events in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, a move which is both about showcasing British technological know-how and also driving the urban regeneration of East London, &quot;propelling forward our vision to cultivate a hotbed of tech talent on the site, creating thousands of jobs&quot;, as Boris Johnson described it. The language of &quot;making&quot; has also been picked up by politicians to invoke hard work and productivity, with George Osborne describing the 2014 budget as one for &quot;the makers, the doers and the savers&quot;.   And so to Shenzhen, where things are made by the hundreds of thousands. China itself is one of the largest and most swiftly developing economies in the world, expanding the industrial capacity of its high-tech industries to act as the global economy\u2019s &quot;world factory&quot;, answering Western desire for information and communications technology (ICT) consumer goods. In the past decade, China\u2019s ICT industry has been one of the most rapidly developing industrial sectors in the world, with ICT manufacturing concentrated in the Guangdong region where the city of Shenzhen sits, just across from Hong Kong. Shenzhen itself was China\u2019s first Special Economic Zone (SEZ), allowing it to receive the foreign investment enabling it to expand and develop massively over the past thirty years; one third of Guangdong\u2019s ICT manufacturing establishments are in Shenzhen, and are dominated by the processing of electronic components. The scale of the city is astonishing \u2013 one of the fastest growing cities in the world, its population is already 10 million strong. The cityscape is morphing around its growth, with the effect of driving through mile after mile of reality-bendingly enormous half-finished high-rise buildings being a little like being dropped inside a full-scale version of Minecraft.   The city\u2019s history rippled into Maker Faire Shenzhen, which sat in the shadow of these high-rises. As expected, many of the classic Maker Faire features were in place: soldering workshops, talks by &quot;makers&quot;, people looking awkward in Google Glass. Yet Maker Faires are often characterised by lots of DIY projects and arts-tech mash-ups, and these were conspicuously lacking. Instead, most stalls were occupied by fully realised electronics products \u2013 brainwave-controlled drones, robots, lots and lots of 3D printers \u2013 either ready for market, or in their beta stage and shipping later in the year. Glossy product catalogues and order sheets were everywhere. Representatives of local manufacturing firms also filled the fair, wandering through the stalls to see if anyone showcasing interesting prototypes wanted to get them mass-produced in bulk. These guys were interesting \u2013 a bridge between Shenzhen\u2019s 30-year old manufacturing hulk, and the recent shifts into what modern &quot;maker culture&quot; is becoming. One of the claims being made about this &quot;new industrial revolution&quot; of making is that some of those that start out boshing things together in their local hackspace will end up transforming from &quot;Maker to Market&quot;, turning the technologies they\u2019ve developed in grassroot community settings into commercial products. The process has also been linked to the emergent &quot;Internet of Things&quot; space, with claims made that the creativity and hardware skills found in maker communities might give rise to new products and prototypes; and is similar to how user innovators sometimes become entrepreneurs.  It is also bloody difficult \u2013 not only the leap from hobbyist to founder, but the scramble into finance, mass manufacture, and supply chains, and from that perspective, plopping a Maker Faire down in the &quot;factory of the world&quot; makes a lot of sense. Even Chris Anderson, author of Makers: The New Industrial Revolution acknowledged in his keynote speech that he was moving some of the manufacturing component of his personal drone company to Shenzhen. The region\u2019s strengths in consumer electronics may also be particularly well-suited to the potential outputs of &quot;Maker to Market&quot; outputs, starting with simplified prototypes built on open hardware technologies such as Arduino\u2019s (as opposed to, say, Germany, whose manufacturing strengths lie in the sophisticated and specialised technologies of cars and &quot;mechatronics&quot;, and whose production requires a highly skilled and costly labour force).   Several hardware start-up accelerators have also set up shop in the city, including Haxlr8r and PCH\u2019s Highway 1, and they acknowledge that yes, Virginia, regional innovation systems exist: participants spend time in Shenzhen to learn about the manufacturing and supply chain networks in the city, before being returned to the Bay Area to pitch for funding. The international nature of the accelerator program is super-interesting if you like that sort of thing (which I do) \u2013 &quot;making&quot;, in scarequotes, can sometimes be framed as a highly localised activity, taking place in sheds and hackspaces and basements. Yet the easy-to-use, flexible and low-cost technologies which underpin it \u2013 open hardware microcontrollers and 3D printers, for example \u2013 have their own materiality, and their own geography. The production of the Raspberry Pi is split between Wales and China, with its director, Eben Upton, describing in an interview with Tech Republic that logistical economics made it &quot;all but impossible&quot; to locate the manufacturing in the UK:  \u2018All of the component inventory is in China, the whole global supply chain is set up to take components manufactured in factories in China, and send them to other factories in China, which assemble them into products and ship them to the west\u2019.  Thinking about the provenance of these technologies also raises questions about the work that goes into producing them, as well as the labour practices of the wider movement. Much of the rhetoric around the &quot;maker movement&quot; considers &quot;makers&quot; to be enthusiasts who love what they do with passion acting as some form of perpetual motion machine. And this flailing enthusiasm is a very real thing: I offer up the trip I took to the Huangqiangbei enormous electronics market as an example, where my colleagues and I voiced excited squeals of the type that only dogs can hear. But physical labour goes into producing the components that were in that market and in hackspaces around the world. Manufacturing practices in the Guangdong region have been put under the microscope in recent years: at the time of writing, upwards of 30,000 staff are striking at apparel factories in the Guangdong Province about unfair pay; and Foxconn, one of the sponsors of the Maker Faire and operator of the largest factory inside Shenzhen\u2019s city limits, has also been subject to interrogation about the working conditions in its factories.  In &quot;Maker to Market&quot; spaces, things can get even messier. Several of the companies on this path depend on \u2018open innovation\u2019 models that allow them to engage with keen communities, providing ongoing feedback and mass customisation. This also allows customers to be used as a cheap form of R&amp;D; a practice common in the creative and culture industries, described by Miya Tokumitsu as &quot;Do what you love&quot; where a volunteer workforce works for passion and social capital rather than actual hard cash.   Finally, Maker Faire Shenzhen raises questions about what &quot;maker culture&quot; actually is and how it manifests. The country has its own DIY &quot;maker&quot; scene and numerous makerspaces, each of which is shaped by its surroundings. Beijing Makerspace works with major companies including Sony and Samsung who open their research labs to them. In Shenzhen, the scene spreads out from Seeed Studio, an open hardware facilitation company founded by Eric Pan in 2008 which sits at the intersection of industrial manufacture and what &quot;maker culture&quot; looks like in that space.  The company designs and produces its own open hardware technologies; acts as a distributor for a large number of &quot;maker&quot; brands including Arduino and Oomlout; and assisted in founding both Haxlr8r and the Chaihuo makerspace in Shenzhen. It also helps people make and distribute their own designs, filling a gap between the small companies starting out and the nearby factories which are still mostly set up for large scale production in the order of many hundreds of thousand units. All of the factors which make Shenzhen a competitive industry hub \u2013 cheap and available raw materials, manufacturing skills and facilities, entry points into supply chains \u2013 make it attractive to &quot;makers&quot;; and prior to the Maker Faire, the Dangerous Prototypes group ran a two-day HackerCamp in Shenzhen where participants learnt soldering skills in the city\u2019s cell phone repair school.   But &quot;making&quot; and the wider dynamics of innovation have different textures in this space. At the ground level, the entry-level electronics which are \u2018low cost\u2019 to foreign consumers such as Arduino microcontroller, can be costly for domestic Chinese enthusiasts, although their cheaper clones can be found easily on the e-commerce site Taobao. Online spaces for collaboration can also shift; in 2013 access to GitHub, the collaborative repository for open source code was temporarily blocked.  At the wider level, the manufacturing networks have become adept in the &quot;shanzhai&quot; methods of &quot;absorbing, adapting, prototyping and market testing&quot; new products at rapid speed, as examined by the Hacked Matter research hub in Shanghai. China itself has been termed an &quot;absorptive state&quot; which is getting better and better at combining its own local capabilities and infrastructure with foreign technologies and knowledge.   The &quot;maker&quot; identity can be framed by flattened shared qualities and values, working with technologies whose provenance is not always transparent. But nothing in technology is so simple or so isolated. Maker Faire Shenzhen shines a light on the externalities and ecosystems of making itself: the political regimes which regulate; the infrastructures which support it; the forms of work that drive it; and the culture and history that shape it.

Ayrton was the driver I looked up to, way before I even started racing."], "title": "Ayrton Senna to be remembered in Imola 20 years after his death", "article": "     Ayrton Senna never drove for Ferrari, the most passionately supported of all Formula One teams, but in the northern Italian town of Imola, where the great champion perished 20 years ago, they are putting aside such petty prejudices. Five days of events to mark Senna&apos;s death will commence on Wednesday, for the last man to die in a grand prix is remembered like no other. Senna was one of the three or four greatest drivers in history, and very possibly the finest; his sheer speed, high intelligence, utter dedication, ruthlessness and good looks placed him apart from his rivals, and his early death added lustre to the legend. The figures are incredible enough \u2013 three world championships, 41 wins and 65 poles \u2013 but it was the ferocity of his will outside as well as inside the car that separated him from the others in his sport. This was a man who walked away from his wife, his country and his friends in order to devote himself to Formula One. Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso are not always in agreement, as anyone who worked at McLaren in 2007 would ruefully agree, but in their grief for the loss of their hero they are united. Sitting beside each other shortly before the last grand prix in Shanghai, Hamilton said: &quot;When I was a kid I had all the books, all the videos ... Ayrton was the driver I looked up to, way before I even started racing. &quot;He inspired me to be a driver and on the day of his passing, his death was ... it was very difficult for me to show my emotions in my family, so I went off to a quiet place and it was very difficult for several days ... your hero&apos;s gone. &quot;He is an incredible legend. You can still learn things from how he approached racing and how he drove. You like to think that one day you may be recognised as someone that was able to drive similarly to him. He was always my favourite driver.&quot; Alonso said: &quot;It&apos;s the same for me. He was an inspiration. I remember some of the races that we could see in the news in Spain, because we didn&apos;t have the TV coverage of Formula One. &quot;I remember I went to school and on my book I didn&apos;t have pictures of girls, but I had Ayrton there, and the same in my room. I had a big poster of Ayrton and even my first go-karts were in the colours of Ayrton&apos;s McLaren because my father also liked him. &quot;It was a very sad moment [when he died]. I know there is something happening at Imola in Italy in the next weekends and I intend to be there, just to be close on this unfortunately important day.&quot; He was first known as Ayrton da Silva, then Ayrton Senna da Silva and finally Ayrton Senna. His first F1 team was Toleman, and his aggression \u2013 he would drive straight at competitors rather than yield \u2013 upset everyone. &quot;I could maybe forgive him if I liked him, but I don&apos;t,&quot; said one of his rivals, Michele Alboreto. But Toleman knew exactly how good he was. The engineer Pat Symonds, who is now with Williams, told Christopher Hilton, in Memories of Senna: &quot;There was one area at Dallas where just about everyone hit the wall. He hit it there too. When he got back to the pits he said: &apos;I just cannot understand how I did that. I was taking it no differently than I had been before. The wall must have moved.&apos; &quot;We thought: &apos;Yeah, right, sure the wall&apos;s moved.&apos; He was very insistent on this so after the race we went out and had a look. The wall had moved. It was concrete blocks and someone had clipped it, moved it, moved it just a few millimetres \u2013 and I mean just a few millimetres \u2013 and he had been judging it that perfectly.&quot; His last employer in F1 was Frank Williams, who said: &quot;My abiding memory of Ayrton is not his world-class ability as a racing driver but as an intellectually unbeatable businessman. Throughout the several meetings that took place between me and Ayrton regarding his joining Willams, it became apparent that he arrived for each and every meeting fully prepared on every point for discussion. &quot;He had prepared in his mind at least three counter moves to every possible counter move by myself. He was gifted with a propensity for extraordinarily clear thinking and an outstanding ability to out-guess, out-think and out-manoeuvre his business opponent.&quot; When the president and CEO of Formula One Management Bernie Ecclestone was asked about the great Brazilian he said: &quot;The trouble with asking for good memories of Ayrton is that I do not have any bad ones. Perhaps my very vivid memories are of his strong opinion, and most of the time he was right.&quot; Back to Hamilton, who said recently: &quot;Sebastian Vettel always runs over the astroturf and over the kerb a little more than he should, going beyond the white line, which you&apos;re not actually allowed to do but they let you get away with it. &quot;In Senna&apos;s day, if he went one foot over that kerb, it would be grass and he would spin, and be penalised. He would be right on the limit, rather than over the limit, and I respect that style of driving more. &quot;Now you can go beyond and get back because modern tracks have run-off areas. They used to be gravel. Hit that, and your car was damaged or stuck. Now you can push beyond, go wide and come back on. &quot;If I could choose an era, I would love to have driven in Senna&apos;s time, 1988, 1989. The cars were dangerous then. When I went around Silverstone in his car, I went flat out and my head felt so exposed. I thought to myself: &apos;Jeez ... those guys.&apos;&quot;", "tags": ["Formula One", "Motor sport", "Formula One 2014", "Sport", "Ayrton Senna"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-26T21:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/bill-gates-china-peoples-daily-wealthy-charity", "sentences": ["An average Shanghai household, for example, brings in \u00a32,790 a year, while an average family in the inland province Gansu makes less than \u00a31,200."], "title": "Bill Gates urges China's wealthiest to give to charity", "article": "Bill Gates has urged China&apos;s extraordinarily wealthy business elite to shed its aversion to philanthropy and donate to the poor, a potent message in one of the world&apos;s most economically divided societies. &quot;Only when we help poor people break away from destitution and illness can the whole world achieve sustainable development,&quot; Gates wrote in the People&apos;s Daily, a mouthpiece of the country&apos;s top leadership. &quot;Investing in poor people requires the involvement of every social strata. I believe that the returns from investing in poor people are just as great as [returns] from investing in the business world, and have even more meaning.&quot; China had 358 billionaires at the end of 2013 \u2013 a rise of 41 over the previous year and the second-most of any country in the world, after the US. Yet in terms of charitable giving, it ranks among the world&apos;s worst. According to the World Giving Index 2013, an annual survey by the NGO Charities Aid Foundation (pdf) (pdf), China ranked 115 among 135 countries for donating money and last for volunteering. Income inequality counts among the country&apos;s most pressing social ills. According to a 2012 survey by Peking University, families in China&apos;s cities and coastal provinces earn significantly more than their rural and inland counterparts. An average Shanghai household, for example, brings in \u00a32,790 a year, while an average family in the inland province Gansu makes less than \u00a31,200. While handfuls of individuals have profited enormously from China&apos;s economic boom, few have shown willing to share their wealth. In 2010, Gates, who runs the $38bn Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the American business magnate Warren Buffet asked 50 of China&apos;s richest people to join a charity dinner in Beijing. Many turned down the invitation, reportedly because they were uncomfortable being asked for donations. Yet the country&apos;s philanthropic record is slowly improving. On Friday, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, co-founders of Alibaba, China&apos;s biggest e-commerce company, announced plans to fund a $3bn foundation, the country&apos;s largest. The amount represents about 2% of the company&apos;s equity, all of it from the founders&apos; shares. According to state media, the foundation will focus on environment, education and healthcare. Yet other details, such as its name and how the money will be distributed, remain unclear. Ma, China&apos;s eighth richest man, stepped down as Alibaba&apos;s CEO last year and has since dedicated much of his time to charity efforts. He sits on the Nature Conservancy&apos;s board of directors and helps lead kung fu star Jet Li&apos;s One Foundation. &quot;When you register a new foundation in China you need a supervisory agency, so a lot of people have worried that by registering a private foundation they&apos;d be giving up control over their personal wealth,&quot; said Anthony Spires, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who researches China&apos;s civil society. &quot;Many of these folks are used to being in charge \u2013 they have very clear issues that concern them \u00a0\u2026 and they don&apos;t want the government to tell them how to spend their money.&quot; Spires called the size of the promised foundation &quot;staggering&quot;. &quot;This will be the largest foundation in China, if they really do it,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s on par with Michael Bloomberg&apos;s philanthropy.&quot; Alibaba is preparing a high-profile initial public offering on the New York stock exchange. Analysts expect the company to be valued at more than $100bn, which would make its IPO one of the biggest in history. &quot;My wife and I had this thought of setting up a personal charitable fund when we started the business,&quot; Ma, 49, told the state newswire Xinhua. &quot;We&apos;d like to earn money before we turn 50 years old and do charitable work in our time after 50.&quot; Gates has responded to Ma&apos;s announcement, saying that the foundation will &quot;do an immense amount of good, particularly in this remarkable time in the development of philanthropy in China&quot;, the newswire reported.

To mark the opening of a flagship store, the fashion label&apos;s fourth in the city and its largest in Asia, Burberry staged a catwalk show designed to &quot;bring London to Shanghai&quot; as Bailey, its now-official CEO, put it. It was as much about selling Britishness to the Chinese consumer as it was about selling trenchcoats. The rise of Bailey (below) to chief executive makes him arguably the most powerful British figure in global fashion, and the first non-founding fashion designer at a major brand to have control of the boardroom as well as the design studio. He replaces Angela Ahrendts, who announced she was leaving for Apple at the end of last year, and finally joined the US tech firm this week.            The show&apos;s location is significant, with Shanghai basking in a second golden age. The haze of retro glamour that lingers from its 1930s heyday as the &quot;Paris of the east&quot; is being overlaid by a very modern buzz. Earlier this year, it overtook New York as the home of the big spender when a survey showed the city&apos;s luxury shoppers spent an average of $1,000 (\u00a3594) on their most recent purchase, compared with $500 among their Big Apple counterparts. In the ranking Global Fashion Capitals, based on tracking fashion-related words and phrases on the internet and blogosphere, Shanghai had risen 12 places to number 10. It is the only Asian city on the list.     Models Suki Waterhouse and Cara Delevingne pose with Christopher Bailey, new company's now-official CEO.  Photograph: Getty Images/PR company handout    Burberry know a thing or two about comebacks. When Bailey arrived in its design studio in 2001, the label was tired and compromised. Today it is one of the world&apos;s top five luxury brands, with annual revenue of more than \u00a32bn. &quot;I wanted it to be joyous and emotive, to combine dance and technology and illusion to create a celebration of all things British,&quot; said Bailey, who officially took over as chief executive on Thursday. He is also chief creative officer. A full-scale replica of the 1820 Regent Street theatre that became Burberry&apos;s London flagship store last year was built for the night in Shanghai. An audience of 1,500 guests included the Hong Kong actor Angelababy, who has 38 million followers on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. The curtain lifted to reveal a catwalk styled as a typical Georgian terraced street, complete with glossy black front doors, flagstones and streetlamps, which led from a projection of London landmarks at one end of the catwalk to the Shanghai skyline at the other. A catwalk presentation of Burberry&apos;s current collection was sandwiched between troupes of dancers clad in its more traditional trenchcoats and twirling umbrellas, and a finale which, in a clear nod to Danny Boyle&apos;s 2012 Olympics curtain-raiser, saw the model Cara Delevingne \u2013 in Burberry beige gabardine and check umbrella \u2013 transform into Mary Poppins and fly above the audience. Fashion relies on telling stories, and nowhere more so than in China. The country&apos;s first fashion show was in March 1979; by 2012, China had become the world&apos;s biggest consumer of luxury goods, accounting for 25% of worldwide sales. In the gold rush years between, brands vied to build their own mythologies. French and Italian luxury became battlegrounds over which brands \u2013 in some cases, not those most well-known in their own countries but those with the foresight to make an early incursion into China \u2013 staged land grabs.     A catwalk presentation of Burberry\u2019s current collection was sandwiched between troupes of dancers clad in its more traditional trenchcoats. Photograph: Dan Medhurst    But Britishness remains relatively virgin territory for fashion brands in China. Luxury car-makers including Bentley and Rolls-Royce have been successful, proving the value of Britishness for brands in China, but Burberry is the only luxury fashion brand from the UK operating on a large scale. (Mulberry once posed a threat, but is now in retreat.) A survey of 750,000 consumers and 50,000 brands in China last year showed that British brands were associated with being &quot;trustworthy&quot; and &quot;reliable&quot; \u2013 qualities important in Chinese culture, and ones that matter more than ever in a country awash with counterfeit goods. &quot;Trust and authenticity is enormously important in Chinese culture,&quot; said Bailey. That pillar of traditional London life the &quot;City gent&quot; was a prominent character in the Burberry show. A mixed troupe of British and Chinese male dancers, trenchcoats looped gracefully over their arms, performed a rush-hour dance routine along their London street, checking their wristwatches and hailing taxis, all in perfect synchronisation. It was a hymn to both nostalgic notions of British elegance and globalised ideals of elegant urban life. Bailey sees strong connections between Chinese and British culture, both in their roots and in contemporary life. &quot;In China there is a great love of history and classicism but, as in Britain, the people have become incredibly digital in everything \u2013 in how they communicate, how they shop, how they navigate their cities.&quot; Bailey&apos;s own persona is one of gentleness and humility, unusual qualities in a fashion designer which have proved helpful in forging business relationships in Shanghai. &quot;When you are guests of a city, which is how it feels when you open a store, it seems to me incredibly important to be respectful of that city,&quot; he said. &quot;We flew over a team from London who worked on this show together with a fantastic Chinese team. It&apos;s a partnership, and that&apos;s really important to me.&quot; The rock star&apos;s welcome given to Delevingne when she appeared on the catwalk was evidence of the immense appeal of high fashion in China, but on the streets of Shanghai the more wearable end of the Burberry offering was making a strong showing. The focus of Burberry&apos;s commercial message for the year is the trenchcoat, with the window displays of Shanghai&apos;s new flagship store devoted to classic belted coats in honey or black, with three simple shapes given very British names: the Sandringham, the Kensington and the Westminster.", "tags": ["China", "Burberry", "Fashion", "Retail industry", "Life and style", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-02T17:32:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/04/advice-stock-market-crashes-plane-disasters-bad-weather-risk-not-reading", "sentences": ["&quot;On average, for big decisions \u2013 say, whether to set up a new factory in Shanghai or not \u2013 every other decision is based on gut feeling,&quot; Gigerenzer says."], "title": "Advice on stock market crashes, plane disasters and bad weather.

From cancer? Or from any cause? The answer, three times: no. They just get more treatment, take more medication, and worry more often.&quot; The Bavarian-born Gigerenzer \u2013 though once a professional banjo player \u2013 has spent decades studying risk, and he long ago concluded that the ways we attempt to cope with life&apos;s uncertainties \u2013 including medical checkups \u2013 can make matters worse. These days, when he is in an upmarket restaurant, he won&apos;t even bother opening the menu: asking the waiter what he or she would order is the only way to get what&apos;s best, he insists. For research purposes, he once tested an unlikely strategy for managing financial risk: instead of trusting the experts, as most people might, what if you stopped pedestrians at random, gave them a list of companies, asked which ones they had heard of, then just invested in those? &quot;I try as hard as I can to live by my principles, so I put in a large sum of my own money,&quot; recalls Gigerenzer, who lives in Berlin but today is sipping coffee in the New York offices of his American publisher. &quot;It was one of the most lucrative things I&apos;ve ever done.&quot; For the rest of us \u2013 as Gigerenzer demonstrates in his new book, Risk Savvy \u2013 things regularly don&apos;t turn out so well. We hear a terrifying news story involving aeroplanes, so we switch to car travel instead, even though it&apos;s vastly more dangerous: in the 12 months following 9/11, that choice killed an estimated 1,600 Americans, unacknowledged victims of al-Qaida. Or we&apos;re told that taking the contraceptive pill &quot;doubles&quot; the risk of thrombosis \u2013 as the Department of Health notoriously announced in 1995 \u2013 but nobody explains what that really means: a doubling from one woman in every 7,000 to two in 7,000. That report scared so many women off the pill, it&apos;s been calculated, that there were 13,000 additional abortions in England and Wales the following year. And then there is the tale of the American weather forecaster who warned of a 50% chance of rain on Saturday, then a 50% chance on Sunday \u2013 meaning that the likelihood of rain that weekend, or so he claimed, was 100%. (Don&apos;t chuckle too hard: do you know what phrases such as &quot;a 30% chance of rain tomorrow&quot; really mean? In one study, most Berliners said it meant it would rain for 30% of the time the following day.) At first glance, Risk Savvy looks like yet another of those books that have become bestsellers recently by telling us we&apos;re much more foolish than we thought. We have learned that we are &quot;predictably irrational&quot;: that our decisions are influenced by factors as seemingly irrelevant as the height of the ceiling, the weather, or the strength of the car salesman&apos;s handshake; and that we do stupid things with money, such as travelling across town to save \u00a35 on a cheap kettle, but not bothering to make the trip when buying an expensive new laptop, even though the saving is the same. Yet one driving motivation behind Gigerenzer&apos;s work is to show that the thrust of this research is wrong: that we are not idiots, chronically misled by our instincts. In fact, he argues, we would handle risk far better if we knew when to trust our guts more, and when to spurn expert advice in favour of simple rules of thumb.     Gerd Gigerenzer: 'We can teach kids to understand risk.' Photograph: Oliver Hartung/The New York Time    &quot;The error my dear colleagues make,&quot; Gigerenzer says, is that they begin from the assumption that various &quot;rational&quot; approaches to decision-making must be the most effective ones. Then, when they discover that is not how people operate, they define that as making a mistake: &quot;When they find that we judge differently, they blame us, instead of their models!&quot; This is mainly a reference to Gigerenzer&apos;s long-running and mainly friendly dispute with Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel prize-winner and author of the hugely successful Thinking, Fast and Slow. Kahneman maintains that we have two inner &quot;systems&quot; for making decisions, the fast but error-prone unconscious system one, and the calculating, conscious system two, on which we ought to rely more. Gigerenzer, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin \u2013 his wife, the American historian Lorraine Daston, runs another of the numerous Max Planck institutes \u2013 thinks that distinction is absurdly vague, and that it is Kahneman who is error-prone. But far worse, he argues, are the political implications of this outlook. If we are hopeless bunglers, forever making bad decisions, it is easy to conclude that what is needed instead is a paternalistic society in which we surrender to experts: &quot;The idea is that if people can&apos;t be trusted to deal with risk and uncertainty, then someone else needs to do it.&quot; The approach known as &quot;nudging&quot;, which grew directly from Kahneman&apos;s work, is just the latest example: it takes it as a given that our urges lead us astray, then asks how those urges might be channelled in healthier ways. &quot;But this isn&apos;t a vision for the 21st century \u2013 to guide people along from birth to death like sheep!&quot; Gigerenzer says. His stance may make for some awkward conversations next month, when he visits David Cameron&apos;s behavioural insights team, AKA the Nudge Unit. (&quot;They wrote to me that they much admired my work,&quot; he says, a bit wryly.) In reality, though, experts may be guilty of more risk-related errors than the rest of us \u2013 or more consequential ones, anyhow. Gigerenzer recalls the surreal week in 2007 when Goldman Sachs executives blamed their firm&apos;s implosion on a sequence of &quot;25-sigma events&quot;. To put that in perspective, a five-sigma event is one you would expect to have occurred once between the end of the last Ice Age and today; a 25-sigma event is as likely as winning the national lottery 21 times in a row. And yet, as John Lanchester writes in his book I.O.U.: &quot;Goldman was claiming to experience them several days in a row. That is so wrong you can&apos;t put it into words. It shouldn&apos;t be possible to be that wrong.&quot; But the underlying mistake it had made was fairly simple, Gigerenzer thinks. Goldman thought it was operating in a world of calculable risks; in fact, it was operating in a world of true uncertainty, where the risk of different outcomes couldn&apos;t be known. &quot;The financial crisis had many causes, but one of them is this illusion that you could calculate the risk,&quot; he says. &quot;You have these very nice models, and they work, assuming that the world is stable and nothing in particular happens&quot; \u2013 which is, by definition, precisely not the case in a crisis. The banks&apos; mathematical risk models gave them a fatal sense of security: &quot;It&apos;s like having an airbag in your car that works all the time, except when you have an accident.&quot; Even when you can calculate the probabilities, trusting experts can be a terrible idea. Gigerenzer&apos;s research has shown that many doctors don&apos;t grasp the pros and cons of procedures such as cancer screening \u2013 or that they do, but have ulterior motives, such as not wanting to get sued if a patient declines screening then dies of cancer. Take mammograms: according to Risk Savvy, for every 1,000 women aged 50 or older who don&apos;t get routine screening, about five will die from breast cancer within a decade. For every 1,000 who do get screened, the figure&apos;s about four. Hardly a huge difference. And then there are the downsides of screening: for every 1,000 women, 100 will experience false alarms or other distress, while five will undergo unnecessary treatments, including mastectomy. Yet you&apos;re still more likely to see leaflets describing the benefits as &quot;a 20% risk reduction&quot;, or just dispensing with numbers in favour of condescending slogans: &quot;Why should I have a mammogram? Because you&apos;re a woman.&quot; Gigerenzer&apos;s team campaigns for fact-boxes setting out the upsides and downsides of each course of action; in Austria, they have already been adopted.     The pill: research says taking it doubles the chance of thrombosis. But this means 1 in 7,000 becomes 2 in 7,000. Photograph: Lehtikuva Oy/Rex Features    The consequences of misunderstanding risk can sometimes be more horrifying. In the early days of HIV testing, when the diagnosis felt like a death sentence, 22 blood donors in Florida were informed that they had tested positive. Was there any hope the tests might be wrong? Suppose, says Gigerenzer, that about five in 100,000 HIV tests administered to low-risk women result in false positives. That sounds tiny, and wouldn&apos;t provide much comfort. But there is a crucial additional fact: only about 10 in 100,000 women, in the US, have HIV anyway. So an average woman, receiving a positive result, has a one in three chance of being fine. But in the Florida case, before the possibility of false positives could be investigated, seven of the 22 donors had reportedly killed themselves. That is a case where more information would have been much better, but the surprising conclusion of much of Gigerenzer&apos;s work is the opposite: that we are often best advised to go with less information and rely on those simple rules of thumb, conscious or unconscious, that psychologists call &quot;heuristics&quot;. Recall those pedestrians, stopped at random and asked which companies they had heard of. This is known as the &quot;recognition heuristic&quot;, and it is a surprisingly good way to pick stocks, because there is a good correlation between a firm&apos;s performance and its prominence. (It is far from a flawless method, of course; the point is that it is less flawed than cleverer-seeming strategies.) In another study, Germans and Americans were asked which of two American cities, Detroit or Milwaukee, had the larger population. The Germans did much better than the Americans: they were much less likely to have heard of Milwaukee, so they (correctly) picked Detroit. The Americans knew too much: they got bogged down analysing possible reasons for either answer. In some parts of life \u2013 such as the arts, or romance \u2013 we are usually happy to trust our intuition. If a friend told you he had used data-gathering and number-crunching to conclude that he preferred Mozart over Beethoven, you would think him rather odd. &quot;And if the woman you desire has a spreadsheet, with all the possible names and consequences, and she does a calculation and selects you \u2026 well, would you really want to have been selected in this way?&quot; Gigerenzer wonders. &quot;Probably not.&quot; Playing a musical instrument well draws similarly on intuition as much as intellect \u2013 as Gigerenzer knows first-hand, having paid his way through college by playing the banjo in a German Dixieland band. And in cricket and baseball, fielders don&apos;t catch high-flying balls by calculating heuristics in their heads. Rather, they unconsciously use the &quot;gaze heuristic&quot;: they fix their eyes on the ball, then adjust their running speed so as to keep the angle of their gaze constant \u2013 which leaves them in the right place when the ball approaches the ground. But in business and politics, gut feelings are taboo: they are used all the time, but nobody dares admit it. &quot;On average, for big decisions \u2013 say, whether to set up a new factory in Shanghai or not \u2013 every other decision is based on gut feeling,&quot; Gigerenzer says. &quot;But executives won&apos;t admit this. So instead you find reasons after the fact. You send an employee on a two-week trip to find reasons to present to shareholders. Or you hire expensive consultants, who&apos;ll provide a 200-page document to justify the gut feeling, without mentioning that that&apos;s what they&apos;re doing.&quot; (The paperwork responsibilities piled on doctors, academics and others often fulfil a similar function.) In the worst cases, decisions get taken solely on the basis of whether they can be justified with data, which usually means a hyper-cautious adherence to the status quo. Hence another of Gigerenzer&apos;s rules of thumb: if an experienced person with a good track record has a strong hunch about some decision, listen to that person, and don&apos;t demand that she or he justifies the hunch with facts. That is the point about hunches: they operate at a level inaccessible to the conscious mind of the person who has them. What if the culture of Goldman Sachs had permitted its most senior managers to say &quot;I&apos;ve got a bad feeling about this&quot;, and for that to be taken seriously? In Germany, thanks largely to Gigerenzer&apos;s efforts, risk literacy is included on school curriculums in the early stages of education, and he&apos;s optimistic that the approach will spread more widely. He wrote Risk Savvy, he says, &quot;as an alternative to this flood of popular books that say we&apos;re foolish, irrational, and there&apos;s not much that can be done about us \u2026 But the assumption that people commit all these errors is only partly correct. And the assumption that there&apos;s no way to help them is strictly incorrect. We have experimental evidence that we can teach kids to understand risk. In fact,&quot; he adds, eyebrows bouncing with amusement, &quot;we can even teach doctors.&quot; Gut instinctGerd Gigerenzer&apos;s top risk tips 1 Always ask: &quot;What is the absolute risk increase?&quot;Journalists are fond of referring to a &quot;100% risk increase&quot;, a &quot;fivefold&quot; increase, and so on \u2013 but the absolute risk might be tiny. How many more people per thousand are actually affected? 2 Don&apos;t buy financial products you don&apos;t understandThat is not the same as being risk-averse. But it is the only reliable way to avoid falling prey to banks&apos; conflicts of interest \u2013 or being sold something even the bank staff don&apos;t understand. 3 Set your &quot;aspiration level&quot;. Then pick the first option that satisfies it and stop searching.This is &quot;satisficing&quot;, as opposed to &quot;maximising&quot;, and it can eliminate huge amounts of worry and wasted time. If you are buying, say, a new mobile phone, decide what matters most \u2013 cost, features etc \u2013 then purchase the first one that ticks those boxes. In principle, at least, it needn&apos;t be confined to small choices: why not use it to pick whom to marry? 4 Don&apos;t ask an expert what they recommend for you; ask them what they would do, or how they would advise a close relative.This triggers a shift in perspective, which helps focus things on the real risks and benefits of whatever is being discussed. \u2022 The picture caption on this article was amended on 5 May 2014.

I don&apos;t smell or see them, but I feel them \u2013 especially in Kuwait: it&apos;s one of the most haunted places on earth. Even with all the concrete and highways and esplanades. It&apos;s very creepy. We have Greek ruins in Kuwait. Alexander the Great built sacrificial temples on one of our islands. I always feel some kind of dread there. Even inside my house. It takes me hours to get to sleep. And music is a kind of ghost too: it&apos;s about conjuring memories, apparitions, something that reminds you of your past.&quot; It&apos;s odd to be talking about ghosts and revenants with Al Qadiri. After all, we&apos;re sitting inside PS1, MoMA&apos;s contemporary art hub in Long Island City, New York, that&apos;s meant to be an incubator for newness. And Al Qadiri, born in Senegal in 1981, is herself often seen as an icon of newness: she makes and curates conceptually inclined, drily satiric art; she&apos;s written for influential art and fashion journals Bidoun, Frieze and DIS; she&apos;s one of a growing band of producers \u2013 among them Holly Herndon, Laurel Halo, Maria Minerva \u2013 who have made waves in what often seems like the Boys Own world of international electronica. Yet it&apos;s hard to talk to Al Qadiri for any length of time without the spectres and demons of old Kuwait leaking into the conversation. &quot;Kuwait in the 1980s was a utopia. It was extremely comfortable and sheltered. I constantly had a feeling of it as sublime: the country is very flat, the sky is huge, and the buildings very low, so you&apos;re always looking up into this expanse. And, like the majority of middle-class Kuwaitis, I&apos;d go to London every summer to escape the 50-degree heat. I&apos;d go to Woolworths to buy candy and comic books. Andy Capp!&quot; Everything changed on 2 August 1990. &quot;I woke to watch a Japanese cartoon dubbed into Arabic and suddenly a black-and-white film kicked in. Some guy I&apos;d never heard of: Saddam. I remember thinking, &apos;Who is this guy?&apos; I didn&apos;t even know the word occupation.&quot; Iraq had just begun its invasion and, over the next seven months, more than 1,000 Kuwaitis were killed and 300,000 fled the country. Al Qadiri&apos;s parents stayed and, at great risk to their lives, joined the resistance. &quot;My mother would distribute forbidden newsletters by wearing an abaya \u2013 which she would never normally do \u2013 and pretending to be pregnant, so she could conceal the leaflets on her body. On one occasion she was stopped at a checkpoint where one of the soldiers told her, &apos;There is an occupation, but you Kuwaitis are still fucking like rabbits.&apos; If she&apos;d been detected, she&apos;d have been shot dead on the spot. &quot;All the phone lines were monitored by the Iraqi police. My father was once half an hour late to a meeting and when he arrived everybody at the safe house had already been murdered. Our family was moving from house to house almost every week, but still my father was eventually a prisoner of war. He was taken from our house to a concentration camp in Basra for a month.&quot; Al Qadiri says it was this period of conflict and chaos, of everyday extremism, that helped give birth to the music \u2013 icy, machinic, almost post-human \u2013 she currently makes. &quot;Kuwait was burned to the ground. It was an ashtray nation. In that alien landscape, I&apos;d wake up and see the illuminated darkness that was the daytime burning of the oil wells. The black sky was lit by the sun. I felt I was living in a sci-fi movie, as if I was in Blade Runner. You&apos;d hear machinegun fire, air-raid sirens. After I moved to America, it took me years to get over my fears about fireworks on the fourth of July. They sounded like bombs falling.&quot; For Al Qadiri, not yet a teenager and increasingly unable to leave bed or attend school, video games became a lifeline. &quot;Me and my young sister played them during and after the war. Even Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf! We were lords of the universe in video games. We had power. They were an alternative universe where we could react against traumatic adult reality. We could escape. And the music was so hypnotic! Little 8-bit melodies that lulled you into a waking sleep while playing the games.&quot; Living in a ravaged nation about which few westerners cared (French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, critiquing postmodern society&apos;s cult of the spectacle, claimed the Gulf war had not actually taken place; most TV footage focused on the Allied bombing of Baghdad rather than daily reality for Kuwaitis) and often retreating into the virtual and electronic worlds of gaming, Al Qadiri felt increasingly out of time and place. &quot;There&apos;s a strong bond between language and national identity, but my education was very English and colonial. I felt an outsider. I always felt lost, inferior, supremely alienated by Arabic. The written version of it is like Chaucer&apos;s English. Reading comic books in Chaucer&apos;s English is a mindfuck! I thought Arabic was bizarre, dusty, absolutely irrelevant. It gave me a continuous identity crisis until I studied linguistics and found the magical word &apos;triglossic&apos;.&quot; This means the existence of different varieties of a language in different situations: so Arabic, for instance, can exist in modern, journalistic fashion as much as in more classical variants. &quot;It was like unlocking the biggest puzzle of my life. Later, when text-messaging came into play, I was like, &apos;Woah!&apos;&quot; Al Qadiri felt equally out of place when she moved to America. &quot;I thought the country would be like Saved By the Bell or The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and that everybody had bleached teeth, good hair, and smelled of Gio Armani. I landed at Penn State University, which is right next to the state penitentiary and has the largest fraternity system in the world. I had one millimetre of orange hair, blue contact lenses and a giant orange fake-fur coat. I really looked like an alien. When I told people I came from Kuwait, they&apos;d reply, &apos;What state is that?&apos; I lasted one semester.&quot;      Reading on mobile? Listen to Szechuan from new album Asiatisch here Nations as mythologies, as fantasies, as erratic aggregations of commerce, junk-media, fabricated fictions: all these feed into Al Qadiri&apos;s debut album Asiatisch. Its title is derived from the German word for Asia, but it&apos;s actually about the concept of China. Song titles such as Shanghai Freeway, Hainan Island and Szechuan may reference real places, but the use of synthesised voices and digital snares alongside &quot;traditional&quot; gongs and bells, the toggling between classical poetry and nonsensical Mandarin, and the creation of a moodscape that moves seamlessly between cheesy, eerie and darkly erotic suggest that Al Qadiri is more interested in Chinas of the mind. &quot;I&apos;ve never been,&quot; she says unapologetically. &quot;The record is trying to posit a notion of an imagined China. This imagined China is for me something that has been brewing for centuries. It started with the opium wars. It&apos;s like a garbage tapestry: you don&apos;t know what the fabric is; it&apos;s not something that&apos;s easily identifiable or quantifiable; there&apos;s a catalogue of films and cartoons and comic books within it, but one that many authors have contributed to. The Asia in Asiatisch is a nexus of stereotypes that have been perpetrated, elaborated, embellished and weaved, each time further and further dislocated from the original misrepresentation.&quot; This sounds rather like Edward Said&apos;s concept of orientalism which, in his celebrated 1978 study, he characterised as a &quot;cultural apparatus that is all aggression&quot;. But where Said saw himself as a debunker and exposer of those phoney versions of the east peddled by novelists, historians and diplomats, there&apos;s little sense of protest in Asiatisch. Al Qadiri doesn&apos;t claim \u2013 or perhaps even seek \u2013 to stand outside of that &quot;nexus of stereotypes&quot;. &quot;I don&apos;t know the real China,&quot; she says. &quot;Only the China the west has been feeding me: this elaborate, simulated roadtrip through virtual China that has been developed over centuries.&quot;      Reading on mobile? Listen to Shanghai Freeway here The China that Al Qadiri creates isn&apos;t a source of ancient wisdoms. It is thrilling, hyper-sleek, as glistening, eager to delight and designed to ensnare as a shopping mall or the duty-free concourses of a modern airport. It&apos;s an emerald city, a sci-fi wonderland, a themepark simulation of China \u2013 a utopia that, like all utopias, doesn&apos;t exist. Or should that be a replicant China? &quot;I always think in architecture,&quot; says Al Qadiri. &quot;The China on this record would be brutalist architecture \u2026 made of jade. There&apos;s something very dainty and delicate about my melodic compositions, but they are made by digital tools, which also render them clunky, cold.&quot; The record bears the imprint of grime, especially a fleeting micro-genre of it christened &quot;sinogrime&quot; that circulated as a mix CD put together by Steve Goodman, aka Kode9, the boss at Al Qadiri&apos;s label Hyperdub. &quot;Grime immediately hit me in the gut,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I felt it was the most futuristic music I&apos;d ever heard. The most macho genre of western music. It was martial! The most apocalyptic and the most childlike music! And as a child who&apos;d lived through the apocalypse, it resonated with me. And as a videogame fan, I knew some of the earliest grime tracks were recorded using PlayStations.&quot; What&apos;s striking about a lot of art currently coming out of the Middle East, and the Gulf states in particular, is its relative lack of interest in tradition, reverence, continuity \u2013 all values that the west foists on other cultures. In her 2012 memoir The Girl Who Fell To Earth, Qatar-born film-maker Sophia Al-Maria, who has collaborated with Al Qadiri in the past, elaborates on her &quot;Gulf futurism&quot; theory: &quot;If you think of history as something defined by the laws of physics, and the discovery of gas and oil wealth as a sort of event horizon from which there is no going back \u2026 what&apos;s happened is a wormhole stargate mindfuck.&quot; The scale and intensity of the warp-speed modernisation programmes in so many Gulf states \u2013 their steel-and-glass citadels under baking hot suns, their labour camps full of imported labourers from Asia \u2013 are perhaps better chronicled by science fiction, video games and HD entertainment than by more traditional forms of journalism or sociology. &quot;There&apos;s been a generational quantum leap in Kuwait,&quot; says Al Qadiri. &quot;The houses are not made of mud any more, but of concrete. People don&apos;t sleep on the roofs of their houses. There&apos;s AC. &quot;My grandmother would get water from the well, waking up at 5am so that nobody would see her and so that her honour wouldn&apos;t be in question. Then she&apos;d come back before anyone else had woken up. She was illiterate, like most women of her generation. The idea of going to a university in America, as I did, was alien. She thought white people were demons, blue-eyed devils, thought they were djinns and evil spirits. Then my parents saw the transformation from a medieval lifestyle to a nation state. My generation went one step further: many of us studied or moved abroad. Now the majority of the Gulf population is under 24. It&apos;s a very youthful area.&quot;      Reading on mobile?

Education ministers pray their nation&apos;s youngsters will climb the international league tables. Around half the countries that take part (66 in 2012) have made significant school reforms in the light of the results. When the latest scores in the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa), as the testing regime is called, were published in December, England came 26th in maths, 23rd in reading and 21st in science. (The UK&apos;s overall performance was similar.) Michael Gove said the results &quot;eloquently&quot; made the case for a more academic curriculum, more rigorous exams, more academies and free schools, and other reforms introduced by the coalition. His junior minister, Liz Truss, went to Shanghai in China, which topped the league tables in all subjects \u2013 with Hong Kong and Singapore runners-up \u2013 to discover the secrets of its success. Chinese maths teachers have been invited to Britain to give &quot;masterclasses&quot; in teaching the subject. Now nearly 100 leading educational figures from around the world have issued an unprecedented challenge to Pisa \u2013 and what they call &quot;the negative consequences&quot; of its rankings \u2013 in a letter to its director, Andreas Schleicher. The signatories include top academics from Cambridge, Oxford, London, Bristol, Stanford (California), Columbia (New York), Ballarat (Australia), Canterbury (New Zealand) and Stockholm universities. The OECD, the letter says, has &quot;assumed the power to shape education policy around the world&quot;. Using &quot;tests widely known to be imperfect&quot;, it encourages governments to seek &quot;short-term fixes&quot; to climb the rankings; narrows our ideas of what education should be about; and kills the &quot;joy of learning&quot;, turning it into &quot;drudgery&quot;. Pisa, the signatories argue, dramatically increases the reliance on &quot;quantitative measures&quot; to rank and label pupils, teachers and heads. It is distorting the curriculum, reducing teachers&apos; autonomy and increasing stress levels in schools. The letter points out that the OECD \u2013 which has 34 member nations, most of them European \u2013 is focused on the economic role of schools. The 1,300-word letter to Schleicher \u2013 described by Gove as &quot;the father of more revolutions than any German since Karl Marx&quot; \u2013 is published on Tuesday on the Guardian website and on Global Policy, an online hub for leading academics and teachers. The letter argues that school reforms should not ignore the &quot;paramount&quot; role of socio-economic inequality in influencing pupil performance. It also argues that the OECD&apos;s growing influence over how schools are run and what they teach is profoundly undemocratic. Unlike Unicef and Unesco, it has no &quot;legitimate mandate&quot; in education. &quot;The OECD is a club,&quot; says Heinz-Dieter Meyer, professor of education policy at the State university of New York and one of the letter&apos;s organisers. &quot;There is not even an aspiration to democratic legitimation. You become a member only by being invited. The founders were the US and UK and they are still the chief influences. Just as governments in those countries were taken over by neoliberal Thatcherism and Reaganism, so was the OECD. Except that, while there is resistance to these policies in member countries, in the OECD they reign supreme. &quot;It looks more and more like a global super-ministry of education,&quot; says Meyer. &quot;It owns a very big chunk of the world&apos;s educational policy research. It has greater influence on the generation and analysis of educational data than any other single institution.&quot; Schleicher, he says, is endorsing controversial education policies. In the US, for example, he backed the Common Core, an initiative to establish consistent standards across the US which many teachers oppose. In New Zealand, educationalists say he has given \u2013 perhaps unwittingly \u2013 partisan support for the ruling National Party&apos;s education policies. The letter to Schleicher also says the OECD is cooperating &quot;with multi-national for-profit companies which stand to gain financially from any deficits \u2013 real or perceived \u2013 unearthed by Pisa&quot;. Pearson \u2013 owner of the Financial Times and Penguin Books and the world&apos;s biggest publisher of school textbooks \u2013 developed the assessment framework for the next Pisa tests, due in 2015. Schleicher told the Guardian that the OECD had hundreds of contracts with academics, researchers, public institutions and private companies to carry out particular aspects of its work. &quot;We do not enter continuing partnerships with companies; it would be inappropriate for us to do so.&quot; He also denied that Pisa endorsed government policies. &quot;All we said was that Common Core standards are in line with what they have in high-performing countries. We have empirical evidence for that.&quot; The letter says the OECD should cancel the next round of Pisa tests. This would allow time to develop &quot;more meaningful and less easily sensationalised ways of reporting assessment outcomes&quot;. Parents, teachers and pupils should be involved in discussing the changes. &quot;Education policy across the world is being driven by the single aim of pushing up national performance levels on Pisa,&quot; says one signatory, Stephen Ball, professor at London university&apos;s Institute of Education. &quot;It&apos;s having a tremendously distorting effect, right down to the level of classroom teaching.&quot; Another signatory, Sally Tomlinson, research fellow at Oxford university&apos;s education department, says that, though the Pisa league tables appear to be scientifically based, &quot;you really can&apos;t compare a country the size of Liechtenstein with one the size of China and nor can you compare education systems that developed over the years in different political, social and cultural contexts&quot;. The signatories are particularly concerned about the UK, the US and other countries imitating schools in Asian countries that come high in the Pisa rankings. They are suspicious of Shanghai&apos;s success. &quot;Shanghai&apos;s approach is an incredibly strategic one,&quot; says Ball. &quot;Their students practise the tests. It&apos;s difficult to see what their maths teachers can say to ours except &apos;teach to the test&apos;.&quot; In a recent paper for Teachers College Record, one of American&apos;s leading educational research journals, Meyer says Asian pupils&apos; scores are partly attributable to intensive cramming and do not translate into greater ability to come up with novel ideas and take risks. Though eastern traditions of filial piety and deep respect for learning can be admired, he writes, &quot;these features often come on the back of \u2026 unquestioned obedience to authority, limits on free speech, and acceptance of paternalistic government&quot;. The OECD, he warns, is expanding its testing into new areas, such as teacher training, higher education, workplace training and &quot;adult competencies&quot;. It &quot;seems hell-bent on assessing every square-inch of the educational globe&quot;. Public education, Meyer fears, will soon cease to be a civic and cultural project and become &quot;a training ground for economic fitness&quot;. Schleicher, however, says that Pisa, far from impoverishing education, enriches it because it encourages countries to look at ideas from around the world. Poland and Germany, he points out, modified streaming by ability in their secondary schools after Pisa analysis showed children from the lower socio-economic classes fell behind. &quot;Those were hardly short-term fixes,&quot; he says. &quot;Germany has become more unequal as a society but education is closing the gap.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 8 May 2014 to clarify Pearson&apos;s role in developing the 2015 Pisa tests.", "tags": ["Education", "OECD", "Schools", "Education policy", "Politics", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-06T06:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/06/oecd-pisa-tests-education-joy-of-learning", "sentences": ["His junior minister, Liz Truss, went to Shanghai in China, which topped the league tables in all subjects, to discover the secrets of its success."], "title": "Global school tests under attack as OECD accused of killing 'joy of learning'", "article": "Leading academics have accused the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) of acting as an unaccountable super-ministry of education which kills the &quot;joy of learning&quot; and turns schooling into &quot;drudgery&quot;. A letter signed by 120 leading academics and teachers from 12 countries \u2013 including Britain, the US and Germany \u2013 argues the OECD&apos;s Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests on 15-year-olds distort the curriculum, reduce teachers&apos; autonomy and increase children&apos;s stress levels. The results of the Pisa tests, which the signatories say are &quot;widely known to be imperfect&quot; because they focus narrowly on the economic goals of education, are anxiously awaited in the 66 countries that take part. When their children&apos;s results fall down the league tables, governments often make sweeping changes in how schools are run and what they teach. The 1,300-word letter describes these as &quot;short-term fixes&quot; designed to boost league table positions, and argues that &quot;enduring changes ... take decades&quot;. It says the next round of tests in 2015 should be scrapped. The letter is published on the Guardian website and on globalpolicyjournal.com, an online hub for top academics and teachers. &quot;Education policy across the world is being driven by the single aim of pushing up national performance levels on Pisa,&quot; said one signatory, Stephen Ball, professor at London University&apos;s Institute of Education. &quot;It&apos;s having a tremendously distorting effect, right down to the level of classroom teaching.&quot; Michael Gove, the education secretary, has repeatedly used English children&apos;s poor performance in Pisa \u2013 the latest scores showed them 26th in maths, 23rd in reading and 21st in science \u2013 as justification for introducing more traditional exams and more academies and free schools. His junior minister, Liz Truss, went to Shanghai in China, which topped the league tables in all subjects, to discover the secrets of its success. The letter says the OECD is co-operating &quot;with multi-national for-profit companies which stand to gain financially from any deficits \u2013 real or perceived \u2013 unearthed by Pisa&quot;. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and Penguin Books and the world&apos;s biggest textbook publisher, is setting the framework for the 2015 tests. Heinz-Dieter Meyer, professor of education policy at the State University of New York and one of the letter&apos;s organisers, says Andreas Schleicher, who runs the OECD tests, gives public endorsement to controversial policies such as Common Core, an attempt to introduce a national curriculum in the US. Schleicher told the Guardian: &quot;All we said was that Common Core standards are in line with what they have in high-performing countries.&quot; He also said Pearson was just one of numerous contractors, including universities and other public bodies, which carry out aspects of Pisa&apos;s work. Far from narrowing education, he argued, Pisa encouraged countries to look at new ideas from around the world. Meyer warned that the OECD is expanding its testing into areas such as teacher training and higher education and &quot;seems hell-bent on assessing every square inch of the educational globe&quot;.", "tags": ["OECD", "Schools", "Education", "Teaching", "Global economy", "Business", "UK news", "World news", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-06T06:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/datablog/2014/may/06/world-cities-most-powerful-brands-get-the-data", "sentences": ["In China, Renren and Weibo are used rather than Facebook and Twitter, which may go some way to explaining the poor showing of Shanghai, for example."], "title": "The world cities with the most powerful brands - get the data", "article": "To establish our list of the world\u2019s most powerful city brands, we asked Saffron, a brand consultancy that prides itself on its expertise in urban branding, to update its 2008 study of European cities into an assessment of 57 major cities around the world. The resulting &quot;brand barometer&quot; is eye-opening: did anyone expect LA to beat New York or London? Or Tokyo and Venice to fall so flat?  The report measures two aspects of a city&apos;s brand: its \u201cassets\u201d \u2013 attractions, climate, infrastructure (particularly transport), safety and economic prosperity \u2013 and its \u201cbuzz\u201d, a combination of social media (Facebook likes and Twitter sentiment analysis) and media mentions. Assets and buzz were each graded out of 10; the numbers were added to produce a total score. (Scroll down for an interactive bar chart of the final ranking.) Although the research was not limited to English language results, the use of social media sites popular among western countries must be taken into account when digesting the list. In China, Renren and Weibo are used rather than Facebook and Twitter, which may go some way to explaining the poor showing of Shanghai, for example. Tokyo scores a buzz of just 2, again due partly to Japan using its own social media engines \u2013 yet Seoul does remarkably well on the same criteria.  \u201cThe western world is just not that in touch with the far east,\u201d says Ian Stephens of Saffron. \u201cTokyo remains, for most people, an alien place for an alien experience. [Its brand] is underperforming relative to its assets. Whereas Seoul&apos;s and Singapore&apos;s offerings are on a more global basis: visitors are very pleasantly surprised at what they find there, it&apos;s less &apos;foreign&apos; than they might have thought.  &quot;This brand list is all about how cities use their assets, how they do the best with what they have. Singapore, for example, is a transport hub and seems to be doing quite a lot with that basic thing.\u201d Mumbai and Mecca are two more examples of up-and-comers in the brand stakes, while European cities \u2013 with the exception of London and Paris \u2013 struggle. Venice isn&apos;t the only loser, just the most surprising. \u201cAll the European cities do relatively poorly, perhaps because there are so many crammed up against each other,\u201d says Stephens. On the whole, the results do show a clear correlation between asset strength and brand reputation. Cities hoping to buy themselves a bit of buzz should take this to heart. As Saffron founder Wally Olins, who died this month, liked to say: when it comes to brands, you can&apos;t just talk the talk, you have to walk the walk.

There is good reason for both. A UN commission of inquiry came out\u00a0in February with a report on the &quot;unspeakable atrocities&quot; committed in\u00a0the country. &quot;The gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,&quot; the commission said. &quot;These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the\u00a0enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.&quot; It quoted former labour camp inmates who said prisoners would catch snakes and mice to feed malnourished babies. On the ridicule front came a recent news item (from a US-funded anti-Pyongyang radio station) about Kim Jong-un, the country&apos;s 31-year-old leader who represents the third generation of the dynasty that has run North Korea since the second world war. The word was that he had ordered all male students to wear their hair like his, shaved bare at back and sides but thick and unparted on top. The fact that the\u00a0flimsily sourced story was never confirmed officially, and visitors to Pyongyang campuses saw no evidence to support it, did not prevent it from being widely published around the world. Anything, however disgusting or outlandish, looks credible in what the media often call the &quot;hermit kingdom&quot;. It is refreshing then to find an author who is willing to approach the country soberly, analysing its tumultuous history, regional context and difficult relations with its allies. Living and working in Shanghai, Paul French has studied and written about North Korea for many years. He pulls no punches on\u00a0the country&apos;s ruthless politics or the\u00a0grim lives its people are forced to\u00a0endure. There are titbits here that seem to reinforce the more ridiculous stories. Smoking while driving is banned, though for safety rather than\u00a0health reasons: smoking would prevent drivers from smelling that something is wrong with their car. But French is primarily concerned with North Korea&apos;s economy. This, he\u00a0argues, is central to understanding the policy shifts and the leadership&apos;s motives over the last 60 years. The country is not the world&apos;s last communist state, but it is the only one that has never seriously experimented with\u00a0private entrepreneurship, let alone oligarchs and crony capitalism. The army leadership lives well, with privileged access to food supplies and scarce consumer goods, but there is no &quot;deep state&quot; that permits the military to run large economic enterprises as in\u00a0Cuba or various non-communist states such as Turkey and Egypt. North Korea has a command economy par excellence, and in French&apos;s account the ruling elite has virtually given up on fundamentally changing it, even though it occasionally talks of reform. Efforts to attract foreign investment have largely failed. Plans for special economic zones where foreign companies can operate as capitalists with a\u00a0tame labour force did not succeed because North Korea could not supply the necessary infrastructure or energy. The country lives off foreign aid, given out of genuine altruism by UN agencies and foreign NGOs as famine relief or extracted from foreign governments as payback for minor political concessions. The historic visit that South Korea&apos;s president Kim Dae-jung made to Pyongyang in 2000 was agreed only after the government in Seoul paid $500m. Even the nuclear brinkmanship in which North Korea regularly indulges by threatening to launch missiles or conduct new underground tests has no\u00a0real military content. Pyongyang has no intention of invading South Korea, nor\u00a0would China allow it to if it ever became serious. The bluster is mainly designed to restart international negotiations in the hope of new economic payments or concessions, while also keeping up the drumbeat of domestic propaganda that warns North Koreans the country is under permanent threat and needs to maintain high spending on defence. Many countries try to solve their economic difficulties by printing extra money; North Korea does it with unusual creativity. It does not bother to churn out more of its own currency, the won. It prints very accurate $100 bills and buys goods abroad with them. These sophisticated counterfeits net the country an estimated $25m a year. Until the mid-1970s, North Korea was wealthier than South Korea in terms of GDP per head. Bringing more people into the industrial workforce and investing state funds allowed the country to recover relatively quickly after the destruction of the three-year Korean war. But the command economy could not work effectively once more sophisticated production was needed. Collectivised agriculture floundered in the absence of sufficient fertiliser and fuel for farm machinery. In the words of one analyst, the country went &quot;from riches to rags&quot;. Like other command economies, North Korea allows peasants to produce some food and keep poultry in\u00a0their gardens for sale at local markets, but this is not enough to feed\u00a0urban populations. Poor transport links, bad roads and a shortage of vehicles mean that tonnes of food produced on state farms rots before it\u00a0reaches the cities. Annual famines were a regular feature in the 1990s.The regime put them down to natural causes such as crop failures, drought and flooding, but outside experts blamed government policies for part of the problem. The UN&apos;s World Food Programme and Food and Agriculture Organisation estimated that the food deficit was roughly 50 per cent of national requirements at the end of the 1990s, a shortfall greater than that seen in the Ethiopian famine of 1985. French points out that North Korea&apos;s leadership is nobody&apos;s puppet. During the Sino-Soviet split following Stalin&apos;s death, Kim Il-sung, the country&apos;s long-serving leader, first tried to keep in with both sides but then broke both with Khrushchev&apos;s revisionism and Mao&apos;s Cultural Revolution. Mao&apos;s Little Red Book was blocked from circulation. Forty years later, China still protects North Korea diplomatically from outside pressure, but there is no ideological affinity between Pyongyang&apos;s command economy and China&apos;s increasingly capitalist one. Russian relations with Pyongyang cooled severely when Soviet communism collapsed and Boris Yeltsin cut cheap fuel supplies and other subsidies, dealing a sudden and massive blow to the North Korean economy.French provides a comprehensive account of the controversies surrounding North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme. A period of genuine promise emerged in 1994 when the US and North Korea reached an Agreed Framework thanks to the diplomacy of former President Jimmy Carter whom Bill Clinton had appointed as a special envoy. Kim Il-sung was to halt his nuclear programme in return for US support in providing &quot;proliferation-resistant&quot; light-water reactors to develop the country&apos;s civilian energy production. It was a good compromise but South Korea and Japan were to shoulder most of the cost and these two countries started to raise objections. When George W Bush came to power and cited North Korea in his &quot;axis of evil&quot; speech in 2002, the deal fizzled. In spite of sporadic negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington to find a new agreement, with China, Japan, Russia and South Korea also involved at the table, there has been no breakthrough for the last dozen years. None is expected. North Korea is not so much a failed state as a frozen one. How will it ever melt? When the Berlin Wall fell, some US hawks advocated a crazy policy of encouraging North Koreans to walk across the border to China en masse. (The border with South Korea is covered in mines.) But, unlike in divided Berlin, not many Koreans live near the border. Others took the German experience of unification as a warning more than a model. If there ever was to be a reconciliation between the two Koreas \u2013 a goal both countries claim to desire \u2013 it should be more gradual than that between the two German states, which involved too sharp a collapse in employment and welfare services in the east and a heavy reliance on compensation payments and new investment by the west. Could there be an internal uprising, with crowds demanding regime change? This is highly improbable. The system is too repressive and most North Koreans have no conception of any alternative. With foreign TV jammed, and laptop and smartphone ownership restricted, they are cut off from almost all outside news. The only change that experts predict is no change at all. They believe the North Korean military might grow tired of the Kim dynasty and seek to establish a military junta in\u00a0its place. But if that is right, surely the early death of Kim Jong-il and the emergence of the young and inexperienced Kim Jong-un was the moment. In office he has proved more ruthless than his baby-face looks suggest. Three defence ministers and four chiefs of the army&apos;s general staff have been replaced and five of the seven men who escorted his father&apos;s hearse two years ago have been removed or disappeared. His uncle was machine-gunned to death. Some of these last points are not in French&apos;s book, which occasionally feels, especially in the economic chapters, as though it should have been updated. But it is still an admirably clear and calm survey of one of the hardest countries in the world to report on. \u2022 Jonathan Steele is a former chief foreign correspondent for the Guardian.

Senior Coalition figures have been making it clear since before the federal election they intend to axe the $223m contract which the ABC secured under the previous Labor government \u2013 and all expectations point to confirmation in next week\u2019s budget. Before it lost office in September, Labor tried to lock in the ABC as the default broadcaster within the region. The ALP inserted a provision in legislation making it clear the ABC was the only organisation the Commonwealth could fund to carry out international broadcasting \u2013 not a private company. The ABC charter also requires the ABC to provide international broadcasting. Subscription TV company Sky News has wanted the regional broadcasting service for some time, but lost out to the ABC in a tender process that was badly botched by Labor and became tangled up in the leadership tensions between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Sky is part-owned by BSkyB, a British company controlled by 21st Century Fox, sister company to Australia\u2019s News Corp. As a consequence of Labor\u2019s efforts to shore up the contract for the ABC beyond the change of government, the Coalition would have to legislate if it wanted to offer a new tender for a commercial broadcaster, such as Sky, to operate the Australia Network. The Australia Network contract is due to run for another seven years and the timing of the termination is not yet known. The ABC has just struck a deal with China to make content from the network and the ABC available in the country in a partnership with Shanghai Media Group. Through that contract Australia is only the third country in the world with broadcast rights in China. The costs of unwinding agreements and other associated exit costs are not known, but any saving booked on Tuesday would have to take account of those factors.  Labor and the Greens have attacked the government for its direction on the Australia Network. Greens communication spokesperson Scott Ludlam said on Thursday the termination would be a broken promise. \u201cThis will sever a two-way street of information in and out of Australia. This cut will mean fewer journalists delivering news content into Australia on the ABC network, as well as information from Australia into Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next election is just two years away and I will campaign continuously to ensure the public do not forget Abbott\u2019s broken promise to not cut funding to the ABC.\u201d", "tags": ["Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "Sky News", "Australia news"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-08T08:03:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/china-damage-control-terror-attacks-xinjiang", "sentences": ["That night, three high-ranking public security officials paid separate inspection visits to railway stations in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern city of Changsha.", "In late April, a quarter of Shanghai&apos;s police began carrying guns during regular patrols."], "title": "China in damage control mode as terror attacks spread beyond Xinjiang", "article": "The attacks began decades ago. The assailants used knives, guns, even grenades. They ambushed police officers and officials in places few had heard of: Akto, Kuqa, Xinhe and other dusty counties in Xinjiang, a sprawling region in China&apos;s north-west. State media would issue a pithy statement about the violence, and the rest of the country would shrug its shoulders and march on. But in recent months the spasms of public violence have spread beyond Xinjiang&apos;s borders, raising concerns nationwide about the government&apos;s ability to keep its citizens safe. Assailants armed with knives and bombs have struck at three major train stations since March. Authorities blamed the first two incidents on Muslim Uighur &quot;terrorists&quot; from the region, intent on waging holy war. So on Tuesday when a knife-wielding man wounded six people at a train station in the southern city of Guangzhou, people immediately assumed the worst. While the attacker&apos;s identity and motives remained unclear \u2013 police shot and detained him at the scene \u2013 security authorities snapped into damage control mode. That night, three high-ranking public security officials paid separate inspection visits to railway stations in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern city of Changsha. In the central city of Zhengzhou, about 100,000 police, security guards and firefighters paraded through the streets, setting up roadblocks and inspecting hotels and internet cafes. Experts say that without resolving Xinjiang&apos;s underlying problems, the shows of force may be only a patch. Uighur groups abroad call the attacks a cry of despair caused by religious repression and economic marginalisation. The government defends its regional policies as open and tolerant, blaming the attacks on &quot;separatists&quot; and &quot;hostile forces&quot; from abroad. &quot;Perhaps each of these incidents has its own rationale, its own origins,&quot; said Yitzhak Shichor, a Xinjiang expert at the University of Haifa in Israel. &quot;But these attackers certainly could not imagine that they could overcome the system. They went in with the idea that they were going to lose, given the balance of power. And this is an indication that these people feel they have no choice. They&apos;re people who have been backed into a corner, and they have nothing to lose.&quot; China&apos;s terrorism problem is getting worse, according to the official China National Security Studies annual report for 2013, released this week. Last year marked a particularly active period for attacks, &quot;whether you&apos;re looking at the number of them or their severity&quot;, Wu Shaozhong, a professor at the Chinese People&apos;s Public Security University, wrote in the report. In late April, a quarter of Shanghai&apos;s police began carrying guns during regular patrols. Some Beijing subway stations have stepped up security checks, conducting X-ray scans of passengers as well as their bags. Magnus Ranstorp, of the Swedish National Defence College, said measures such as patrols were never sufficient in countering terrorism but were one part of the response. He said exchanging ideas internationally could help. &quot;The US and Canada have huge experience with school shootings and have active shooter protocols based on research. If you can&apos;t prevent it, how do you take the person out?&quot; Some experts say that an ongoing security crackdown in Xinjiang often takes the form of increased repression, which in turn fuels more social unrest. &quot;There&apos;s a rage against the state, which is sometimes expressed in religious terms,&quot; said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. &quot;Mosques are being damaged, women being told to take off their veils, people being told to report other people with long beards \u2013 clearly the religious element is causing friction.&quot; Last Wednesday, two Uighur attackers detonated explosives at a train station in Xinjiang&apos;s regional capital, Urumqi, killing themselves and one other person. In March, five assailants turned a train station in the south-west city of Kunming into a scene of carnage, slashing and hacking 29 people to death. Authorities responded to both incidents by vowing to step up anti-terror campaigns in the region. The government must &quot;make terrorists like rats scurrying across a street, with everybody shouting &apos;beat them&apos;,&quot; the president, Xi Jinping, said in late April before a trip to the ethnically riven city Kashgar. Experts say the unpredictability, even spontaneity of many attacks make them difficult to pre-empt, both in China and abroad. James Leibold, of La Trobe University in Melbourne, said events such as the Oklahoma City and Boston marathon bombings had made Americans aware that &quot;if a small group of people are intent on carrying out a terror event, it is hard to stop them&quot;.

Around half of the international visitors who flock to Bicester retail village are Chinese nationals, making the one-hour train trip from London, or using the fleet of special coaches that head there each day \u2013 to stock up on luxury goods. A World Bank-backed report has declared that the country&apos;s national currency, the yuan, will go further than previously thought in the hands of the Chinese consumer and that this supercharged purchasing power will push the world&apos;s second-largest economy ahead of the US this year. This could be the century of the Chinese consumer, now a figure of central importance for luxury goods companies including some of the biggest retail names in Britain. Gareth Leather, Asia economist at Capital Economics, says the UK stands to be benefit substantially from the spending power of the Chinese. &quot;China is a huge market for luxury goods, and there are high taxes on luxury goods in China, so there is a tendency to travel abroad. The UK has missed out on this to an extent, because visa issues have meant it is as open to Chinese tourists as other countries, but the government is looking to change that.&quot; Last October, George Osborne announced plans to simplify visa applications for Chinese tourists visiting the UK. According to a report by Barclays, the easing of restrictions will encourage shopaholic Chinese tourists to spend \u00a31bn a year in the UK by 2017 \u2013 an 84% increase from 2013. Chinese buyers are brand junkies, and the Bicester outlets of their favourite labels are heaving. A sprawling two-floor Burberry store is packed with Chinese visitors poring over the brand&apos;s trademark trench coats and accessories, while the Prada branch nearby is thronged too.And this is not just window shopping. To judge by the masses of shopping bags bearing luxury names such as Ralph Lauren and Gucci, as well as Burberry and Prada, some serious cash is being spent. The popularity of this outlet village among Chinese visitors has spurred owner Value Retail to open an outlet centre in China itself. Suzhou Village, near Shanghai, is scheduled to open on 15 May, targeting China&apos;s swelling middle class. The centre&apos;s 100 shops, restaurants and cafes will be within an hour&apos;s drive of 40 million people. And for the long-term health of the Chinese economy \u2013 and of the global financial system \u2013 it is a necessary development. If western economies such as the UK&apos;s are to tilt back towards export-driven growth, China&apos;s status as the world&apos;s factory floor has to change. The west needs China to open up as a market that consumes goods rather than just making them. And China itself needs to lessen its dependence on an economic model that fuels manufacturing and infrastructure growth with artificially low interest rates, as this punishes savers and has seen households take on a teetering edifice of debt. Rob Wood, economist at German bank Berenberg, says: &quot;So far China&apos;s growth has been based on strong investment growth, and you would expect that with a developing country. But China has bought a lot of machines now, and it needs domestic demand for the goods it is producing. It is going to be hard because it has relied on investment for so long, but that is the way countries move from being low-income to high- income, and it is potentially important for the UK.&quot; The scale of the challenge is huge but, Wood says, the authorities have demonstrated a determination to change the growth model. China&apos;s growing pains have had unintended consequences for a luxury goods sector that has benefited from the nation&apos;s rise so far, but finds itself exposed to the vagaries of the Chinese economy. A crackdown on corruption, announced by President Xi Jinping last year, has been an unexpected blow. At Diageo, the British drinks group, sales in China of the traditional white spirit baijiu have been hit in the ensuing drive against gift-giving. The backlash has also been painful for Diageo&apos;s French rival, R\u00e9my Cointreau, where sales of cognac fell 32% in the final quarter of the year to March, following a 30% drop in the third quarter. The attempt to unravel a culture of lavish gifts and extravagant spending among officials has also hit the restaurant trade and sales of other luxury goods, such as watches. Growth in China&apos;s luxury market slowed to about 2% in 2013 from 7% in 2012, according to consultancy Bain. Sales of watches, which make up more than a fifth of the total domestic luxury goods market in China, fell by 11%. &quot;The highly visible government campaign encouraging frugality and focusing on corruption had a large impact on gifting, which had been one of the major growth engines of the sector,&quot; Bain said. Brands with outlets at Bicester will be hoping that the corruption clampdown will not dampen Chinese appetites abroad. Bain estimates that around two-thirds of luxury shopping by Chinese consumers is done outside China. But the ascendancy of the Chinese consumer is predicated on more than just British retail villages and largesse directed at party officials. There is also the impact of people in China who are earning money honestly and want to spend it \u2013 and this can be felt 5,000 miles from Bicester.     The Sanlitun shopping village in Beijing. Photograph: Xiao Lu Chu/Getty Images    Beijing&apos;s upmarket Sanlitun shopping district consists of two outdoor malls joined by a 500m-long row of seedy bars and restaurants. South Sanlitun Village is stacked with mid-range chains such as Uniqlo, Nike and Starbucks. It is a thoroughfare of fashionable young Chinese and camera-wielding tourists. But to cross into the North Sanlitun Village is to enter a more rarefied world. Its flashy European boutiques \u2013 Balmain, Marni, Givenchy \u2013 stand grandiose and empty around a vast paved square. Looking at the window display in Emporio Armani, Shi Wen, a design student at the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, says luxury goods in China are caught in a bind. People have more money than ever, but ostentatious displays of wealth are increasingly taboo, considered the province of coal bosses and corrupt officials rather than a tasteful, cosmopolitan class. &quot;Chinese people only started making money in the 1980s,&quot; she says. &quot;They wanted to show it, but didn&apos;t have any taste. Now, people will still spend a lot of money on luxury goods, but they want to look subtle and sophisticated.&quot; Shi is wearing tight black jeans and a black leather jacket. She says her favourite brand is US leathergoods maker Coach. In a Sergio Rossi outlet across the square, \u00a3400 pairs of shoes sit in untouched rows in an empty, thickly carpeted atrium. &quot;Business is all right,&quot; says one saleswoman, who declines to give her name. &quot;I spend most of my time waiting around.&quot; Bill Dodson is a US-born writer of books on Chinese society and economy who lives in Suzhou and works in Shanghai. He says the crackdown appears to be having little impact on normal life: &quot;I don&apos;t see any effect on the daily purchasing habits of middle-income and rich Chinese as a direct result of the clampdown on government purchasing excesses. In the downtown Shanghai office in which I work, women coworkers are still turning over their wardrobes with abandon. They seem to have the same level of anxiety about falling behind the fashion times as ever.&quot; He says the reason Chinese nationals prefer to buy luxury goods abroad is because of a lack of trust in branding \u2013 and genuine safety issues with domestic products, from foodstuffs to cars, clothing and electrical goods \u2013 not because of any clampdown or general economic slowdown. The conversion of China to a consumption-driven model is taking place against a backdrop of slowing growth. China&apos;s economy grew by 7.4% in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the same period a year earlier, following 7.7% growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. It was the lowest rate of growth in 18 months, but markets nevertheless reacted positively to the data, because it beat expectations of a GDP increase of just 7.2%. The slowdown does, however, raise the prospect of the Chinese government missing its target for 7.5% growth in 2014, unless further stimulus measures are announced. Economists at Fathom Consulting believe the slowdown has much further to go. &quot;Our benchmark assumption is that China will slow to a rate of just 5% this year. In our worst-case scenario, that figure plunges to 2%.&quot; This has not dampened the attractiveness of Chinese consumers to western investors. The display of Chinese spending power in Bicester is merely an analogue indication of a 1.84 trillion-yuan online shopping market in China, one potential shareholders are keep to tap. Last week China&apos;s biggest online retailer, Alibaba, announced plans for an initial public offering in New York that could value the business at $200bn. Analysts believe this could be the biggest technology stock sale in history, dwarfing even that of Facebook, as investors bet on further stellar growth in what is already an enormous market. According to Alibaba&apos;s filing with US stock market regulator, its three main marketplaces \u2013 Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan \u2013 last year notched up 231\u00a0million active buyers and 8 million active sellers, and generated transactions totalling $248bn. It is numbers such as these that lie behind the appeal of the Chinese consumer market to investors. And there has been one telling bright spark in recent Chinese economic figures. Investment was weak in the first quarter and industrial production disappointing, but retail sales have been better than expected, boosting Beijing&apos;s hopes that consumption will continue to hold up. And that is key, not just to Bicester but to Suzhou Village \u2013 and the entire global economy.", "tags": ["Luxury goods sector", "Global economy", "Consumer spending", "Retail industry", "Business", "China"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-10T23:05:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/11/uk-world-fair-pavilion-beehive-paul-smith", "sentences": ["At the last world fair in Shanghai, Britain won the award for the finest pavilion for a structure which became known as the Dandelion, for its radiating sprays of rods."], "title": "Paul Smith team 'to design UK pavilion for world fair'", "article": "He is usually associated in the public mind with beautifully tailored, if somewhat expensive, suits, but Sir Paul Smith, fashion designer to the stars, is expected to be announced as a winner of a competition to design the UK pavilion at the 2015 World Fair in Milan.

In the words of the proposal, visitors to the World Fair will walk through an orchard and a wildflower meadow before entering the hive, which will &quot;pulsate, buzz and glow according to signals from a real hive&quot;. The success of the idea against seven rival designs is expected to be announced next Sunday, according to trade bible Architects&apos; Journal, although the government&apos;s trade and investment arm, UKTI, declined to comment. The best-known &quot;World Expo&quot; was held in 1851 at the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, under the title the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations. The aspiration \u2013 to allow nations to promote their design, commercial and industrial innovation every five years \u2013 remains the same. Last week, however, the 2015 event became mired in controversy when a senior manager for Milan&apos;s Expo 2015 trade fair was arrested with six business people and politicians. Edmondo Bruti Liberati, a Milan prosecutor, reportedly said that the suspects were taped by police making suspected attempts to offer bribes to secure contracts for next year&apos;s fair. At the last world fair in Shanghai, Britain won the award for the finest pavilion for a structure which became known as the Dandelion, for its radiating sprays of rods. The pavilion, designed by Thomas Heatherwick, attracted eight million visitors over six months in 2010 and was regarded as among the top attractions at an exhibition that attracted more than 70 million, a record number of visitors. The 2015 proposal, in which Smith is involved, is said by its designers to &quot;explore the life of the bee colony through an immersive sensory experience \u2013 a beautiful and profound encounter leaving visitors with a lasting flavour of the British landscape&quot;. According to his website, Buttress, who is based in Nottingham, &quot;creates simple, elegant and contextual artworks which seek to define and celebrate a sense of place and the sublime&quot;.

He began to see a pattern of rare skin conditions and soon realised that the underlying cause for all of them was the condition that would soon be known as Aids. He devoted the rest of his life to the care of those with HIV and Aids. The first few years of the epidemic were very frightening for those of us involved in providing medical treatment and care, as we did not know how the infection spread; and all those infected died. In the Guardian in 1985, Charles wrote of the alarm within the medical profession \u2013 at that point St Stephen&apos;s was treating a dozen Aids patients, but two years later the number stood at 1,000. With a steely, determined, inquiring mind and a pleasing and precise public face, he was in a pivotal position in persuading the Conservative government of the time to recognise the severity of the problem, and the need for public information and money for both research and care of the infected patients. Thirty-three years later, the epidemic has been partly controlled and smaller than many feared. Draconian laws were not necessary and indeed the epidemic gave impetus to a set of liberal anti-discriminatory measures, which have helped to reduce the stigma attached to HIV. By 1989, Charles was able to point to &quot;the acceptance of it as a disease, as something needing compassion. In the early days I was always having to defend Aids patients against all sorts of cruelty, but I seldom have to do that now. It isn&apos;t over yet, by a long way, but the difference is colossal&quot;. This outcome is a tribute to the ministers of health at the time, who recognised the scale of the problem, activists, who used reasoned arguments to produce a supportive plan for care, and the pharmaceutical industry, which developed the drugs which have transformed the prospects of patients. Charles, who was chair of the all-party parliamentary committee on Aids and founder of the campaigning and fundraising UK Aids Foundation, proved to be a catalyst for many of these early developments. He was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, to Ngaire, a piano teacher, and Jack, an accountant, and was educated at Christ&apos;s college, Christchurch. He was considering the ministry but chose medical school instead, at the University of Otago, Dunedin. He practised medicine in Christchurch for five years before travelling to Britain to continue his studies. At St Stephen&apos;s, he designed the first purpose-built Aids clinic and outpatient day-care clinic in the UK and carried out a great deal of research. He described many of the symptoms of this new disease and how to ameliorate them. Between 1985 and 1988, he and I carried out early clinical trials on medications including Thymosin, AZT and foscarnet. In 1988 Charles was awarded a fellowship to study HIV at Bellevue hospital in New York, eventually becoming director of its Aids programme. In 1994, he joined the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) in Los Angeles as principal investigator, and in 1997, keen to see the development of a vaccine, was among a group of researchers who volunteered to inject themselves with a weakened strain of the virus. In 2001 he became medical director at AHF and helped to set up clinics providing excellent care throughout the world, including in Honduras, Uganda and South Africa. Charles was the AHF medical director at the time the &quot;triple therapy&quot; mixture of drugs \u2013 which revolutionised the management of Aids \u2013 first became available. In 2007, he joined the pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme as the HIV medical director in the Asian and Pacific region. The company had developed a new and potent drug for HIV infection and Charles was instrumental in making it widely available in the developing world. He was one of the first western specialists invited to teach and advise medical professionals in China, and taught at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and at Fudan University, Shanghai. He was an inspiring teacher and an influential advocate for HIV-infected patients, an excellent organiser and a charming companion. Charles is survived by his partner, Dougie Lui, his brother, Bruce, and four nieces, Kathryn, Elizabeth, Sonja and Helaina. \u2022 Charles Frank Farthing, doctor, born 22 April 1953; died 6 April 2014", "tags": ["Aids and HIV", "Society", "Medical research", "Science", "Health", "New Zealand", "New York", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-11T17:00:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/12/bernie-ibini-loan-deal-sydney-fc", "sentences": ["Graham Arnold has completed his first signing as Sydney FC coach, securing a one-year loan for Bernie Ibini from Shanghai Dongya."], "title": "Bernie Ibini becomes Graham Arnold's first signing at Sydney FC", "article": "Graham Arnold has completed his first signing as Sydney FC coach, securing a one-year loan for Bernie Ibini from Shanghai Dongya. \u201cI\u2019m definitely very excited and looking forward to my first season here next year,\u201d said the Socceroos under-23 striker, who played under Arnold at Central Coast Mariners. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to be working with Graham Arnold again and having heard his and the club\u2019s big plans for the future, everything is going in the right direction. \u201cThe timing of the move was perfect for me.

Little did she know that this investment would end up paying off big time years later, giving her a degree of personal freedom that is rare for most young Chinese women, who have been increasingly left behind during the recent economic boom. Shang admits she married her husband just a few months after meeting him because she had just turned 28. &quot;Thirty years old is the age where you are considered a &apos;leftover&apos; woman, so I was getting a lot of pressure to marry,&quot; says Shang, who studied in the UK. &quot;I\u00a0was getting older and older and there was this pressure. It&apos;s stupid, but it exists.&quot; Since 2007, when the All-China Women&apos;s Federation (ACWF) first described single women over the age of 27 as shengn\u00fc, &quot;leftover&quot;, many women in China, even those such as Shang who have relatively high-paid jobs in multinational companies, have been affected by these attitudes. Far fewer women, it seems, have been able to take advantage of rising property prices in a country where only one out of 15 single women own a home, compared with one in five single men. Chinese parents tend to buy homes for sons rather than daughters, but fortunately for Shang, her middle-class parents were more progressive. As soon as the couple was engaged, her partner moved into Shang&apos;s apartment. Yet the relationship soon soured and deteriorated further after Shang gave birth to their son. &quot;My husband refused to help with any of the housework, but the last straw was that he didn&apos;t care about the baby,&quot; says Shang. At the end of 2012, she divorced him after he became violent and hit her father, giving him a black eye. Shang&apos;s situation was helped by the fact that with a home registered solely in her name, she was able to ask her husband to move out and the divorce court allowed her to claim the home. According to the nationwide Third Sample Survey on the Social Status of Women, conducted by the ACWF and the national bureau of statistics in 2010, only 13.2% of married women in China have homes in their own names, compared with 51.7% of married men. Moreover, Horizon China, a market research company, conducted a survey in 2012 of home buying in China&apos;s top real-estate markets \u2013 Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen \u2013 and found that although over 70% of women contribute to the marital-home purchase, only 30% of marital-home deeds include the woman&apos;s name. This has profound consequences for women&apos;s wealth and overall well-being, particularly since China privatised public housing in 1998. The subsequent property boom has led to exponential returns on homes. Shang Wen&apos;s home in Beijing, for example, has risen by more than 500% in value since she bought it in 2004, from 950,000 RMB (\u00a390,000) to well over 5m RMB today. Chinese women have largely missed out on what is arguably the biggest accumulation of residential property wealth in history, estimated by HSBC at more than \u00a317.5tn at the end of 2013. Despite this, women often transfer all of their assets to their husband or boyfriend to finance the purchase of a home, which is then registered in the man&apos;s name alone. The reasons are complicated, but include deeply entrenched norms that the man must be the official home owner; myths that a man must own a home in order to attract a bride; and retrograde gender norms of parents who only buy homes for sons or even nephews, because they think that their daughters do not need to own property. The extraordinary pressure on women to marry has had damaging economic consequences because so many are afraid to walk away from an unequal financial arrangement with their boyfriend or husband. Such attitudes are leading to a new gender wealth gap in the market-reform era. Evidence is found in legal setbacks to married women&apos;s property rights, a sharply widening gender income gap, report of an &quot;epidemic of domestic violence&quot;, as well as the orchestrated state media campaign to stigmatise single, educated women in their late 20s as &quot;leftover&quot; women. The resurgence of gender inequality in recent years is in stark contrast to the early Communist era, when the Communist party publicly celebrated gender equality and Mao declared that &quot;women hold up half the sky&quot;. Today, the authoritarian nature of China&apos;s one-party system has prevented the rise of an independent, large-scale, Chinese feminist movement. Regulations requiring the registration of NGOs are so onerous that feminist activists without official state support find it extremely difficult to secure funding or organise events without harassment from the authorities, while the officially backed ACWF dominates women&apos;s rights\u00a0activities. Yet some feminists have succeeded in raising awareness about women&apos;s rights in spite of political restrictions. In January, for example, a woman settled in what is believed to be the country&apos;s first gender discrimination lawsuit. The woman sued a tutoring firm that rejected her job application specifically because she was a woman. The firm told her it needed a man because the &quot;work would include physical tasks such as changing the bottle on a water dispenser&quot;. Now that Shang is divorced, her parents are helping to take care of her two-year-old son and she is economically secure with a good job and a home worth significantly more than it did when she moved in. She is one of the lucky ones. Shang Wen is a pseudonym.

It was an entirely fitting image. Kaymer&apos;s earlier victory had launched him into elite European company; he is only the fourth player from the continent to claim the event dubbed golf&apos;s fifth major. Two years ago Kaymer&apos;s nerveless putt sealed victory for Europe against the United States at Medinah. There are more than three months to go before McGinley&apos;s team for the next Ryder Cup is settled. Still, it is significant that, as of Monday morning, Kaymer had edged into an automatic berth on the points list. This marks quite a turnaround. Even before the last Ryder Cup, Kaymer was enduring on-course struggles to the extent that questions were raised as to whether he should \u2013 or would \u2013 take his place in Europe&apos;s team. In 2011 Kaymer was ranked as the world&apos;s top golfer after winning the 2010 US PGA championship . Within two years he had slipped outside the top 40. He is not the first and will not be the last to suffer such a swift decline. But not all manage to recover. &quot;The belief was always there,&quot; says Kaymer, whose last victory had been in the Shanghai WGC tournament in November 2011. &quot;I knew I could win a golf tournament again. It was not traumatic, like a lot of people made it out to be. I knew I was doing the right thing. I just didn&apos;t know it would take me this long but it did. This has proved that everything I did, even though it took a little bit longer, it was all good. I work with really good people.&quot; Indeed those around Kaymer have had a duty to maintain the German&apos;s spirits. His coach and &quot;biggest influence&quot; of 15 years, G\u00fcnter Kessler, and caddie, Craig Connelly, were crucial. &quot;G\u00fcnter has the talent to teach really everyone and that is for me really a world-class coach,&quot; says Kaymer. &quot;He doesn&apos;t like the big stage and he doesn&apos;t like to be in all the newspapers and stuff but I believe he really deserves that.&quot; Connelly is now in his second spell with Kaymer. &quot;Martin works extremely hard on the range, from sun up to sun down really, at home in Arizona,&quot; the Glaswegian caddie says. &quot;There have literally been times when the skin on his hands has cracked through the number of balls he has been hitting. He does all the right things, on the basis that, if you repeat the correct actions enough times, then they will mould. &quot;He was never down in the sense of &apos;why me?&apos; It wasn&apos;t as if he was on the ground and needed to be constantly picked up. He was trying hard, maybe too hard, although Martin would tell me there is no such thing. Sometimes you need to take a step back and trust yourself on the golf course and he is doing that now. &quot;He always went on feel. He has gone back to that after realising he has every shot in his golf game anyway.&quot; Signs of Kaymer&apos;s renaissance were apparent at the Shell Houston Open in early April. &quot;Something clicked in the break between Doral and Houston,&quot; Connelly says. &quot;Martin played lovely at Houston despite missing the cut, which was all about putting. Then he made the cut at the Masters and took that on to Hilton Head and Charlotte. &quot;So I did see this coming; you just hope the big day eventually is going to arrive. For it to come in such a massive tournament was obviously perfect.&quot; Kaymer, by his own admission, has regularly been guilty of over-thinking on the course. Now his mind-set is one which rightly exudes confidence for the future. He is still only 29, after all. &quot;Now it&apos;s a time where we have to work even harder,&quot; he said after his second victory on the PGA Tour, by one shot from Jim Furyk. &quot;I need to sit down and reflect on the final round, reflect on the last 36 holes that I played because I shot only one under par on the weekend. It&apos;s OK but there was a lot of room to be better. &quot;We still have three majors left this year. I&apos;m not saying that I&apos;m thinking about it now but there&apos;s still a lot of golf left this year that I would like to participate in on the weekends.&quot;", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport", "Martin Kaymer", "PGA Tour", "US sports"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-12T16:50:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/13/world-cup-stunning-moments-25-conte-verde-uruguay", "sentences": ["It was moored in Shanghai when in September 1943 news broke of Italy&apos;s surrender to Allied forces, and its crew were ordered to destroy it rather than risk it falling into Japanese hands."], "title": "World Cup: 25 stunning moments \u2026 No16: Conte Verde's trip to Uruguay", "article": "In April 1923 a new boat sailed out of the shipyards of William Beardmore &amp; Co in Dalmuir, near Glasgow, destined for history. &quot;Italian craftsmen and artists were brought specifically from Florence to carry out the decoration of the first-class saloons,&quot; reported the Times. &quot;The wall of the main staircase bears a huge painting by Cavalieri; the library is in the Tuscan renaissance style, with stained-glass windows and ceiling paintings; and the other public rooms are equally ornate. The wealth of artistic detail everywhere recalls the old-time splendour of an Italian palace.&quot; The boat was built for the Genoese Lloyd Sabaudo line and named the Conte Verde, after Amadeus VI, a 14th-century Count of Savoy. The Conte Verde was destined to shuttle between Europe and either South America or Asia, carrying the Chinese Olympic team to Berlin in 1936 and thousands of refugees from Nazi persecution in the opposite direction over the following years, and played a small but noteworthy role in the second world war. It was moored in Shanghai when in September 1943 news broke of Italy&apos;s surrender to Allied forces, and its crew were ordered to destroy it rather than risk it falling into Japanese hands. It was sunk in the most inconvenient location possible, blocking all traffic from entering or leaving the naval yard where the Japanese were busy repairing various war craft. It took three months to move it, and on the day it was finally raised an Allied bomber turned up and sank it again. It was another six months before it was back afloat, whereupon the Japanese salvaged it, renamed it Kotobuki Maru and used it to move troops until it was bombed, definitively this time, in July 1945. The Conte Verde made one other particularly noteworthy journey. On 21 June 1930, shortly before the first World Cup in Uruguay, it set sail from Genoa heading for South America, with the Romania national team on board. The boat stopped off at Villefranche-sur-Mer, where they picked up the French squad, three referees \u2013 there were 15 referees in all at the tournament, 11 of them Uruguayan \u2013 and a group of officials including Jules Rimet himself, who packed the trophy in his suitcase. In Barcelona they were joined by the Belgians, and finally they picked up the Brazilian delegation in Rio do Janeiro before arriving in Montevideo on 4 July. In all the journey lasted a little over a fortnight, although for some it was even longer. &quot;We lost two nights on the train to Genoa,&quot; said Romania&apos;s captain, Rudolph Wetzer. &quot;The seats were very bad \u2013 our bones were killing us \u2013 but it was worth it.&quot; &quot;There was no talk of tactics or anything like that, no coaching,&quot; France&apos;s Lucien Laurent said of life on the Conte Verde. &quot;It was just running about the boat on the deck. Running, running all the time. Down below we would do exercise \u2013 stretching, jumping, running up stairs, lifting weights. There was also a swimming pool there, which we all used until the weather got cooler. And we would be entertained by a comedy act or a string quartet. It was like a holiday camp. We didn&apos;t really realise the full enormity of why we were going to Uruguay. Not until years later did we appreciate our place in history. It was just adventure. We were young men having fun. The journey on the Conte Verde took 15 days. It was 15 very happy days.&quot; &quot;It was a really tough trip because in those days the only way you could get there was by boat,&quot; remembered his team-mate Edmond Delfour. &quot;Raoul Caudron, who was the coach back then, said to me: &apos;You&apos;ve got to keep the players busy on the boat, keep them in shape.&apos; And so I became their fitness coach on the trip. It was a superb voyage.&quot; Only Yugoslavia travelled from Europe by any other method, because by the time they decided to come to the World Cup the Conte Verde was fully booked. Instead they set sail from Marseille, after a three-day train journey, on the pleasure cruiser Florida. The only African representatives, Egypt, were due to join them only for their boat from Africa to get slowed down by a storm, and the Florida left without them. They cabled their apologies and the tournament continued with an awkward 13 teams. The Mexico squad, meanwhile, sailed from Veracruz via Havana to New York in order to join the Americans on the SS Munargo. The USA coach, the former Celtic player Robert Millar, forced his charges to train on board &quot;despite the conditions&quot;, labelling the Munargo &quot;a steamer not only too small and without an open deck for exercising, but also with very poor bathrooms&quot;. There had been no process of qualification, these were simply the only teams interested in turning up. Sweden, Spain, Italy and Holland had been sufficiently enthused about the idea of a World Cup to volunteer to host the first one, but less keen on it when someone else was given the honour. Rimet had badgered the French into attending but even then their coach, Gaston Barreau, and their best striker, Manuel Anatol, opted to stay at home. Fifa&apos;s Belgian vice-president, Rudolf Seedrayers, had stamped his feet until his nation was represented, but their best player, Raymond Braine, had been suspended for the unlikely offence of opening a cafe (he instead spent that summer trying to join Clapton Orient, but failed to get a work permit). Romania were forced to play by their enthusiastic new king, Carol II, who picked the squad himself and convinced their employers to keep their jobs open despite an absence that would stretch to three months. Carol also convinced the Yugoslavian football association to send a team. It did not much matter who came, as Uruguay, twice Olympic champions in the 1920s, would have been strong favourites to win anyway. Not only were they at home, they were the great footballing power of the age, having won gold at the 1924 and 1928 Olympics. Of the five seeded teams, four were South American and the other was the USA \u2013 even though their participation in the 1928 Olympic football tournament had ended with an 11-2 defeat by the eventual silver medallists, Argentina, in the first round. &quot;In my opinion the absence of European football players will not undermine this tournament,&quot; the American goalkeeper James Douglas said. &quot;The Olympic Games showed that the supreme soccer nations of the world are those on either side of the River Plate.&quot; The tournament featured an inevitable stream of curiosity and controversy, many concerning the refereeing \u2013 at one stage a local paper wrote: &quot;The truth about the referees is that there has not been a single good performance. Not one.&quot; Kits were rather undeveloped, with the man who refereed the final, Belgium&apos;s John Langenus, sporting shirt, tie and knickerbockers for all his matches, and one game between Brazil and Bolivia starting with both sides sporting white shirts (half of the Bolivians, who were eventually to change into a red kit, also wore berets).     Uruguay's captain, Jos\u00e9 Nazassi, left, shakes hands with Argentina's 'Nolo' Fereyra in front of World Cup final referee John Langenus. Photograph: Keystone/Getty    The Argentinians were the event&apos;s great controversy magnets. On the night of 14 July their players were kept awake for half the night by members of Montevideo&apos;s large French population, celebrating Bastille Day. On the 15th they played France, and took out their annoyance in physical style: in the opening exchanges Luis Monti \u2013 the first and only man to play in two World Cup finals for two different nations, also turning out for Italy in 1934 \u2013 fouled Lucien Laurent, who spent the rest of the match hobbling around to little purpose. Then the French goalkeeper, Alex Th\u00e9pot, was taken ill. France clung on with nine fit men until the 81st minute, when Monti scored direct from a free-kick. But the most controversial incident of all came towards the end of the match when the France winger Marcel Langiller ran clear on goal, apparently certain to score, and the referee blew the final whistle. It was controversial because only 84 minutes had been played. The official \u2013 who one watching member of the Uruguay team said &quot;didn&apos;t know much about football&quot; \u2013 later brought the sides back out to complete the match, but France&apos;s momentum had faded. Argentina&apos;s win was so unpopular that local fans carried off some members of the France team shoulder-high and pelted the victors with stones as they left the ground, behaviour that one official from their FA suggested could &quot;gravely affect our nation&apos;s fraternal feelings with the nation of Uruguay&quot;. But their progress remained beset by scandal. Their second match, a 6-3 win against Mexico, was refereed by Ulises Saucedo, the Bolivian team coach, who awarded five penalties. Guillermo St\u00e1bile, playing only because Argentina&apos;s first-choice striker and captain, Manuel Ferreira, had gone home to sit a law exam, scored a hat-trick on his international debut (he would be the tournament&apos;s top scorer, but never played for his country again). Argentina&apos;s third group game, against Chile, featured an ugly mass brawl prompted, inevitably, by Monti, and eventually broken up by the police. St\u00e1bile scored twice in a 3-1 win but, by the time they qualified for the semi-finals, Argentina were so unpopular their team&apos;s hotel required round-the-clock police protection. In their semi-final against the USA, Alejandro Scopelli broke the leg of Raphael Tracey with a horrible challenge after 10 minutes. Tracey played on, as best he could, until half-time, when Argentina led 1-0. The South Americans scored five more times in the second half, and won 6-1. The USA&apos;s other casualties that day included Andy Auld, who lost four teeth and, according to their manager, Wilfred Cummings, &quot;had his lip ripped wide open&quot;; Bert Patenaude, who was taken to hospital with a stomach injury; and Jimmy Douglas, who was left limping after a blow to the knee. &quot;The Americans demonstrated true sportsmanship,&quot; El Dario reported, &quot;refusing to lose their temper in spite of the continued fouls of the Argentina players.&quot; The other semi-final also ended 6-1, Yugoslavia \u2013 exceeding all expectations by getting so far, with the average age of their young squad just 21.7 years \u2013 scored in the fourth minute before being outclassed by the hosts, one of whose goals came after the ball had gone out of play and been hoofed straight back in by a helpful policeman without any of the officials noticing. And so the tournament got the final the world demanded but the police most feared, between Uruguay and Argentina. Such was the pre-match excitement an entire fleet of boats set off across the River Plate from Buenos Aires, leaving a quayside crowd screaming &quot;Argentina si! Uruguay no! Victory or death!&quot;. They got lost in fog and most of them never made it. Fans were advised to arrive several hours before kick-off, as they were all to be searched at the gates in an effort to keep out firearms and assorted weaponry. Langelus was named as referee but agreed to do the job only on the condition that he and the linesmen \u2013 one of whom was Costel Radulescu, the manager of Romania \u2013 were escorted safely away from the ground after the match by mounted policemen. The teams could not agree on a match ball, so played the first half with Argentina&apos;s choice and the second with Uruguay&apos;s.     The Uruguay team for the 1930 World Cup final.

Peregrino Anselmo&apos;s illness forced them to recall H\u00e9ctor Castro, a striker remarkable predominantly for having lost most of an arm in a childhood carpentry accident. Argentina&apos;s players might not have previously suffered such significant physical injury but they certainly feared they might: at half-time, with Argentina 2-1 up, the defender Jos\u00e9 Della Torre told his team-mates: &quot;If we win this the crowd will tear us apart.&quot; &quot;That game was a disaster for us,&quot; said Argentina&apos;s Francisco Varallo, who died in 2010, aged 100, the last of the finalists. &quot;Monti and others played poorly from the very beginning \u2013 I later found out that he had received a letter threatening to kill him and his daughters if we won. Jos\u00e9 Nassazzi, the Uruguay captain, insulted me and hit me all the time. When we were winning 2-1 I received the ball and tried one of my trademark shots [he was nicknamed Canoncito, little canon], it hit the bar, and I did my knee in. &quot;At 2-1 I thought we&apos;d done it, that there was no way we could lose. But after my injury I had to go off. I couldn&apos;t walk. Uruguay started to put pressure on us then, and with the greatest respect to my team-mates, I reckon we lacked a little bit of steel. In the end they won 4-2. I still remember it so well and it makes me so angry. I still wonder how we let it slip, and I am convinced that if I had stayed on the pitch we would have won. In my whole life I&apos;ve never felt such a bitter pain as losing that final.&quot; Rimet insisted he &quot;liked the final game because it was a tough one, as I believe football should be \u2013 a game for strong and healthy men&quot;, and it inspired the first mention of the tournament in the Guardian, a single paragraph describing &quot;scenes exceeding in enthusiasm even those of an English Cup final&quot;, that got the score wrong.     Jules Rimet presents the World Cup trophy to Dr Paul Jude, the president of the Uruguayan FA after the final. Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images    The final whistle prompted a pitch invasion. Langenus, worried about violent reprisals from the losing team or their fans, saw the sudden arrival on the pitch of thousands of strangers as perfect cover, and made good his escape. He fled straight to the port and onto the SS Duilio, the Italian ocean liner that was due to take him home. Its departure was delayed by a day due to the fog, but he remained hidden on board. In Uruguay a national holiday was declared, and each team member was given a house. In Argentina a nation felt the pain described by Varallo, just with added fury. Agency reports detailed &quot;several minor riots, in which shots were fired, in Buenos Aires&quot;, while &quot;late at night about 100 demonstrators assembled in front of the Uruguayan Consulate and threw stones&quot;. The two nations&apos; football associations officially ended relations. &quot;The Argentine press calls attention to the condition of the players when they returned home,&quot; the Guardian later reported. &quot;They were injured and badly bruised, it says, and the violent game played by the Uruguayans was criticised severely.&quot; Which is all a bit rum, given the state that Argentina&apos;s extremely robust approach to the games against France, Chile and America. For the Europeans, another marathon journey awaited, one that did not pass without drama. One of the Romanians, Alfred Eisenbeisser Feraru, was taken ill during the transatlantic voyage, and diagnosed with pneumonia. When the boat reached Genoa, he was left in Italy to recuperate. A huge crowd gathered at Bucharest&apos;s Gara de Nord to welcome the team, and when his absence was noted a rumour spread that he had died in South America. The squad dispersed around the country and returned to work, and a distraught Mrs Feraru organised a wake to mark the passing of her beloved son. Right on cue, on the morning of his own wake, he returned home. His mother took one look at him and feinted. Not only was Feraru not dead, he was healthy enough to compete as a figure skater in the 1934 and 1938 European Championships \u2013 in the first of them he was also in the bobsleigh team \u2013 and the 1936 Winter Olympics, where he came 13th in the pairs. The reputation of the World Cup had been made. Four years later only the British were still refusing to participate, while the rest of Europe forgot their earlier indifference. Uruguay, on the other hand, did not \u2013 the holders refused to defend their title in Italy in belated protest at the lack of European representation in Montevideo. The Uruguayans ended the first World Cup burdened with both greatness and grudges, and the tournament had set a standard for excitement, scandal and intrigue that it has been seeking to live up to ever since.", "tags": ["World Cup", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-13T09:15:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/14/china-accuses-british-glaxosmithkline-executive-in-bribery-case", "sentences": ["The statement said Reilly and two Chinese executives also were accused of bribing government officials in Beijing and Shanghai."], "title": "China accuses British GlaxoSmithKline executive in bribery case", "article": "Chinese police have accused a British executive in drugs maker GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s China unit of ordering his salespeople to bribe doctors and hospital officials to use the company&apos;s products.

Mark Reilly ran GSK&apos;s operations in China but now risks a jail sentence in the country after he was accused of offences that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. Chinese police claimed that that Reilly and two other Chinese executives, Zhang Guowei and Zhao Hongyan, bribed doctors and hospital officials. The bribery allegations, which will now be passed to prosecutors, were harsher than many Chinese-based executives expected, Reuters reported. The police accused GSK, the UK&apos;s largest pharmaceutical company, of offering billions of yuan in bribes to doctors and other hospital staff in order to boost sales of its products. Although Reilly stood down from running GSK&apos;s China operations last July, he remains an employee. A report by the Chinese state news agency Xinhua highlights the role of the Briton. Zhang, a former vice-president of GSK China, told Xinhua that pressure to increase sales led to the bribery. &quot;When Reilly took over the post, the company&apos;s strategy shifted from profit-oriented to sales-oriented. The sales target in China was raised every year to compensate the reduction in US and European markets.&quot; When allegations of doctors being bribed with \u00a3320m worth of gifts and sexual favours first emerged last year, GSK said the investigation was focused on Chinese executives rather than British managers. GSK declined to comment on the specific allegations against Reilly. But in a statement, it said: &quot;We take the allegations that have been raised very seriously. They are deeply concerning to us and contrary to the values of GSK. &quot;We want to reach a resolution that will enable the company to continue to make an important contribution to the health and welfare of China and its citizens.&quot; Reilly has been working for GSK since 1989, according to his LinkedIn profile. A graduate of University College London, he holds a PhD in pharmacology and an accountancy qualification. He rose up the GSK ranks, doing a variety of commercial jobs that included stints in Singapore, the USA and GSK&apos;s headquarters in London. He took charge of GSK&apos;s operations in China in January 2009, based in Shanghai. He left the country last July when the bribery scandal broke. He later returned and was subsequently barred from leaving. Ten days after the scandal broke Reilly was replaced as GSK&apos;s China boss by Herve Gisserot. Chinese police have not said whether Reilly has been detained, but officials at the British Consulate in Shanghai have said they are in contact with him and providing assistance.

More like &quot;Chinewood&quot; \u2013 as in China plus Pinewood \u2013 David Cameron told reporters last December. Cameron was in Beijing at the time with Britain&apos;s largest ever trade mission, a 100-person microcosm of everything Britain had to offer: financial services, pharmaceuticals, energy, manufacturing, and culture \u2013 including the British Film Institute (BFI) and, unsurprisingly, Pinewood Studios. The latter didn&apos;t come back emptyhanded. A British-Chinese co-production deal was agreed giving Chinese film-makers access to British tax breaks and skills, and British film-makers a back door into the lucrative but well-shielded Chinese market. As with China&apos;s wider economic boom, the country&apos;s film industry is mushrooming, and everyone wants a piece of it. China is opening seven new cinema screens a day. It is the second largest film market in the world, and is expected to overtake the US within the next five years. Under China&apos;s state-controlled quota system, though, only 34 foreign films a year are permitted a release, and invariably those are big-budget Hollywood films. Films made under the UK-Chinese agreement will count as co-productions, however, and will therefore bypass the quota system. &quot;This is a significant step forward for the British film industry,&quot; said Cameron. Subsequent steps will be more tentative, though. The marriage has been arranged, but now the couple have to get to know each other. Britain has similar co-production deals with other countries, but as anyone in the movie business will tell you, China is different. There is no certification system deeming films appropriate for certain ages; instead, films are approved by the state \u2013 for everyone or not at all. The criteria are not made explicit, but foreign films are routinely rejected or cut on grounds such as religion (Darren Aronofsky&apos;s Noah), sex and violence (Django Unchained), and even time travel (The Time Traveller&apos;s Wife). And anything casting aspersions on China&apos;s rulers, history, military, human rights record \u2013 or any other aspect of the country \u2013 is out of the question. A Chinese spokesperson summed it up at a US/China film summit last year: &quot;We want to see positive Chinese images.&quot; The US has already been courting China for some time, though it has struggled to make Chollywood work. As one executive recently put it to the Hollywood Reporter: &quot;China is way too big to ignore and way too fucked up to expect anything.&quot; As well as the censorship hoops, there is a reduced box-office cut (studios usually get 25% in China, as opposed to 50%), and an unlevel playing field (Avatar, for example, was pulled from Chinese screens to make way for a home-made Confucius biopic). But it is still considered worthwhile. Stars such as Scarlett Johansson and Johnny Depp regularly turn up for the Beijing premieres these days, and Hollywood bends over backwards to incorporate Chinese actors and locations into blockbusters such as Mission Impossible 3 and Transformers 4. The results can be awkward, though. Few will have noticed Fan Bingbing and Wang Xueqi in last year&apos;s Iron Man 3, but Chinese audiences saw a different cut of the movie, with extended scenes featuring the Chinese actors. Having a villain named the Mandarin was a potential deal-breaker, but they got round that by making him from Croydon. Locals were not convinced, however. &quot;Some people mistake Hollywood&apos;s strategy as a sign of growing recognition of Chinese culture, but it is actually a commercial tactic,&quot; wrote China Daily after Iron Man 3, in an editorial entitled Don&apos;t Be Tricked By Hollywood. Britain is hoping for a happier relationship. &quot;I do think it&apos;s going to be complicated in the beginning,&quot; says Amanda Nevill, the BFI&apos;s chief executive, who accompanied David Cameron on the trade mission last year. &quot;We&apos;re two very different countries. It&apos;s a great leap of faith. But the only reason the co-production has been pursued with such vigour and enthusiasm is because both sides know there are a lot of wins.&quot;     Fei Mu\u2019s 1948 classic Spring in a Small Town.  Photograph: www.ronaldgrantarchive.com    That cultural gulf is already being bridged. Last month another British delegation \u2013 this time of film professionals \u2013 travelled to Beijing to meet and engage with their Chinese counterparts. And in June, a four-month retrospective of Chinese cinema begins at the BFI Southbank, the largest ever held in Britain. It offers a rare chance to see films from Shanghai&apos;s 1930s golden age: classics such as 1948&apos;s Spring In a Small Town, which has been compared with the works of Ozu and Antonioni, or the 1934 silent movie The Goddess, starring screen heroine Ruan Lingyu \u2013 both of which have recently been restored and received like long-lost relatives by Chinese audiences. China is virtually a missing chapter in cinema history. The ravages of the Cultural Revolution and decades of media control have done much to erase it, not just from outsiders but from its own population. If the outside world struggles with China&apos;s idiosyncrasies, it has been even harder for its own film-makers, who must obtain state permission to shoot a movie. What quality cinema China has produced in recent decades has often been made outside, or in opposition to, the official system. The award-winning films that heralded its 1990s renaissance, such as Zhang Yimou&apos;s Raise the Red Lantern and Chen Kaige&apos;s Farewell My Concubine, were banned in China. Both directors subsequently returned to the state-approved fold (Zhang directed the opening ceremony for the 2008 Beijing Olympics), where they have produced little of comparable calibre. Many young film-makers still prefer to operate outside official channels. They know the stories they are interested in telling would never be officially sanctioned. Documentary maker Wang Bing, for example, has earned festival acclaim with unvarnished studies of China&apos;s modernisation such as Three Sisters. Rising star Zheng Kuo&apos;s Burned Wings is a reckless study of young north-eastern hoodlums mixing violence, sex and comedy. Liu Jiayin&apos;s Oxhide films, meanwhile, are set entirely in the cramped Beijing apartment she shares with her parents. The movies that do get official approval and release tend to be inoffensive comedies and historical action movies catering to a youth audience. China is building a huge and profitable movie industry of its own, but its products are by no means up to international standards.            Reading on Mobile? Click here to view.  The best-known director of the current generation is Jia Zhangke, whose new film A Touch of Sin is released today. It lays out tales of death, violence and simmering anger at the inequality China&apos;s economic boom has created. A disgruntled worker takes a shotgun to the wealthy boss who sold off the state-run coal mine. Prostitutes parade in skimpy People&apos;s Army uniforms before wealthy clients. A migrant worker shoots a wealthy woman on the street for her cash. So much for &quot;positive Chinese images&quot;. Jia&apos;s previous films have been sedate, semi-documentary observations of his country&apos;s transition, but A Touch of Sin plays more like a Tarantino movie, or rather, the type of martial-arts movie Tarantino rips off. &quot;I&apos;ve always focused on contemporary Chinese issues and showing ordinary people&apos;s lives in dramatic transformation. But in recent years I&apos;ve been drawn to more extreme cases,&quot; says Jia. &quot;There is definitely a change in Chinese society. In my past films, when people were faced with problems, they chose to endure, to bear the consequences. However, in the past few years, pressure on people has intensified, and other ways to express yourself have been blocked. That leads to these outbursts of violence.&quot; The way Jia gleaned the stories in A Touch of Sin is also a reflection of this changing China. They were all based on news stories reported on Weibo \u2013 the Chinese version of Twitter. &quot;These kind of incidents never used to make the news. They were not allowed to be reported on TV, but now because of social media, we know what&apos;s going on,&quot; he says. A Touch of Sin won Jia best screenplay at last year&apos;s Cannes film festival, but, perhaps unsurprisingly, it has not been released in China. &quot;They are concerned what consequences releasing such a film might bring,&quot; says Jia. At least he got permission to make this one. His first movie, 1997&apos;s Xiao Wu, about a smalltown pickpocket, was shot clandestinely in his hometown of Fenyang. It earned him international recognition and a domestic ban from making any more movies. The former seems to have outweighed the latter. Similarly, A Touch of Sin has already been widely seen in China through pirated copies. One website hosting it got 30,000 comments. &quot;Censorship has actually loosened up a lot, though,&quot; says Jia. &quot;It&apos;s very hard to imagine A Touch of Sin would have been allowed to go ahead 15 years ago.&quot; Film-makers no longer have to submit entire scripts for approval; just a two-page synopsis. &quot;I&apos;ve found the best way to work is to have everybody on board. To communicate. So they get a sense that we&apos;re doing this project together. That does not mean I have to compromise or give up my own ground. I need to repeatedly express my will and intention and desire to make film freely in China.&quot;            Reading on mobile?

And what exactly might a &quot;Chinewood&quot; co-production look like? A British version of A Touch of Sin? An epic retelling of the opium wars, perhaps? An inoffensive hybrid, something like Crouching Tiger, Harry Potter? Perhaps we shouldn&apos;t expect this new relationship to breed a whole new type of cinema just yet, says Robin Gutch, managing director of Warp Films, who was one of the British team who recently flew out to Beijing. He was encouraged by what he saw. &quot;It was very inspiring.

Modi is a lifelong member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a paramilitary Hindu nationalist organisation inspired by the fascist movements of Europe, whose founder&apos;s belief that Nazi Germany had manifested &quot;race pride at its highest&quot; by purging the Jews is by no means unexceptional among the votaries of Hindutva, or &quot;Hinduness&quot;. In 1948, a former member of the RSS murdered Gandhi for being too soft on Muslims. The outfit, traditionally dominated by upper-caste Hindus, has led many vicious assaults on minorities. A notorious executioner of dozens of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 crowed that\u00a0he had slashed open with his sword the womb of a heavily pregnant woman and extracted her foetus. Modi himself described the relief camps housing tens of thousands of displaced Muslims as &quot;child-breeding centres&quot;. Such rhetoric has helped Modi sweep one election after another in Gujarat. A\u00a0senior American diplomat described him, in cables disclosed by WikiLeaks, as an &quot;insular, distrustful person&quot; who &quot;reigns by fear and intimidation&quot;; his neo-Hindu devotees on Facebook and Twitter continue to render the air mephitic with hate and malice, populating the paranoid world of both have-nots and haves with fresh enemies \u2013 &quot;terrorists&quot;, &quot;jihadis&quot;, &quot;Pakistani agents&quot;, &quot;pseudo-secularists&quot;, &quot;sickulars&quot;, &quot;socialists&quot; and &quot;commies&quot;. Modi&apos;s own electoral strategy as prime ministerial candidate, however, has been more polished, despite his appeals, both dog-whistled and overt, to Hindu solidarity against menacing aliens and outsiders, such as the Italian-born leader of the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, Bangladeshi &quot;infiltrators&quot; and those who eat the holy cow. Modi exhorts his largely young supporters \u2013 more than two-thirds of India&apos;s population is under the age of 35 \u2013 to join a revolution that will destroy the corrupt old political order and uproot its moral and ideological foundations while buttressing the essential framework, the market economy, of a glorious New India. In an apparently ungovernable country, where many revere the author of Mein Kampf for his tremendous will to power and organisation, he has shrewdly deployed the idioms of management, national security and civilisational glory. Boasting of his 56-inch chest, Modi has replaced Mahatma Gandhi, the icon of non-violence, with Vivekananda, the\u00a019th-century Hindu revivalist who was obsessed with making Indians a &quot;manly&quot; nation. Vivekananda&apos;s garlanded statue or portrait is as ubiquitous in Modi&apos;s public appearances as his dandyish pastel waistcoats. But Modi is never less convincing than when he presents himself as a humble tea-vendor, the son-of-the-soil challenger to the Congress&apos;s haughty dynasts. His\u00a0record as chief minister is predominantly distinguished by the transfer \u2013\u00a0through privatisation or outright gifts\u00a0\u2013 of national resources to the country&apos;s biggest corporations. His closest allies \u2013 India&apos;s biggest businessmen \u2013 have accordingly enlisted their mainstream media outlets into the cult of Modi as decisive administrator; dissenting journalists have been removed or silenced.     Mukesh Ambani's 27-storey house in Mumbai. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters    Not long after India&apos;s first full-scale pogrom in 2002, leading corporate bosses, ranging from the suave Ratan Tata to Mukesh Ambani, the owner of a\u00a027-storey residence, began to pave Modi&apos;s ascent to respectability and power. The stars of Bollywood fell (literally) at the feet of Modi. In recent months, liberal-minded columnists and journalists have joined their logrolling rightwing compatriots in certifying Modi as a &quot;moderate&quot; developmentalist. The Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati, who insists that he intellectually fathered India&apos;s economic reforms in 1991, and Gurcharan Das, author of India Unbound, have volunteered passionate exonerations of the man they consider India&apos;s saviour. Bhagwati, once a fervent supporter of outgoing prime minister Manmohan Singh, has even publicly applied for an advisory position with Modi&apos;s government. It may be because the nearly double-digit economic growth of recent years that Ivy League economists like him \u2013 India&apos;s own version of Chile&apos;s Chicago Boys and Russia&apos;s Harvard Boys \u2013 instigated and championed turns out\u00a0to have been based primarily on extraction of natural resources, cheap labour and foreign capital inflows rather than high productivity and innovation, or indeed the brick-and-mortar ventures that fuelled China&apos;s rise as a manufacturing powerhouse. &quot;The bulk of India&apos;s aggregate growth,&quot; the World Bank&apos;s chief economist Kaushik Basu warns, &quot;is occurring through a disproportionate rise in the incomes at the upper end of the income ladder.&quot; Thus, it has left largely undisturbed the country&apos;s shameful ratios \u2013 43% of all Indian children below the age of five are undernourished, and 48% stunted; nearly half of Indian women of childbearing age are anaemic, and more than half of all Indians still defecate in the open.           Absurdly uneven and jobless economic growth has led to what Amartya Sen and Jean Dreze call &quot;islands of California in a sea of sub-Saharan Africa&quot;. The failure to generate stable employment \u2013 1m new jobs are required every month \u2013 for an increasingly urban and atomised population, or to allay the severe inequalities of opportunity as well as income, created, well before the\u00a0recent economic setbacks, a large simmering reservoir of rage and frustration. Many Indians, neglected by the state, which spends less proportionately on health and education than Malawi, and spurned by private industry, which prefers cheap contract labour, invest their hopes in notions of free enterprise and individual initiative. However, old and new hierarchies of class, caste and education restrict most of them to the ranks of the unwashed. As the Wall Street Journal admitted, India is not &quot;overflowing with Horatio Alger stories&quot;. Balram Halwai, the entrepreneur from rural India in Aravind Adiga&apos;s Man Booker-winning novel The White Tiger, who finds in murder and theft the quickest route to business success and self-confidence in the metropolis, and Mumbai&apos;s social-Darwinist slum-dwellers in Katherine Boo&apos;s Behind the Beautiful Forevers point to an intensified dialectic in India today: cruel exclusion and even more brutal self-empowerment. \u2766 Such extensive moral squalor may bewilder those who expected India to conform, however gradually and imperfectly, to a western ideal of liberal democracy and capitalism. But those scandalised by the lure of an indigenised fascism in the country billed as the &quot;world&apos;s largest democracy&quot; should know: this was not the work of a day, or of a few &quot;extremists&quot;. It has been in the making for years. &quot;Democracy in India,&quot; BR Ambedkar, the main framer of India&apos;s constitution, warned in the 1950s, &quot;is only a top dressing on an Indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic.&quot; Ambedkar saw democracy in India as a promise of justice and dignity to the country&apos;s despised and impoverished millions, which could only be realised through intense political struggle. For more than two decades that possibility has faced a pincer movement: a form of global capitalism that can only enrich a\u00a0small minority and a xenophobic nationalism that handily identifies fresh scapegoats for large-scale socio-economic failure and frustration. In many ways, Modi and his rabble \u2013 tycoons, neo-Hindu techies, and outright fanatics \u2013 are perfect mascots for the changes that have transformed India since the early 1990s: the liberalisation of the country&apos;s economy, and the destruction by Modi&apos;s compatriots of the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya. Long before the killings in Gujarat, Indian security forces enjoyed what amounted to a licence to kill, torture and rape in the border regions of Kashmir and the north-east; a similar infrastructure of repression was installed in central India after forest-dwelling tribal peoples revolted against the nexus of mining corporations and the state. The government&apos;s plan to spy on internet and phone connections makes the NSA&apos;s surveillance look highly responsible. Muslims have been imprisoned for years without trial on the flimsiest suspicion of &quot;terrorism&quot;; one of them, a Kashmiri, who had only circumstantial evidence against him, was rushed to the gallows last year, denied even the customary last meeting with his kin, in order to satisfy, as the supreme court put it, &quot;the collective conscience of the people&quot;. &quot;People who were not born then,&quot; Robert Musil wrote in The Man Without Qualities of the period before another apparently abrupt collapse of liberal values, &quot;will find it difficult to believe, but the fact is that even then time was moving faster than a cavalry camel \u2026 But in those days, no one knew what it was moving towards. Nor could anyone quite distinguish between what was above and what was below, between what was moving forward and what backward.&quot; One symptom of\u00a0this widespread confusion in Musil&apos;s novel is the Viennese elite&apos;s weird ambivalence about the crimes of a brutal murderer called Moosbrugger. Certainly, figuring out what was above and what was below is harder for the parachuting foreign journalists who alighted upon a new idea of India as an economic &quot;powerhouse&quot; and the many &quot;rising&quot; Indians in a generation born after economic liberalisation in 1991, who are seduced by Modi&apos;s promise of the utopia of consumerism \u2013 one in which skyscrapers, expressways, bullet trains and shopping malls proliferate (and from which such eyesores as the poor are excluded).     A civilising mission \u2026 Jawaharlal Nehru with Mahatma Gandhi. Photograph: Max Desfor/AP    \u2766 People who were born before 1991, and did not know what time was moving towards, might be forgiven for feeling nostalgia for the simpler days of postcolonial idealism and hopefulness \u2013 those that Seth evokes in A Suitable Boy. Set in the 1950s, the novel brims with optimism about the world&apos;s most audacious experiment in democracy, endorsing the Nehruvian &quot;idea of India&quot; that seems flexible enough to accommodate formerly untouchable Hindus (Dalits) and Muslims as well as the middle-class intelligentsia. The novel&apos;s affable anglophone characters radiate the assumption that the sectarian passions that blighted India during its partition in 1947 will be defused, secular progress through science and reason will eventually manifest itself, and an enlightened leadership will usher a near-destitute people into active citizenship and economic prosperity. India&apos;s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, appears in the novel as an effective one-man buffer against Hindu chauvinism. &quot;The thought of India as a Hindu state, with its minorities treated as second-class citizens, sickened him.&quot; In Nehru&apos;s own vision, grand projects such as big dams and factories would bring India&apos;s superstitious masses out of their benighted rural habitats and propel them into first-world affluence and rationality. The Harrow- and Cambridge-educated Indian leader had inherited from British colonials at least part of their civilising mission, turning it into a national project to catch up with the industrialised west. &quot;I was eager and anxious,&quot; Nehru wrote of India, &quot;to change her outlook and appearance and give her the garb of modernity.&quot; Even the &quot;uninteresting&quot; peasant, whose &quot;limited outlook&quot; induced in him a &quot;feeling of overwhelming pity and a sense of ever-impending tragedy&quot; was to be present at what he\u00a0called India&apos;s &quot;tryst with destiny&quot;. That long attempt by India&apos;s ruling class to give the country the &quot;garb of modernity&quot; has produced, in its sixth decade, effects entirely unanticipated by Nehru or anyone else: intense politicisation and fierce contests for power together with violence, fragmentation and chaos, and a concomitant longing for authoritarian control. Modi&apos;s image as an exponent of discipline and order is built on both the successes and failures of the ancien regime. He offers top-down modernisation, but without modernity: bullet trains without the culture of criticism, managerial efficiency without the guarantee of equal rights. And this streamlined design for a new India immediately entices those well-off Indians who have long regarded democracy as a nuisance, recoiled from the destitute masses, and idolised technocratic, if despotic, &quot;doers&quot; like the first prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. But then the Nehruvian assumption that economic growth plotted and supervised by a wise technocracy would also bring about social change was also profoundly undemocratic and self-serving. Seth&apos;s novel, along with much anglophone literature, seems, in retrospect, to have uncritically reproduced the establishment ideology of English-speaking and overwhelmingly upper-caste Hindus who gained most from state-planned economic growth: the Indian middle class employed in the public sector, civil servants, scientists and monopolist industrialists. This ruling class&apos;s rhetoric of socialism disguised its nearly complete monopoly of power. As DR Nagaraj, one of postcolonial India&apos;s finest minds, pointed out, &quot;the institutions of capitalism, science and technology were taken over by the upper castes&quot;. Even today, businessmen, bureaucrats, scientists, writers in English, academics, thinktankers, newspaper editors, columnists and TV anchors are disproportionately drawn from among the Hindu upper-castes. And, as Sen has often lamented, their &quot;breathtakingly conservative&quot; outlook is to be blamed for the meagre investment in health and education \u2013 essential requirements for an equitable society as well as sustained economic growth \u2013 that put\u00a0India behind even disaster-prone China in human development indexes, and now makes it trail Bangladesh. Dynastic politics froze the Congress party into a network of patronage, delaying the empowerment of the underprivileged Indians who routinely gave it landslide victories. Nehru may have thought of political power as a function of moral responsibility. But his insecure daughter, Indira Gandhi, consumed by Nixon-calibre paranoia, turned politics into a game of self-aggrandisement, arresting opposition leaders and suspending fundamental rights in 1975 during a nationwide &quot;state of emergency&quot;. She supported Sikh fundamentalists in Punjab (who eventually turned against her) and rigged elections in Muslim-majority Kashmir. In the 1980s, the Congress party, facing a fragmenting voter base, cynically resorted to stoking Hindu nationalism. After Indira Gandhi&apos;s assassination by her bodyguards in 1984, Congress politicians led lynch mobs against Sikhs, killing more than 3,000 civilians. Three months later, her son Rajiv Gandhi won elections with a landslide. Then, in another eerie prefiguring of Modi&apos;s methods, Gandhi, a former pilot obsessed with computers, tried to combine technocratic rule with soft Hindutva. The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), a political offshoot of the RSS that Nehru had successfully banished into the political wilderness, turned out to be much better at this kind of thing. In 1990, its leader LK Advani rode a &quot;chariot&quot; (actually a rigged-up Toyota flatbed truck) across India in a Hindu supremacist campaign against the mosque in Ayodhya. The wildfire of anti-Muslim violence across the country reaped immediate electoral dividends. (In old photos, Modi appears atop the chariot as Advani&apos;s hawk-eyed understudy). Another BJP chieftain ventured to hoist the Indian tricolour in insurgent Kashmir. (Again, the bearded man photographed helping his doddery senior taunt curfew-bound Kashmiris turns out to be the young Modi.) Following a few more massacres, the BJP was in power in 1998, conducting nuclear tests and fast-tracking the programme of economic liberalisation started by the Congress after a severe financial crisis in 1991. The Hindu nationalists had a ready consumer base for their blend of chauvinism and marketisation. With India&apos;s politics and economy reaching an impasse, which forced many of their relatives to emmigrate to the US, and the Congress facing decline, many powerful Indians were seeking fresh political representatives and a new self-legitimising ideology in the late 1980s and 90s. This quest was fulfilled by, first, both the post-cold war dogma of free markets and then an openly rightwing political party that was prepared to go further than the Congress in developing close relations with the US (and Israel, which, once shunned, is now India&apos;s second-biggest arms supplier after Russia). You can only marvel today at the swiftness with which the old illusions of an over-regulated economy were replaced by the fantasies of an unregulated one.     Narendra Modi waves to supporters as he rides on an open truck on his way to filing his nomination papers. Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images    According to the new wisdom \u2013 new to India, if already worn out and discredited in Latin America \u2013 all governments needed to do was get out of the way of buoyant and autonomous entrepreneurs and stop subsidising the\u00a0poor and the lazy (in a risible self-contradiction these Indian promoters of minimalist governance also clamoured for a big militarised state apparatus to fight and intimidate neighbours and stifle domestic insurgencies). The long complex experience of strong European as well as east Asian economies \u2013 active state intervention in markets and support to strategic industries, long periods of economic nationalism, investments in health and education \u2013 was elided in a new triumphalist global history of free markets. Its promise of instant and widespread affluence seemed to have been manufactured especially for gormless journalists and columnists. Still, in the last decade, neoliberalism became the common sense of many Indians who were merely aspiring as well as those who had already made it \u2013 the only elite ideology after Nehruvian nation-building to have achieved a high degree of pan-Indian consent, if not total hegemony. The old official rhetoric of egalitarian and shared futures gave way to the media&apos;s celebrations of private wealth-creation \u2013 embodied today by Ambani&apos;s 27-storey private residence in a city where a majority lives in slums \u2013 and a proliferation of Ayn Randian cliches about ambition, willpower and striving. \u2766 Nehru&apos;s programme of national self-strengthening had included, along with such ideals as secularism, socialism and non-alignment, a deep-rooted suspicion of American foreign policy and economic doctrines. In a stunning coup, India&apos;s postcolonial project was taken over, as Octavio Paz once wrote of the Mexican revolution, &quot;by a capitalist class made in the image and\u00a0likeness of US capitalism and dependent upon it&quot;. A new book by Anita Raghavan, The Billionaire&apos;s Apprentice: The Rise of the Indian-American Elite and the Fall of the Galleon Hedge Fund, reveals how well-placed men such as Rajat Gupta, the investment banker recently convicted for insider trading in New York, expedited close links between American and Indian political and business leaders. India&apos;s upper-caste elite transcended party lines in their impassioned courting of likely American partners. In 2008, an American diplomat in Delhi was given an exclusive preview by a Congress party factotum of two chests containing $25m in cash \u2013 money to bribe members of parliament into voting for a nuclear deal with the US. Visiting the White House later that year, Singh blurted out to George W Bush, probably resigned by then to being the most despised American president in history, that &quot;the people of India love you deeply&quot;. In a conversation disclosed by WikiLeaks, Arun Jaitley, a senior leader of the BJP who is tipped to be finance minister in Modi&apos;s government, urged American diplomats in Delhi to see his party&apos;s anti-Muslim rhetoric as &quot;opportunistic&quot;, a mere &quot;talking point&quot; and to take more seriously his own professional and emotional links with the US. A transnational elite of rightwing Indians based in the US helped circulate an impression of an irresistibly &quot;emerging giant&quot; \u2013 the title of a book by Arvind Panagariya, a New-York-based economist and another aspiring adviser to Modi. Very quickly, the delusional notion that India was, as Foreign Affairs proclaimed on its cover in 2006, a &quot;roaring capitalist success-story&quot; assumed an extraordinary persuasive power. In India itself, a handful of corporate acquisitions \u2013 such as Tata&apos;s of Jaguar and Corus \u2013 stoked exorbitant fantasies of an imminent &quot;Global Indian Takeover&quot; (the title of a regular feature once in India&apos;s leading business daily, the Economic Times). Rent-seekers in a shadow intellectual economy \u2013 thinktank-sailors, bloggers and\u00a0Twitterbots \u2013 as well as academics perched on corporate-endowed chairs recited the mantra of privatisation and deregulation in tune. Nostrums from the Reagan-Thatcher era \u2013 the primary source of ideological self-indoctrination for many Americanised Indians \u2013 about &quot;labour flexibility&quot; were endlessly regurgitated, even though a vast majority of the workforce in India \u2013 more than 90% \u2013 toils in the unorganised or &quot;informal&quot; sector. Bhagwati, for\u00a0instance, hailed Bangladesh for its superb labour relations a few months before the collapse of the Rana Plaza in Dhaka; he also speculated that the poor &quot;celebrate&quot; inequality, and, with Marie Antoinette-ish serenity, advised malnourished families to consume &quot;more milk and fruits&quot;. Confronted with the World Health Organisation&apos;s extensive evidence about malnutrition in India, Panagariya, ardent patron of the emerging giant, argued that Indian children are genetically underweight. \u2766            This pitiless American free-marketeering wasn&apos;t the only extraordinary mutation of Indian political and economic discourse. By 1993, when A Suitable Boy was published, the single-party democracy it describes had long been under siege from low-caste groups and a rising Hindu-nationalist middle class. (Sunil Khilnani&apos;s The Idea of India, the most eloquent defence and elaboration of India&apos;s foundational ideology, now seems another posthumous tribute to it.) India after Indira Gandhi increasingly failed to respect the Nehruvian elite&apos;s coordinates of progress and order. Indian democracy, it turned out, had seemed stable only because political participation was severely limited, and upper-caste Hindus effectively ran the country. The\u00a0arrival of low-caste Hindus in mass\u00a0politics in the 1980s, with their representatives demanding their own share of the spoils of power, put the first strains on the old patrimonial system. Upper-caste panic initially helped swell the ranks of the BJP, but even greater shifts caused by accelerating economic growth after 1991 have fragmented even relatively recent political formations based on caste and religion. Rapid urbanisation and decline of agriculture created a large mass of the working poor exposed to ruthless exploitation in the unorganised sector. Connected to their homes in the hinterland through the flow of remittances, investment, culture and ideas, these migrants from rural areas were steadily politically awakened with the help of print literacy, electronic media, job mobility and, most importantly, mobile phones (subscribers grew\u00a0from 45 million in 2002 to almost a billion in 2012). The Congress, though instrumentally social-welfarist while in\u00a0power, failed to respond to this electorally consequential blurring of rural and urban borderlines, and the heightened desires for recognition and dignity as well as for rapid inclusion into global modernity. Even the BJP, which had fed on upper-caste paranoia, had been struggling under its ageing leaders to respond to an increasingly demanding mass of voters after its initial success in the 1990s, until Modi reinvented himself as a messiah of development, and quickly found enlarged constituencies \u2013 among haves\u00a0as well as have-nots \u2013 for his blend of xenophobia and populism. A wave of political disaffection has\u00a0also deposited democratic social movements and dedicated individuals across the country. Groups both within and outside the government, such as those that successfully lobbied for the groundbreaking Right to Information Act, are outlining the possibilities of what John Keane calls &quot;monitory democracy&quot;. India&apos;s many activist networks \u2013 for the rights of women, Dalits, peasants and indigenous communities \u2013 or issue-based campaigns, such as those against big dams and nuclear power plants, steer clear of\u00a0timeworn ideas of national security, economic development, technocratic management, whether articulated by the Nehruvians or the neo-Hindus. In a\u00a0major environment referendum last year, residents of small tribal hamlets in a remote part of eastern India voted to reject bauxite mining in their habitats. Growing demands across India for autonomy and bottom-up governance confirm that Modi is merely offering old \u2013 and soured \u2013 lassi in new bottles with his version of top-down modernisation. Modi, however, has opportunely timed his attempt to occupy the commanding heights of the Indian state vacated by the Congress. The structural problems of India&apos;s globalised economy have dramatically slowed its growth since 2011, terminating the euphoria over the Global Indian Takeover. Corruption scandals involving the sale of billions of dollars&apos; worth of national resources such as mines, forests, land, water and telecom spectrums have revealed that crony capitalism and rent-seeking were the real engines of India&apos;s economy. The beneficiaries of the phenomenon identified by Arundhati Roy as &quot;gush-up&quot; have soared into a transnational oligarchy, putting the bulk of their investments abroad and snapping up, together with Chinese and Russian plutocrats, real estate in London, New York and Singapore. Meanwhile, those made to wait unconscionably long for &quot;trickle-down&quot; \u2013 people with dramatically raised but mostly unfulfillable aspirations \u2013 have become vulnerable to demagogues promising national regeneration. It is this tiger of unfocused fury, spawned by global capitalism in the &quot;underdeveloped&quot; world, that Modi has sought to ride from Gujarat to New Delhi. \u2766 &quot;Even in the darkest of times,&quot; Hannah Arendt once wrote, &quot;we have the right to expect some illumination.&quot; The most prominent Indian institutions and individuals have rarely obliged, even as the darkness of the country&apos;s atrocity-rich borderlands moved into the heartland. Some of the most respected commentators, who are often eloquent in their defence of the right to free speech of famous writers, maintained a careful silence about the government&apos;s routine strangling of the internet and mobile networks in Kashmir. Even the liberal newspaper the Hindu prominently featured a journalist who retailed, as an investigation in Caravan revealed, false accusations of terrorism against innocent citizens. (The virtues of intelligence, courage and integrity are manifested more commonly in small periodicals such as Caravan and Economic and Political Weekly, or independent websites such as Kafila.org and Scroll.in.) The owners of the country&apos;s largest English-language newspaper, the Times of India, which has lurched from tedium to decadence within a few years, have innovated a revenue-stream called &quot;paid news&quot;. Unctuously lobbing softballs at Modi, the prophets of electronic media seem, on other occasions, to have copied their paranoid inquisitorial style from Glenn Beck and\u00a0Rush Limbaugh. Santosh Desai, one of contemporary India&apos;s most astute observers, correctly points out that the &quot;intolerance that one sees from a large section of society is in\u00a0some way a product of a &apos;televisionised&apos; India. The pent-up feelings of resentment and entitlement have rushed out and get both tacit and explicit support from television.&quot; A spate of corporate-sponsored literary festivals did not compensate for the missing culture of debate and reflection in the press. The frothy glamour of these events may have helped obscure the deeper intellectual and cultural churning in India today, the emergence of writers and artists from unconventional class and caste backgrounds, and the renewed attention to BR Ambedkar, the bracing Dalit thinker obscured by upper-caste iconographies. The probing work of, among others, such documentary film-makers as Anand Patwardhan (Jai Bhim Comrade), Rahul Roy (Till We Meet Again), Rakesh Sharma (Final Solution) and Sanjay Kak (Red-Ant Dream), and members of the Raqs Media Collective outlines a modernist counterculture in the making. But the case of Bollywood shows how the unravelling of the earliest nation-building project can do away with the stories and images through which many people imagined themselves to be part of a larger whole, and leave only tawdriness in its place. Popular Hindi cinema degenerated alarmingly in the 1980s. Slicker now, and craftily aware of its non-resident Indian audience, it has become an expression of consumer nationalism and middle-class self-regard; Amitabh Bachchan, the &quot;angry young man&quot; who enunciated a widely felt victimhood during a high point of corruption and inflation in the\u00a01970s, metamorphosed into an avuncular endorser of luxury brands. A\u00a0search for authenticity, and linguistic vivacity, has led film-makers back to the rural hinterland in such films as Gangs of Wasseypur, Peepli Live and Ishqiya, whose flaws are somewhat redeemed by their scrupulous avoidance of Indians sporting Herm\u00e8s bags or driving Ferraris. Some recent breakthroughs such as Anand Gandhi&apos;s Ship of Theseus and Dibakar Banerji&apos;s Costa-Gavras-inspired Shanghai gesture to the cinema of crisis pioneered by Asian, African and Latin American film-makers. But India&apos;s many film industries have yet to produce anything that matches Jia Zhangke&apos;s unsentimental evocations of China&apos;s past and present, the acute examination of middle-class pathologies in Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho&apos;s Neighbouring Sounds, or Nuri Bilge Ceylan&apos;s delicate portrait of the sterile secularist intellectual in Uzak. \u2766 The long artistic drought results partly from the confusion and bewilderment of an older, entrenched elite, the main producers, until recently, of mainstream culture. With their prerogative to rule and interpret India pilfered by the &quot;unwashed&quot; and the &quot;gullible&quot;, the anglophones have been struggling to grasp the eruption of mass politics in India, its new centrifugal thrust, and the nature of the challenge posed by many apparently illiberal individuals and movements. It is easy for them to denounce India&apos;s evidently uncouth retailers of caste and religious identity as embodiments of, in Salman Rushdie&apos;s words, &quot;Caligulan barbarity&quot;; or to mock Chetan Bhagat, the bestselling author of novels for young adults and champion tweeter, for boasting of his &quot;selfie&quot; with Modi. Those pied-pipering the young into Modi-mania nevertheless possess the occult power to fulfil the deeper needs of their needy followers. They can compile vivid ideological collages \u2013 made of fragments of modernity, glimpses of\u00a0utopia and renovated pieces of a forgotten past. It is in the &quot;mythological thrillers&quot; and positive-thinking fictions \u2013 the most popular literary genres in India today \u2013 that a post-1991 generation that doesn&apos;t even know it is lost fleetingly but thrillingly recognises itself. In a conventional liberal perspective, these works may seem like hotchpotches, full of absurd contradictions that confound the &quot;above&quot; with the &quot;below&quot;, the &quot;forward&quot; with the &quot;backward&quot;. Modi, for instance, consistently mixes up dates and historical events, exposing an abysmal ignorance of the past of the country he hopes to lead into a glorious future. Yet his lusty hatred of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty excites many young Indians weaned on the neo-liberal opiates about aspiration and merit. And he combines his historical revisionism and Hindu nationalism with a revolutionary futurism. He knows that resonant sentiments, images, and symbols \u2013 Vivekananda plus holograms and Modi masks \u2013 rather than rational argument or accurate history galvanise individuals. Vigorously aestheticising mass politics, and mesmerising the restless young, he has emerged as the new India&apos;s canniest artist. But, as Walter Benjamin pointed out, rallies, parades and grand monuments do not secure the masses their rights; they give them no more than the chance to express themselves, and noisily identify with an alluring leader and his party. It seems predictable that Modi will gratify only a few with his ambitious rescheduling of India&apos;s tryst with destiny. Though many exasperated Indians see Modi as bearing the long-awaited fruits of the globalised economy, he actually embodies its inevitable dysfunction. He resembles the European and Japanese demagogues of the\u00a0early 20th century who responded to the many crises of liberalism and democracy \u2013 and of thwarted nation-building and modernisation \u2013 by merging corporate and political power, and exhorting communal unity before internal and external threats. But Modi belongs also to the dark days of the early 21st century. His ostensibly gratuitous assault on\u00a0Muslims \u2013 already India&apos;s most depressed and demoralised minority \u2013 was another example of what the social anthropologist Arjun Appadurai calls &quot;a vast worldwide Malthusian correction, which works through the idioms of minoritisation and ethnicisation but is\u00a0functionally geared to preparing the world for the winners of globalisation, minus the inconvenient noise of its losers&quot;. Certainly, the new horizons of\u00a0desire and fear opened up by global capitalism do not favour democracy or human rights. Other strongmen who supervised the bloody purges of economically enervated and unproductive people were also ruthless majoritarians, consecrated by big election victories. The crony-capitalist regimes of Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand and Vladimir Putin in Russia were inaugurated by ferocious offensives against ethnic minorities. The electorally bountiful pogrom in Gujarat in 2002, too, now seems an early initiation ritual for Modi&apos;s India. The difficulty of assessing his personal culpability in the killings and rapes of 2002 is the same difficulty that Musil identifies with Moosbrugger in his novel: how to measure the crimes, however immense, of individuals against a universal breakdown of values and the normalisation of violence and injustice. &quot;If mankind could dream collectively,&quot; Musil writes, &quot;it would dream Moosbrugger.&quot; There is little cause yet for such despair in India, where the aggrieved fantasy of authoritarianism will have to reckon with the gathering energies below; the great potential of the country&apos;s underprivileged and voiceless peoples still lies untapped. But\u00a0for now some Indians have dreamed collectively, and\u00a0they have dreamed a man accused of mass murder.", "tags": ["Politics", "Narendra Modi", "World news", "India", "India elections 2014", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-16T05:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/17/taiwan-taipei-street-food-markets", "sentences": ["So we do, waiting half an hour for a spring onion omelette inside a sweet-glazed hot sesame flatbread at Fu Hang Dou Jiang at Huashan Market (Zhongxi\u00e0o East Road, Zhongzheng), a famous breakfast joint which shuts at 10am, where Er Chen would come with her family to eat curdled milk with breadsticks; and at Din Tai Fung Dumpling House, Taiwan&apos;s most famous restaurant, where we debate how to eat our xiaolongbao \u2013 soup dumplings (with roots in Shanghai) encased in translucent skin and holding a puddle of broth and a ball of pork."], "title": "Taiwan, home to the best street food markets in the world", "article": "The air is filled with the aromatic mix of soy, rice wine, sesame, spices, frying oil, grilling meat and the high-pitched shouts of hawkers. Clouds of smoke waft above the dozens of small stalls that make up Taipei&apos;s Ningxia night market, all brightly lit, sitting under coloured signs, beckoning customers to tables loaded with glossy, roasted duck heads and necks, intestines and hearts of every conceivable nature, piping hot bowls of noodles and freshly made dumplings. Stepping deeper into the elbow-jostling crowd, my nose leads my eyes towards frying chicken (often lushly marinated in soya milk then spiced and floured), coal-roasted squid, poached quail eggs, pig&apos;s blood rice cake, even frog spawn and skewered and grilled crickets. I try gooey omelette of sweet potato studded with small, fat salty oysters and covered in sweet, vinegary, ketchupy sauce. And gelatinous mochi rice balls, topped with peanut and sesame shavings. Above it all is the unmistakeable stench of stinky tofu. This Taiwanese staple begins as regular tofu which is fermented in basins of brine until it reaches a malodorous ripeness \u2013 it is then deep fried to render the outside crispy. I muster one biteful and the taste is, well, fine, but the putrid smell lingers on your clothes and in your hair and, for me, hangs on in the memory for just a little too long. Taiwan probably has the best night market scene in the world and some of the most exciting street food in Asia. With little space at home to cook, the Taiwanese prefer to head out almost every night to the heaving markets for the cheap snacks \u2013 or xiaochi \u2013 that are found across the island \u2013 on corners, in clusters of food-devoted streets or at one of over 100 night markets. Those with no language skills simply stand in front of the stall, point to what they want and use their digits to say how many. Stallholders then write the price down, with dishes generally costing between 60p and \u00a31.20.     A cook prepares for the evening rush at one of Taipei\u2019s ever-popular street food markets. Photograph: Lap-Fai Lee    &quot;A melting pot of cuisines&quot; is an oft-used cliche \u2013 but the food of Taiwan really is. Inhabited first by aborigines, the island sitting between the South and East China Seas was settled by Fujianese then Hakka people from mainland China before being &quot;discovered&quot; by the Portuguese in the 16th century, colonised by the Dutch in the 17th century, followed by the Spanish and then, between 1895 and 1945, the Japanese. At the end of the Chinese civil war, Chiang Kai-shek and the defeated Kuomintang army retreated to Taiwan with more than two million people, including many of the mainland&apos;s best chefs. I am being guided through Taiwan, its culinary history and the wondrous world of xiaochi by the team of street food vendors who last year won the Young British Foodie award and two British Street Food awards for Bao, a London-based bar and market stall championing Taiwanese dishes and ingredients. Er Chen Chang was born in Taiwan but came to boarding school in the UK in 2005 and stayed. She met Shing Tat Chung at Slade School of Fine Art and, together with Shing&apos;s sister Wai-Ting (Ting for short), decided to make something of their gastronomic passion. &quot;When we travelled around Taiwan, we loved the baos (buns) \u2013 they had this combination of flavours that just blew us away,&quot; says Shing. &quot;It was the first time we&apos;d tried peanut shavings, then there was the soft bun, the salty pork, the sour pickles. There was a great challenge for us to see how far we could go to make that better.&quot; Demand for Bao&apos;s baos means the threesome is now looking for premises in central London. They&apos;re leading a vanguard of what seems to be a burgeoning love for buns in the UK, a new craving that was gestated at the New York restaurant (now group) Momofuku, whose founding chef David Chang has been dubbed &quot;the king of pork buns&quot;. For this trip to Taiwan, the Bao group has gathered a bunch of like-minded food lovers via the crowd-sourcing travel site Open Trips. But it is a foray that similarly greedy adventurers can replicate with the help of Er Chen&apos;s guide to the foodie nooks and crannies of her home city (see below). &quot;You can come and do this yourself as Taipei is an easy city to negotiate, the public transport system, called the MRT, is great and cheap.&quot;     A tea ceremony. Photograph: Lap-Fai Lee    We travel to Ningxia by taxi (dirt cheap if there&apos;s a few of you) and the Bao group heads straight for the deep-fried taro stall with its biscuity smell. The queue snakes along the pavement and there is a 20-minute wait for crispy balls of tuber. &quot;I love that people do one thing really well, adapting and perfecting their recipes. If there&apos;s a queue, it means they make the best. If you see a queue for food in Taiwan, get in it,&quot; Er Chen advises. So we do, waiting half an hour for a spring onion omelette inside a sweet-glazed hot sesame flatbread at Fu Hang Dou Jiang at Huashan Market (Zhongxi\u00e0o East Road, Zhongzheng), a famous breakfast joint which shuts at 10am, where Er Chen would come with her family to eat curdled milk with breadsticks; and at Din Tai Fung Dumpling House, Taiwan&apos;s most famous restaurant, where we debate how to eat our xiaolongbao \u2013 soup dumplings (with roots in Shanghai) encased in translucent skin and holding a puddle of broth and a ball of pork. At Nanmen indoor produce market, stallholders proffer sour cherries, peanuts that are almost black when you pop them from the shell, and samples of Jinhua-style ham. Tables are piled with the remarkable fruit of this island \u2013 pineapples, mangoes, guavas. In the basement, people are hand-rolling dumplings, smiling. Hanging on one stall is the famous black chicken, known as a Silkie, with blue-ish black flesh and bones and a deep, gamey flavour. &quot;I remember when I was young my grandmother would make &apos;healthy soup&apos; from black chicken and said it would make me tall. It definitely worked,&quot; laughs Er Chen. &quot;I am much taller than my parents.&quot;     Dishes from Audrey's cooking class.  Photograph: Lap-Fai Lee    We buy ingredients for a cookery class at Teacher Yong&apos;s Cookery School where Er Chen, Ting and Shing reveal some (but not all) of the secrets of making their bun of unfathomable fluffiness (you can book something similar at kitchenivy.com) and when we exit down seven flights of stairs, we are thrust into the busy Ximending area which is packed with young people. Beyond its fashion shops, little sides alleys with stalls selling cheap tat and gay bars (where you can drink outside) is a city that&apos;s unfairly under-rated as a tourist destination. We visit Buddhist and Taoist temples, watch the highly choreographed changing of the guard at the elaborately grand Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall, take the fastest lift in the world to the top of the Taipei 101 tower (at 508 metres it was once the world&apos;s tallest building), watch early morning tai chi in the park and ponder the world&apos;s greatest collection of Chinese artefacts at the National Palace Museum. The city&apos;s low-rise architecture makes it seem less dense than many Asian cities and, in recent years, it has cleaned up its smoggy act and cleared green spaces. Taipei is working on showing visitors that what it lacks in architecture, it makes up for with relaxed and friendly people, a rich natural larder and some of the best Chinese food in the world. From the capital, we take the high-speed train 180 miles south to Tainan, the oldest city in Taiwan, and certainly more beautiful than the capital. We watch the landscape change, passing trees in blossom and beginning to fruit, until we reach the station on the outskirts of the city. Our first stop is a pavement cafe where we have breakfast bowls of turkey rice for less than a pound and &quot;little sausage wrapped in big sausage&quot; at the country&apos;s biggest night market, Hua Yuan. There&apos;s more space here, enough to sit on pop-up tables and chairs, which means we can really savour our next find \u2013 pancakes filled with milky ice-cream, peanut shavings and coriander. They are divine. On the train back to Taipei, the Bao group concedes that stinky tofu won&apos;t be making it on to the list of new dishes they want to add to their London menu. But that ice-cream pancake? Shing smiles: &quot;That was just amazing. We&apos;ll definitely be trying our own version of that when we get back.&quot; Taipei food tips by Er Chen Chang of Bao     Hsu Ren Ping's noodle factory.

Attorney general Eric Holder announced that the US for the first time would seek to bring officials of a foreign government to the US to face charges of infiltrating American computer networks to steal data beneficial to US trade competitors. The Justice Department even went as far as printing \u201cwanted\u201d posters. The charges come as revelations about the scale of National Security Agency surveillance from whistleblower Edward Snowden indicate that at least some US surveillance carries an economic benefit. \u201cThe range of trade secrets and other sensitive business information stolen in this case is significant and demands an aggressive response,\u201d Holder said on Monday. While suspicions about government sponsorship of corporate data theft have swirled around China for years, never before has the US formally accused officials from China, or any other government, of involvement. Not only has attribution of online espionage long vexed investigators, the prospect of diplomatic or economic retaliation has also been an impediment to taking action. The Justice Department national security chief, John Carlin, and colleagues from the Federal Bureau of Investigation credited a years-long effort, and the willingness of companies to admit to a data breach, with \u201cexposing the faces and the names behind the keyboards in Shanghai.\u201d Accused are Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu, and Gu Chunhui, whom a federal grand jury in Pennsylvania indicted on 31 counts of espionage. Carlin described the five men as members of a People\u2019s Liberation Army entity known as Unit 61398.     Three of the five officials on an FBI 'Wanted' poster. Photograph: AP    Last year, a report by the information security firm Mandiant concluded that Unit 61398 was most likely behind data theft comprising hundreds of terabytes, a scale it found to be unlikely to have occurred without government sponsorship. Mandiant found that the unit\u2019s network infiltrations \u201cperiodically revisit the victim\u2019s network over several months or years and steal broad categories of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing documents, partnership agreements, and emails and contact lists from victim organizations\u2019 leadership.\u201d The alleged data theft affected aluminum giant Alcoa, US Steel, the US Steelworkers Union, electricity and nuclear energy firm Westinghouse, Allegheny Technologies Inc, and SolarWorld. A senior FBI official, Robert Anderson, said he hoped other companies who experienced theft of proprietary information would \u201ccome forward and talk to us\u201d. China&apos;s foreign ministry called the allegations \u201cextremely ridiculous&quot;. Ministry spokesman Qin Gang demanded that the US \u201cimmediately rectify its mistake&quot; and repeal the lawsuit, according to a statement on its website. \u201cThis grave violation of the basic norms of international relations has harmed Chinese-US cooperation and mutual trust,\u201d he said, adding that China has already lodged a formal complaint with US authorities. The Chinese government frequently counters hacking allegations by claiming that the country is a safeguard of internet security and that cyber-attacks are a universal problem. Qin said that China \u201cnever engages in the activity of stealing commercial secrets through the internet.\u201d He called the allegations \u201cbaseless\u201d. \u201cFor a long time, American authorities have conducted large-scale, organized cyber-theft and cyber-espionage activities against foreign dignitaries, companies and individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is already common knowledge.\u201d The US military has for years suspected its Chinese counterpart of stealing proprietary defense information, including about the design of the F-35 family of stealth jets, even as it seeks to forge closer ties with the People\u2019s Liberation Army. General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, welcomed his PLA counterpart to the Pentagon last week, but both officers avoided talk about cyber espionage in a Thursday press conference. Some observers said China was all but certain to retaliate, economically or diplomatically. \u201cClearly, China will need to respond in some fashion,\u201d said a trade lobbyist who requested anonymity. \u201cHopefully, advancements will be made that won&apos;t impact economic development for either country.\u201d James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the effect would be &quot;intangible&quot; but the formal accusation &quot;sends a strong message&quot; to Beijing. But Holder said that he wanted China to turn the five officers over to the US to stand charges, an unlikely step for the Chinese to take. \u201cOur intention is for the defendants to have due process in an American court of law,\u201d Holder said. The US posture is complicated by recent revelations of widespread NSA surveillance that impacts the blurry area between economic and security matters. Since the Edward Snowden disclosures began, the US has drawn a distinction between spying for security purposes, which it considers legitimate, and surveillance intended to reap economic advantages, which it does not. But the NSA penetrated the servers of the Chinese telecom corporation Huawei, which US officials consider little more than a stalking horse for Chinese surveillance, and put the company\u2019s executives under surveillance, the New York Times and Der Spiegel reported in March. While the US insists its concerns about Huawei are predicated on security threats from Huawei products sending customer data back to China \u2013 and the opportunities of inserting backdoors into Huawei products used by surveillance targets \u2013 Huawei has felt those concerns amounted to a pretext. Last year it announced it would abandon the US market, although executives later walked the announcement back somewhat. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden showed the NSA targeted the Brazilian oil firm Petrobras, even as the NSA insisted that its Defense Department parent \u201cdoes not engage in economic espionage in any domain, including cyber,\u201d in a statement to the Washington Post. Holder attempted to distinguish between economic and security surveillance in a Monday press conference. \u201cAll nations are engaged in intelligence gathering,\u201d Holder said, but the current indictment involves \u201ca state sponsored entity, state sponsored individuals, using intelligence tools to gain commercial advantages, and that is what makes this case different.\u201d", "tags": ["Cyberwar", "Espionage", "Hacking", "Internet", "China", "US news", "Asia Pacific", "Heartbleed", "Doge", "World news", "Cybercrime"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-20T07:58:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/20/china-reacts-furiously-us-cyber-espionage-charges", "sentences": ["Mandiant linked a number of attacks to a military-affiliated group based in nondescript building on the outskirts of Shanghai."], "title": "China reacts furiously to US cyber-espionage charges", "article": "China&apos;s foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador on Tuesday after the US indicted five Chinese military-affiliated hackers for stealing commercial secrets in an unprecedented cyber-espionage case.

The authorities in Beijing also suspended China&apos;s role in a joint anti-cybertheft group with Washington. Zheng told Baucus that China would &quot;take further action on the so-called charges&quot;, according to the official Xinhua news agency. On Monday the US justice department accused China of stealing sensitive information from five US enterprises and a trade union. The FBI printed wanted posters accusing the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) officials Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu and Gu Chunhui of a series of offences, including conspiring to commit computer fraud, aggravated identity theft and economic espionage. In 2013, the California-based cybersecurity firm Mandiant said Chinese had launched cyber-attacks on 141 organisations across 20 industries. Targets included a range of government departments, private companies, from the Pentagon to the New York Times. NGOs were also targeted. Mandiant linked a number of attacks to a military-affiliated group based in nondescript building on the outskirts of Shanghai. The five suspects the justice department named allegedly worked from the same building. &quot;The range of trade secrets and other sensitive business information stolen in this case is significant and demands an aggressive response,&quot; the US attorney general, Eric Holder, said at a news conference . He said the case should &quot;serve as a wake-up call to the seriousness of the ongoing cyber threat&quot;. Without China&apos;s co-operation, the officials are highly unlikely to ever stand trial. China has long denied US hacking allegations, but its response to the current indictments has been unusually strong. &quot;Up to now, relations between the China and US militaries had been developed well overall,&quot; the foreign ministry said in a statement. &quot;The US, by this action, betrays its commitment to building healthy, stable, reliable military-to-military relations and causes serious damage to mutual trust between the sides.&quot; China also accused the US of hypocrisy, tacitly recalling Edward Snowden&apos;s revelations last year that Washington had overseen the hacking of Chinese companies, including the Shenzhen-based telecommunications company Huawei. Washington maintains that it draws a clear line between economic and security-related cyber activity.

His 3,000-word handwritten dispatch, entitled The Great Chinese Takeaway, was written on the plane and circulated to friends. It exposed his views on the &quot;ridiculous rigmarole&quot; and &quot;awful Soviet-style display&quot; of goose-stepping Chinese soldiers. For good measure, he also bemoaned his uncomfortable club class seat on the British Airways 747 transporting the British contingent back to the UK, and described his indignation at discovering that others, including Edward Heath, Douglas Hurd and Robin Cook were &quot;ensconced in First Class immediately below us&quot;. &quot;Such is the end of Empire,&quot; he lamented. These private views inevitably found their way into the public domain courtesy of a Sunday newspaper in 2006, just days after the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, made a state visit to Britain. Three months later, at the opening of a new Madame Tussauds in Shanghai, the lack of a waxwork Charles from the happy royal group was conspicious. The Halifax incident highlights the vexed question of just how private the prince&apos;s conversations are on official engagements representing the British government. He was shown around the Museum of Immigration in Halifax by Marienne Ferguson, 78, who told him how she fled to Canada with her family shortly before the Nazis annexed Gdansk in 1939. After the meeting she reportedly said: &quot;The prince said: &apos;And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler.&apos;&quot; Later she expressed surprise that such a &quot;little remark&quot; had made &quot;such a big uproar&quot;. Past experience alone should have taught the prince that such comments rarely remain private, and as future monarch great care must be taken. The royal correspondents&apos; lot is to trail in the wake of the heir to the throne as he gladhands his way around the planet, and access to those he has just spoken to is usually facilitated. Picking up such stories is the bread-and-butter of royal tour coverage, for which journalists pay hefty prices for airfares and hotels to provide the oxygen of publicity necessary to keep the institution of royalty afloat. In the United Arab Emirates in 2007, it was McDonald&apos;s that attracted the prince&apos;s ire, as he told a nutritionist at a diabetes centre that banning the fast food outlets was &quot;key&quot;. The company registered its disappointment, adding that other royals had &quot;probably got a more up-to-date picture of us&quot;. In 2010 he attracted criticism for expressing strong opinions on a multimillion-pound plan for Chelsea Barracks in London, telling the prime minister of Qatar, who was chair of the developers, that his heart sank when he saw Lord Rogers&apos; modernist glass and steel design. It was unhelpful timing, with Qatar about to provide the UK with more than 20% of its gas needs, and the Queen due to open a new liquified natural gas terminal in south Wales. The prince&apos;s 2004 visit to Washington was his first to the US in seven years. The long gap, the Guardian was informed by a source at the time, was on the advice of the Foreign Office as he was known to have strong pro-Palestinian views and had been privately critical of US policy in the Middle East conflict. The Queen has mastered the art of small talk. &quot;Have you come far?&apos; and &quot;what do you do?&apos; are staples. No one should expect this crusader prince to confine himself to inanity, but judgment is still called for. Next month, he and Putin will both be in France along with Allied leaders including the Queen to commemorate the 70th anniversay of the D-day landings. If the two were due to meet, it seems unlikely now. The timing of his remarks was badly chosen, according to the Russian daily Moskovsy Komsomolets.

The exhibitions, both opening this week \u2013 the first in the UK with new works since his Sunflower Seeds filled the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern \u2013 have had to be organised with his studio in Beijing by email: the artist himself can rarely even speak on the phone. In a Guardian interview in 2010, he said: &quot;I have to speak out for the people who are afraid&quot; \u2013 but as the timeline makes clear, speaking out has become increasingly difficult for him in the years that have followed. Clare Lilley, director of programme at the sculpture park, said: &quot;These pieces look so calm and so beautiful \u2013 but the undertone is that life is really incredibly difficult and bloody for millions of people.&quot; The timeline includes some figures the west may have forgotten \u2013 an estimated five million famine deaths across China in 1928-30; 10\u00a0million in 1943; 25-45\u00a0million after the end of the Great Leap Forward in 1961. Some of the dates are unforgettable: 1989 troops opened fire on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, Beijing (the official death toll is 200); 2008 an 8.0-magnitude earthquake hit Sichuan province, killing tens of thousands \u2013 and Beijing hosted the Olympic games. In parallel columns there are dates very personal to the artist: 1932, his father, the celebrated poet Ai Qing, begins to write because he cannot paint while imprisoned as a member of the League of Left Wing Artists; 1958, Ai Qing interned in a labour camp as a &quot;rightist&quot; with his family, including the baby Ai Weiwei, where he spends the next 16 years cleaning the village toilets.

The most recent date simply reads &quot;2014 passport confiscated&quot;. Lilley had the idea of an Ai Weiwei show when she was wondering how to celebrate the reopening of the chapel, a Grade II* listed building that was once the private church for the family and workers of the grand Bretton estate, newly rescued at a cost of \u00a3500,000 from dereliction and the English Heritage register of important endangered buildings. By happy coincidence, a private collector phoned to say he was about to buy a very large, heavy sculpture, wouldn&apos;t have space to display it, and wondered if the park would like to borrow it. It proved to be the 9.4 tonnes of Ai Weiwei&apos;s Iron Tree, 97 casts of pieces of timber from a Chinese market bolted together: &quot;They said it would take three weeks. It took us two \u2013 bloody hard work,&quot; said sculptor and technician Nobby Stephenson proudly. The tree, already rusting into a beautiful golden red, is now spectacularly installed by the gable, surrounded by the real ancient graveyard trees. Lilley then remembered Ai Weiwei&apos;s moving 2007 piece Fairytale 1001 Chairs, for which he brought antiques to Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany, each representing a Chinese citizen who could not travel \u2013 made at a time when he could.     A recreation of Ai Weiwei's Fairytale-1001 Chairs, representing Chinese people denied the right to travel, in the chapel at Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    She emailed the plans and photographs of the chapel to Beijing, and heard nothing for some time \u2013 until the reply came that Ai&apos;s studio would be sending 45 chairs. More pieces followed, including a tiny but spectacular ceramic sculpture for the gallery, and his map of China made of timbers reclaimed from demolished temples. The final consignment was a new piece, a lantern like the ones he has teasingly hung on the state&apos;s security cameras that encircle his home, but carved in marble from the quarry which supplied the Forbidden City, and centuries later, the tomb of Mao Zedong. The chairs have been set out in the nave in nine rows of five, set at a precise separation specified by Ai Weiwei. On the first Sunday of every month, there will be readings of his father&apos;s poems. It sounds simple, but the effect is powerful: many of the chairs are museum pieces, but people are welcomed to sit on them and the spacing means that they are companionable but isolated. The park has just suffered a grievous loss in the early death of its head gardener, Dave Edwards \u2013 who had worked on the estate his entire life \u2013 and many of the staff who first sat quietly in the chairs found their eyes filling with tears. \u2022 Ai Weiwei in the Chapel, Yorkshire Sculpture Park, West Bretton, near Wakefield, until 2 November", "tags": ["Ai Weiwei", "Sculpture", "Art", "Art and design", "Yorkshire", "UK news", "China", "Protest"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-22T13:19:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-culture-blog/2014/may/25/amy-tan-gary-shteyngart-and-benjamin-law-on-being-the-children-of-immigrants", "sentences": ["When Tan&apos;s mother lived in Shanghai, she was a socialite.", "&quot;When I went to Shanghai with her she got into even more arguments, and I realised English only held her back.&quot; Shteyngart had similar revelations on travelling back to Russia."], "title": "Amy Tan, Gary Shteyngart and Benjamin Law on being the children of immigrants", "article": "&quot;Isn&apos;t Jewish culture more about guilt than shame?&quot; asks Amy Tan. &quot;Shame is much more public.&quot; Tan, Benjamin Law, Gary Shteyngart and facilitator Annette Shun Wah are discussing what it means to grow up in a western culture as the children of immigrant parents. The first topic they tackle: where do Asian parents and Jewish parents intersect? A ritual and importance around food, it is established. Money. And what is that relationship between guilt and shame? Strangers in a Strange Land is that perfect blend of a writers&apos; festival panel: funny, perceptive, occasionally shocking, and allowing the audience a new insight into the writers and the ways their lives can be connected through their work. Tan says that as a child, she felt as though she had landed in the wrong family - she felt American. Shteyngart, emigrating with his parents from Leningrad to New York when he was seven, found solace in writing: &quot;it was the one thing where I didn&apos;t have an accent.&quot;  Law, on the other hand, feels he had a reverse experience to typical. Growing up in Queensland as one of five children, with Sesame Street on television and Law starting school the same year the World Expo came to Brisbane, &quot;I started out in a place of confidence,&quot; he says. &quot;Multiculturalism was in. [...] We were considered sort of awesome. &quot;I had currency. I had chopsticks in my lunchbox - I gave chopstick lessons,&quot; he says, to laughs from the audience. Being shorter than his peers and with a shaved head &quot;they would pat my head for luck.&quot; In the 1990s, though, the political climate began to shift, and with Pauline Hanson becoming a prominent political figure, &quot;anti-Chinese sentiment became quite mainstream.&quot; His friends, trying to be complementary, would say they didn&apos;t think of Law as Chinese. But then how did they see him? He still finds himself grappling with this today: &quot;Do I pass as Australian? Do I pass as a gay person living in a predominantly straight world?&quot;  &quot;I never thought of you as gay!&quot; exclaims Tan.  As a child, Tan helped her mother &quot;pass&quot; in America. She would write notes as her mother, speak on the telephone as her mother. It was a frequently abusive relationship, and Tan was often forced to say terrible things about herself. &quot;I thought it was my punishment,&quot; she says. When Tan&apos;s mother lived in Shanghai, she was a socialite. Moving to America for love to marry a poor minister, she struggled not only with the change in cultures, but perhaps even more so with the shift in status. Tan says it was in returning to China with her mother that she began to realise the complexities of her life. &quot;I used to think she got into a lot of arguments [in America] because no-one could understand her English,&quot; says Tan. &quot;When I went to Shanghai with her she got into even more arguments, and I realised English only held her back.&quot; Shteyngart had similar revelations on travelling back to Russia. As a child, he says, &quot;I always wanted to have American parents. That was my dream.&quot; Reflecting back on the anger he expressed at his parents in his early writing, he has found his perspective has shifted. He has travelled back many times alone, but it was on going back with his parents for the first time he found &quot;all those feelings of anger turned to sadness that they didn&apos;t have the same upbringing as me.&quot; His mother, he says, &quot;was a very tough person. And Russia was a very tough country.&quot; Again and again, the panellists turn to the complexity of their parents relationships with their adopted countries; with the conflict of raising children in a foreign culture; and with trying to find a way to solidify their status. Shun Wah says, &quot;my parents had in some sense a feeling of superiority: Chinese parents take much better care of their children than Australian parents.&quot; This was, she says, &quot;one of the few ways they could establish their status.&quot;  Laughing about his own complex relationship as an immigrant, &quot;to make ourselves feel better,&quot; says Shteyngart &quot;we tell ourselves we&apos;re more cultured than America. &quot;At least we have Chekhov!&quot;", "tags": ["Sydney writers' festival 2014", "Books", "Australia news", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-25T04:56:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/26/cigar-that-fell-love-with-pipe-review-david-camus-nick-abadzis", "sentences": ["It&apos;s 1947, and Welles and Hayworth have just finished making The Lady from Shanghai."], "title": "The Cigar That Fell in Love With a Pipe review \u2013 David Camus and Nick Abadzis revisit Welles and Hayworth", "article": "When Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles split up in 1948, she told the press: &quot;I can&apos;t take his genius any more.&quot; Both sides were said to have been unfaithful. But David Camus and Nick Abadzis have come up with a loopily different version of the story, one they tell in this charming new graphic novel (words by Camus, who is French; pictures by Abadzis, who lives in Brooklyn and won an Eisner award for his 2007 book, Laika, a fictionalised account of the life of the dog the Soviets sent into space in Sputnik II). As Camus and Abadzis have it, Welles and Hayworth parted because she smoked the most precious cigar in his collection, an irreplaceable Cuban rolled by Conchita Marquez, the island&apos;s greatest ever torcedora. After this, you understand, there was no way forward; whether these stars loved each other or not, divorce was the only possible outcome. It&apos;s 1947, and Welles and Hayworth have just finished making The Lady from Shanghai. At home in Hollywood, the director takes receipt of a box of celebratory cigars, sender unknown. It doesn&apos;t take him long to realise that these are really special. Slightly oily, soft to the touch, and covered with a layer of dusty white mould, he soon recognises them as the work of the legendary Marquez: &quot;The sweet smell of her cigars was unlike any other \u2013 a heavenly blend of perspiration and grime that drove cigar lovers mad.&quot; Naturally, Welles is thrilled, though how he will resist smoking them all, he has no idea. And resist he must, for there are no more where these came from. Marquez is dead, having become suddenly allergic to nicotine. It was hoped that a clinic in Switzerland would save her, but she was unable to resist rolling the glorious dark green tobacco leaves she packed in her trunk for the voyage, and by the time she arrived in Europe, it was too late. What Welles doesn&apos;t know, however, is that her spirit lives on in a single cigar \u2013 one that happens to be lying at the bottom of his box. Sure enough, Marquez&apos;s shade now appears before him, begging that this particular cigar might be locked safely in his humidor, alongside an exquisite carved pipe Welles bought at auction, in which, by happy coincidence, resides the spirit of a sailor she fell in love with on the boat to Europe. Welles agrees, and all is well until Hayworth, who is enraged by his smoking, raids his humidor in his absence. Does all this sound surreal, even a little barmy? Maybe so. All I can tell you is that on the page it works wonderfully well, becoming an unlikely fairy tale that takes in both Hollywood&apos;s golden age and the mystique and ritual so beloved of cigar aficionados. Abadzis&apos;s drawings are voluptuous and comical, and Camus combines speech bubble wit with the narrative solemnity of a fable.

If anyone is a \u201cmaster of the universe\u201d, it is Justin, who never does tell me how much he earns, nor even how many digits his income runs to. I&apos;d hazard a guess at seven, maybe eight in a good year. \u201cI&apos;m underpaid for what I bring in to the bank,\u201d is all he&apos;ll say. My initial contact with him is a Saturday-morning phone call. I am just struggling into consciousness; Justin has been up for hours, sealing a deal in Africa. He says he gets to his office at 7am every day, and is often still there at midnight. The attraction of the City of London for financiers is that it spans time zones and acts as a bridge between the US and the rest of the world \u2013 hence the 17-hour day. The other seven hours can be left to Wall Street. Even investment bankers occasionally have to sleep. A few days after our initial phone conversation (when Justin warns me that \u201cwe see the Guardian as the enemy\u201d), we meet at a hotel in Mayfair, where he has been having lunch with clients. Mayfair, Canary Wharf and the old City, based around the Bank of England, are the three centres of London&apos;s financial world. Canary Wharf \u2013 modernist, faceless, towering \u2013 houses the mighty investment banks; the City \u2013 quirky, crowded, knotty, historic \u2013 has the brokers, insurers and ancillary services; Mayfair \u2013 discreet, stylish, cosmopolitan \u2013 is home to the hedge funds and private equity companies. I am trying to understand the culture of the City; to find out whether those who work there have learned the lessons of the crash of 2007-08, and if the City can ever be made \u201cdisaster proof\u201d \u2013 a question that has vexed politicians, financiers and the public ever since (indeed Mervyn King, the former Bank of England governor, has been warning the Hay Festival that another Fred Goodwin \u2013 the disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland boss \u2013 will emerge unless the banking system changes). Seeking an insight into the City\u2019s problems is a thankless task. The terminology is baffling \u2013 I still can&apos;t distinguish between a credit default swap (CDS) and a collateralised debt obligation (CDO); organisations, including the Bank of England that refuses to grant me an interview, thrive on opacity; and City insiders are paranoid about talking to the media. I have never met so many people who insist on anonymity and demand to see quotes, or who, like Justin (not his real name), want both. He really must see me as the enemy, but to his credit he does talk \u2013 even if later he doubts whether he should have given the interview. \u201cThe City is the equivalent of Venice in the middle ages,\u201d Justin tells me. \u201cIt&apos;s a massive international melting pot that drives London and the rest of the country.\u201d He accepts there are bad guys, especially among the hedge funds, but insists the malign aspects of the City are outweighed by its benefits to the UK economy \u2013 providing more than 10% of the Treasury&apos;s total tax take. \u201cTo the aesthete Guardian, the average City trader looks pretty ugly because they drive swanky cars and are spivs,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut you should respect the mores and the facts.\u201d I promise to try.     The City of London is opaque to outsiders. Photograph: Martin Godwin    Justin startles me by extending his Venetian analogy. If the City is Venice, he says, then the rest of the UK is Mestre \u2013 the boring bit on the other side of the causeway that no one visits. \u201cThe banks are here [in the UK], but almost everything they do is not here,\u201d he says. \u201cI&apos;ve got no clients in this country. I&apos;ve got clients in Russia, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, Switzerland. That&apos;s very normal in the City. The City doesn&apos;t service London and the UK; it starts off in India and goes all the way to Ireland, then up to Russia and down to Cape Town.\u201d The City is not especially interested in the UK; it exists to serve \u2018Emea\u2019, a land known only to bankers: Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He doubts whether I will really grasp the City. \u201cOne of the problems for you is that the big banks are so massive. If I leave my desk and walk 10 yards, I have no idea what the people sitting there do. I&apos;m on one floor of a huge, multi-storey building, and each floor is the size of a football pitch.\u201d It sounds loathsome. Does he enjoy it? \u201cWith a bank you have to be in a competitive frame of mind. If you&apos;re good at it, you like it and you make money for yourself and the bank. You enjoy it and you like the buzz of money. If you&apos;re not good at it, you&apos;re unhappy, you don&apos;t make any money and eventually you get shot. I really hate it if I&apos;m not doing well. It&apos;s like a big competitive cocktail party where you have to be personable and outgoing and persuasive, but also you&apos;ve really got to think through the issues, understand the complex beast you&apos;re working for, and exploit all the various things it can do. Most of these banks can do anything.\u201d In a good way, he means. A few days after meeting Justin, I have dinner with three members of a City-based book club \u2013 a partner in one of the big four accountancy firms, a partner in a large City law firm, and a senior analyst at an investment bank. They are thoughtful, friendly, articulate; they don&apos;t share Justin&apos;s hang-ups about the Guardian; they accept there are many legitimate criticisms of the City \u2013 the accountant even recognises that the domination of the big four accountancy firms is a cartel; and they don&apos;t wash down the expensive meal (paid for by the accountant, thank goodness) with a ludicrously overpriced bottle of wine; in fact they don&apos;t drink any alcohol. Conclusion one: the image of the drink and drug-fuelled City may be overstated; these guys like good food, lively conversation \u2013 an antidote to the ritualised alternation of home and work, says one \u2013 and thought-provoking books. They are the antithesis of spivs. The analyst (all three have requested anonymity) rejects my assertion that the City is hermetically sealed from outsiders and almost deliberately opaque \u2013 my main conclusion by the time I meet them. With a comment that underlines the difficulty facing the newly launched Banking Standards Council (an independent body that will monitor the City\u2019s attempts to restore its reputation), he says, \u201cYou have to be careful when you refer to \u2018the City\u2019. It doesn&apos;t really exist. There are lots of different parts of the City that often work together, but it&apos;s a very long way from being homogeneous. They&apos;re all financial markets to some extent, and the City just happens to be the geography and the legislative regime that everybody operates in. \u201cIt&apos;s a lot less homogeneous than it used to be,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt&apos;s much more fragmented. There&apos;s no trade body, there&apos;s no single profession, the regulators have been fairly fragmented, and the client base is all different. I&apos;ve got hedge fund clients who are often managing money on behalf of very wealthy individuals. I&apos;ve got pension fund clients who are managing the retirement funds of shopfloor workers. The only thing that&apos;s homogeneous about it is that very little of it is consumer facing. It&apos;s all professional clients. There&apos;s a vague commitment to keeping London competitive as a financial centre, because that&apos;s in everyone&apos;s interest, but that&apos;s as close to esprit de corps as you get.\u201d   Hard Times interactive Interactive graphic: the divisive toll of the economic slump   The esprit de corps of the old bowler-hatted public-school City of the 1960s and 70s has gone. The US-born lawyer tells me that when he first came to the UK in the late 1980s, the City ran entirely on personal trust and had no regulation at all. \u201cIt shocked me coming from the US, where the securities markets [markets where assets such as stocks, bonds and futures are traded] had been regulated since the 1930s.\u201d He says deals were done with a handshake, and the lawyers drew up the contracts later. In the US it was always the other way round. That informality and sense of belonging to a club, in which the main sanction was the threat of being blackballed by your fellow members, largely disappeared with the restructuring (or rather destructuring) of the City that took place in 1986 \u2013 the so-called &quot;big bang&quot;, from which both London&apos;s dramatic rise as a global financial hub and the collapse of 2007-8 directly stem. The analyst says banks are now too big. \u201cMost banks are a series of silos,\u201d he says. \u201cThere&apos;s a fixed-income [government bonds] business, there&apos;s an equities [company shares] business, there&apos;s an advisory business, there&apos;s a fund management business, and they all operate with different regulators, different chinese walls, different operational requirements. In theory there&apos;s a synergy in having them all together, but in practice they&apos;re actually quite different institutions, and sometimes, in my more cynical moments, I think the only reason organisations get bigger is so the CEO can get paid more, because there&apos;s a strong correlation between the size of the organisation and how much money the CEO makes.\u201d He says that these multi-function banks, which have emerged since big bang, are impossibly complex. \u201cI look at our business and I think, how could one person understand a big, sophisticated international investment bank? It&apos;s almost impossible, particularly because the financial instruments have got a lot more complicated. With some of the financial instruments, you may be able to value them accurately today, but tomorrow it could be completely different. There are so many complicated things driving the valuation that no one can really understand what goes on, and the speed of trading makes it potentially very dangerous.\u201d In the age of high-frequency trading, where computers are increasingly making decisions with minimal human supervision, many insiders believe that, if there is another crash, the dominoes will fall even faster than last time. In 2008, chancellor Alistair Darling had 48 hours to make sure the ATMs didn&apos;t run out of cash. Next time the window may be a lot smaller (though optimists suggest it might be possible to program the computers to shut down if markets are in freefall). What is certain is that we are entering unknown territory, and that a future crash will take a different form from that of 2007-8.     The trading floor of the London Stock Exchange as the Big Bang reforms took effect in 1986. Photograph: PA    Big bang Justin and my dinner companions are denizens of the new City of London. This came into being on 27 October 1986, when the Thatcher government stripped away all the old rules and conventions governing financial life, in particular the brokers&apos; fixed commissions that had made it a closed shop, and heralded a revolution that became known as big bang. \u201cBig bang changed everything,\u201d says David Kynaston, author of a highly regarded four-volume history of the City. \u201cUntil then, the City was just the Square Mile, and in many ways it was a village.\u201d The governor of the Bank of England had almost papal powers and, it was said, could exert authority by arching an eyebrow. \u201cIt wasn&apos;t just that the financial centre was a physically much smaller place, which gave it a greater intimacy,\u201d says Kynaston. \u201cBusiness itself was conducted in a much more personal way, partly because institutions were smaller but also because markets were face to face. They became very impersonal with screen trading. There were also infinite personal connections. You had City families where one brother went off to a merchant bank and another brother went off to a discount house and another went to a stockbroking firm and so on. There was an intricate interconnected web of personal relationships.\u201d The upside \u2013 personal trading that bred the culture of \u201cmy word is my bond\u201d \u2013 had a downside: this really was a closed world of public school chaps who all knew each other, dined with each other, played golf or went shooting together, and earned a comfortable living because of the closed-shop practices that Margaret Thatcher, in the City as elsewhere, quite rightly set out to destroy. She ushered in a new, meritocratic world that is much more tolerant than the old City (where anti-semitism was endemic), but also made possible the takeover of the City by American banks in the 1980s and 90s, sweeping away most of the cautious old family-owned institutions and prepared the ground for the ultra-competitive anything-goes culture that produced the crash. In 2000 Philip Augar, a former high-flying City broker, wrote a book called The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism, which chronicled the end of the old City. Even then, long before the great reckoning of 2007-8, he had an inkling of what was in store. \u201cOwnership brings control and it is the City&apos;s lack of control over its own destiny that creates concern,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are good reasons to believe that ownership matters and that the consequences will appear in due course.\u201d When I meet Augar, he tells me that after a 20-year career in the City, which straddled big bang, he started to worry about what he saw going on around him. \u201cDuring the 90s I started to get very unhappy about what was happening in the City, and one reason I left NatWest [where he was head of global equities and bonds] was that it was running a full-blooded trading, market-making business, and I felt that was risky. I didn&apos;t like the model and moved to Schroders [which then had an investment bank] because it was a different kind of firm \u2013 family dominated, been around a long time \u2013 and had a number of very happy years there. But I was getting less enamoured about what was going on in the City \u2013 the culture, the business model, how level we were with people \u2013 and I had the idea that I would write about it.\u201d The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism, in some respects a lament for what had been lost, was the result. He says the book shocked people in the City. \u201cAt the time, the British-owned investment banks had blown up to the extent that they had sold themselves to foreign firms,\u201d he says. \u201cThe view at the time was, \u2018Hey, this is globalisation, that&apos;s what happens, and isn&apos;t it great.\u2019 But I took the view that it wasn&apos;t just about globalisation. There had been a lot of mismanagement in the City, and we needed to shine a light on that, and that&apos;s what the book tried to do. I also felt that no good would come of this. I felt that not having an indigenous investment banking industry would mean that the City would lose business. That bit was wrong. The bit that was right was that we would import the hard-charging American investment banking culture, which means conflict of interest, making money at the expense of everything and high leverage, by which I mean you borrow a huge amount of money to run your business.\u201d     Canary Wharf  (front) and the old City of London emerge from the fog. Photograph: Reuters/Metropolitan Police/MPS Helicopters    Augar&apos;s follow-up book, published just before the crash, was The Greed Merchants: How the Investment Banks Played the Free Market Game, which exposed the conflicts of interest at the heart of investment banks. \u201cI tried to explain how, by being able to act for the buyer and the seller in a deal, investment banks had an edge that gave them an advantage over every other market user. I saw that the culture was wrong and the business model was wrong, and that it was going to blow up somehow.\u201d He says that if he goes into investment banks or broking firms now, he realises he couldn&apos;t work in such an environment any more. \u201cI feel uncomfortable being in the City or Canary Wharf,\u201d he says, \u201cand overhearing conversations in coffee shops and wine bars.\u201d He finds \u201cthe certainty, the self-confidence, the reluctance to open up to alternative views\u201d depressing. \u201cThe view that you get is that there is just one way and ours is the right way. That view has started to soften around the edges, but hardcore City man and woman is still a very competitive alpha male/female focused on personal goals and some corporate goals. They still believe in the unfettered market economy, and I don&apos;t. I believe in the managed market, and that fundamental difference is why I had to stop.\u201d I wonder, given this philosophical divide from the culture of the City, how Augar coped in the two decades he spent at its heart. \u201cThe business model that was being run in the City then was fairly moderate,\u201d he says. \u201cThe conflicts of interest, the high leverage, the short-termism, those things weren&apos;t prevalent, and I felt for many years we were doing a good job for our customers, our shareholders and our staff and playing a responsible role in the economy at large. That started to change in the early 90s, and that was when I started to feel uneasy. I used to visit institutional shareholders with the then chief executive of NatWest, the late Derek Wanless, and I could see the pressure that they were putting him under. It felt wrong. It was all about results now, now, now, and if you fail to deliver we&apos;re going to shoot you, and eventually they did.\u201d He locates the start of the City&apos;s cultural transformation in the mid-90s. \u201cIt was the time when Morgan Stanley made a bid for SG Warburg [in 1994]. That started to tell you that the game was really beginning to change. The world that I&apos;d grown up in and was comfortable in was becoming something different.\u201d Big bang had triggered an even bigger bang. \u201cThe real watershed occurred in 1995,\u201d says Augar. \u201cIt was quite soon after the Barings debacle. Warburgs was forced into a merger, Kleinworts followed suit, Smith New Court sold themselves to Merrill Lynch. That opened the gates to the very highly leveraged, dangerous, risky model of trading, and after that everyone really went for it big time, all of which led to the banking crisis of 2007.\u201d Banks simply had too little capital to support the level of bad debts on their books, and without government bailouts many would have gone to the wall in 2007-8. Without a taxpayer-funded rescue, the bankers&apos; hubris would inevitably have been followed by nemesis. There&apos;s a great phrase that I hear again and again \u2013 \u201chaving your skin in the game\u201d. The old family-owned investment banks and stockbroking partnerships were dealing with their own money. The new conglomerates were not. The ecology of the old City made it much more small-scale and cautious. The post-big bang, post-consolidation City was expansionist and risk-taking, because the risks were being taken with someone else&apos;s money. Big bang ended the old nepotism, but introduced a form of financial despotism, when mega-banks \u2013 banks that in the end proved too be too big to fail \u2013 held the rest of society of ransom. In banking, small can be beautiful, but whether that old ecology can ever be recreated is highly doubtful. The global financial system is simply too interconnected. Putting &quot;moral hazard&quot; \u2013 the doctrine that says that if a bank makes a mistake, it pays for it \u2013 back into the system would be the single greatest step that could be taken in making the City more stable, but the Bank of England admits that we are still very far from achieving this. Banks are still too big to fail, and if there was another crash tomorrow the government would again have to step in to save the system from collapse. These days, the only skin in the game is the taxpayers&apos;.           Video analysis by Phillip Inman: the financial crisis, five years on    Evading responsibility  Meeting Kynaston and Augar was crucial to my understanding that, in a way, we were all responsible for the crash. We \u2013 the public, journalists, politicians \u2013 let it happen because we didn&apos;t challenge the City, didn&apos;t try to understand it. New Labour thought it had discovered a magic money-tree and gave up on regulation; journalists on the whole failed to read the runes or question the new macho expansionist, masters-of-the-universe culture; the public liked the easy credit and soaring house prices and was too lazy to examine what was happening in the City; and what naysayers and doom-mongers there were tended to be marginalised. Much of this remains true even today. Who understands the implications of George Osborne&apos;s great pensions reform, and who is bothering to find out what it means? Is the alleged collusion in foreign exchange trading getting the play it deserves? Do we understand the recent shake-up of personnel at the Bank of England, which saw the installation of a new head of financial stability?  The Financial Conduct Authority has been much in the news because of the bungled announcement of an investigation into pensions and other investments, but do you really understand where they fit into the complicated web of financial supervision that has been constructed in the wake of the crash? It&apos;s complicated, technical and needs a long-term commitment to telling the story. Most of the time we can&apos;t be bothered, even though the way the City behaves and regulates itself affects the lives of every one of us. \u201cThe City has always managed to evade its responsibilities because people find finance incomprehensible and boring,\u201d says Kynaston, \u201cand the City itself didn&apos;t do much to change that. In the 1870s, following the scandals that prompted Trollope to write The Way We Live Now, the Royal Commission on the Stock Exchange recommended that a viewing gallery be erected so that people could go and see what was happening in this place. The commission reported in 1878; the viewing gallery was erected 75 years later, in 1953.\u201d I approached the present-day stock exchange \u2013 now just a central supervisory office next to St Paul&apos;s Cathedral, as trading is done remotely from banks&apos; trading floors \u2013 for an interview and to observe the official start of trading at 8am (a visiting dignitary is sometimes allowed to sound the bell that declares trading open). The press office team were very friendly and sent me a very nice video of the Dominican ambassador opening trading in June last year, but I am still waiting for the interview. I was told I would receive a call to set up a visit and an interview with one of the executives. Three weeks later, I&apos;m still waiting. This remains a world fundamentally opposed to viewing galleries. A group of young activists inspired by the Occupy movement now do tours of the Square Mile, Canary Wharf and Mayfair. I joined the Mayfair tour one Sunday afternoon, and for two and a half hours we strolled around looking at the offices of all the hedge funds and investment companies in the area. What was most striking was that not a single one had a nameplate on the elegant building that housed them. They didn&apos;t want anyone to know they were there. There were about 20 people on the tour, which has to be booked online, and I got talking to a woman in her 20s. It&apos;s ridiculous, she told me, that finance isn&apos;t an integral part of the curriculum \u2013 both personal finance and the big-picture stuff about the City. She is of course right. How are we supposed to make decisions about our own finances \u2013 should I cash in my pension pot and buy that Lamborghini? \u2013 or even try to understand the City without a basic grounding? The Square Mile is run by the City of London Corporation, which traces its lineage back almost 1,000 years and prides itself on being like no other local authority. The Occupy activists see them as secretive and insular, as part of the problem. I found them efficient and eager to help, though I accept Occupy&apos;s point that they lack the democratic accountability of an ordinary local authority. The electorate is small \u2013 the 9,000 residents of the City and senior figures in the businesses that operate there; the electoral structure of wards, councillors, aldermen, sheriffs and, at the top, the lord mayor labyrinthine. The Occupy activists have a good deal of fun with the &quot;Remembrancer&quot;, a legal official from the corporation who represents the City&apos;s interests in the House of Commons and gets to sit behind the speaker&apos;s chair \u2013 a prime example, according to Occupy, of the overly close embrace of politics and big business. Canary Wharf, a private estate with a private security force, is even more of a closed world. It feels as if it could be anywhere in the world \u2013 Dubai, Singapore, Shanghai. Both the old City and the new are self-governing islands of wealth: not only not part of the UK but barely part of London. The fact that the Corporation of London has its own 800-strong police force, separate from the Met, emphasises that this is a world entire unto itself. The Square Mile grew up within London&apos;s old Roman wall, and that wall has become symbolic of its otherness and defensiveness. Most City buildings may be made of glass these days, but they are still far from transparent.     The City of London is a world unto itself. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Macho culture The Dutch writer Joris Luyendijk spent two years from 2011 to 2013 writing a blog for the Guardian about the City of London, and next spring will publish a book encapsulating his thoughts about this strange, secretive, self-contained world. The fact that he is an anthropologist by background has helped him delineate its tribes and rituals, and when we meet \u2013 in his favourite Turkish restaurant in north London \u2013 he tells me he has reached a counterintuitive conclusion about the inhabitants of the City. They are not masters of the universe, he insists; they are victims \u2013 clocking up 100 hours a week, working in an ultra-competitive environment, getting kicked out with just a few minutes to toss their possessions into a cardboard box if they can&apos;t hack it. \u201cHow they survive is by self-delusion,\u201d he argues. \u201cThey completely deny and ignore their own vulnerability.\u201d The City, he points out, is full of psychotherapists giving help to troubled financiers. \u201cThe bankers are the best-paid victims of a system that turns all of us into victims. The whole culture of always squeezing more growth and wealth out of something makes for a very totalitarian system where everybody&apos;s constantly after success.\u201d Luyendijk sees Canary Wharf as the empty heart of City life \u2013 towering offices, glitzy shops and a setting that (except for the dreary London weather) could be anywhere in the world. \u201cIt&apos;s the crassest illustration of the human condition in the 21st century,\u201d he says. He calls the working life of people in the City \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and says there is no evidence it has changed since the crash. \u201cThere is ripping off, where you lie to your clients. There is market rigging, where you lie to the central administration of Libor or forex. Then there is risking, where you lie to yourself about the risks you are taking or lie to your superior and then the regulator. And then there&apos;s rogue trading, where somebody hides their losses for a long time.\u201d Some banks are more predatory than others, but the prevailing culture remains short-termist. \u201cAs long as you can be out of the door in five minutes,\u201d he says, \u201cyour horizon is five minutes.\u201d A Dutchman like Luyendijk is horrified by such a culture. Dutch society is founded on social-democrat and Christian-democrat principles \u2013 long-term relationships based on trust rather than control \u2013 whereas the City now runs on anglo-American neoliberal rules of zero job security and control rather than trust. \u201cThe City of London is a little pocket of Hobbesian jungle,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don&apos;t think that&apos;s tenable in the long run.\u201d Luyendijk&apos;s critique is powerful, though it is rejected by most of those who work in the City. They accept the high-risk, high-reward structure, and say no one is forcing them to work there. But burn-out rates are undoubtedly high. In quitting after 20 years, Augar is by no means untypical. This is a world of ambitious young people on the make, and by the age of 50, especially on trading floors, you are ancient in City terms. Savvas Savouri, who has worked in the City for more than 20 years and is now a partner in a hedge fund that manages assets worth \u00a32.5bn, says the value placed on youth in the City is misguided. He also argues that the fact that many of the people entering the City have no financial qualifications \u2013 he speaks as someone who has an economics PhD and was an economics lecturer in the 1980s \u2013 is insane.  \u201cThe first thing you should ask anybody in this industry \u2013 very carefully, because they can get rubbed up the wrong way \u2013 is, \u2018Do you mind giving me your background?\u2019 Their instinct is to tell you where they&apos;ve worked, but you say, \u2018No, no, your education.\u2019 You&apos;ll be frightened by what you&apos;ll hear. You&apos;ll have professionals that have degrees in the humanities and the arts, and most recently engineers and physicists. I&apos;m not suggesting that those aren&apos;t laudable subjects, but they don&apos;t have an application in this industry. It&apos;s like asking someone who&apos;s trained as a mechanic to become a surgeon.\u201d In the course of a long conversation, in which he dismisses the veneration of the pre-big bang City as \u201cnostalgic crap\u201d, he keeps returning to this theme that the standard of people entering to the City has to be improved. \u201cWe are in the same state of development as medicine was before it was formalised,and you had to go and do a medical degree. In the old days, your dentist or your barber or your butcher was also your surgeon. We&apos;re still in that in finance, and that&apos;s why 2007-8 happened. Rather than regulate bonuses, regulate and manage the human capital that comes into it.\u201d     The City of London. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Russell Taylor has spent the past 25 years chronicling the ups and downs of City life through his cartoon character Alex, which started in 1987 in the London Daily News, migrated to the Independent when the LDN closed and currently trades in the Telegraph. He says he and cartoonist Charles Peattie concocted an archetypal monstrous, money-obsessed yuppie from their imaginations, and then, as they got to know the City better. were shocked to discover he really existed. \u201cI remember once talking to someone in the City about Alex and saying, \u2018Well, he&apos;s just a prat, isn&apos;t he?\u2019, and he said, \u2018But he&apos;s my hero, my role model.\u2019\u201d Taylor&apos;s view is that many of those who went into the City in the 70s and 80s drifted into the City, but that the new intake are totally committed. \u201cThe Alex generation [of the 1980s and 90s] has cleared the way for them morally by saying it&apos;s OK to be shallow. It&apos;s OK just to want money. You don&apos;t have to pretend that you want to save the world or write a protest song.\u201d Many observers believe that getting more women into the City, especially at board level, might help to curb the macho culture. There are a healthy percentage of women in law and human resources, but very few in trading or in the upper echelons of banking management. The analyst I met at dinner told me he had recently attended a meeting of almost 50 executives at his bank, only one of which was female \u2013 and even she had just returned from maternity leave. This remains a man&apos;s world, especially at the sharp end. At a breakfast discussion of women in the London economy at the office of the Centre for London thinktank, there is general agreement that anti-social hours and the culture of presenteeism in the City are barriers to women. There is a further problem, Diane Perrons, professor of gender studies at the London School of Economics, tells me after the discussion. \u201cWithin an organisation it&apos;s often very unclear what the progression structures are. Many of the mechanisms for promotion or pay increases are very opaque. What tends to happen is that people make judgements about other people&apos;s qualities in terms of leadership, dynamism, competitiveness, drive and so on, and they tend to be based on what one can think of as a kind of reciprocal recognition among peers. Other kinds of skills that may be important, more competitive, collaborative skills, are not really appreciated.\u201d They are the very skills, she says, that women are likely to have, but all too often they are ignored by male executives who tend to promote in their own image. Perrons describes research she did at a bank that said it wanted to change its working practices to encourage women, but found it very hard to do so. \u201cPeople at the lower levels of the organisation took advantage of leave schemes,\u201d she says, \u201cbut people higher up did not because of what were seen to be the negative effects of how they would be understood by the organisation.\u201d She says she had found no evidence that women were breaking into trading and other traditional male areas. Women do have one significant champion in the City \u2013 the Lord mayor, Fiona Woolf, only the second woman in more than 900 years to occupy that position. I meet her at the Mansion House, the lord mayor&apos;s residence close to the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England in the heart of the old City. Woolf is an energy lawyer, an area of relative female strength, but she recognises there are other areas where women are finding it hard to break in. \u201cThere are curious pockets where women are absent, like in asset management,\u201d she says. \u201cEven the law still has a long way to go. It has a long-hours culture, and measures success by the number of hours charged rather than the quality and efficiency of the output.\u201d \u201cWe want a much more diverse working culture, and we haven&apos;t got there yet,\u201d admits the accountant with whom I have dinner. \u201cPersonally, I think we should have quotas, and we should start at every promotion stage and fill them half male and half female. We have 50% male and 50% female at graduate level, but by the time you get up to senior management level we&apos;re 70:30. That&apos;s because we don&apos;t try to create the working environment that accommodates being a working mother.\u201d But getting more women in the City is unlikely to be a panacea. \u201cThe chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers was a woman,\u201d the lawyer points out drily. The analyst is also sceptical that more women in the City would have averted the crash, arguing that the problem is not too few women at the top, but too many traders. \u201cNever let a trader run a bank,\u201d he says emphatically. Traders are instinctive gamblers, and, as the crash showed, when banks place huge bets the most likely losers are the rest of us.     Bank bailouts compared. Click for a larger image. Graphic: Paul Scruton    After the crash Has anything really changed since the crash of 2007-8? That&apos;s the trillion-dollar question. Have lessons been learned in the City? Can the culture truly be said to have changed? Can we trust the new system of regulation? Some insiders argue that there are encouraging signs of a cultural shift, but plenty of others are sceptical. My most worrying encounter is with a derivatives trader who trades interest rate futures. He insists behaviour is as bad as ever, supervision as lax and, with increasingly high-frequency trading, the market even more unstable than it was in 2007-8.  \u201cThere is no morality in the City,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThere is no justice, no law, it&apos;s ruled by Billy the Quid, it&apos;s a free-for-all. There are fewer colourful bankers hanging out in chatrooms calling themselves &apos;the Cartel&apos; these days. Now it&apos;s mathematicians and computer scientists programming algorithms from the Czech Republic. The Financial Conduct Authority no longer have any control over these foreign-based hedge funds.\u201d The trader says misbehaviour is endemic. \u201cIf you&apos;re in an environment where misbehaviour is taking place, it&apos;s accepted. For example, with Libor if you were there you would have to have done it. If you didn&apos;t do it, they [your employer] would have said &apos;What&apos;s your fucking problem? Out.&apos; You&apos;d have been fired. There is an ongoing manipulation of interest rate futures on a scale much larger than Libor. We all know it&apos;s going on, we see it every day, we&apos;ve reported it and it&apos;s been brushed under the carpet.\u201d He claims algorithms and trading from overseas make rigging easier, the regulators are weak, and the exchanges are primarily interested in the volume of trading. The picture he paints is nightmarish. Luyendijk is convinced that the steps taken so far in terms of regulation and reining in bonuses are a charade. He argues that both banking and politics are run by mutually supportive cartels, and that the status quo is inherently unstable. I ask him for his prescription. He replies with a counter-question. \u201cCan you have global finance without global government? And if you don&apos;t want global government, what do you do about global finance?\u201d He says the banks are so large and powerful that they have co-opted politicians and academics, and despite the shock to the system in 2007-8 have now reverted to global business as usual. \u201cThe way the economics profession have washed their hands of all this is quite astonishing,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the global issue I don&apos;t have a solution. I really don&apos;t know whether you can have global finance without global government, and I don&apos;t want global government. But various steps [worth taking] would be that credit rating agencies should not be paid by the banks they rate, and accountancy firms should not make lots of money through consultancy to banks whose books they audit. It&apos;s deeply incestuous.\u201d Savouri says the conflicts and overlaps will get worse, as accountancy and legal firms, eyeing the investment banks&apos; fat fees in merger deals, start to develop banking arms of their own. He may not be nostalgic for the ordered pre-big bang City, but he doesn&apos;t seem too enamoured of the chaotic of the one that has emerged since, though he does say that, with so much misinformation and mismanagement, a hedge fund which knows what it&apos;s doing and can sort through the rubbish can find that edge which everyone in the City is pursuing. Luyendijk rejects the whole system \u2013 a tempting, if impractical, position. Lobby group CityUK \u2013 another organisation that was reluctant to grant me an interview \u2013 likes to point out that financial services account for 8% of UK GDP and almost 12% of tax revenues. It also claims almost 2 million people work in finance and associated professional services, though that figure is largely meaningless as it will include large numbers of lowly paid workers in high street banks \u2013 not really part of the City by any proper definition. Justin sees high street banks as corner-shop operations compared with the investment banking titans. A more relevant figure might be that the old City and Canary Wharf each has around 45,000 fully fledged bankers. But even allowing for CityUK&apos;s inflation of the real figures, this is not a sector that can be dismantled without taking the UK economy down with it. Reform and some degree of disaster-proofing seem the only answer. My three dinner companions are, however, doubtful whether that can be achieved. \u201cYou always solve the problems that you don&apos;t have any more when you try to do these things,\u201d says the lawyer. \u201cWe&apos;re just bolting the stable after the horse has gone,\u201d says the analyst. \u201cGreater regulation won&apos;t future-proof the industry. It just pushes up the cost of doing business.\u201d So what should have happened, I ask him? \u201cWe should have sent more people to jail. Not enough senior people were put to the sword.\u201d \u201cAnd more banks should have been allowed to go bust,\u201d chimes in the accountant. \u201cI&apos;d have let them all go, personally.\u201d Andrew Hilton, the affable director of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, takes a similar line, arguing that moral hazard is the only way to ensure the operation of a free market. Hilton says the answer is to have less regulation rather than more, and to let the failures go to the wall. \u201cBig banks like regulation,\u201d he explains. \u201cRegulation is a fixed cost, so the bigger you are, the more clout you have to amortise [spread] it over. It favours the big over the small, and is another row of bricks in the wall that keeps competition out. You may complain like hell about it, but in the end you like it because it preserves your oligopolistic position. There isn&apos;t a single regulator in the world who has ever advanced his or her career by letting a bank go broke, so the answer to every problem for a regulator is a regulation, like a carpenter and a nail. So you have an ineluctable tendency for regulators to regulate more and more, and for banks to get bigger and bigger. We&apos;re in a cul de sac, and heading for gridlock in the financial system.\u201d Hilton welcomes the growth of hedge funds and what he calls the \u201cshadow banking\u201d sector because the institutions are smaller, more flexible, less closely regulated and can be allowed to go under. \u201cThey may be very loathsome people,\u201d he says, \u201cand I&apos;d want to count my fingers after I&apos;d shaken hands with some of them, but the model is good because these guys have their own money at risk and they&apos;re not too big too fail.\u201d Hilton hopes this shadow banking sector will grow \u2013 though not so much that the institutions in it start to pose their own systemic risk \u2013 and also believes peer-to-peer lending will expand, with internet marketplaces matching entrepreneurs and private investors. Everyone, except Justin the investment banker who blames two uppity Scottish banks, recognises that, in the years leading up to 2007-8, thinking in the City was suicidally short-termist. \u201cThere was so much emphasis on what you delivered this year,\u201d says one City insider. \u201cI can remember times when bosses in banks and hedge funds would turn around and say, \u2018You&apos;re just not performing well enough this year. If you&apos;re not performing by the end of the year, you&apos;re fired.\u2019 Some guy would come through and make a load of money and he&apos;d be hailed as the new star trader, but it was just that he was on the right side of whatever wave was striking the markets that year. I&apos;ve seen a number of people do really well one year and then do terribly the next year, but because of the asymmetric nature of the bonuses you might get a million euros one year and nothing the next, but you&apos;ve still got 500,000 euros a year.\u201d James Barty, strategy director at the British Bankers&apos; Association, insists the City is now being more rational about remuneration. \u201cSalaries have gone up, and bonuses [the analyst at dinner insisted on calling them \u2018variable pay\u2019] have been deferred.\u201d You can take some of the bonus, but the rest is kept back in case you perform poorly in subsequent years. If you &quot;blow up&quot;, to use the argot of the City, your anticipated bonus will not be paid, or it will be much reduced. In theory, it reduces risk-taking, makes traders take a more long-term view, and is also a way of ensuring loyalty among staff. \u201cIt changes behaviour,\u201d says Barty. \u201cIf you say, \u2018I got a really good bonus last year, but I&apos;m either going to get zero or possibly get fired this year if I don&apos;t make enough money,\u2019 you&apos;re incentivised to roll the dice because you&apos;ll think, \u2018If I lose \u20ac5m I&apos;ll get fired and if I lose \u20ac10m I&apos;ll get fired.\u2019 But if you say to somebody, \u2018OK, you made \u20ac20m last year, you&apos;re down \u20ac5m this year, we&apos;re going to claw back a little bit of your bonus but if you go to down \u20ac20m we&apos;re going to claw back everything,\u2019 it changes people&apos;s behaviour, and that&apos;s a very healthy thing to happen.\u201d     A worker walks away from the Canary Wharf office of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 when the 158-year-old Wall Street firm sought bankruptcy protection. Photograph: Andrew Winning/Reuters    Regulatory failures The other key contributor to the crash was the failure of the new system of regulation set up by the Labour government. \u201cThe regulators didn&apos;t do their job properly,\u201d says one former hedge fund manager. \u201cThe Bank of England got away with murder, Mervyn King [the then governor] in particular. There is some evidence that the Bank of England saw some of the problems coming, but if it saw some of the problems coming why did it not say to RBS when it was going to buy ABN Amro [the Dutch bank which helped bring RBS down], \u2018You are our biggest bank, we&apos;re worried about the stability of the financial system, we cannot allow you to take an acquisition like this, which is going to leverage you up so much that you will put the UK economy at risk\u2019? \u201cA whole bunch of us in the City in 2007 were saying, \u2018Why is RBS still trying to buy ABN Amro?\u2019 because everyone knew that ABN Amro was probably the worst and most leveraged bank in Europe, with lots of horrible stuff on its balance sheet. RBS should either not have been allowed to buy it, or the regulators should have insisted they raise equity to buy it. They were allowed to fund the acquisition with debt, which is why RBS had so little equity to absorb the losses. That should never have been allowed to happen.\u201d The Financial Services Authority carried the can for the regulatory failures, and has now been replaced by two regulators (which are costing \u00a3128m a year more to run than the FSA, according to recent figures). The Prudential Regulation Authority, which operates under the Bank of England&apos;s umbrella, is responsible for the financial health of the banks, building societies, insurers and investment companies. The Financial Conduct Authority concentrates on the way they behave and how they treat their customers. Critics of the quality of regulators say they have difficulty dealing on equal terms with highly paid City professionals. There is also a risk that staff, who tend to earn a lot less than the people they are supposed to be regulating, will be poached, especially at a time when in-house compliance officers are multiplying. This need to show they can compete on level terms may be why the FCA&apos;s office in Canary Wharf is so imposing. The reception area is vast, and the scanners and TVs make it feel like an airport. The reception staff are efficient and keep calling me by my first name. There is a sense that the new organisation is trying very hard. I am here to meet Clive Adamson, the FCA&apos;s director of supervision. Like many at the FCA, he used to work at the FSA, but that was then. This is year zero in bank regulation terms \u2013 a fresh beginning. \u201cA real breakdown in trust has occurred,\u201d he says, \u201cand we have to restore that trust.\u201d He accepts the regulators were, as the cliche has it, \u2018&quot;asleep at the wheel&quot;. \u201cThere was so much froth in the financial system that we didn&apos;t spot where the froth was leading too. Financial engineering, over-leverage, a lack of capital in the system, no real liquidity, banks taking on too much risk. While everything looked good, it looked good, and nobody really spotted the elephant in the room. In the UK it was unclear who was really responsible [for the well-being of the system], the central bank or the regulator, and because the regulator was too over-stretched and had too broad a remit, it was insufficiently focused on those issues.\u201d Can we now be confident the regulator is awake at the wheel and knows an elephant when it lumbers into the boardroom? \u201cThere have been several key changes,\u201d says Adamson. \u201cThe regulator has been split into two. The PRA looks at individual firms&apos; financial robustness and works out if they fail, how would they fail? The Bank of England&apos;s financial policy committee looks at the system as a whole. And the FCA has a very clear remit about consumer protection, market integrity and competition, which is all about making markets work well for the benefit of consumers. By splitting it in that way, we can be much more focused. \u201cThe other key thing that&apos;s changed is that we now put the interests of the consumer at the heart of what we do. Historically, we focused more on firms, but now we are focused on the consumer. Thirdly, we&apos;ve changed culturally. We are much more forward-looking and pre-emptive now, and want to act quicker when we see things. We don&apos;t always want to be fighting the last battle. Conduct regulation tends to be very reactive, dealing with things when they&apos;ve happened and trying to clear the mess up, as opposed to asking what the next mess is going to be and trying to stop it before it happens. That in essence is what we are now trying to do, and it&apos;s very difficult.\u201d The light-touch regulation beloved of the Blair-Brown governments has now been abandoned, but Andrew Hilton at the CSFI will be pleased to hear that Adamson is wary of going too far. \u201cIt&apos;s a real issue how to get the balance right,\u201d he admits, \u201cbecause what we don&apos;t want to do is to be so intrusive that we stop markets developing. That&apos;s partly why we have a competition objective \u2013 to make markets work better.\u201d He says the stability of the financial system can never be guaranteed. \u201cYou can&apos;t disaster-proof. What we can do is reduce the risk of something going wrong. We can&apos;t eliminate the risk. And if we did try to eliminate the risk with ever tougher regulation, by for example prudentially demanding more and more capital and from a conduct perspective being much more prescriptive on products, the costs would be too high.\u201d I ask Adamson whether he believes the culture in the City has changed since the crash. \u201cI think it&apos;s changing,\u201d he says after a moment&apos;s hesitation. \u201cThat&apos;s the biggest issue of all \u2013 to change both the corporate culture and individual attitudes. In our experience when bad things have happened, whether it&apos;s financial problems or big conduct issues like PPI [payment protection insurance], in virtually all cases there&apos;s an aspect of the culture in the firm that&apos;s wrong. Either the incentive system is wrong, or the people at the top didn&apos;t know what was happening. So we think very strongly that in order for less bad things to happen in the future, the culture and behaviour in the firms have to support doing the right thing, and that&apos;s difficult to change.\u201d     Workers in the Canary Wharf business district. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters    Towards an ethical City In 2010, the lobby group CityUK brought together 21 young professionals from banking, asset management, accountancy, insurance and the law to write a manifesto for the future of the City. Called Next Generation Vision, its conclusions were eminently sensible. Its mantra was that financial services should be \u201ca part of society, not apart from society\u201d \u2013 Venice needed to engage with Mestre.  The document produced by the 21 called for \u201ca standardised, formalised moral code to encompass the industry as a whole\u201d; \u201cremuneration based on the long-term value created\u201d; greater transparency and accountability in an effort to regain trust; and \u201can independently audited annual report assessing the wide-ranging aspects of the contribution of our industry to society\u201d. It also called for industry to \u201cwork with the appropriate education experts and bodies to establish an enhanced programme of lifelong financial education and assistance, embedded into our school curriculum and beyond\u201d. All laudable aims that, if acted on, could transform the relationship of the City and wider society, which at the moment, if it can be said to exist at all, is a combustible mixture of incomprehension, envy and loathing. I have breakfast with Alan Mak, a 30-year-old corporate lawyer turned private investor who was one of the co-authors of the Next Generation Vision, and ask him why he got involved. \u201cIt&apos;s about generation Y, the next generation of leaders in the City, setting out a vision for what they think it should be like in 10 to 15 years,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt&apos;s not a minute blueprint of everything that should happen; it&apos;s more a vision of how things should be: an ethical marketplace that is tied to society; a sector that should be successful but should also help businesses, communities and families.\u201d Mak&apos;s background has shaped his proselytising mission. His parents were Hong Kong Chinese who came to the UK in the 1960s, and he grew up in Yorkshire. They were poor but very ambitious for their son, who studied law at Cambridge and joined a big City law firm, which nominated him for the Next Generation Vision project. He is also a Christian, and the combination of his religion and the deprivation he experienced as a child gives him a strong moralising mission. \u201cThe City has to be successful \u2013 it employs hundreds of thousands of people, provides the finance for hundreds of thousands of businesses, and keeps food on the table for hundreds of thousands of families \u2013 but those who are successful in it have a duty to use that success to benefit others. There was a sense in the crash that certain parts of the sector had become detached from wider society.\u201d He also emphasises that the City is unique among industries in that it is systemic. It has the power to take every other business down with it, so unethical activity in the City poses society-wide dangers. In a lecture at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral to mark the publication of his biography of the great financier Siegmund Warburg in 2010, the historian Niall Ferguson spelt out the need for an ethical reawakening in the City. \u201cThe real lesson of history is that regulation alone is not the key to financial stability,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, over-complicated regulation can be the disease it purports to cure, by encouraging a culture of box-ticking \u2018compliance\u2019 rather than individual moral judgment ... What is more important is to instil in financial professionals the kind of ethical framework that was the basis of Siegmund Warburg&apos;s life and work. \u2018Success from the financial and from the prestige point of view is not enough,\u2019 Warburg told his fellow directors in 1959. \u2018What matters even more is constructive achievement and adherence to high moral and aesthetic standards in the way in which we do our work.\u2019\u201d Warburg, the king of the old City, died in 1982, just as the new anything-goes culture was about to destroy it. Take a short walk down Cheapside from the Bank of England and you come to St Paul&apos;s Cathedral. In the City, God and mammon are intimately connected. On virtually every street corner, there&apos;s a gorgeous church designed by Christopher Wren to fill the gaps after the great fire of 1666, which destroyed the medieval city. Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein once claimed he and his fellow bankers were \u201cdoing God&apos;s work\u201d, and, judging by the way banks and churches sit cheek by jowl, the City seems to take the same view. St Paul&apos;s has its own chinese wall, with contentious political and economic issues dealt with by the St Paul&apos;s Institute, which, according to its website, exists \u201cto engage the financial world with questions of morality and ethics\u201d. Until 2011 it was run by Canon Giles Fraser (now a parish priest in south London and a Guardian columnist), but he resigned in October of that year because he disagreed with the cathedral&apos;s decision to evict the Occupy protesters camped all round the great church. \u201cI would have wanted to negotiate down the size of the camp and to have appealed to people to help us keep the cathedral going,\u201d Fraser said at the time, \u201cand if that meant that I was thereby granting them some legal right to stay then that is the position that I would have to wear.\u201d     Occupy London demonstrators outside St Paul's Cathedral in 2011. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    Since Fraser&apos;s resignation, the institute has been overseen by Peter Selby, the former bishop of Worcester and author of Grace and Mortgage: The Language of Faith and the Debt of the World, though a new full-time director will be appointed later this year. Selby is a thoughtful, articulate 72-year-old with a wonderfully sonorous episcopal voice, and all through our conversation at the cathedral, I feel he wants to be more radical in his prescriptions for remaking the City than the institute&apos;s rules of engagement allow him to be. Selby tells me the institute surveyed financial professionals in the City, and that he was struck by the apparently contradictory findings the survey threw up. \u201cIt goes to the heart of many of the questions you are raising,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo thirds of the people that were surveyed said financial-sector professionals were overpaid, and two thirds of them also said they were in it for the money. If you draw a Venn diagram, you can see that there are a significant number of people who are in it for the money and feel the profession is overpaid, which I think is the kind of conscientious difficulty that the church ought to be sticking a crowbar into and prising open.\u201d The conflicted nature of the respondents to the survey may be another aspect of the self-delusion that Luyendijk pinpoints as a feature of City life. The bishop highlights another feature of the survey. \u201cMore than half of them said the big bang had contributed to a decline in ethical standards. Given the almost universal acceptance at the time of the necessity of deregulation, that&apos;s also an intriguing area in which we need to insert ourselves. How can a huge community of people say that the work [they do] is absolutely necessary and wrong?\u201d So what needs to change? \u201cThe prescriptions are very hotly debated,\u201d says Selby, \u201cand most of them in my view don&apos;t go to the heart of the matter. The real question is how far the City is connected with and deeply committed to the real economy of people&apos;s actual work. The difference between the virtual and the real economy is another crucial area in which we need to work. The virtual economy is entirely about numbers and money, and that&apos;s what led us to the abyss.\u201d I ask him how Jesus would have dealt with the City. I don&apos;t get a direct response to this question, but there&apos;s not much doubt Selby would want to take a hard line with the moneylenders. \u201cWe have to say to certain people, \u2018What you just said doesn&apos;t tally with what you just did. And this is not being said to you because we want to condemn you personally. It&apos;s the system that is leading you into these contradictions.\u2019\u201d A few days before coming to St Paul&apos;s, I had met a leading figure from a Christian charity who recalled having lunch with a banker friend high up in the executive dining room of a City office. \u201cWe are buying that company tomorrow,\u201d the banker had told him, pointing to a building far below, \u201cand most of the staff will have to be sacked.\u201d \u201cThat&apos;s terrible,\u201d the man from the charity said to his friend. \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d \u201cIt&apos;s the will of the bank,\u201d said the banker. The charity man told me he had tried to unpick what that phrase meant, and had found it impossible to discover who had made the decision. The bank had become an impersonal entity, almost literally with a will of its own. The story and the phrase had stayed with me, and I put it to Selby that this was crucial to the dehumanised way in which the City tended to operate. He cites Vince Cable&apos;s recent criticism of the bankers for saying they feel they have to earn multimillion-pound salaries because all their peers in other banks do \u2013 a feeble reason, Selby (and indeed Cable) thinks. Selby&apos;s colleague, Canon Mark Oakley, who has overall responsibility for the institute and has joined our meeting, makes a wider point: \u201cThat picture you describe says so much about the anger of a lot of people. Money represents a huge source of power that is seemingly out of democratic control, and that gets us nervous. But if something is out of democratic control in a democracy, it&apos;s a political problem.\u201d \u201cIt&apos;s worse than that,\u201d adds Selby. \u201cIt&apos;s not only out of control. It&apos;s in control of the things it should be being controlled by.\u201d Oakley is right: only the politicians can really get to grips with the City and decide what part it should play in our national life. But do they have the will to do so? The Vickers and Tyrie commissions, set up in the wake of the crash to look at both the way banks operated and the culture within them, have made a series of sensible suggestions \u2013 dividing investment banking from retail banking; making bank executives personally responsible for scandals such as Libor; deferring bonuses; protecting whistleblowers \u2013 but there has no fundamental questioning of the role of the City in our lives, and we are now more or less back to business as usual. As David Kynaston points out, the City scandals of the 1870s produced a royal commission; why wasn&apos;t there one this time? Many of the people who work there deny it, but the City does feel like a separate, self-contained world, protecting its age-old rights, wary of intruders. The Occupy activists told me that, when I visited the Mansion House to meet the lord mayor, I should look at the stained-glass window in the dining room where the chancellor makes his annual speech. It shows Wat Tyler, leader of the Peasant&apos;s Revolt in 1381, being slain by the then lord mayor, William Walworth. One doesn&apos;t necessarily want to take sides in that 600-year-old battle between property and privilege, but I did wonder if replacing it might be one symbolic way for the City to mark a fresh beginning in its relationship with the peasants who exist outside its gilded world. \u2022 Stephen Moss on why Russians are obsessed with London", "tags": ["Cities", "Business", "London", "Financial crisis", "Banking", "Economics", "Financial sector", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-27T08:37:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice/2014/may/27/china-scrap-millions-cars-reduce-air-pollution", "sentences": ["Up to 333,000 will be taken off the roads in the capital Beijing and 160,000 in Shanghai.", "The cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guiyang and Tianjin also limit the number of new vehicles registered each year."], "title": "China to scrap millions of cars  to ease pollution| Jennifer Duggan", "article": "The Chinese government has announced plans to take up to 6 million vehicles that don\u2019t meet emission standards off the roads by the end of the year, in a bid to reduce the country\u2019s air pollution problems. The move is part of a plan published by China\u2019s cabinet, the State Council, which outlined emission targets for a number of industries over the next two years. The State Council said that some pollution targets are not being met for the 2011-2013 period and that action needs to be stepped up.  China is facing a \u201ctough situation\u201d in hitting its targets for energy and emissions for 2015, Xu Shaoshi, Chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission was quoted by state media.  One fifth of the vehicles to be scrapped will be in the northern regions of China, which have been the worst hit with air pollution. Hebei province, where seven of China\u2019s smoggiest cities are located, has been ordered to scrap 660,000 cars that don\u2019t meet emission standards. Up to 333,000 will be taken off the roads in the capital Beijing and 160,000 in Shanghai.  More vehicles will be scrapped next year with up to 5 million being removed from the roads of highly developed regions including the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the smog-choked region of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. \u201cStrengthening control on vehicle emissions will be a major agenda item for the country\u2019s energy savings, emissions reductions, and low-carbon development during the next two years,\u201d the plan said.  According to the state news agency, Xinhua, removing these older vehicles from the roads will help China to meet some of its green targets such as reducing energy consumption, and will also help to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide by 2% a year and emissions of nitrogen oxides by 5% per year.  The Ministry of Environmental Protection said that 7.8% of cars on China\u2019s roads do not meet the minimum national standards. According to figures published by Xinhua, 31.1% of air pollution in Beijing comes from vehicle exhaust emissions.  A number of Chinese cities have started restricting vehicle licenses as a way of reducing car use. The city of Hangzhou recently restricted the number of new car licenses it issues and will only issue new plates via an auction and lottery. The cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guiyang and Tianjin also limit the number of new vehicles registered each year.  According to the plan issued by the State Council, the government will also reduce coal consumption and introduce more green technologies. Xu Shaoshi was quoted in state media saying that a report will be published monthly on how regions are carrying out energy reductions.  The State Council also issued guidelines to increase food safety. In a statement, it said that there will be more measures taken to deal with soil and water pollution. There will also be punishment for those who are found to be using banned pesticides.  Tackling pollution has become a top priority for the Chinese government. Years of rapid economic development have left the country with high levels of air, soil and water pollution.  The often hazardous levels of air pollution in some cities regularly make headlines worldwide. While a recent government report estimated that 20% of the country\u2019s farmland is polluted and the land and resources ministry has said that nearly 60% of groundwater is polluted.

The Geneva-based Richemont is asking the industry to police the sale of its goods using a similar system of injunctions to the one that blocks websites offering pirated music and films.

Since 2012, legal pressure has forced British broadband providers to routinely take down links to websites offering illegal downloads of games, books, music, films and television series. Once judges have been persuaded that an organisation such as The Pirate Bay is breaching copyright, any future internet addresses associated with it are simply added to the banned list and can be blocked without a new court ruling. Richemont is understood to be arguing that under section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, broadband companies should be subject to piracy-style injunctions when trademarks are breached. Gareth Mead, a spokesperson for Virgin Media said: &quot;This claim raises untested legal issues and we believe it should be carefully scrutinised by the courts.&quot; A spokesman for BT said: &quot;We&apos;re fully supportive of trademark and copyright protection, however we believe a thorough review should be given to any such requests that could affect online content. We&apos;re reviewing the claim and will respond in due course.&quot; The case follows the settlement in February of a seven-year battle by the French cosmetics company L&apos;Or\u00e9al, which sought to have counterfeits of its brands removed from eBay. The European court of justice said in 2011 that eBay was not exempt from liability if it had knowledge and control over information about infringing items on its sites. Toby Headdon, an intellectual property expert at Berwin Leighton Paisner, said: &quot;This is all about a big tussle that is taking place between rights owners and internet service providers about who has to bear responsibility for tackling all this activity online. The pendulum is swinging in favour of the rights owners now.&quot; On a site such as eBay, where some counterfeit goods appear alongside of millions of legitimate items, injunctions will be difficult to impose. Experts say the case could also have implications for websites selling medicines across borders that may be protected by patent in one country, but generic in another. Killock said: &quot;It&apos;s better to simply prosecute the company involved and understand what they are doing. Injunctions of this sort are half measures because they don&apos;t stop the company involved from existing and operating, and the people potentially being criminalised aren&apos;t necessarily being heard.&quot;", "tags": ["Luxury goods sector", "Business", "Online shopping", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "eBay", "Internet", "Technology", "Broadband"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-29T17:25:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/30/city-links-can-hacking-end-homelessness", "sentences": ["Our roundup of the week&apos;s best city stories addresses ways to solve homelessness, as well as &quot;solar roads&quot; and even pavements; we also take a look at the antics of Shanghai&apos;s elite clubbers and learn the fate of a condemned \u2013 yet much-loved \u2013 factory in New York.", "Shanghai&apos;s elite Jaeger bombs, contortionists and &quot;champagne wars&quot;: this gallery from Al Jazeera immerses us in the extravagant world of the Shanghai clubbing scene, where the city&apos;s young elite spend as much as \u00a332,000 on their nightly bar tab."], "title": "Can hacking end homelessness?", "article": "Our roundup of the week&apos;s best city stories addresses ways to solve homelessness, as well as &quot;solar roads&quot; and even pavements; we also take a look at the antics of Shanghai&apos;s elite clubbers and learn the fate of a condemned \u2013 yet much-loved \u2013 factory in New York.

Hacking homelessness Tomorrow is Civic Hacking Day, where citizens across the world will come together to propose inventive technological solutions to our biggest urban challenges. One of the most significant problems in cities is homelessness: a recent Hack to End Homelessness event in Seattle explored how data could be used to tackle homelessness through mapping, outreach, advocacy and education. These maps on Fast Co.Exist reveal the extent of the problem in the US; cities with the most homeless people are Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Honolulu and Orlando.  What hacks would improve life in your city? Let us know on Twitter and follow #hackforchange this weekend \u2013 we&apos;ll be there, too, so say hello. Shanghai&apos;s elite Jaeger bombs, contortionists and &quot;champagne wars&quot;: this gallery from Al Jazeera immerses us in the extravagant world of the Shanghai clubbing scene, where the city&apos;s young elite spend as much as \u00a332,000 on their nightly bar tab. These &quot;hedonistic new rich ... are busy re-cementing the city&apos;s reputation as home to some of the world&apos;s most decadent nightlife&quot;. Yet while the parties rage, deep economic inequalities among the country&apos;s citizens persist. Solar roadways What if roads could actually be a sustainable source of energy? In Idaho, a couple have prototyped a solar roadway, with a surface consisting purely of hexagonal solar panels. If rolled out on a large scale, these innovative road surfaces could generate vital energy for a growing population. But it doesn&apos;t stop there: pavements, too, could generate power simply by using our footsteps. Plan your city How do you involve people in planning a city? As this article from The City Fix tells us, cities are using new strategies to engage their (largely younger) residents, from hashtags to parties on trains. Social media platforms and apps are enabling citizens to have their say in urban development and report problems to their local government. But how can we be sure this will lead to practical action? &quot;It must be remembered too,&quot; the article notes, &quot;that there are still many demographics that cannot afford smart phones, and planners must work to ensure that all residents\u2019 voices are heard.&quot; Sweet industry Last month, the New York City Council approved a $1.5bn redevelopment of the Domino Sugar Factory in Brooklyn. A well-known part of the city&apos;s heritage, the factory will be demolished to make way for 2,000-odd luxury apartments. The local community organised a petition, unsuccessfully, to stop the redevelopment, protesting the &quot;adverse effects of overdevelopment in cities today&quot;. Before the bulldozers move in, the New Yorker presents David Allee&apos;s beautiful and melancholy images of the abandoned spaces and deteriorating machinery that once powered the largest sugar refinery in the world. The world&apos;s coolest roofs We&apos;re not talking about roof parties here: a &quot;cool roof&quot; is one with a white surface that bounces sunlight back into the atmosphere, potentially lessening the urban &quot;heat island&quot; effect and offsetting global warming. This Next City article says recent calculations claim installing cool roofs across hot cities could be &quot;roughly equivalent to taking half of the world\u2019s approximately 600 million cars off the road for 20 years&quot;.

Tim Cahill Australia&apos;s most famous football face in Brazil almost never played for the Socceroos. At the age of 14, he was picked for the Samoa national team with his brother, Chris. A family man, Cahill explained later that it was a good chance to get an all-expenses paid trip to visit his sick grandmother in Samoa. While Chris Cahill went on to captain Samoa, Tim took Fifa to court to play for Australia. He missed gaining experience in Australian youth teams, but when Fifa changed their eligibility rules in 2003, Tim was theoretically able to choose to represent five different national teams. Thankfully for Australia, he chose the country of his birth. Speaking of youth development, every one of Cahill&apos;s junior clubs now squabbles over his legacy. Sydney United, the Croatian backed club in Sydney&apos;s western suburbs, have Twitter battles with Sydney Olympic, a Greek-backed side from a little further south, while Belmore Hercules also chimes in from time to time. Millwall, Cahill&apos;s first club in England, must look at it all with bemusement. Bloody convicts. Speaking of convicts, the Cahill Expressway in Sydney, named after a former New South Wales Premier Joseph Cahill, was briefly renamed the Tim Cahill Expressway in June 2013. Jason Davidson The little-known Jason Davidson plays in the Netherlands for Heracles Almelo. His father Alan was also a Socceroo, part of several squads during the 1980s, and was named as part of the greatest ever Australian team in 2012. Not that he sat back and let his dad&apos;s reputation help him coast by. At the age of 14 he was sent to an elite Tokyo boarding school \u2013 his grandmother is Japanese \u2013 specialising in football. He was a minute late for his first training session and as punishment had his head shaved \u2013 along with all those of his team-mates. Davidson cried every day at the start of his time in Japan but said it helped him toughen up. &quot;It was hell,&quot; he later told the Melbourne Age. &quot;There were guys that got broken noses and all sorts of injuries by the coaches. In a way, I was lucky.&quot; Mile Jedinak Werrington Croatia&apos;s favourite son, Mile Jedinak is the only Australian who has started regularly for his club in the Premier League. As more young Australians move to Holland, Germany and various Asian leagues, Jedinak is holding it down for Aussies in England with Crystal Palace. It is an unlikely rise to fame. Overlooked initially by the new A-League clubs in 2005, Jedinak played for Sydney United in the NSW state leagues before earning a contract with Central Coast Mariners in 2006. Nicknamed &apos;Inspector Gadget Legs&apos; by his former coach at the Mariners, Lawrie McKinna, Jedinak led the Premier League table of tackles and interceptions last season. Mat Ryan Ryan won all there was to win with the Central Coast Mariners. In just three seasons at the club Ryan won two premierships, a grand final, the goalkeeper of the year award and the young footballer of the year gong twice in a row. With the retirement of Mark Schwarzer from international duty \u2013 Ryan had a poster of Schawarzer on his wall as a boy \u2013 and Ryan&apos;s recent good form at Club Brugge, it dovetails nicely for the young goalkeeper to start in Brazil. Rumour was he was being scouted by Real Madrid, although it appears his former coach, Graham Arnold, might have been getting a little carried away. Still, the former Anderlecht keeper Wim De Coninck commented that it is only a matter of time before Ryan leaves Brugge, and the World Cup might be a launching pad for a move to a bigger club. Tom Rogic The last time Australia were preparing for a World Cup, in 2010, Tom Rogic was playing in the AFC Futsal Tournament in Uzbekistan. He also had a mullet. How times change. Now Rogic is a bona fide star and has a more sensible short back and sides. He featured in Nike&apos;s kit launch and is hyped as &apos;the next big thing&apos; in Australian football, and yet Rogic is yet to play a full game for the Socceroos. Likely to be used sparingly by Ange Postecoglou \u2013 especially considering his relative lack of game time at Melbourne Victory \u2013 Rogic could be one of the surprise packages at the World Cup. Mark Milligan An almost certain starter in the centre of midfield in Brazil, Milligan is one of many Socceroos who ply their trade in the A-League. In 2006, &apos;Millsy&apos; - who had completed just one season for Sydney FC - was the shock selection in Guus Hiddink&apos;s squad for Germany. He didn&apos;t start any games, but featured in the Asian Cup a year later. The 20-year-old was then rumoured to sign for Manchester City, Porto, Arsenal and Werder Bremen. The move to Europe never materialised however, and Milligan instead went to Asia, playing at Shanghai Shenhua and JEF United Chiba. An earthquake drove him back to Melbourne Victory, where he is currently captain. He has been poised to move to Crystal Palace in England and Baniyas in the United Arab Emirates this season, but again nothing has eventuated. Still, with a coach who respects A-League talent, home has provided Milligan with a good platform to stake a case for Brazil. Ange Postecoglou All eyes are on Ange. The first Australian to coach the Socceroos to a World Cup since Rale Rasic in 1974, Postecoglou is a media darling in Australia. Seven years ago it was a vastly different story, after Postecoglou was sacked by the FFA for failing to qualify for the under-20s World Cup. An infamous interview with the prominent pundit, Craig Foster, didn&apos;t help his case, but made for great television. Postecoglou is no stranger to Brazil, however. In 2000, he took his boyhood club, South Melbourne, to the Club World Championship. South lost to Vasco da Gama, then the Mexican side Necaxa, then Manchester United and finished on zero points. Fourteen years on, Postecoglou&apos;s team are still the underdogs, but he&apos;ll be hoping for better results this time round.

It has a historic core, including nine Unesco world heritage sites, as well as many beautiful gardens, waterways and temples. And it is experiencing extraordinary rates of urban growth: the Suzhou Industrial Park is a cathedral to consumerism, while the lights at Harmony Times Square illuminate a surrounding urban sprawl littered with construction projects. But Suzhou has also embarked on another fascinating project: urban mimicry. From Venetian-style \u201cwater town\u201d districts to Dutch-style suburban living, Suzhou hosts what journalist Bianca Bosker calls \u201coriginal copies\u201d: simulations of western landmarks. The city is fast becoming China\u2019s city of clones.  Most amazing of all, perhaps, are the replica bridges. This particular phenomenon is centred in Xiangcheng district, a newly developing area in the city&apos;s north-east which is earmarked as a commercial and financial \u201ctrade city\u201d. With 35% of the district covered in water, planners set out to connect its urban archipelago \u2013 but rather than use traditional architectural styles (as a water town, Suzhou had already earned the nickname Venice of the East), it was felt that replication would earn more exposure. The result is a sort of museum of world bridges: 56 famous replicas, including spectacular simulations of London&apos;s Tower Bridge, Sydney Harbour Bridge and Pont Alexandre III bridge in Paris.     Suzhou's Sydney Harbour Bridge, one of 56 famous replicas in Xiangcheng district,  is less than a third of the length of the original. Photograph: Michael Silk    Built by the Suzhou Municipal Engineering Design Institute, rather than foreign designers or consultants, the bridges have been modified from their originals to fit the urban landscape. Tower Bridge boasts four towers rather than two, offers glazed vertical floating walkways to maximise the scenic view, and houses two coffee shops.  The Sydney Harbour Bridge copy is smaller than the original, made from granite (thereby significantly cheaper and quicker to construct than the eight years it took 1,400 Sydney labourers in the 1920s and 30s), and has been designed as a &quot;rainbow across the river bend&quot;, with a 100m replica steel truss arch and 327m in length (the original is 1,149m long).  The Pont Alexandre III bridge, unlike its Parisian counterpart, is constructed from concrete. With little regard for context, as depthless, superficial, pseudo-authentic simulations, these new-old recreations have been parachuted in, as George Ritzer would argue, to \u201cre-enchant\u201d space and encourage commerce and consumption.      Re-enchantez to meet you ... Suzhou's Pont Alexandre III Bridge is made out of concrete, unlike the original bridge in Paris. Photograph: Michael Silk    Suzhou is not the first Chinese city to embark upon urban mimicry. A simulation of Dorchester (Dorset, UK) houses 200,000 citizens in Chengdu; there is also Thames Town in Shanghai, a replica of Austria\u2019s Hallstat resort in Huizhou and the replica of the Eiffel Tower and the Champs Elysee square in Hangzhou. Part accelerated urban development, part race for global recognition, these mimicries capitalise on the symbolic successes of their originals, in an attempt to signal China&apos;s self-assured sovereignty and urban speculation. It is also a result of housing becoming a free-market commodity. After Mao&apos;s death, the introduction of a new economic policy, starting in 1979, opened the nation to foreign investment and restored private control over land use. Real estate investors supported by Hong Kong, Taiwanese and overseas Chinese financiers were quick to exploit the new opportunities in the booming housing market. With a rapid increase in the number of cities, a growing middle class and a desire to invest capital in property, there has been a boom in residential construction, investment and sales, coupled with a desire to demonstrate personal prestige.  The trend of urban mimicry, or what Bosker calls \u201cduplitecture\u201d, emerged in the early 1990s, and has seen a vast number of replicated residential buildings and landmarks in cities across China. The opportunity to live in housing that represents the historic grandeur of the west is an appealing prospect to those Chinese citizens who can afford to become part of an urban elite. These buildings offer luxury and exclusivity, the chance to posture and parade among plastic facsimiles of \u201cprogress\u201d \u2013 displays of conspicuous consumption that are enactments of status among China\u2019s emergent nouveau riche (sometimes known by the somewhat derogatory term tuhao).      Original Suzhounese architecture ... the  Shantang Canal connects the old town to Tiger Hill. Photograph: Michael Silk    Reaction among Suzhou residents is mixed, with some expressing concern that the developments are not moored within the culture and history of Suzhou. \u201cAll the bridges in Suzhou have their history and cultural background, there is a reason for their existence,\u201d said one resident. \u201cHowever, these new bridges are purely copies. There\u2019s no history linked to Suzhou and they are not meaningful towards the city.\u201d  Others question whether the mimicries promote Suzhou or western countries. Younger people seem more appreciative, marvelling in the \u201cexperience\u201d and \u201cconvenience of seeing foreign landmarks without needing to travel overseas\u201d, suggesting that the mimicries were markers of a hybrid eastern/western progress, \u201csuitable for a modern Suzhou that always wants to do something new&quot;.     Suzhou's currently deserted Dutch Village, complete with a Moon Gate acting as an 'inviting entrance'. Photograph: Michael Silk    The scrubbed, sanitised and sparkling sidewalks of these new temples to speculation are, at present, spookily silent: the only sounds come from the migrant labourers putting their finishing touches to the buildings and the frenzied clicks of the wedding paparazzi, part of Suzhou\u2019s famed bridal industry. The brides, wearing western white as opposed to the traditional Chinese red, pose in front of China\u2019s new temples like manicured effigies to neoliberalism. These married couples are clamouring for positive proof of their success and the emulation of a middle-class consumption ethic, as well as, perhaps contradictorially, celebrating local boosterism, growth and achievement.  The cloned buildings hint at another dark side to capital development in China. These mimicked monuments are constructed and maintained by a migrant labour force, one that is simultaneously indispensible and disposable. Suzhou boasts it is the most \u201cpopular\u201d city for migrant workers in China. Housed in temporary dormitories, they live in the shadows of this duplitecture, a haunting reminder that the historic structure and temples Suzhou is actively preserving were often built using enslaved labour: after the completion of the iconic Tiger Hill pagoda during the Northern Song Dynasty (959-961AD), its 1,000 workers were put to death.     Migrant labourers in the shadow of Suzhou\u2019s Tower Bridge. More authentic historic structures were often built using enslaved labour. Photograph: Michael Silk    Suzhou&apos;s development lies is in the hands of urban planners who are attempting to reconcile contradictory impulses: the active preservation and exploitation of monuments to the past; an intensified race to enter global circuits of capital; and spectacular projects of urban speculation and duplication. But the fascination with simulation could have stark consequences. \u201cSo far,\u201d said one resident, \u201cother than providing the younger generation with somewhere to take their wedding photos, it is hard for citizens to see any contribution towards promoting the city itself in relation to tourism, culture and its traditional appearance.\u201d  The risk of duplication is that it may result in standardisation \u2013 and ultimately harm the distinctiveness and urban differentiation of not just Suzhou but indeed Chinese cities as a whole.

Travelling on British-owned steamships and British-built railways, he could complete his circuit while scarcely leaving Anglophone territory. &quot;There is a trail of British towns right round the world,&quot; reflects Fogg&apos;s valet in Hong Kong, a city that apparently looked as English as &quot;one of the many market towns in Kent or Surrey \u2026 With a few exceptions, it was Bombay, Calutta, or\u00a0Singapore all over again.&quot; How did this ring of British settlements come into being, and what remains of it today? In Ten Cities that Made an Empire, Tristram Hunt considers the rise and fall of the British empire by touring its centres. It&apos;s an ingenious and timely approach, and one that Hunt, the author of Building Jerusalem and biographer of Friedrich Engels as well as shadow secretary of state for education, is well equipped to\u00a0make. In the 1970s, social history reigned and urban studies proliferated, but such work fell out of fashion with the rise of imperial and cultural history. Hunt&apos;s fusion of the two holds special resonance now, as the &quot;developing&quot; world experiences rates of urbanisation analogous to those of Britain during the Industrial Revolution, and the megacity has become the icon of globalisation in all its good, bad and ugly forms. Hunt skilfully constructs his itinerary to provide a lively and cliche-busting survey of imperial history. He\u00a0begins in three corners of the 18th-century British Atlantic. Bridgetown in\u00a0Barbados surged on the profits of one of the era&apos;s hottest commodities \u2013 sugar \u2013 which was cultivated on the island by armies of African slaves. The more that British and North American consumers gobbled sweets, the more Bridgetown flourished, becoming a planters&apos; playground of &quot;assembly rooms, race courses, musical societies, dancing schools, bowling greens&quot;. One\u00a0could read the city&apos;s debt to transatlantic trade off a map: New England Street, Manchester Lane, the Birmingham Warehouse. Boston, too, was bound to the British empire by commerce, trading North American timber, whale oil and cod, and consuming imported ceramics, silver, sugar and tea. Colonial Boston, as Hunt describes it,\u00a0was a &quot;fiercely royal city&quot; whose denizens were &quot;delighted to be part of Britain&apos;s emergent, Atlantic empire&quot;. Until, of\u00a0course, they weren&apos;t. Hunt uses the\u00a0story of the Boston Tea Party \u2013 essentially an anti-tax protest \u2013 to show how the American revolution was at least as much a conflict about prices and profits as it was about principles. That may also help explain why the American revolution tended, if anything, to reinforce colonial loyalty in other domains. In Dublin, Hunt explains, the Protestant ascendancy strived to &quot;be equal partners in empire, not troublesome colonial cousins&quot; like\u00a0the Americans. The city&apos;s grand Georgian redevelopment, with its fine aristocratic townhouses, its remodelled parliament, its Custom House and the Four Courts, showed how the city &quot;was becoming more, not less, integrated with Britain during this period&quot;. The process culminated in the 1800 Act of Union, which sealed Ireland&apos;s transformation &quot;from a problem to a partner in imperialism&quot; \u2013 at least for a time. The British empire that emerged from the American and French revolutions was characterised by increasing metropolitan control, an assertively Protestant, Anglocentric culture, and a\u00a0global strategic vision. Cape Town, seized during the Napoleonic wars, would be transformed by the British &quot;from a second-tier refreshment station to an axis\u00a0of empire&quot;. In Calcutta, Governor Richard Wellesley stamped out what he saw as a &quot;lax, dissolute world&quot; of &quot;interracial liaisons, drinking and gambling&quot; and built a neoclassical, lion-bedecked temple to &quot;morality and\u00a0pageantry, deference and duty&quot; in\u00a0the form of a monumental new Government House. These civic and strategic ambitions were matched by an economic vision: the doctrine of free trade. To Manchester School ideologues, free\u00a0trade would shape a fairer, more peaceful world. But that wasn&apos;t how the Chinese, among others, experienced it. Hong Kong became a &quot;British&quot; city when British opium traders, angered by Chinese restrictions on drug trafficking, convinced the British government to bombard the\u00a0Qing into\u00a0submission. Given such hostile beginnings, it is little wonder that Hong Kong society remained sharply segregated, its white minority steeped in anti-Chinese prejudice. While Hong Kong was a &quot;monument to \u2026 free trade&quot;, Bombay came to stand for a Victorian ideal of modernity. Hunt perceptively notes parallels between Raj-era Bombay and Joseph Chamberlain&apos;s Birmingham: both cities were transfigured by municipal public works (Florence Nightingale became a relentless advocate for Indian sanitation reform) and by civic philanthropy. And while Bombay echoed late Victorian Birmingham, Melbourne offered an Antipodean reflection of, say, Surrey, with handsome suburbs and a thriving culture of sport fostering a sense of belonging to a &quot;Greater Britain&quot;. Britons built virtually all these cities on hitherto scarcely settled patches of coast. The great exception was New Delhi, Hunt&apos;s penultimate case. In 1911, the British shifted their Indian capital to this historic site, which had been the capital of numerous Indian regimes from the Mahabharata to the Mughals. Appointed to design the latest Delhi was country house architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who disdained every previous style. &quot;&apos;Personally, I do not believe there is any real Indian architecture or any great tradition,&apos;&quot; he\u00a0told his wife. Mughal architecture was &quot;&apos;all tommy rot&apos;. And as for the Hindu tradition, &apos;Hindon&apos;t, I say.&apos;&quot; Delhi, a short documentary made in 1938, pans over Lutyens&apos;s monumental state buildings with a voiceover grandly explaining: &quot;Neither Saracen nor British \u2026 the new Delhi is dynamic, but\u00a0no less inspiring than the old.&quot; The film concludes with a panoramic shot down the processional boulevard of Rajpath, and a sonorous valediction to &quot;the ninth, enduring city, which in the old legend of the Hindustan, would stand and rule forever&quot;. The spectacle uncomfortably reminds one of Albert Speer&apos;s plans for the capital of &quot;the Thousand-Year Reich&quot;. Within less than 10 years, New Delhi had become instead the capital of the Republic of India. What did the Indian officials who moved into these imperial buildings make of their inheritance? Hunt uses the urban lens to terrific effect in assessing the legacies of empire today. In present-day Boston, the city&apos;s long, prosperous connection with Britain has been overwritten by the relentlessly patriotic &quot;Freedom Trail&quot; and caricatures of British tyranny. In Dublin, by contrast, one finds tourist literature busily &quot;marketing the architecture and aesthetic of a colonial, Protestant past&quot; to weekend city-breakers. In Hong Kong, old buildings have been torn down &quot;with\u00a0a\u00a0brutal, rhythmic regularity&quot;, a\u00a0reminder of Britain&apos;s ultimate failure &quot;to &apos;open up&apos; China to the virtues of\u00a0free trade&quot;. Hunt locates perhaps the most complex legacy of empire in Britain itself. He concludes in Liverpool, which in the 19th century prospered thanks to shipping and import-related industries such as sugar refining. When imperial trade dried up after the second world war, so did the city&apos;s business, leaving a blasted landscape of empty docks, shuttered warehouses and neighbourhoods affected by racial tension. The latest plans for urban renewal have turned to China: Liverpool has become &quot;twinned&quot; with Shanghai, and plans have been drawn up to develop a port facility for Chinese imports, and a waterfront complex anchored by the 60-storey &quot;Shanghai Tower&quot;. Are the ghosts of the opium wars making mischief? Hunt could of course have picked numerous other imperial cities and found different stories. If you looked at\u00a0the 18th-century British empire from Freetown, Sierra Leone, rather than Bridgetown, you would discover a remarkable riposte to the Atlantic slave trade in a city built by former slaves, with abolitionist sponsorship. If you looked at the Victorian empire from Singapore, rather than Hong Kong or Melbourne, you would see a city shaped by a single &quot;enlightened despot&quot;, Stamford Raffles \u2013 it remains one of the world&apos;s most international cities. And if you looked at the 20th-century empire from Johannesburg, rather than New Delhi, you would see how tactics of divide-and-rule evolved into a cityscape stamped by appalling policies of white supremacist rule. But such variations are tributes to the richness of Hunt&apos;s approach, and his success at moving beyond &quot;a barren conversation about empire being a &apos;good&apos; or &apos;bad&apos; thing&quot; to &quot;reflect instead on how the processes of imperial exchange took place&quot;.

Leta Hong Fincher&apos;s subject \u2013 researched through statistical analysis, sociological surveys and extensive first-hand interviewing \u2013 is the toxic vitality of sexism in China today. The book&apos;s title is drawn from a vile state-sponsored media campaign of the same name, which is designed to browbeat educated, professional women into early marriages in the interests of safeguarding social stability. Since at least 2007, newspapers, magazines, websites and \u2013 perhaps most troublingly of all \u2013 the All-China Women&apos;s Federation (a government organisation founded in 1949 supposedly to defend women&apos;s rights) have aggressively pushed the idea that unmarried urban females over 27 are &quot;leftover women&quot;. These women may have university degrees and thriving careers but in the eyes of much of the state-controlled media they are essentially worthless without husbands and children. &quot;Do leftover women really deserve our sympathy?&quot; asked one article on the Women&apos;s Federation website. &quot;Girls with an average or ugly appearance \u2026 hope to further their education in order to increase their competitiveness. The tragedy is they don&apos;t realise that, as women age, they are worth less and less, so by the time they get their MA or PhD, they are already old, like yellowed pearls.&quot; Although the Chinese media makes much noise about the country&apos;s epidemic of &quot;leftover&quot; single women, there are in fact far more &quot;leftover&quot; Chinese men, due to a traditional preference for sons and sex-selective abortions. By 2012, there were 117.7 boys to every 100 girls. &quot;The continual accumulation of unmarried men of legal marrying age,&quot; admits the Communist party&apos;s mouthpiece, the People&apos;s Daily, &quot;greatly increases the risk of social instability and insecurity.&quot; In this context, Hong Fincher writes, single, educated women &quot;threaten the moral\u00a0fabric \u2026 for being free agents, unnatural in failing to perform their duty to give birth to a child and tame a\u00a0restless man&quot;. The openly eugenicist Chinese state is particularly anxious to see educated, &quot;high-quality&quot; women marry, &quot;to produce children with &apos;superior&apos; genetic makeup&quot;. The social coercion of women into marriage has troubling economic consequences. Because urban women in their mid-20s are indoctrinated to feel already almost on the shelf, they often marry hastily and do not press for economic equality within their marriages. The urban Chinese today are preoccupied with buying a home. In cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, prices have skyrocketed in recent years, resulting in an extraordinary appreciation in real-estate wealth. Working women often contribute their\u00a0life savings to securing a marital apartment, and siphon their salaries into mortgage repayments. Yet although more than 70% of women help finance the purchase of a marital home, only 30% of such deeds include the wife&apos;s name, and their contributions to mortgages are frequently not officially acknowledged. Hong Fincher&apos;s research suggests that husbands and inlaws often make women who request property rights within a marriage feel grasping and unreasonable. Consequently, women tend to back down, for\u00a0fear of scaring off a potential spouse. Sole ownership of the marital property inevitably gives a husband greater power in the relationship, and weakens the woman&apos;s bargaining position on financial and domestic issues. At the same time as women have been left out of China&apos;s property boom, employment rates for urban women have fallen in the past two decades, from 77.4% to 60.8%. One female graduate whom Hong Fincher interviewed deliberately dropped out of employment in order make herself &quot;less intimidating to suitors&quot;. Some parents of young women also\u00a0fail to support their daughters emotionally and materially, compared to sons. One father told her daughter that she would not be able to have children after the age of 30. Parents routinely help sons buy their own apartments, but many choose to financially assist a male nephew rather than their own daughter. Chinese parents commonly feel they have no responsibility to buy a house for a daughter; that is the duty of a spouse. As a result, urban Chinese women have lost out badly in the massive growth in private home ownership of the past decade and a half. Recent legal developments further undermine women&apos;s property rights. In 1950, one of the first pieces of legislation enacted by the young People&apos;s Republic of China was the New Marriage Law, theoretically guaranteeing women&apos;s rights in marriage, divorce and property. In 2011, however, China&apos;s supreme court specified that marital real estate &quot;belongs to the person \u2026 whose name is on the property deed&quot;. Since the majority of property deeds are in the name of men, if a marriage collapses the woman can be left homeless, even if she sank savings and income into financing the property. The book also highlights the shocking inadequacy of China&apos;s laws against domestic violence. Women are actively discouraged from reporting abuse: wives who go public are accused of &quot;exposing family ugliness&quot; (jiachou buke waiyang). Social institutions that should be protecting vulnerable women \u2013 the police, doctors and the Women&apos;s Federation \u2013 seem to be seriously failing in basic duties of care. One wife whose husband took away her son and beat her publicly was told that she ought to &quot;just put up with it&quot;. The police labelled the abuse &quot;family conflict&quot; and told the couple to solve their differences peacefully. A recent analysis of open media coverage of domestic violence revealed that 70 to 80 women had been killed by their partners in the course of\u00a0just two months. A husband who murdered his wife in 2009 after she had reported domestic violence to the police eight times was given a mere six-and-a-half-year prison sentence for &quot;ill-treatment&quot; of his wife. A 2013 UN study reported that 50% of Chinese men surveyed on intimate partner violence had physically or sexually abused their partner, and that 72% of Chinese rapists suffered no legal consequences. Moreover, Hong Fincher writes, &quot;marital rape is not considered a crime in China&quot;. Activists have been campaigning for an effective law on domestic violence for a decade; no legislation has resulted. Although extremely depressing, the book is also scattered with inspiring life-stories of courageous women who have faced down appalling discrimination. One example is Kim Lee, a US woman who in 2005 married the billionaire entrepreneur Li Yang. For years, she helped develop his business and brought up their three daughters. Throughout this time, she suffered escalating levels of domestic abuse, including Li Yang kicking her in the stomach when she was seven months pregnant. After she finally walked out in 2011 (with head injuries), Lee began a two-year legal battle to prove domestic violence occurred, in which the Chinese legal and medical system blocked her case with successive bureaucratic obstacles, and during which Lee suffered unthinkable stresses in her private and public life. While the case was ongoing, Li Yang (either in text messages or yelling through her locked apartment door) threatened to kill her. At one point, while Lee was riding the Beijing underground with one of her daughters, a man spat at her and screamed, &quot;I hope he beats you to death next time, you American bitch.&quot; Yet Lee struggled on \u2013 posting pictures of her injuries on Chinese Twitter, appearing on Chinese TV \u2013 in the hope of resolving her case, and publicising China&apos;s domestic violence epidemic. &quot;This is really an open sore,&quot; she has commented. &quot;It&apos;s hidden, but it&apos;s hurting.&quot; Eventually, in\u00a0a landmark ruling, a Beijing court granted her a divorce on the grounds of\u00a0domestic violence. Nonetheless, a women&apos;s rights attorney still argued that Li Yang had succeeded in skilfully concealing from the legal process many of his assets; Lee&apos;s financial settlement was consequently much too small. The book ends with profiles of other women who are committed to resisting sexism: female activists and bloggers dedicated to drawing attention to China&apos;s deep-seated male chauvinism, and politically neutral professionals who have vowed never to marry, in protest against the political and social oppression of women. &quot;Marriage in China is a living hell,&quot; one woman told Hong Fincher. The international press \u2013 with headlines such as &quot;China dominates list of female billionaires&quot; and &quot;Women in China: the sky&apos;s the limit&quot; \u2013 trumpets the egalitarian opportunities that Chinese women enjoy. Leftover Women is a highly sobering corrective to this rosy picture, but also gives faint grounds for hope that the fight for gender equality in China is not yet dead. \u2022 Julia Lovell&apos;s books include The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams and the Making of China.

Deutsche Telekom, which owns half of Britain&apos;s EE mobile network and operates in 14 countries including the US, Spain and Poland, has already published surveillance data for its home nation \u2013 one of the countries that have reacted most angrily to the Edward Snowden revelations. In the wake of Vodafone&apos;s disclosures, first published in the Guardian on Friday, it announced that it would extend its disclosures to every other market where it operates and where it is legal. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Telekom, which has 140 million customers worldwide, said: &quot;Deutsche Telekom has initially focused on Germany when it comes to disclosure of government requests. We are currently checking if and to what extent our national companies can disclose information. We intend to publish something similar to Vodafone.&quot; Bosses of the world&apos;s biggest mobile networks, many of which have headquarters in Europe, are gathering for an industry conference in Shanghai this weekend, and the debate is expected to centre on whether they should join Deutsche and Vodafone in using transparency to push back against the use of their technology for government surveillance. Mobile companies, unlike social networks, cannot operate without a government-issued licence, and have previously been reluctant to discuss the extent of their cooperation with national security and law enforcement agencies. But Vodafone broke cover on Friday by confirming that in around half a dozen of the markets in which it operates, governments in Europe and outside have installed their own secret listening equipment on its network and those of other operators. Under this direct access system, wires suck up traffic at key points in the network, allowing unfettered access to the content of phone conversations and text messages, and in some cases delivering live data about the location of customers. They allow surveillance without the usual warrants, and it means the phone company cannot know how many people are being targeted and what the justification is for any snooping. Vodafone will formally table its Law Enforcement Disclosure report, which sets out country by country the laws that oblige it to help governments spy on citizens, at the GSMA industry group conference in Shanghai. Disclosure may pose a dilemma for Orange, formerly France Telecom. Like Deutsche it is still partially state-owned, and French newspaper Le Monde reported this year that the company had deep links with its domestic intelligence agency. A spokesperson for Orange said: &quot;Orange respects the laws and regulations of every country in which it is present. Naturally, this means that the group rigorously adheres to the legal framework with regards to all surveillance requests emanating from state authorities across its footprint.&quot; The newspaper confirmed, using files obtained by Snowden, that Orange had collaborated with the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Ext\u00e9rieure (DGSE) to break encryption codes, and that the agency was allowed free and total access to all traffic on its network. Campaign group Access asked Orange at its annual meeting this year to begin publishing data on warrant numbers, and has called on all operators to do so. The biggest European companies, including Spain&apos;s Telef\u00f3nica, Portugal Telecom and Telecom Italia, operate in many of the same markets for which Vodafone has published its numbers. &quot;Working together, operators can make a clear stand against unfettered surveillance,&quot; said Access policy counsel Peter Micek. &quot;Competition on transparency is something we would welcome. It&apos;s not going to happen overnight, but I think Vodafone has made a great headstart for the sector and it is incumbent on the rest of the field to follow up quickly.&quot; &quot;Europe has a strong charter of fundamental rights, and those rights apply online as they do offline.

Next to the words is an image of a composite Shanghai/Dubai-like city, made of sealed towers of the kind that would be impossible without artificial air. Any association with this year&apos;s Rolex-sponsored Venice Biennale of Architecture is coincidental, but the poster is an eloquent exhibit of the event&apos;s main theme. This is: thousands of years of architectural history are being changed utterly by modern techniques of constructing and servicing buildings which, predetermined by technical considerations, make architects marginal to their making. If, for example, a fireplace was once an occasion for social gathering and ornamental embellishment, there are now sensors that can track an individual and provide heating specific to that one person. The provision of heat becomes a solitary, dematerialised and invisible affair. The point is made in the large central pavilion at the heart of the Biennale&apos;s gardens. Here, this year&apos;s director, Rem Koolhaas, together with students from Harvard and a considerable team of collaborators, has installed a series of rooms which represent the elements of architecture \u2013 doors, stairs, walls, balconies and so on \u2013 and their contemporary versions. It is a 3D Google of what buildings have been and are now. Just after entering, you reach the pavilion&apos;s domed hall, whose rich blue and gold decorations from 1909 have recently been restored. Below, Koolhaas has installed a section of ceiling such as you might find in a modern hospital, in which a layer of dumb panels separates off a zone of ducts and machinery, in volume as large as the lower space inhabited by people. The progress of doors is traced, from decorative and ceremonial frames to the disembodied beep of modern security. A marvellous wall of windows, from the Brooking Collection of such things, looks on to a testing machine borrowed from the Belgian Sobinco window factory, which, with relentless rhythm, opens and closes to infinity. There are joys: for example in a montage of film clips of the ways in which bits of architecture have been exploited by the movies \u2013 people hanging off cornices, the opening of doors to shocking discoveries, and the silver screen&apos;s never-ending fascination with smashing sheets of glass. A video follows the many miles of tunnels created by the fifth duke of Portland at Welbeck Abbey in Sherwood Forest. You can experience the nerdy delights a science museum might offer, for example in the spiral escalator installed in Holloway Road underground station in 1902, which functioned for a day (or it might have been in 1906: the not completely meticulous cataloguing gives both dates). The show is partly a celebration of what built spaces can do, but there is also an underlying pessimism. Things Ain&apos;t What They Used to Be is one message, or We&apos;re All Doomed. This is striking, coming from Koolhaas, who has usually seemed happy to embrace contemporary techniques and has never been too precious about the niceties of traditional architecture; but then, paradox has also been one of his favourite tools. The message is delivered in a different way in another Biennale venue, the long and venerable rope-making works of the Arsenale, where Italy is surveyed in all its splendour and squalor. The country, says Koolhaas, &quot;has amazing gifts, but has difficulty realising them&quot;. In this, it might stand for all developed societies. At other biennales, Italy is the uninvited host, on account of the fact that it ceded its supremacy in new architecture some time ago. Here it is laid out for inspection, like a body on a slab, in a series of exhibits arranged according to geography from south to north, starting with the modernist buildings Mussolini built in the colony of Libya. It proceeds via the contemporary arrangements for dealing with illegal immigrants on the island of Lampedusa, halfway between Sicily and Tunisia, all the way to the Sikh festivals that now take place in the Po valley, and ultimately to the Alps.     The Arsenale, which exhibits Italy's legacy, in all its splendour and squalor.  Photograph: David Levene    Perhaps 60% of the enjoyment of this space comes from the accompaniment of clips from great films set in Italy, by Antonioni, Rossellini, Godard and others, and the display is arguably an overload of ideas and incidents. It would take days, if not weeks, to take it all in. But every element rewards attention, and the governing themes are clear enough \u2013 the country&apos;s intersections of power, money, humanity and beauty. These are summarised by a new film by Ila B\u00eaka and Louise Lemoine, in which the architect Stefano Boeri mournfully tours the palace he was asked to design on the gorgeous coast of Sardinia, to host the G8 summit. Berlusconi didn&apos;t like it, so it was never used, leaving behind a fenced-off folly, environmental contamination and accusations of corruption in the construction process. In view of which it is particularly poignant that the mayor of the magical city of Venice could not attend the Biennale&apos;s opening party, as he and 30 others had been detained that very day on suspicion of extortion and money-laundering. Like the air-conditioning advert, this event became an inadvertent exhibit. The other main element of the Biennale is the set of national pavilions, curated by individual countries and distributed among its gardens. Koolhaas requested that they represented the ways in which they have absorbed modernity, &quot;as a boxer absorbs a blow&quot;, over the past century. Korea responded interestingly, with a display that combines North and South in a way that makes them look more similar than you might expect. The British pavilion, led by Sam Jacob of the about-to-dissolve practice FAT, shows how the transformative dreams of William Blake&apos;s Jerusalem have played out in concrete housing estates, new towns, and in music and film. It offers a series of flavourful cultural snacks, which also manage to embody something important about British culture. The Biennale is greatly enhanced by the fact that, unlike its predecessors, it does not pay tribute to the big beasts of contemporary architecture (Koolhaas excepted) and the absence of their honking and rutting adds greatly to its enjoyment. They are represented mostly by a panel of door handles, each designed by a famous name and each only slightly different from the others, a microcosm of previous biennales that is eloquent in its pointlessness. At times, this year&apos;s biennale is only obliquely about architecture (it includes, for example, dance performance), but as architecture is usually best experienced obliquely, this is a strength. Shows like this can be a wearisome tramp through information, but this one is stimulating. It doesn&apos;t offer answers, but the questions it raises are pertinent.

It was Michael Scott, president of the Chicago Board of Education. A single, close-range gunshot to the left temple suggested foul play. That is, until a month later, when the police department revealed that pioneering data analytics had been used to sift through a haystack of video footage from the city\u2019s CCTV cameras. The all-seeing eyes had tracked Scott\u2019s blue Cadillac to its terminus on the river&apos;s east bank. He was alone: it was suicide. This harrowing story unsettled Illinois five years ago, and became an inspiration for the video game Watch Dogs, released last week. Set in near-future Chicago, it follows hacker hero Aiden Pearce as he tries to stay alive in a city where a single mainframe \u2013 the Central Operating System (CtOS) \u2013 controls the urban electronic infrastructure. \u201cWe extrapolated a bit from what was happening in 2009,\u201d says Watch Dogs creative director Jonathan Morin. \u201cBut there was a feeling that, because of the city\u2019s history, Chicago was the kind of place where the authorities might actually install something like CtOS.\u201d  Watch Dogs, which sold 4m copies in its first week, is just the latest game to thrust the player into a detailed, pulsating and populous artificial metropolis. Ubisoft&apos;s previous bestsellers, the Assassin&apos;s Creed series, modelled the cities of Renaissance Italy; Rockstar&apos;s Grand Theft Auto has given us pimped-out versions of New York (Liberty City), LA (Los Santos) and Miami (Vice City). But as these virtual cityscapes become ever more closely synced with their real counterparts, does the street run the other way, too? Can video games teach us about our cities, and how we might want them to play out?     The Willis Tower, Chicago, pictured in Watch Dogs    Bottling metropolis mojo in video games has become a painstaking artisanal labour, one that is conducted by the 21st-century equivalent of Renaissance fresco workshops. Ubisoft, for example, had more than 1,000 people working on Watch Dogs. Morin says they chose Chicago because of its reputation as a \u201ccity of crisis\u201d: the rebuilding after the Great Fire of 1871; the overhaul of the police force after Al Capone; the riots of 1919 and 1968 that caused the city to re-examine race relations. \u201cThey are proud to stand back up after big problems,\u201d Morin says. \u201cAnd they always seem to do it through innovation in terms of how the city is run. They always end up taking very ballsy moves, which is why we thought CtOS was plausible there.\u201d  Chicago\u2019s office of emergency management and communications has indeed pioneered an integrated operations centre, which unifies public and private security feeds into one of the world\u2019s largest surveillance networks \u2013 an estimated 24,000 cameras. (Ubisoft\u2019s Montreal headquarters is just a few kilometres from Genetec, whose software helps monitor the Chicago footage.) But Ubisoft didn\u2019t get any access to that network. So how exactly do you go about modelling an urban ecosystem?  If there is one man who knows what an imposing task it is, it\u2019s Will Wright, creator of 1989\u2019s seminal SimCity. \u201cCities are amazingly complex systems,\u201d Wright told me from his home in Oakland, California. \u201cMillions of autonomous agents \u2013 the people \u2013 making millions of decisions: where to live, where to work, where to eat lunch. Those millions of decisions are the city.\u201d The Watch Dogs team tried to get a handle on those millions of decisions by applying an old-fashioned technique: the field trip. They made repeated visits to take photos of different neighbourhoods and landmarks, such as the Willis tower; they recorded ambient audio and observed people\u2019s behaviour. They wanted the unauthorised tour: beyond police escorts into sketchier areas, they didn\u2019t enlist much official cooperation. Scouting out the city\u2019s deprived Englewood district, they fell victim to a case of mistaken identity. \u201cWe were in a big red van, so as soon as we got out, people starting yelling, \u2018FBI! FBI!\u2019 and running away,\u201d says level-design director Sebastien Galarneau. The team have also brought the virtual and real together, with a site that shows how much data is available right now on real cities, such as London, Paris and Berlin.      'People started yelling FBI! FBI!' ... Englewood, Chicago was one of the neighbourhoods the Watch Dogs team visited to model. Photograph: Getty    Everyone who has developed an &quot;open-city&quot; game undertakes the same trawl for authenticity. Shenmue was the genre&apos;s first modern 3D incarnation, modelling the streets of Hong Kong in 1999, while last year\u2019s Grand Theft Auto V is generally agreed to be the high-water mark: Rockstar distilled 250,000 photographs and countless hours of video into Los Santos, their version of Los Angeles and its hinterland. It isn&apos;t always easy, says Watch Dogs&apos; Galarneau. &quot;It was a stressful experience going into the back alleys taking pictures of abandoned homes, weird railings ... the dark places of the city.&quot; But developers must also strike a balance between fidelity and fun. For instance, Ubisoft tampered with Chicago\u2019s grid layout, to encourage a more stimulating (ie carnage-filled) driving experience. Sleeping Dogs (2012) crammed Kowloon and many of Hong Kong\u2019s other districts on to the main island, which is considerably less populated in real-life. \u201cSome of the alleys are very tight,\u201d says lead designer Mike Skupa. \u201cThe organic nature of the city is just incredible \u2013 it keeps on getting built on top of itself.\u201d The Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise, a Ubisoft titan that towers over the field alongside Grand Theft Auto, has mocked up 14 cities across four different time periods. For Assassin&apos;s Creed: Brotherhood, set in 1499, Ubisoft figured players wouldn\u2019t stand for a virtual Rome bereft of the dome of St Peter\u2019s, on which work only began in 1506. So they finagled it in \u2013 the only significant deviation from scrupulous historical accuracy (with respect to the architecture, at least) that made an archaeologist out of lead designer Patrick Plourde. \u201cWe had to break the whole present-day city down. We had a historian who would say: that\u2019s baroque \u2013 no good. That\u2019s medieval \u2013 you can use it. Early Renaissance \u2013 good. Late Renaissance \u2013 no good.\u201d     'The organic nature of the city is just incredible' ... Kowloon was merged with the main Hong Kong island for the 2012 game Sleeping Dogs. Photograph: Paul Hilton/EPA    In this increasingly crowded field, each virtual city has its own style: Assassin\u2019s Creed uses a \u201csocial-stealth\u201d system that relies on sophisticated crowd dynamics; Sleeping Dogs emphasises pedestrianism; Watch Dogs, surveillance. By encompassing all these different facets of city living, open-world game development is approaching a form of urban planning \u2013 albeit a fantasy version, in which the designer has near-godlike agency. They&apos;re not quite free of budgetary restrictions, perhaps, but they&apos;re unencumbered by local politics, and can cut and paste neighbourhoods, orchestrate traffic flows and command the weather.  SimCity, of course, handed this panoply of powers to the player. Will Wright, was inspired, among many things, by the work of JW Forrester \u2013 whose 1969 book Urban Dynamics [PDF], a collaboration with a former Boston mayor, pioneered a computer model for a simulating city environments. By breaking down social and economic forces into 118 equations, it encouraged people to stop thinking passively of urban problems as sculpted by external forces, like rural-to-urban migration, and start envisioning a more dynamic, adjustable ecosystem. With SimCity, planners got their first taste of play; and thousands of players later became planners. Wright now thinks we may be on the verge of another breakthrough. \u201cI\u2019ve always like the metaphor of the city as a body \u2013 the roads are the circulatory system, the nervous system is communication,&quot; he says. &quot;In some sense we are now overlaying a whole new nervous system on our cities, with new information flows and feedback. For the first time, through social networks, we have real metrics about the things that happen thanks to the millions of individual agents in the city.\u201d With the digital and the physical finally speaking the same language, there&apos;s surely never been a better time for games to reshape our cities. *** Wright lives in the hills of Oakland. He digs the ocean view, but says it\u2019s one of the \u201cmost dysfunctional\u201d Bay Area cities. He admires neighbouring Emeryville: \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a totally different approach to zoning and governance, and they\u2019ve been extremely successful. It\u2019s a very small area, but that\u2019s where a lot of the new development in shopping areas and office space has gone.\u201d  Lined up side-by-side, the Bay Area cities are a perfect illustration of the unpredictability of actual cities. As he puts it: \u201cWhen you throw humans in the mix, things become very, very counterintuitive.\u201d But though cities have a way of outgrowing any model, video games are starting to provide tools to keep ahead.      'When you throw humans in the mix, things become counter-intuitive' ... Will Wright, creator of the seminal SimCity. Photograph: Ryan Anson/Getty    Second Life and Minecraft have been used to visualise built environments, such as the Blockholm project, a state-funded recreation of the Swedish capital using the Minecraft engine. Based on official land data, the simulation allowed players to propose future buildings; the best 10 were publicly exhibited and put up for planning consideration. Meanwhile Block by Block, an initiative by the UN human settlement programme UN Habitat, used Minecraft to involve residents in shaping community spaces around the world, like redesigning football fields in Nairobi\u2019s Kibera slum. For more finessed-looking 3D world-building, there are commercial programs like CityEngine, which was used to remake a section of Marseille for a significant redevelopment project and to create a futuristic cityscape for a Ministry of Sound commercial. For civic organisations, however, such programs remain expensive (if not quite in the $265m league of Grand Theft Auto V). Chris Haller, founder of Urban Interactive Studio, also experienced his \u201cbig a-ha moment\u201d playing SimCity. His company now applies game mechanics, such as interactive visual elements and a scoring system, to public-engagement projects like surveys. \u201cWe often see this vicious circle in the typical town hall meeting,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople yell and start demanding certain things. And the planners go into defensive mode, because they think the ideas are pie-in-the-sky. It becomes very unproductive.\u201d      'Big a-ha moment' ... SimCity inspired countless planners, and led Chris Haller to apply game mechanics to public projects like town hall meetings    His &quot;gamified methodology&quot; seeks to open up the planning process for all parties, by drawing more people out and giving equal weight to all voices, not just the loudest. Bannock county, Idaho used the studio\u2019s BrightPages app to liven up four alternative scenarios for its transportation system; the participants opted for one that adapted existing infrastructure, to minimise additional public spending. Eric Gordon, director of Emerson College&apos;s Engagement Lab in Boston, takes a more purist approach. He says gamification does a good job of getting people to talk about pre-defined goals, but true games have other advantages. \u201cThey\u2019re not about making a process more efficient \u2013 a game is probably the least efficient method of doing anything. There are goals, but you have obstacles in your way that aren\u2019t necessary. You agree to be part of that system, and you play towards your goals without taking the most efficient route. A game gives people a chance to imagine things in a different way, not just get there faster.\u201d In 2010, he devised Participatory Chinatown, a role-playing game in which Bostonians were invited to play one of 15 fictional residents, and complete missions like finding a job or a place to hang out. \u201cPeople said they appreciated the perspective of this other person they got to play,&quot; he says. &quot;They told the story of what was happening in a very different way \u2013 much more personalised.\u201d But the method has its limitations: \u201cThey might play, say, an immigrant who couldn\u2019t afford to buy a coffee at Starbucks every morning. But if they wanted a Starbucks on every corner in real life, that was still the case [after they finished the game]. Playing Grand Theft Auto doesn\u2019t make me want to shoot people, so why would playing a pro-social video game make me more pro-social?\u201d     'People appreciated the perspective of this other person they got to play' ... Participatory Chinatown, in which Bostonians were invited to play one of 15 fictional residents    Gordon hopes for a more subtle effect \u2013 to exploit the play-centric space of video games to challenge people\u2019s moral frameworks, to get them to give answers they didn\u2019t know they would, to obtain more nuanced findings for the planning process. He calls it \u201caugmented deliberation\u201d. His ideas had their biggest trial in 2012 during a three-week series of games, involving over 1,000 players, that fed recommendations about transport and zoning into Detroit\u2019s Future City study, which maps out the next 50 years for the embattled metropolis. Social experiments like this could just be the start, Gordon thinks: \u201cGames are inevitably going to reshape what cityscapes look like.\u201d He compares their potential impact to the development of New York\u2019s Times Square in parallel with the early urban films of Thomas Edison: their primitive tracking shots fostered a new conception of the &quot;moving&quot; city that also found expression in the square\u2019s illuminated advertising, known as \u201csky signs\u201d. \u201cPeople would stop and watch [the ads] for minutes at a time, and bask in the kinetic energy of that space,\u201d says Gordon, \u201cThe idea of the ur-city, [ultimate city] became the city in movement. Times Square was considered the centre of New York, and New York the centre of world urbanism.\u201d He thinks that video games could now have a similar effect on how we think of cities, born out of countless Xbox rampages. Pursuits like parkour \u2013 physically moving through a city like an obstacle course \u2013 could be seen as analogues of untrammelled video game freedom, and better ones than clunky transpositions like Pac-Manhattan (though location-based games, such as the popular geo-tagging &quot;wargame&quot; Ingress, are undeniably getting more sophisticated). The whole idea of the &quot;smart city&quot;, networked up to deliver all services conceivable, is a sublimation of the gamer\u2019s bottomless inventory and notion of place as malleable to their every need. The global fantasy architecture of places like Dubai, Shanghai and even the new London skyline, elasticating the limits of spatial feasibility, seems to have been pulled direct from the digital realm.     City as obstacle course ... a map of Chicago in Watch Dogs    All very exciting for any Google Glass cyborgs keen to lord it over the Tron boulevards of the future. But the danger is that the human element gets sidelined. On one level that just means forgetting that cities are, in fact, the people who live there: for example, the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) and Xerox are building a 32-acre simulated city, with buildings, benches, intersections, street lights, traffic signals, signs, construction barriers and, as Fastcompany puts it, &quot;every other complication of city life that a driver might encounter ... except wayward pedestrians&quot;. On a deeper level, Watch Dogs aims to flag up the perils of data centralisation, such as Rio de Janeiro\u2019s 2016 Smart Cities pledge, which feeds off citizen-sourced data and occupies a perilous zone between civic empowerment and Orwellian control. \u201cCentralising information so you can better dispatch civic resources is an inevitable need in the evolution of our society, but we need to be cautious about the consequences,\u201d says Watch Dogs&apos; Morin. \u201cWe all love our phones, put a lot of information on them. But we sometimes fail to step back and look at the big picture. That\u2019s why we give the power of hacking to the player \u2013 all the temptation and desire to exploit the weaknesses around them.\u201d Gordon and Haller are similarly concerned that citizens win out in the great tech march forwards. The former says he is aware that co-opting video games into public engagement could be \u201cused to pacify people into a haze of fun\u201d. In his eyes, it\u2019s vital that game-driven urban planning delivers tangible results for citizens, and doesn\u2019t slip into the kind of trendy &quot;participative&quot; marketing more likely to serve business interests. You could question other gamified projects: London\u2019s Oystercard game Chromaroma, which awards points for different journeys, could be useful for amassing travel data, but might equally be rattling the can to get more money for TfL. Is Ingress a canny way of co-opting people into urban mapping or, just a giant Google advert? \u201cI want to see responsible use of games that deploys what they\u2019re good at \u2013 creating a context of play that allows people to experiment safely with possibilities in the civic realm and ultimately empower them,\u201d says Gordon. On the other side of the looking glass, games developers have their own version of the problem. Their clockwork cities are ever more immaculate, but Morin admits they fall short on the people front: the sense of a city as a wondrous, unconducted symphony of individual minds. Games are struggling to move beyond the looped dialogue and behaviour scripts of the past; Watch Dogs hints at the idea of citizens having inner lives, but mostly to deliver the game\u2019s satirical slugs about privacy.  Plourde dwells similarly on the strengths and limitations of the first, Crusades-set Assassin\u2019s Creed. \u201cIt was the best one in terms of low-level immersion: being able to walk around and watch what people were doing. But it was not well-realised in terms of making the crowd an active element in the gameplay.\u201d He says that the sequels were a constant struggle to maintain the illusion of a spontaneous city \u2013 ensuring that a player never rounded a corner to find no one there, or a Matrix-like glitch in the system. Wright believes open-world developers are taking the wrong approach entirely. \u201cYou look at GTA, and this amazing world Rockstar have created, and it\u2019s all hand-built,&quot; he says. &quot;An evolutionary process didn\u2019t lead to Los Santos: it was 300 artists studying pictures, building models. They\u2019re just painting a portrait of a neighbourhood. It only gets you so far.\u201d That way of thinking, he says, hinders developers from bridging the gap between static (if beautifully rendered) city backdrops and true, dynamic simulations. Rather, he envisions games that work like evolution: an open-ended, unpredictable system. The challenge is how to make such a thing compatible with the personalised drama, all those sagas of rogue gangsters, cops and assassins so crucial to drawing in the player. We\u2019ll carry on inching our way towards the ultimate sim city. Playing it, detached from the real world, could be the ultimate exercise in cynicism. Or perhaps our playful instincts really can be meaningfully unleashed on our streets. Wright has made a brilliant career in the gap between sim and reality, between the model and the mortar, but even he stresses that the impulse to sculpt cities has natural limits. \u201cUtopia is always finite. The agenda changes all the time. I don\u2019t think there ever will be a utopian city.\u201d Digital or otherwise.  \u2022 Which are the best video game cities?

The report comes just weeks after the US filed charges against five members of a cyber division thought to be working out of the same military organisation, known as Unit 61398, for alleged breaches of six US organisations. The attacks, detailed on Monday, are said to be the work of Unit 61486, and primarily sought to steal trade secrets of private and public bodies operating in the satellite, aerospace and communication industries, according to US firm Crowdstrike. Two separate sources familiar with the activities of the group, which is known as Putter Panda and has been operating since at least 2009, told the Guardian it had attacked companies within the UK. It\u2019s also believed Units 61486 and 61398, the latter also known as APT1, are closely linked. \u201cWe do track hundreds of threat actors and this group [Unit 61486] would be covered in our attribution \u2013 they are very close to APT1,\u201d said Jason Steer, director of technology strategy at FireEye. Putter Panda hackers sent emails to targets, attempting to lure them into clicking on attachments that promised information on upcoming conferences, the Crowdstrike researchers said. When the attachments were opened, bespoke malware known as remote access trojans would be surreptitiously downloaded on recipients\u2019 systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Microsoft Office. Crowdstrike went as far as to name Chen Ping, aka cpyy, as one of the main operators within Unit 61486, as he was named as the registrant of the internet domains used to manage the attacks. The company said it was not sure if that was cpyy\u2019s real name. Yet his operational security may not have been up to snuff, as researchers found various clues that linked him to the PLA. These included personal pictures posted across his internet accounts, including an \u201coffice\u201d file that included images linked to PLA facilities in Shanghai, as well as what appeared to be photos from his dormitory room showing two PLA army officer peak hats. The domains he was thought to have registered were linked to an address corresponding to the physical location of the Shanghai headquarters of Unit 61486, in the Zhabei district of Shanghai, the researchers said. Another person was linked to the group, known as httpchen, who had claimed to be attending the School of Information Security Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a \u201crecruiting ground for the PLA to find personnel for its cyber intelligence gathering units\u201d, the Crowdstrike report read. Unit 61486 is part of the PLA\u2019s General Staff Department (GSD) Third Department, the primary intelligence collection and analysis group within China, Crowdstrike said, and supports China\u2019s space surveillance network. Such specific attribution could be incorrect. Security expert Jeffrey Carr said in a blog post the Crowdstrike attribution was not based on sufficient evidence, whilst Steer said it was \u201cvery hard to be able to state with 100% confidence that any group or individual is behind an attack just because of the ease at which it is able to make yourself look like someone else on the internet\u201d. Aviv Raff, CTO of security firm Seculert, which has been tracking the attacks since 2012, said he had also uncovered links to China, but could not prove they emanated from the PLA. A separate report on Tuesday from security company FireEye suggests Chinese hackers are also using social media in their targeted attacks on critical infrastructure providers. It detailed a case involving an unnamed energy company and a fake persona called Emily, a purported job applicant, which was used to contact an employee over social media in an attempt to gather information from the firm. The resume sent by &apos;Emily&apos; via email also included malware, which would install a backdoor on target computers to allow the hackers access. The attacks have been linked to a group called Clandestine Fox, which FireEye believes is based out of China. Some sectors of the security industry and within government are calling on the US and others to apply more pressure on China to curb its digital espionage activity, which the Asian superpower denies ever carrying out. \u201cWe believe that organisations, be they governments or corporations, global or domestic, must keep up the pressure and hold China accountable until lasting change is achieved,\u201d the CrowdStrike report read. \u201cThrough widespread espionage campaigns, Chinese threat actors are targeting companies and governments in every part of the globe.\u201d The Chinese Embassy in London had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.

He would be a Baghdadi flaneur if the security situation let him \u2013 as it is, visits to points of interest are made in body armour. Marozzi has lingered long enough in the city since the 2003 invasion (working on health and education projects) to rally from the near-total absence of a built heritage. He has got to know Baghdad by learning the language, forming friendships and reading the Arab historians of the past. A special kind of romantic conceit is\u00a0essential to the kind of book that Marozzi has written and that the other Middle Eastern cities have inspired. (Philip Mansel&apos;s Constantinople may be the pick of these city portraits, though Simon Sebag Montefiore&apos;s Jerusalem and Max Rodenbeck&apos;s Cairo are also very fine.) Writer and reader alike must be convinced that, in spite of the ravages of\u00a0time, with historic quarters flattened and demographics transformed by massacres, pestilence and flight, the city has not ceased to be what it was when the story began. The aspect changes \u2013 even the name \u2013 but never the soul. Marozzi gets to the unchanging soul of his city through diversions from the main historical narrative into more recent life. The opening of a chapter on Harun al-Rashid is a pretext for a long description of a boulevard named after the great Abbasid caliph, from the Ottomans obliterating medieval houses during construction to a coachman, Sheykhan, who plied it in the 1960s. One of Sheykhan&apos;s regular passengers was a prostitute for whom he would tout by blowing thunderous raspberries, answered by delighted pedestrians. The proverb, &quot;Cairo writes, Beirut prints and Baghdad reads&quot;, draws Marozzi into the &quot;book-lovers&apos; paradise&quot; of Mutanabbi Street, a &quot;maelstrom of activity with booksellers spreading thousands of new and second-hand titles&quot; ranging from the Qur&apos;an to back issues of Cigar Aficionado \u2013 presumably left by the classier sort of American grunt. The nearby Shahbandar coffee house was destroyed in 2007 by a suicide bomb that killed three of the owner&apos;s sons, but he subsequently restored the place to use \u2013 &quot;a tribute to the resilience of Baghdadis, demonstrated with such tragic regularity over the centuries&quot;. The city was founded by the Abbasid caliph Mansur in 762, set within an auspicious Euclidian circle and enjoying the classic Mesopotamian blessings of an excellent water supply, access to the sea \u2013 Basra a short sail down the Tigris \u2013 and proximity to the Mediterranean and the uplands of Asia Minor and Iran. Here was an ideal home for an empire that had united east and west for the first time since Alexander the Great. Goods and people swilled around the\u00a0empire but it was Baghdad that embodied the Abbasids&apos; ambition, a\u00a0magnificent new city drawing in a dramatically variegated population of Arabs, Persians and Aramaic-speaking Jews and Christians. &quot;The stage was set,&quot; writes Marozzi, &quot;for one of the most extraordinary periods in the history of civilization.&quot; The first two centuries of the Abbasid empire marked nothing less than the absorption by Islam of the taste and knowledge of the world. Envoys sent out by the caliphs brought back Indian mathematical treatises, theories of Iranian statecraft and the models for that affable literary mongrel, The Arabian Nights. Most significant of all were the Hellenic acquisitions \u2013 fusty, scholastic Byzantine envoys carried virtually the entire extant corpus of Greek written culture. In time, translation led to Muslim authorship, with the physician and philosopher al-Razi pinpointing the difference between measles and smallpox, and the astronomer al-Khwarizmi popularising the use of numerals. The arts of Baghdad also flourished, Islam fusing with its environment to create a culture of stunning sophistication and beauty, excelling in\u00a0architecture, textiles, ceramics and\u00a0metallurgy. It wasn&apos;t all work, work, work. Marozzi diligently chronicles the caliphal downtime, omitting neither incest (a toe-curling story of a man tricked by his mother first into sex with her and, years later, their daughter) nor scatology (an anally retentive dinner guest, a laxative and a prank that backfires). He mines a 10th-century cookery book for gastronomic details \u2013 Nabatean chicken was a favourite \u2013 and\u00a0table manners to be observed in the caliph&apos;s presence; this is a rich immersion. But the empire&apos;s soft centre attracted a rougher gang from the steppe (inspiring the later north African theorist Ibn Khaldun to an influential cyclical theory of government), as the Abbasids were gradually submerged by the Turkic tribes. The Mongols killed the caliphate in 1258. Hundreds of thousands were slaughtered and the last caliph was starved before being fed a banquet of\u00a0jewels and trampled to death. Tamerlane&apos;s &quot;pilgrimage of destruction&quot; followed a century and a half later, towers of skulls rose around the city and (in the words of an earlier historian) &quot;the land that had once figured as Paradise ... [was] now turned into an arid, treeless desert, across which swept every storm with irresistible force.&quot; Thus, as the Renaissance arrived in\u00a0Europe, Baghdad was snuffed out as\u00a0a\u00a0world city. Contested by the rival\u00a0Iranians and Ottomans, it was estimated to have a population of only 14,000 by the 1650s. At least it retained something of the old mercantile verve, a mixed population sending Arab horses, Egyptian emeralds and Turkish textiles east to India, and caravans of pilgrims to Arabia further south. With the exception of Istanbul, the seat of the Ottomans, the great Middle Eastern cities would suffer from provincial sterility in the 18th and\u00a019th centuries, their destinies bound to an empire being torn by national consciousness among its Balkan subjects, and by European powers professing high-minded concern for minority communities such as the Armenians. Marozzi is good on Baghdad&apos;s minorities, particularly the Jews, with their trading outposts in Bombay, Shanghai and London. (Siegfried Sassoon&apos;s family came to Britain from Baghdad via India.) There were 80,000 Jews in Baghdad before the first world war, and they sat in the Istanbul parliament \u2013 halcyon days before the combined effects of British colonisation, Zionism and Arab nationalism ended the Jewish presence for good. When Marozzi arrived in Baghdad in 2004, the community was seven-strong. I once had an Arabic teacher in London who was a Baghdadi Armenian. The former head of the Iraq national museum, the admirable Donny George, was an Assyrian. This is the kind of cosmopolitanism that has no place in the new Iraq, where nihilistic groupthink is driving away the minorities that Saddam Hussein \u2013 for cynical reasons of his own \u2013 wanted to keep. The diversity of Baghdad was once the city&apos;s greatness; it has become its flaw. The crucial line now is between Sunnis and Shias. The feeling among many Sunnis is that the Shias are neither true Muslims nor true Iraqis; rather, they are loyal to the &quot;Magian insects&quot; \u2013 as an Iraqi commander described his Iranian Shia foes in the war of the 1980s. Under Saddam, the Sunnis were in control, but now the jackboot is on the other foot, with the ascendant Shias driving many of Baghdad&apos;s Sunnis out of their former neighbourhoods and the Sunnis in open (and religiously inspired) rebellion in their provincial strongholds, muttering that it is all a Persian plot. It wasn&apos;t always so. Baghdad&apos;s name comes from old Persian, meaning &quot;God gave&quot;, and the Abbasid capital was a joint production, with imported Persians constituting an invaluable class of mandarins for their Arab rulers. It is an irony of Baghdad that one of the few monuments to survive from the 500-year Abbasid empire, the Mustansiriya theological school, is in stylistic terms an Iranian building. &quot;Defiance and nostalgia,&quot; writes Justin Marozzi, with perhaps more hope than conviction, &quot;are set in every stone.&quot; \u2022 To order Baghdad for \u00a320 with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk.", "tags": ["History", "Religion", "Middle East and North Africa", "Iraq", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-11T14:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/11/guinea-pigs-michael-gove-model-madrasas-our-children-experiment-education-policy", "sentences": ["Gove often refers to our global competiveness but Japan has decided to stop ranking schools, and Shanghai not to publish its schools results."], "title": "The guinea pigs in Gove's model madrasas are our children.

Rooting it out is difficult, as the leader of the cult is the education secretary. To be fair, he is only following in Labour&apos;s interfering footsteps, but every time I think we have reached peak Gove, he pulls off another spectacular. One must be ever-vigilant, for between tussling with Theresa May and semi-combusting about Syria, he is busy meddling with our children. Relax, I say to myself, half of his pronouncements won&apos;t see the light of day. Remember the baccalaureate that was definitely happening? But the man&apos;s meddling never stops. There I was at parents&apos; evening last week, not my favourite night out but something I have been doing for 20 years, when I realised that my youngest is subject to yet more whimsical experimentation. Anxious parents, deeply embarrassed kids mumbling in corridors because they are seen to be in possession of said parents, frantic teachers ticking boxes \u2013 it is always much the same. I only remember over the years the teacher who drank four Red Bulls in 10 minutes, the one who explained she was up for a hearing after accidentally locking two children in a cupboard, and the one who told me he didn&apos;t like reading. Mostly, though, I have sympathy with them as they have to explain the ever-moving targets they are expected to hit. All my children have been subject to &quot;innovations&quot;. My eldest was in the first year that moved to AS-levels \u2013 no more exploring, but straight out of GCSEs and into more tests. My middle one was pushed through certain GCSEs a year early, a practice that they now think is &quot;damaging&quot; \u2013 that whole &quot;gifted and talented&quot; labelling thing, or what the kids called the gin and tonics. The curriculum narrowed under New Labour. This child studied the Nazis three years running, but at least they still did music. Well, drumming. But now my youngest is party to the full Govian mission. Creative subjects are squeezed out and even essays for English language are rendered unreadable as they are no longer about the flow of ideas but a tedious display of metaphors, similes and personification. The lesson that is always drilled home is &quot;tick the box&quot;. Self-expression is the square root of failure. We know that literature has been narrowed; Gove has not banned books, but he has made a range of them harder to teach. No one yet knows what texts my Year 8 child will be doing. They do know that everything will be assessed with exams. Coursework is out. Yep, all of it. On what basis has this been decided? Why the endless homework when it only matters what they do on the day? Why did\u00a0I ever have to help make a mosque out a cereal box or bother taking them to see Shakespeare performed? Exams. Make or break. One teacher told me her\u00a0A-level students have major problems constructing 2,000-word essays and without coursework she is worried they will never learn these skills. Personally, I love an exam. The three Rs \u2013 &quot;ram, remember, regurgitate&quot; \u2013 worked for me, because I hardly went to school and am lazy. But most people see value in both coursework and exams. In the age of the internet, memorising facts is surely but one goal of education. The sheer reach of one man within our education system, a man with no experience of teaching, is incredible. This is not evidence-based policy but pure ideology. We are not Finland, who pay their teachers well; nor Korea, where kids put in 14-hour days; so who are we emulating? Gove is right to be concerned about the 20% of our young people who leave school illiterate and innumerate but none of these measures address what is happening in primary schools. Instead, the discourse of &quot;dumbing down&quot; focuses always on testing and performance. Over-tested children and over-worked teachers are not a good combination. Schools where every pupil is graded in every subject all the time are Gove&apos;s ideal, yet TV programmes such as Educating Yorkshire show the amount of pastoral care teachers also do. This extreme measure of getting rid of coursework at GCSE \u2013 which is said to favour girls and pupils at private schools \u2013 is not demanded by employers. Indeed, what is an MA or PhD but extended &quot;coursework&quot;? Gove often refers to our global competiveness but Japan has decided to stop ranking schools, and Shanghai not to publish its schools results. Systems that are producing the best results do not rely on exams alone. Creativity and critical analysis suffer. But exams offer a kind of fake accountability. Where there should be real accountability, there is none. Via the introduction of academies and free schools, billions of pounds of state assets have been transferred into the private sector. The whole debate about rigour is a sleight of hand for what is really happening: the privatisation and centralisation of state education. If any of this policy had been presented as a coursework essay, it would have failed. There is no evidence, little support, very confused thinking and a refusal to show the workings. How\u00a0are the bottom 20% of kids helped by catering to the anxieties of people who mostly\u00a0use private education anyway? While the future clearly demands agile thinkers, we are sending them into ever more rigid exam sweatshops. The guinea pigs in Gove&apos;s model madrasas are my children, your children.

The quality of our political debate, and by extension our politicians, is a cause for frustration, disappointment and cynicism.  Journalists lament the selfish, short-term gimmicks of political and parliamentary debate. Political parties accuse each other of being captured by vested interests. Meanwhile, the public switches off in droves, leaving both major parties struggling to reach the levels of support that are equated with stable majorities and popular legitimacy. Independent candidates and smaller parties add to the growing unpredictability and confusion of daily politics. The main casualties seem to be difficult, long term decisions taken in the public interest. How to encourage Australian policymakers to take more responsibility on the public\u2019s behalf is therefore a growing preoccupation for some. For example, Ross Garnaut\u2019s recent book, Dog Days, advocates greater reliance on the &quot;independent centre&quot; of academics, journalists and bureaucratic economists clustered around Canberra and other key Australian institutions.  These people, Garnaut argues, are a source of wisdom, rationality and expertise, and can help to counter the short term biases of populism and rent-seeking that have plagued Australia over the last decade. In the book, he appeals to the self interest of the newly elected Abbott government, suggesting that there is long term political advantage to be gained from pursuing difficult decisions in the public interest. He accompanies this pitch with an elegant diagnosis of the problem, writing that &quot;capitalism doesn\u2019t work if all of us seek to maximise our private interest in every interaction with society&quot;. This basic point is right, in keeping with Garnaut\u2019s contributions to the framing of Australia\u2019s response to climate change and our relationships with Asia. The full implications of Garnaut&apos;s proposal demands a wider rethinking of the ways in which the public interest is defined and articulated, a broader range of policy choices, and a much stronger focus on the renewal of Australian institutions in every sector. As Jim Chalmers has recently chronicled, one big cause of the recent political malaise is the aggressive, uncompromising approach taken by many, especially corporations, to asserting their self-interest. As governments try to respond to disruptive changes \u2013 like the global financial crisis, climate change and the impact of the internet \u2013 this approach reduces politics to a public arena for conspiracy and extortion. The media are clearly tangled up in this problem, as different media organisations simultaneously advocate for vested interests, influence public interpretation of politics and compete desperately for people\u2019s attention. The tendency of political reporting to punish uncertainty and exploit ambiguity makes things worse, reducing the discussion of ideas to a form of tactical warfare. Considered policy options are repeatedly dragged through the mud of opinion polling and fiscal costing Australia\u2019s political media has been built around career structures which privilege a few increasingly grumpy voices at the top. It is not an accident that every time the communications channels covering Canberra have broadened, fresher journalistic voices have emerged. Overall, our political culture is being defined by a small group of protagonists who push themselves into the arena, prompting many more to step back instinctively from public life because of the apparently negative consequences of taking part. In this environment, Garnaut is arguing a case for public virtue, and advocating that we place its protection in the hands of elite guardians with the knowledge, confidence and independent status to know what is good for the rest of us. It should come as no surprise to him that, after three decades of continuously promoting competition as the central idea in economic life, the bonds of shared morality and restraint are fraying. Amid these conflicting pressures, the reliance of our policy elites on traditional assumptions about good government and economics risks narrowing the options when the long term public interest demands that they be broadened. For example, a Canberra economist of late 1980s vintage, whose intellect and integrity I deeply respect, recently told an audience that the &quot;worst thing that could happen&quot; would be for Australia to flip back and forth between different policy reforms as governments come and go. This is not the worst that could happen. The Hawke government succeeded by re-instating some of Whitlam\u2019s key reforms and building on them. The worst is that Australia could get on the wrong path and stay there. So Garnaut&apos;s \u201cindependent centre\u201d is essential to the public conversation, but it is currently too fragile and too insular to carry that conversation on its own. Instead, the discussion should be widening to take in what we can learn from around the world and how it could be adapted and combined with Australian strengths. We should learn from Switzerland\u2019s management of its currency to encourage a healthy manufacturing sector. From the way Germany\u2019s universities strengthen its economy. From innovation policy in Israel or Brazil, school reform in Hong Kong and Shanghai. We could even learn from the way that Chile has used its mining income to reduce poverty, or from Seoul\u2019s revitalisation of urban infrastructure.  We should rediscover the fact that public discussion is the most important influence on better government. We could start with the example set by David Gonski, a man who has reached the pinnacle of Australian business but chooses to advocate publicly that schools should be funded according to social need, and dares to criticise both the Liberal and Labor parties for not doing enough to prioritise that need. Or Glyn Davis, head of Australia\u2019s highest status university, who rather than focus narrowly on the interests of his own institution, publicly called for an increase in general taxation to fund education properly. Likewise, Ross Garnaut, since Dog Days was published, has pointed out that keeping the carbon price would contribute as much to the budget bottom line as the \u201csavings\u201d currently being proposed by the government. These are individual acts of leadership. They stand in stark contrast to the many more Australians who have bargained for their own interests while peddling the rhetoric of public interest.  It is not just senior men running big institutions who need to speak up. New voices are needed everywhere. In the long run, Australia\u2019s future depends on a wider sharing of both power and responsibility. That will not happen if we continue to demand that party leader after party leader face the prospect of winning elections without also confronting some hard truths about ourselves as a community. It\u2019s easier to punish a woman who confronts your prejudices than a man with powerful friends who claims to know what he is doing. It\u2019s easier, but it makes us poorer. An honest politics requires an honest media and an honest civil society, where people accept the inevitability of compromise and failure, share responsibility for solving problems and listen to each other for long enough to form reasoned conclusions. Relying on the mandarins to run the place on our behalf will never be enough. These practices are not abstract virtues controlled by distant rulers \u2013 they are everyday aspects of our own culture, reinforced by the way we do our jobs, talk to our families, and choose to spend our time. This is where the sense of fairness is cultivated. The roots of our political culture are still in everyday conversations in bar rooms, classrooms, surgeries, at board tables and dinner tables. Changing them is not the exclusive preserve of our professional political class.  Yes, we should expect politicians to do better; to lead is to change the culture. But an engaged population will also need to respond differently. That means confronting real injustices, and giving the benefit of the doubt to politicians who stumble while trying to do the right thing. The Abbott government is a slow motion, multi-vehicle pile-up. It is not going to deliver on the aspirations of a decent majority for a better life. Doing better will mean extending renewal beyond parliament and the parties into journalism and academia, companies and unions, bureaucracy and community organisations.  If we, as members of a community, are not prepared to use our minds and our voices, we will get the politicians we deserve. Don\u2019t let it happen.

A circular solar field of 2,650 heliostat mirrors covering 185 hectares concentrates the sun&apos;s energy onto the central receiving tower, where the intense heat generated is stored using molten-salt heat storage technology. The heat collected by the salts, capable of reaching temperatures above 5,000C, generates steam and produces electrical power. The surplus heat accumulated during sun hours is stored in the molten-salt tank, allowing Gemasolar to generate electrical power 24 hours a day for many months of the year. Solar efficiency guarantees electrical production for 6,500 hours a year. This provides 1.5 to 3 times more power than other renewable energy sources. The plant could supply clean, safe power to 25,000 homes and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 30,000 tonnes a year.

Chatwin&apos;s work includes the late-1970s travelogue In Patagonia, and Bailey was interested &quot;in his nomadic lifestyle, the idea of his easy spirit,&quot; he said, &quot;although in reality he was a complex character.&quot; The cursive script used across the collection was inspired by earlier vintage book jackets, from the 1940s: &quot;The labels and graphics were much more playful then,&quot; said Bailey, whipping out his iPhone to show a photograph of some of the books he had used for inspiration, including English Fashion, English Children and British Universities. Though travel is a perennial fascination for Bailey, for Burberry all roads lead back to Britain; a recent show in Shanghai, for example, saw models dancing with umbrellas, one of which carried model Cara Delevingne into the ether like Mary Poppins. This retro, elegant idea of Britishness is a core component of the company&apos;s continuing success in China and will be key to Bailey&apos;s ambition to strike it big in Japan. Bailey added the role of chief executive to his existing job of chief creative officer last month, following Angela Ahrendts&apos; departure for Apple. His status as one of the most powerful people in global fashion was confirmed by a pay deal worth up to \u00a38.1m per year. As befits the driving force of a global mega-brand, Bailey&apos;s backstage vision was clear and unambiguous, a sharp contrast to the other most-anticipated moment on Tuesday&apos;s schedule, the first solo show from 27-year-old rising star Craig Green. In the past, Green has showed his collections as part of talent-fostering initiatives Fashion East and Topshop MAN. His radical designs have charmed critics while being deemed bizarre by much of the mainstream press, featuring models wearing huge facial sculptures fashioned from reclaimed plywood. Models in Tuesday&apos;s show marched down the catwalk wearing one colour head to toe, with hues ranging from white to cobalt blue to black. Garments were designed to be &quot;flat pack&quot;, created from distinct pieces tied together with dozens of bows. There were fluid, martial arts-style jackets and trousers, plus padded segments tied together at the sides, inspired by the clothes worn in medieval fencing. Billowing shirts were layered one on top of another, while a few tight tops with cut out sections, paired with fisherman-type trousers, added a hint of 1990s raver to an otherwise loose silhouette. The wooden structures that fascinate Green played a part with a handful of models \u2013 one wearing each of the collection&apos;s key colours \u2013 taking the role of bannermen, wearing a huge frame from which fabric billowed like a flag. Backstage, overwhelmed by the rapturous reception, Green told himself off for &quot;getting a bit deep&quot; when talking about the clothes, explaining that there was a feeling of &quot;silent protest&quot; in the show. Looks were styled to feel &quot;finished a bit raw&quot;, the fabric ties affixed loosely to create an &quot;exploded&quot; version of pieces that might be neater and more wearable in the real world. It was ambiguous and fascinating, the perfect presage to the glitz and pomp of Burberry. All in all, it spoke of a London menswear scene in rude health, more than capable of fulfilling those who like their fashion radical and the outr\u00e9, as well as satisfying the fashion establishment.", "tags": ["London Collections Men", "Burberry", "Men's fashion", "Fashion weeks", "Fashion", "Retail industry", "Business", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-17T17:39:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/jun/19/andreessen-bitcoin-surfacepro", "sentences": ["E-Commerce gives a lift to China&apos;s rural farmers &gt;&gt; Businessweek  The online grocery, officially known as the Young Village Officials&apos; Farm, has customers in Beijing, Shanghai, and elsewhere, and about 10,000 followers on Weibo."], "title": "Boot up: on Andreessen, tweaking Bitcoin?, Surface Pro 3 (and con)", "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Dear Marc Andreessen &gt;&gt; Alex Payne Former Twitter-staffer and occasional angel investor Payne comes not to praise Andreessen:   I grew up using your work.

Bitcoin may be altered after fears of manipulation by powerful players &gt;&gt; MIT Technology Review Tom Simonite:   postdoctoral researcher Ittay Eyal, told MIT Technology Review that the Bitcoin protocol should be updated to prevent mining pools from being able to amass so much computing power. Discussion about how to do that has begun, but no easy-to-implement front-runners have yet emerged. There is also little precedent for such a tweak to Bitcoin&apos;s design, Eyal says. &quot;A change like that has to be done extremely carefully,&quot; he says. &quot;At its core right now Bitcoin mostly works according to Satoshi Nakamoto&apos;s original paper.&quot; The process is complicated by the fact that any such change could potentially invalidate much of the specialized hardware that bitcoin miners have built up over the years and that powers the processing and verification of bitcoin transactions (see &quot;Custom Chips Could Be the Shovels in a Bitcoin Gold Rush&quot;). &quot;That industry is the reason that Bitcoin is secure, and so it needs to be kept happy,&quot; says Eyal.  Microsoft&apos;s Surface Pro 3 is better than Apple&apos;s MacBook Air - here&apos;s 5 reasons why &gt;&gt; Betanews Brian Fagioli:   The Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and Apple MacBook Air are great\u00a0balances between portability, power and cost. Yes, there are more powerful computers, but they are often very heavy and have terrible battery life. Portability cannot be underestimated when it comes to a laptop&apos;s value and both of these machines are super thin and light.\u00a0Last month, my colleague Mihaita pondered the question of which was better based on specs alone. However, as someone who has used both, hands-on, for long periods of time, I am ready to definitively tell you that the Surface Pro 3 is better. Do you agree?  One question: if the Surface Pro 3 is a tablet - and Fagioli insists so - where is its array of truly tablet-focussed apps (besides those for cartoonists)? Does it have an array of touchscreen-focussed games, and apps designed with tablet use in mind? (Thanks @EasilyLead for the link.) Microsoft&apos;s Surface Pro 3 isn&apos;t for everybody &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com Farhad Manjoo:   For the better part of a month, I&apos;ve been trying to replace the laptop that I use for my daily work, an Apple MacBook Pro, with Microsoft&apos;s new tablet computer, the Surface Pro 3. I say &quot;trying&quot; because that&apos;s what it has felt like; this is a machine that I&apos;ve had to put a lot of work into adjusting to, in the hope that, at some point, I&apos;d get used to it and see some kind of payoff. In the end, I didn&apos;t see that payoff. My time with Microsoft&apos;s new tablet computer began with a feeling of minor annoyance and eventually leveled off into a sense of settling for something less than ideal. I never felt fully at ease with the Surface Pro 3, and I&apos;m typing this review on the MacBook. But don&apos;t let my experience put you off from trying the Surface Pro 3. In fact, I encourage you to think of this review as something like a George Costanza breakup: Dear Surface Pro 3 \u2014 we&apos;re not right for each other, but it&apos;s not you, it&apos;s me.  Well, specifically, it&apos;s the keyboard and trackpad. And a couple of other things. Pantech survival hinges on wireless operators &gt;&gt; Korea Times  The fate of debt-ridden Pantech hinges on the country&apos;s three telecom carriers agreeing to turn their accounts receivable into equity capital in the handset maker. If they do not, the nation&apos;s smallest smartphone maker will either be sold to a foreign company or go bankrupt. The Korea Development Bank (KDB), the key creditor bank of Pantech, has asked SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus to take part in a capital-increase plan to addressing the debt of the handset maker. The three have a total of 180 billion won [about $175m] in accounts receivable.

Google faces fresh antitrust complaint in Europe &gt;&gt; WSJ  Google is facing fresh accusations of anticompetitive behaviour in Europe over its Android operating system for mobile phones, even as the web giant struggles to overcome separate concerns over its dominance of online search. In a complaint it said it filed with European Union regulators on Monday, Aptoide \u2014 a Portuguese company that runs a marketplace for mobile applications, or app store \u2014 claims that Google is abusing its dominant position in the smartphone market to push users away from app stores that rival its own, Google Play. &quot;We are struggling to grow, even to survive, in the face of Google systematically setting up obstacles for users to install third-party app stores in the Android platform and blocking competition in their Google Play store,&quot; said Paulo Trezentos, Aptoide&apos;s co-founder and CEO. The Lisbon-based company, which says it has six million unique monthly users, said it planned to &quot;join forces with other independent app stores to forge a common front&quot; against Google.  Being dominant carries risks, it seems. The Aptoide blogpost is titled &quot;Enough is enough: when Google Evil reaches Android App Stores&quot;. E-Commerce gives a lift to China&apos;s rural farmers &gt;&gt; Businessweek  The online grocery, officially known as the Young Village Officials&apos; Farm, has customers in Beijing, Shanghai, and elsewhere, and about 10,000 followers on Weibo. Twenty-seven farms now fill orders, including that of Li and Cheng, who sell dried radishes. Customers place orders online, and Zhang visits farmers to inform them of the order and work out logistics and shipping. Zhang says the reason for their success is a renewed interest in local farming traditions\u2014which she documents in lush photographs on social media\u2014and strict quality control. Her team inspects harvests and literally throws out bad apples. &quot;We prefer to work with farmers in mountainous regions with better natural environments,&quot; she says. In an area where the average monthly household income is only about 600 yuan ($99), farmers selling produce through the online grocery store can increase their income by a third, according to Zhang. The store&apos;s most popular items include dried bamboo shoots, firm tofu, and jars of honey. Many of the farmers can&apos;t read and have never used the Internet. But they can still reap the economic benefits of e-commerce with the help of younger villagers who &quot;use the Internet on our phones,&quot; says 20-year-old Mu Er, general manager of an inn in Bishan. Zhang sends Weibo postings from her Xiaomi\u00a0smartphone.  This is the true benefit of smartphones and their internet access: bringing economic opportunity to people and places which would have been too remote and too poor for PCs and wired access.

After that, we moved forward \u2013 that was it.&quot; Fay Ballard, daughter of the writer JG\u00a0Ballard, is describing what happened when her mother, Mary, died of pneumonia, aged 34, on a family holiday in Alicante, Spain. After the burial, her father drove Fay, her sister, Bea, and brother, Jim, home to England. Fay was seven years old. She recalls a doctor visiting their holiday apartment and her mother&apos;s fight to breathe with the aid of an oxygen cylinder; and, finally, her father emerging from the bedroom, holding his children tightly and saying, &quot;She&apos;s dead.&quot; &quot;My father was the most wonderful, loving, brilliant father,&quot; she says, &quot;but we never talked about our mother. Not once. We couldn&apos;t discuss her with the wider family either. I never discussed her with Bea or Jim. I felt very awkward if her name ever came up. I buried the trauma deep inside of me.&quot; After her father died of cancer in 2009, Fay, who is an artist, came across some family photographs of her mother that she had never seen before when she was cleaning the family house in Shepperton, Surrey. &quot;I wanted to bring her back to life,&quot; she says. &quot;The only way to do that was to start drawing her. I found the process very cathartic. I put these photos up in my studio at home and started living with them, getting used to them. I started talking to her, as if she were there in the room with me.&quot; Her mother has been a blank canvas to her and now she is starting to sketch in some details. &quot;There was a collection of small black-and-white snaps of my mother playing with my brother, Jim, and me on Prestatyn beach in north Wales. My mother is fooling around with us on the sand, playing on all fours and pulling funny faces \u2013 my first direct insight into her personality. &quot;There was also a box of colour slides of the holiday in Alicante in 1964, taken before she died. When I opened the box, I cried. Here she is with us three children, standing in front of a cracked, dried-up river bed, smiling at the camera, arms round us.&quot; I meet Fay, 57, at the Eleven Spitalfields gallery in east London where her exhibition of artwork relating to her parents is on show. There is a heart-breaking yearning in these pencil and watercolour drawings of objects that evoke memories of her parents, Fay somehow trying to conjure her mother through Mary&apos;s powder compact, the Welsh blanket she had slept in or the Staffordshire tea cup that Fay&apos;s maternal grandmother gave her and which she feels Mary had used too. The first object that she started to draw was her mother&apos;s watch, which she&apos;d stolen from the room in the hotel in which she&apos;d died. She&apos;d kept it ever since. &quot;I hid it in a drawer at home \u2013 my\u00a0father must have known.&quot; In her art, Fay, who is also the joint executor with her sister Bea, of Ballard&apos;s literary estate, is echoing the work of her father, whose protagonists are often engaged in a desperate search for meaning following some catastrophic event, and who have to adapt to a harsh new environment. None of the pictures in the gallery are of her parents together; they are isolated and compartmentalised. Fay has called the collection House Clearance after the auctions she remembers buying furniture from when the Ballards didn&apos;t have much money. &quot;I saw her as fragmented,&quot; she says of her mother. &quot;I remember her Playtex girdle, her breasts, but I don&apos;t think of her as a whole person. I&apos;ve still got to work that through.&quot; Perhaps the most powerful images are of her mother and father holding her as a baby. Behind is a statue of the sphinx, a menacing portent of what was to come. She has entitled them Omen (i) and (ii).     Omen, Fay's drawing of her mother, holding her as a baby in front of a sphinx.     &quot;It was only after my father&apos;s death in 2009 that I found a sense of release but also urgency, wanting to learn more about my mother.&quot; She had read Ballard&apos;s autobiography, Miracles of Life, when it was published in 2008, which contained a chapter devoted to her mother. The information, including a photograph she had never seen, was almost all new to Fay. She learned that her parents had met in a London hotel and that Mary had worked as a secretary at the Daily Express for Charles Wintour. She had always thought that her mother had been a nurse and met her father at Cambridge where he studied medicine. But Fay felt awkward and embarrassed; it was a subject she couldn&apos;t discuss with him. The drawings of her brother Jim&apos;s flipper, which he&apos;d worn on holiday in Spain \u2013 and used from the early 1970s as a doorstop at Shepperton \u2013 appear also to be of a hooded woman whose face is a void. This absence is also apparent in other drawings, such as one of her mother&apos;s swimming cap. Then there is a lemon that was kept on the living room mantelpiece \u2013 for 40 years. There&apos;s something oddly surreal about some of these images. Given that her father wrote novels such as Crash, which dealt with the sexuality of car crashes, and The Atrocity Exhibition, growing up, Fay had access to books other than Enid Blyton. &quot;I liked these strange crash injuries or plastic surgery books because the images were so vivid and arresting. And the surrealist art books, including Max Ernst and Ren\u00e9 Magritte.&quot; She says that the flipper &quot;is a sort of Dada joke. Maybe it references swimming pools in his work ...&quot; She didn&apos;t read any of her father&apos;s novels until she went to university, where she studied history of art. &quot;I felt that it would be like opening a drawer in his bedroom and reading his love letters. Too personal, too intimate.&quot; Fay is aware of the slippery nature of some of her memories. For example, there is a drawing of an origami elephant that she is convinced she and her dad made together but when she looked through the origami book that they used, there was no elephant in it. &quot;This is the thing about memory: it&apos;s part fiction, part reality.&quot; All through her 30s, Fay had a recurring nightmare of a large black cloud that got bigger and bigger and started to press down on her with such force that she would wake up in a cold sweat. She saw a therapist about the dream and it eventually went away. But after her father&apos;s death, she experienced a different recurring nightmare. &quot;I started to have these very strange swimming pool dreams in which I was in a pool full of excrement and all this horrible stuff, unable to swim freely.&quot; It&apos;s hard not to see this as being connected to one of her father&apos;s signature images \u2013 that of a drained swimming pool. Did she ever feel angry with him for not being able to talk about her mother? &quot;No, I was more ... sympathetic. I can understand that as a man left with three children to bring up, you have to make these choices, and it was partly a convention of the time and he felt he had to move on.&quot; There were also her father&apos;s brutal war-time experiences in Shanghai \u2013 he was interned by the Japanese as a boy from 1943 to 1945 \u2013 to take into account. Though it&apos;s clear that this was a traumatic experience for Ballard, Fay says that he actually quite liked being in Lunghua camp and based his novel Empire of the Sun on that time. &quot;It was the first time he&apos;d been so close to his parents, living in the same room. His parents before that were quite remote and he was looked after by his White Russian nanny, Vera. He had a very different upbringing to us. But I remember in the summer of 1976, in Shepperton, he was naked the whole time, walking around the house. It was very funny. He used to go into the garden and the neighbours would complain. The complete opposite to how he grew up \u2013 this cathedral school boy living a very formal upper-middle class life. He really broke away from that.&quot; In 2008, when Ballard became too ill to look after himself, he moved in with his long-term partner Claire Walsh. Fay helped him move, and when she went to pick him up from the family home in Shepperton, it was the first time she had been there in 15 years. &quot;He always preferred to meet in town,&quot; she says, &quot;usually with Claire and often in a Chinese restaurant, or he&apos;d visit me at home.&quot; One of only two artworks on display to feature any colour is Farewell, based on a picture she took of her father looking out from his study into his wild, overgrown back garden for the last time. &quot;I&apos;m really fascinated by the house and these objects, and what they mean. Was he trying to arrest time, was he creating this timeless zone in this house? Or were these objects just not important to him? To me they unlock so much memory.     Fay Ballard in her garden with a sculpture JG Ballard made in the early 1960s. Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian    &quot;There were certain things \u2013 like the flipper and the lemon \u2013 that he did allow to be covered in dirt or dust because they weren&apos;t part of the house. They were something else.&quot; Fay visited Shanghai a couple of years ago and the house her father grew up in. A waitress who showed her round the building, now a restaurant, also took her next door to see where she lived. Fay was amazed to find how uncannily similar her kitchen was to their kitchen at Shepperton \u2013 yet more evidence, she feels, of her father recreating Shanghai in Shepperton. &quot;It had the same black and white chequered line, the same white tiles, the same wooden cupboards with mottled glass,&quot; she says, incredulously. In Miracles of Life, Ballard argued &quot;At least my girls were spared the stress that I noticed between many mothers and their daughters as puberty approached&quot; and there are similar rationalisations such as &quot;I probably needed them more than they needed me.&quot; Clearly, Ballard tried to blot out many of his experiences. &quot;I remember taking it for granted that there would be whisky on his study table at 9am,&quot; says Fay. &quot;Whisky was a helping friend all day long.&quot; Even in the last few months of his life, when his physician Dr Jonathan Waxman tried to broach the subject of his wife&apos;s death (they were writing a book together), it wasn&apos;t something he could talk about. It was a wound that never healed. Ballard wrote that he often thought his children brought him up in the &quot;chaotic, friendly brawl&quot; at Shepperton, and his fiction is the great counter-example to Cyril Connolly&apos;s enemy in the hallway. Bea has written that Ballard was &quot;our mother and father combined&quot;. &quot;When I reached the age of 34, that was a milestone,&quot; says Fay. &quot;I was overtaking my mother \u2013 a huge moment for me. It was quite healing to have my own children actually [Isabella and Matthew are now 18 and 16 respectively], to feel that I&apos;d become a mother myself. But then I got worried about dying young, of leaving them.&quot; Fay says it has been very hard for her and her siblings to not have a focus for their grief and &quot;perhaps the drawings are the gravestones, where I can lay the flowers&quot;. She has never been to Alicante to visit her mother&apos;s grave and is afraid to go even now. &quot;I&apos;m a bit frightened about how I&apos;d respond,&quot; she admits. &quot;I feel I might break down. I&apos;d have to be feeling in a fairly strong place to go there. But I must go. I have to go.&quot; \u2022 House Clearance is at Eleven Spitalfields Gallery, London E1 until 29 June.

But the budget papers warned the reduction was a \u201cdownpayment\u201d on further cuts to come. The CPSU said a reported government plan to strip an additional $40m to $50m from the ABC budget was \u201cvindictive and savage\u201d. Tull said the cuts were designed to stifle the ABC\u2019s ability to innovate and develop new platforms like iView and News24.

Commissioned by the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, the Lewis report is to give the ABC and SBS options to cut back room functions without cutting programming. No announcements have been made as a result of the Lewis report and it is yet to be released. \u201cThe basic problem for ABC management is that they cannot make budget decisions when the government is not saying what its budget will be,\u201d Tull said. \u201cFor the affected staff \u2013 who are being treated like a political football by the government \u2013 the result is an intolerable situation.

I don't play a role'", "article": "From her vast and airy office, &quot;even bigger than the president&apos;s&quot;, overlooking the Seine, Anne Hidalgo, the first female mayor of Paris, is clearly enjoying her first few months in the job. &quot;There is not one single day when I don&apos;t think what an exceptional job this is. It&apos;s a job where you can really do and achieve something,&quot; she says. &quot;My vision is to make Paris a city of the world that has its history and heritage, its appeal and economic power, but also offers all Parisians a quality of life. It is the challenge of centuries.&quot; So far, the challenges of being the first woman to run the French capital have included defying the French language police to be called Madame La Maire (and not the grammatically correct masculine &quot;le Maire&quot;) and being instructed by the protocol police not to wear trousers to meet the Queen on a recent state visit. Unusually for her, she wore a dress. Asked if she was ordered to curtsey, she laughs: &quot;I&apos;m a good republican. I don&apos;t have to.&quot; In her first interview with a foreign newspaper, the Spanish-born, French-naturalised Hidalgo is warm, open and charming. Yet one interviewer said her voice could send you to sleep and she is often regarded as autocratic, the town hall equivalent of France&apos;s big socialist boss, President Fran\u00e7ois &quot;Monsieur Normal&quot; Hollande. &quot;People want responsible politicians who are themselves, and I am who I am,&quot; is her riposte. &quot;I don&apos;t play a role. If I&apos;d wanted to, I&apos;d have gone into the cinema or theatre \u2026 which, come to think of it, might have been fun, but was not my path.&quot; Relatively unknown outside the gilded corridors of the h\u00f4tel de ville before emerging as the designated successor of the hugely popular socialist mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb, Hidalgo maintains a no-nonsense approach to celebrity. &quot;I haven&apos;t changed and neither has my life. I have my family and the same friends and I still take my son to school. If the celebrity press wants to take pictures of me pushing a trolley around the supermarket, well, I&apos;m not sure it will sell tabloids.&quot; These comments mark a back-to-business approach for Hidalgo after a brutal and closely run mayoral election between two women that at times appeared to focus too much on image at the expense of policy. Though the socialist Hidalgo never appeared in Paris Match wearing a party gown deep in a forest, unlike her centre-right rival Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, her campaign photo was nonetheless criticised for being airbrushed. Hidalgo says that her first priority as newly elected mayor is righting inequalities across the city by means of affordable housing. Trying to combat the city&apos;s historic socio-economic east-west divide, the divide at the heart of Victor Hugo&apos;s Les Mis\u00e9rables, is a lofty ideal. It is also likely to be met with opposition from the leaders of the city&apos;s wealthy western arrondissements, who in the past have resorted to France&apos;s plodding legal system to block attempts to create council houses on their patch. &quot;The social mix of classes comes about through housing and we need more council housing in the west of Paris,&quot; says Hidalgo, whose power does not stretch to the run-down outer city banlieues. &quot;This was a campaign promise and I have made this my objective.&quot; Immigration and inequality are subjects that Hidalgo can talk about with some authority. Her paternal grandfather fled General Franco&apos;s fascist Spain in 1937, taking his family on a donkey across the Pyrenees. Homesick, he returned two years later, but his wife died on the journey and he was jailed. His children, including Hidalgo&apos;s father, were placed in an orphanage and outcast as the &quot;children of Reds&quot;. Hidalgo&apos;s parents left for France in 1961 and settled in Lyon with their daughters when Ana, as she was then known, was just two years old. &quot;For my father, France was the country of Victor Hugo, the country that had given him refuge when his republican parents were forced to flee Franco&apos;s massacres,&quot; she wrote in her book Mon Combat pour Paris (My Fight for Paris). Her childhood in &quot;rabbit cage&quot; homes on gritty French housing estates alongside other \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Armenia, Portugal, Italy, Russia and north Africa gave her a first-hand interest in town planning. Graduating with degrees in social services and law, she headed for Paris and a civil servant post as a works&apos; inspector. After &quot;retiring&quot; as a bureaucrat, she became deputy mayor in 2001. She has a grownup son and daughter from a first marriage, and a 12-year-old son from her second. The whole family, including her parents, now in their 80s, and her older sister, who lives in the US, came to Paris for the mayoral campaign. As she talks, Hidalgo gestures as if forming ideas with her hands, in a way one French journalist described as &quot;like making pottery in the air&quot;. &quot;The worst moment was waiting for the result. I was confident of winning right through the campaign until just before it was announced. Bertrand Delano\u00eb, who is naturally pessimistic, had prepared me for the worse, saying perhaps I wouldn&apos;t win. Then he rang me that evening, just as I was having doubts, and said: &apos;You will be mayor of Paris.&apos; Then the result fell and it was a liberation. It was just an enormous moment.&quot; Just back from a visit to New York, where new Democratic mayor Bill de Blasio described her as a political soulmate, Hidalgo blew on the embers of Anglo-French hostility almost as soon as she was elected in January when she claimed, &quot;London is a suburb of Paris&quot;, before adding the conciliatory, &quot;and Paris is a suburb of London&quot;. Hidalgo says she is happy to come to London to see Boris Johnson. &quot;Or perhaps Boris will come here. I met him many times when I was deputy mayor, he is \u2026 er \u2026 eccentric.&quot; Anxious not to create another international spat, she adds quickly: &quot;This is, of course, a personality trait we like so much about you British.&quot; Hidalgo says she likes to think that the London-Paris relationship is complementary; that seen from Shanghai, they are both equally worth a visit or an investment. &quot;Of course we like the competitive edge, and that&apos;s normal and makes life so much more interesting. I know Boris likes to be competitive, but so do I.&quot; However different their vision of the competition itself, a Boris v Anne match is an interesting prospect.", "tags": ["Women", "Paris", "France", "Women in politics", "Boris Johnson", "Gender", "World news", "Politics", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2014-06-23T17:17:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/24/was-academy-chain-warned-multi-inspection", "sentences": ["Liz Truss, Norfolk MP and education minister; Sean Harford, head of Ofsted in the region; and Dame Rachel de Souza, Inspiration chief executive, recently all went on a fact-finding trip to Shanghai."], "title": "Was academy chain warned about its multi-inspection?", "article": "Did chain get extra notice of inspections? One of England\u2019s largest academy chains has become the second to undergo a multi-inspection blitz by Ofsted, Education Guardian can reveal. But was the Kemnal Academies Trust tipped off about the visits in advance? Ofsted has confirmed that Kemnal, which has 39 academies, received visits at six of its schools, starting on 11 June. The co-ordinated inspections were the second of their kind, following a swoop on the E-Act chain in January and February, as revealed by this column. Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, recently reiterated a call for inspections to be carried out on a \u201cno-notice\u201d basis, and schools are usually notified only the day before that a visit will be taking place. However, a teacher at one of Kemnal\u2019s schools tells us that the headteacher told a staff meeting on 6 June, five days before the inspections started, that \u201cOfsted has been in contact\u201d with the chain about plans to inspect its schools. An email sent by the head to staff, dated 12 June, appears to confirm this, even though the school itself had not yet been inspected. The email urges staff to be in a \u201cheightened state of readiness\u201d for the inspectors. Isn\u2019t this exactly the sort of preparation that Wilshaw said he was against? Neither Ofsted nor Kemnal responded to our requests for comment. Rumours suggest Norfolk\u2019s fate is sealed Meanwhile, close watchers of education reform will also be scrutinising goings-on in Norfolk this week, when, we have learned, Ofsted will make a return visit to the local authority. Norfolk has been under intense pressure since last year, when the inspectorate strongly criticised its school improvement work. The outcome of the inspection is expected by the end of term. But an intriguing rumour suggests a verdict has already been prepared, with Norfolk to be ordered to work with three \u201cpartner\u201d bodies in its school improvement drive [see footnote]. One of these partners is said to be the Inspiration Trust, the ambitious local academy group sponsored by Norfolk-based businessman Theodore Agnew. Agnew is a Tory donor and non-executive director at the DfE, where he has his own office and secretariat and heads the \u201cacademies board\u201d, promoting academy sponsorship. Liz Truss, Norfolk MP and education minister; Sean Harford, head of Ofsted in the region; and Dame Rachel de Souza, Inspiration chief executive, recently all went on a fact-finding trip to Shanghai. Any further expansion of the trust in this way is likely to increase the scrutiny on these sort of relationships. Mystery over the missing Ofsted report In the spring, this column reported on the strange case of the Ofsted inspection, or inspections, of Oldfield school in Bath, where more than one inspection report was written, but only one was officially ever published. Now we have learned of another case in which a school was inspected without publication of a report. In March, Ofsted visited the Duke of York\u2019s Royal Military school, a state-funded boarding academy sponsored by the Ministry of Defence in Dover, Kent, following safeguarding allegations. But a \u201cbackground note\u201d sent to a parent who raised concerns with her local MP, from the office of the academies minister Lord Nash, says \u201cOfsted\u2019s initial inspection in March 2014 was flawed, and the draft report was not finalised\u201d. Instead, the school was re-inspected in April, and received a \u201cgood\u201d verdict overall. What did the first report say and why was it flawed? Ofsted will not comment, replying that \u201cvery occasionally\u201d some reports are found to be flawed. The note from Nash\u2019s office also refers to a comment on a blog about an alleged incident of a pupil \u201cself-harm[ing] through an overdose\u201d. The note concludes: \u201cWe have discussed this with the MoD sponsor who has assured us that this relates to a historic incident\u201d. The parent says the DfE has not spoken to her. In his letter, Nash says \u201cwe take such allegations very seriously\u201d. Education Guardian understands that, in fact, the \u201cincident\u201d occurred this year. Is this really \u201chistoric\u201d? The DfE said: \u201cAll boarding schools must meet our published set of national minimum standards regarding care of their pupils. Ofsted completed a full inspection of Duke of York\u2019s Military school in April and rated it as \u2018good\u2019.They had no concerns over the handling of specific incidents involving pupils.\u201d Three-way free school row: Gove wades in Three academy organisations are feuding over plans to open a free school on a prized site in south London. But, perhaps unsurprisingly, it is Michael Gove, rather than local residents or their representatives, who may have the final say. In April, a steering group of residents in East Dulwich selected the Haberdashers\u2019 Aske\u2019s Federation academy chain as their preference to set up a new secondary school, which they hope to open from 2016, on the site of Dulwich Community Hospital, which is being redeveloped. Meanwhile, another academy, the Charter School in North Dulwich, is preparing its own bid to the DfE to run a secondary school on the site. However, both the plans may be scuppered by the Harris chain, which has been looking for a site for a free primary. In a letter to Tessa Jowell, the local MP, Gove writes: \u201cMy department has been working with officials in the Department of Health to acquire part of the Dulwich Community Hospital site for the Harris ... primary free school which is due to open in September 2015.\u201d Jowell wrote back to say this was the first she and local people knew about it, and that the site was the only possibility for a local secondary. A DfE spokesman says the hospital is only one site being considered for the Harris school. State school trumpets its sporting strength Ofsted\u2019s report last week on PE \u2013 which lauded private schools\u2019 provision, while offering little analysis of the relative riches of the fee-paying sector, with its rowing, beagling and dressage facilities \u2013 provoked a hostile response in some quarters. The paper criticised state schools where sport was \u201cnot seen as a priority\u201d. But might this be because inspectors do not always view it as one? PE staff at Shenfield high school, an academy in Essex, felt aggrieved. \u201cLast three Ofsted visits have not even spoken to PE at Shenfield. Seven national titles in the last 10 years. No recognition at all,\u201d the PE department tweeted. Although Shenfield\u2019s sporting provision was described as \u201cvery strong\u201d in a 2012 Ofsted report, perhaps its staff have a point. Sadly, the \u201cvery strong\u201d sports judgment could not save Shenfield from a \u201crequires improvement\u201d verdict from Ofsted overall. \u2022 This footnote was added on 12 July 2016. Ofsted found Norfolk county council\u2019s arrangements for supporting school improvement were effective and Norfolk was not ordered to work with the Inspiration Trust.

One answer is to look overseas, to the more dynamic economies of Asia and Latin America, where investment in science and innovation is growing fast. And nowhere more so than China, where research budgets have increased by more than 10% year-on-year since the mid-1990s, exceeding one trillion renminbi (\u00a3100bn) for the first time in 2012. Little surprise then, that the government sees science as one arena where the UK and China can do business. Since October 2013, David Willetts, minister for universities and science, has made three trips to China (one with the chancellor, one with the prime minister and one on his own) to thrash out the details of an ambitious new programme of collaborative research. The broad contours of the Newton Fund were unveiled in April, with a commitment of \u00a3375m over five years, to be spent on joint projects. These will be cofinanced by the UK \u2013 from the budget of the Department for International Development (DfiD) \u2013 and a targeted group of fifteen emerging powers: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam. China will account for the largest slice, when last week it signed an agreement for a UK-China research partnership worth \u00a353m to help fund projects on climate change, energy and human diseases. A significant shift  Asking emerging economies to match the UK&apos;s investment, as equal partners, is a significant shift from the traditional model of science and technology capacity-building as part of overseas aid, even if the UK&apos;s share is coming from DfID. But persuading the Chinese to buy into this hasn&apos;t been easy: at a Foundation for Science and Technology dinner last week, Willetts joked that getting the funds from Beijing &quot;was like excavating concrete with nail scissors&quot;. Now that the funding is in place, the next challenge comes in determining how best to align UK and Chinese strengths, weaknesses and priorities across the research and innovation value chain. This process needs to take account of risks as well as opportunities, given persistent concerns over intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer and cybersecurity. How to design and manage this process of targeted collaboration is the focus of China&apos;s Absorptive State, a report I co-authored last year for Nesta \u2013 a charity that invests in innovative projects. The report reviews developments across China&apos;s research system, and identifies ways in which UK-China collaboration can become more strategic. It includes fresh bibliometric analysis, and shows that the UK has, for the first time, overtaken Japan as the second most frequent source of co-authored academic papers with China (behind only the US). However, this collaborative map is uneven: in certain fields, such as engineering and computer science, about 8% of the UK&apos;s research base is now involved in some kind of collaboration with China. But in others, including the social sciences, there is still huge potential for more UK-China partnerships. Scope for collaboration in social sciences Links across the science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines understandably attract most of the attention in any discussion of UK-China collaboration \u2013 particularly as so much of China&apos;s own funding is concentrated on science and engineering. But given the UK&apos;s enormous strengths across the social sciences, and China&apos;s comparative weakness, the scope for productive collaboration is clear. There are a number of areas, including sustainable cities, public health and low-carbon innovation, where the UK can offer China unique interdisciplinary strengths, which span the natural and social sciences. The Newton Fund should provide the mechanism for these opportunities to be realised. My advice to smart UK researchers is brush up your Mandarin and get ready to spend a lot more time in Beijing and Shanghai.

Clinton castigates the Chinese government for censoring a broadcast of her 1995 address to the UN conference on women in Beijing, and dedicates a chapter to negotiations over the blind activist Chen Guangcheng, who sought asylum at the US embassy in spring 2012, threatening a diplomatic falling out. &quot;It&apos;s outrageous and unfortunate,&quot; the Simon &amp; Schuster president, Jonathan Karp, told Buzzfeed. &quot;And it&apos;s a pretty clear indication of the low level of intellectual freedom in China right now.&quot; Karp said Chinese publishers had turned down translation rights to the memoir, and one of China&apos;s largest import agencies, Shanghai Book Traders, had refused to distribute English copies of the book, despite its bestseller status abroad.

The movie business is treating the clean sweep as a sign that its strategy for balancing the entertainment requirements of the world&apos;s two largest markets is paying off. Hollywood is devoting resources and star power to breaking open the tightly controlled region. Earlier this month, Jolie, Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Mark Wahlberg and Johnny Depp all went to China to support releases that could add up to a quarter of takings. Seducing the Chinese market can be as simple as adding Chinese locations, such as in the recent James Bond film Skyfall. In X-Men: Days of Future Past, half an hour of action takes place in Hong Kong, with Chinese star Li Bingbing and a Chinese boyband added to the superhero mix. With relations between Washington and Beijing tense, Hollywood&apos;s wooing of China can be similarly fraught. Two years ago, Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Django Unchained was yanked from cinemas after censors claimed it showed scenes too violent for Chinese audiences. Until its scheduled release last month, Warner Brothers was uncertain whether censors at China&apos;s state administration of press, publication, radio, film and television would permit the release of Godzilla, given its heavy association with Japan and the tension between Beijing and Tokyo over maritime territories. Disney was concerned that Jolie&apos;s recent comments on the political sovereignty of &quot;self-ruled Taiwan&quot; might keep mainland Chinese viewers away. But Maleficent still took a respectable $22m at the Chinese box office after Jolie, husband Brad Pitt and several of their children shared a birthday cake with a crowd in Shanghai and took lessons in making dim sum. Hollywood&apos;s current success will partially settle fears that it was losing ground to domestic Chinese releases. US film studios are counting on increased foreign sales to offset a decline in American cinema visits and the virtual collapse of the DVD market. The Chinese market was worth $3.6bn in ticket sales last year \u2013 more than enough to warrant substantial plot changes to appeal to Chinese filmgoers. US film executives are urgently looking to make deals in China. Last week Jeff Robinov, a former Warner Bros president known for approving the Matrix series, The Lego Movie and Gravity, signed a $1bn deal with Chinese investment giant Fosun to make films in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Some executives say the deal could help film-makers get around Chinese rules that limit the number of foreign-made releases in the country to 34 a year. But with Chinese films&apos; box-office share down 12% in the past year to 40%, there may be renewed efforts to counter the US invasion. Critics warn that Hollywood&apos;s closer ties with Beijing could mean that film-makers are less willing to touch on sensitive topics such as the Dalai Lama, the Falun Gong sect, and the Chinese market for rhinoceros horn, ivory and other items from critically endangered species. How much western culture Chinese audiences are willing to consume \u2013 and how much censors allow \u2013 is open to question. Disney recently announced an $800m deal with a Chinese consortium of state-owned companies to boost investment in Shanghai Disneyland, increasing the number of rides when it opens next year.

It is the latest chapter in a lurid bribery saga which continues to rock the pharmaceutical giant. The secretly filmed video of Mark Reilly and his Chinese girlfriend at his Shanghai apartment was emailed to 13 GSK executives in March 2013, including the chief executive, Andrew Witty. Accompanying the footage were detailed allegations of sales and marketing practices described as &quot;pervasive corruption&quot; by an anonymous writer, &quot;gskwhistleblower&quot;, according to a report in the Sunday Times, which first revealed the existence of the video at the weekend. Reilly is accused by Chinese authorities of running &quot;a massive bribery network&quot; and faces a possible jail sentence. He remains a GSK employee, although he stood down last July when the scandal first emerged. His whereabouts are unknown and his lawyer declined to comment. When the sex video surfaced, GSK hired a British corporate investigator, Peter Humphrey, to find out who broke into Reilly&apos;s apartment, according to the Sunday Times. But he was not told about the bribery allegations until two months later. In July last year Humphrey and his wife and business partner, American citizen Yu Yingzeng, were arrested by Chinese police over charges that they had illegally bought and sold personal data of Chinese citizens. The pair were later paraded on Chinese television in orange prison vests and handcuffs when Humphrey said he had obtained illegal information and regretted it. Speaking in Mandarin, Humphrey made no mention of GSK in the &quot;confession&quot; aired on state channel CCTV. A spokesman for GSK confirmed that its China division had engaged Chinawhys, Humphrey&apos;s firm, but declined to comment further on his role. The company said it was continuing to co with the Chinese authorities: &quot;The issues relating to our China business are very difficult and complicated,&quot; it said. &quot;As we have said previously, the allegations that have been raised are deeply concerning to us. We have committed significant resources to find out what happened in China, including an independent legal review. &quot;We also continue to make fundamental changes to our business in China. We are learning lessons from this situation and we are determined to take all actions necessary as a result.&quot; The emergence of the video is yet another setback for GSK, already reeling from allegations that its sales executives paid 3 billion yuan (\u00a3285m) in bribes to encourage doctors to use its medicines. The company has described the reports as &quot;shameful&quot;, but has always insisted there were no systemic problems. Along with Reilly, two Chinese executives, Zhang Guowei and Zhao Hongyan, also face charges of bribing doctors and hospital officials.

While the contemporary art scene in Guangzhou is less pronounced than in Beijing or Shanghai, it is this Cantonese-speaking area that largely spawned Australia\u2019s early waves of Chinese migration from the mid-19th century onwards. That cultural legacy lies at the heart of Yiban Yiban.  &quot;Yiban&quot; is Mandarin for &quot;half&quot;, and &quot;Yellah Fellah&quot; is an Aboriginal term for people of mixed (Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal) descent. Hence this exhibition, curated by the prominent, senior Aboriginal curator Djon Mundine, comprised the work of three Aboriginal artists who also share Chinese heritage: Gary Lee, Sandra Hill and Jason Wing. Lee, a photo artist from Darwin with Aboriginal and Chinese heritage on both his mother\u2019s and father\u2019s side, was represented by two earlier photographs and a selection of 10 works from a new series of portraits, China men, created during a two-month residency he undertook in Beijing in early 2012.      Gary Lee's Kenbi Dancers.    The earlier photographs, Billiamook and Shannon (2006) and Kenbi Dancers (2011), effectively serve to foreground Lee\u2019s Larrakia Aboriginal identity, with enlarged family album-type photographs also shown by Hill and Wing to introduce and personalise their own mixed heritages. Wing has a recent image of himself proudly standing between his Aboriginal and Chinese grandfathers. Hill offers her maternal Chinese ancestry with two historic black-and-white portraits, including her mother and aunties.  Lee\u2019s China men portraits belong to his ongoing street photographic project of celebrating everyday male beauty, with the diverse looks and settings of his subjects praised by Australia\u2019s consul-general in Guangzhou, Dominic Trindade. Trindade, who officially opened the exhibition, appreciated this diversity as an insightful reflection on contemporary Chinese life, and for countering foreign (as in non-Chinese) notions that &quot;all Chinese look the same&quot;. Sydney-based Wing also showed a series of photographs, The Great Wall (2012), produced during a Beijing residency and previously exhibited as part of Making Change. The group exhibition commemorated 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and Australia, and premiered late 2012 at China\u2019s National Art Museum, Beijing.  Wing Dynasty (2013), a photographic self-portrait paying homage to his mixed ancestries (as denoted by national and heraldic flags) was the exhibition\u2019s &quot;hero&quot; image, reproduced on banners and posters around the Redtory precinct and in large-scale on first entering the E9 Gallery. Part of the inspiration for this work was his experience of Chinese classical opera, where the king is festooned with flags identifying clan affiliations.  Hanging directly behind this entry statement is his new photographic work, Snake (2014), a more abstracted self-portrait. In black-and-white, and with his painted face, it bears echoes of Chinese opera while aiming to unify the symbol of his Chinese astrology with Aboriginal totemic beliefs.     Sandra Hill's The Curtain.    Occupying this sizeable gallery\u2019s back walls is a selection of Perth-based Sandra Hall\u2019s more modestly scaled paintings, presented in gilded frames and hung in an almost &quot;salon&quot; style, and suggestive of religious icons. The gallery, a former fish factory, is cathedral-like with its high-vaulted, wood-beamed roof.  With titles such as Once Were Warriors, Wife and Mother, and And Then the White Man Came, Hill\u2019s richly textured and collaged works (including archival images presumably of her Nyoongah forebears around the time of first contact) deal more with the onslaught of colonisation and assimilation than directly addressing mixed Aboriginal/Chinese ancestries. Nonetheless, this sense of being caught between two worlds is conveyed by the derogatory racial connotations implicit in the exhibition\u2019s title. This exhibition grew out of a smaller show, Yuen Yang, co-curated by Mundine and Imogen Young for Sydney\u2019s Art Atrium gallery in 2013, and which included work by Hill and Wing. It also has a thematic precedent in the Speakeasy exhibition co-curated by Vernon Ah Kee and Aaron Seeto for Sydney\u2019s 4A Centre for Contemporary Asian Art in 2009.  However, this showing in Guangzhou, as a significant cultural homecoming for the artists, is unprecedented and was made possible by the diligence and passion of Catherine Croll and Cultural Partnerships Australia. Since 2010, Croll&apos;s program has brokered a range of ongoing exchanges between artists and curators from Australia and China.  The attendance of Mundine, Lee and Wing at the exhibition\u2019s opening is part of a broader exchange program organised by Croll, which included a visit to the Southern Chinese city Kunming. The purpose of the visit was to share ideas and perspectives with minority Chinese artists ,who seem to have a lot less visibility than Indigenous Australian artists within their nation\u2019s contemporary art polity.  As Mundine remarked in his opening speech, \u2018art is a conversation; we are here to start a conversation with you\u2019. Judging by media interest at the opening and by the gallery and overall precinct\u2019s daily influx of visitors, it\u2019s a conversation that many Chinese seem ready to take up.

His mug tells its own little story: Forest supporters have long had to endure chants of &quot;scab&quot; when their team plays around here. The chanters are making an oblique reference to the miners&apos; strike of 30 years ago, even though most Forest fans were never miners and most of the chanters weren&apos;t even born at the time. Buxton, 60, remembers the strike well. He started work here in January, 1984, when he was still living in Retford, Nottinghamshire, and the strike began two months later. &quot;Every time I drove to school, there were lines of police on the county border,&quot; he recalls. &quot;The first few times I was stopped and they&apos;d go through the car.&quot; The men in his family worked at Annesley colliery. &quot;My father insisted that I wouldn&apos;t go down the pit,&quot; says Buxton. Instead he went to teacher training college in London, and by 1984 he had been qualified for seven years.     Ian Buxton, deputy headteacher at Bolsover school, lived in Nottinghamshire but taught in Derbyshire when the strike started. 'There were lines of police at the county border,' he recalls. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    It was a difficult time to be teaching in a colliery town. &quot;Some staff had families split between those who had joined the strike and those who had stayed at work. One member of staff, I remember, had two sons on different sides.&quot; As far as students were concerned, &quot;there was a little bit of tension but it didn&apos;t really come into school that much. We had a sixth form in those days and there were some healthy debates at post-16 level.&quot; Edwina Currie came in to talk to sixth formers, he says. Currie was a Derbyshire MP and a member of Margaret Thatcher&apos;s cabinet. The local MP was, and is, Labour&apos;s Dennis Skinner, a fierce supporter of the strikers. But 30 years on, how much do young people in the former mining towns know about the strike that divided their communities? The answer is not a lot, according to research by Dr Geoff Bright from Manchester Metropolitan University. While the communities are still suffering from the results of the conflict, those still at school know little about the dramatic history of their own neighbourhoods. Bright, a research associate in the university&apos;s Education and Social Research Institute and author of a new book, There&apos;s a Kind of Haunting Going On, spent six years interviewing students in this area who had been excluded or were on the verge of exclusion from school and talking to them about their lives and their communities. The vast majority were boys. At one time they would probably have followed their fathers into mining, for a dirty and hazardous but nonetheless steady living and the opportunity to learn electrical or mechanical skills. But those jobs no longer exist. Mining communities have traditionally been conscious of their shared history. But not now, says Bright. &quot;Kids don&apos;t know their own histories, yet they&apos;re still playing them out,&quot; he says. He cites the way youths from one village will routinely call those from another &quot;scabs&quot;, leading to some &quot;very nasty&quot; confrontations. Their knowledge about the actual events is very limited. Bright is all too aware, though, that telling students what really went on in 1984-5 is not easy, with the sensitivities of parents with long memories and the constraints of the national curriculum. No students from Bolsover school were involved in Bright&apos;s research. Chatting to some of them, though, is fascinating. Ellie Whittaker, 15, was due to answer questions on the American west and medicine through time when I spoke to her shortly before her history GCSE exam. Her father, grandfathers and uncles were all miners. &quot;Grandad Keith&apos;s always going on about it,&quot; she smiles. &quot;He&apos;s got bits of coal in his back.&quot; Was he in or out during the strike? &quot;Not sure.&quot; He was in, as it happens, but only because he was a member of NACODS, the deputies&apos; union charged with keeping collieries safe for strikers to go back to. The rest of the family were all out. So was Jamie Brown&apos;s father, Dave, now chairman of the school governors. Does he talk about the strike? &quot;No. But he did tell me about his accident underground when a machine fell on his leg.&quot; Like Ellie, Jamie has studied the Romans, the Tudors and the second world war as part of the history syllabus. &quot;I am interested in the history of mining, though,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve been underground [at the National Mining museum] in Wakefield with my Mum. Didn&apos;t like the look of it. I couldn&apos;t do a job like that.&quot; Had he been born at another time, he may not have had much choice. As it is, Jamie wants to join the army.     Ellie Whittaker and Jamie Brown, year 11 pupils at Bolsover school, say they have not been taught about the strike or been told much about it by their relatives who took part. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Headteacher Gordon Inglis is conscious of the need to expand his students&apos; horizons, &quot;enabling individuals to fulfil their potential within our dynamic 21st-century economy&quot;, as it says in the school vision. Hence annual trips to Shanghai and a sister school in West Africa, and hence the clocks in the entrance hall telling the time in New York, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong and Sydney. At the same time he tries hard to connect the children with their mining past through extra- curricular projects. By his own admission, though, he is &quot;nervous about upsetting the local community&quot; when it comes to discussing the strike. Bright hopes that his research will make schools and support services in former mining areas more aware of what he calls &quot;the complex consequences of the history of de-industrialisation&quot;. The mining communities, he says, &quot;weren&apos;t just isolated; they were self-contained. They inherited a cultural history that had been handed down orally. Those communities had their own narratives, a sense of their own part in a dangerous and precarious industry.&quot; There is still some awareness of that legacy in areas such as South Yorkshire and south Wales, he says. &quot;But the educational aspirations of kids from former mining towns are still being affected by the positioning of those communities as &apos;the enemy within&apos; by the prime minister of the time, Margaret Thatcher. It&apos;s hard to see that you have a stake in things when your family and community have been positioned like that.&quot; In areas such as Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, meanwhile, Bright believes that children are aware of deep-lying conflicts but unaware of the causes. So is it the job of schools to impart that missing knowledge? &quot;That&apos;s a matter of very fine judgment. If they&apos;re in a position to do that, yes. Schools are under massive pressure to present themselves as a success story. I don&apos;t want to undermine that. I&apos;m simply making the case for complexity. Some would say that this is an issue that has gone, that it&apos;s done and dusted. I would argue that it&apos;s not. It keeps presenting itself.&quot; Chris Arnot is the author of Britain&apos;s Lost Mines", "tags": ["History", "Education", "Schools", "The miners' strike 1984-85", "Politics past", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-01T06:25:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jul/02/istanbul-gentrification-force-locals-angry-luxury-hotels-turkey", "sentences": ["In competition with the likes of Rome, Dubai, Rio and Shanghai, Istanbul is doing just fine."], "title": "Istanbul\u2019s gentrification by force leaves locals feeling overwhelmed and angry", "article": "At a grand ceremony along the Black Sea, Turkey recently marked the start of construction on the world\u2019s largest airport \u2013 six runways and 150 million passengers per year, at a projected cost of about $15bn (\u00a38.8bn). \u201cIstanbul is marking a historic day,\u201d the prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said at the groundbreaking. \u201cWe\u2019re building not just an airport, but actually a monument of victory today.\u201d In 1850, the French novelist Gustave Flaubert predicted that in a century\u2019s time, Istanbul would be the capital of the world. He may not have been many decades off. Since 1970 this ancient, continent-straddling city \u2013 the Bosphorus Strait bisects Istanbul and divides Europe and Asia \u2013 has blossomed from a quiet burg of 2 million to a vast, confident megalopolis of 16 million, stretching across 2,060 square miles: four-and-a-half times the area of New York City. The engine for Turkey\u2019s booming national economy, Istanbul represents 20% of the country\u2019s population and more than 40% of its tax revenues. Economic production has more than doubled since 2004, and now Erdogan is pushing more than $100bn worth of construction projects to the city where he grew up and, in the 1990s, served as mayor. In the shadow of an iconic, minaret-spiked skyline, ageing districts are being rebuilt. Luxury hotels and massive, billion-dollar hunks of infrastructure are rising all over town. Arab sheikhs and other flush foreigners are snapping up million-dollar apartments along the Bosphorus, some overlooking a manmade party island pulsing with revellers into the wee hours. Innovative art, design and dining scenes attract international tastemakers and a travel website recently named Istanbul the world\u2019s top destination for 2014. In competition with the likes of Rome, Dubai, Rio and Shanghai, Istanbul is doing just fine. Yet it\u2019s also seething. Many locals feel overwhelmed and shunted aside by the ongoing makeover, which they view as focusing on profit for the privileged while ignoring the majority. They see disappearing green spaces, overpriced apartments, forced evictions, endless commutes, vast corruption and \u2013 in contrast to America \u2013 the sudden ubiquity of that 1980s retail relic, the shopping mall. It was a proposed mall, to be built on a razed Gezi Park in the centre of Istanbul, that initially sparked protests just over a year ago, which spread nationwide after an aggressive government crackdown and transformed into a fight against authoritarianism. Mass, often violent protests have since waxed and waned, resulting in at least 11 dead, hundreds injured and many more on trial.     Protesters outside Gezi Park. Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters    Rather than quell the antipathy by altering his plans or softening his language, the prime minister has pressed the gas. In 2002, Turkey\u2019s cities issued building permits for 36 million square-metres of space. In the first three months of 2014, that number was 43 million, at a cost of $24bn \u2013 more than double the total spent just a year prior. Erdogan has also sharpened his rhetoric; these days one either supports Turkey\u2019s rise and the remaking of Istanbul, or works to undermine it. \u201cThose who cannot accept [Turkey\u2019s] government want to carry out a coup by using the streets,\u201d the prime minister said recently. \u201cErdogan\u2019s strategy is to consolidate his supporters by making it a black and white discourse,\u201d Yasar Adanali, who studies Istanbul development and teaches urban planning at Stuttgart University, explained during a recent interview at his office in Istanbul\u2019s Karakoy district. \u201cIt\u2019s capulcu versus milli irade \u2013 the \u2018looters\u2019 versus the \u2018national will.\u2019\u201d This dynamic has sharpened to a knife\u2019s edge in Okmeydani, a working-class district near the city\u2019s Golden Horn estuary. In centuries past, Ottoman officials enjoyed various sports in the district\u2019s open meadows, took target practice (Okmeydani means archery field), and held grand public events including circumcisions. Today, the old playground of the ruling elite is densely populated and a bit rough round the edges. On a cloudy, breezy June afternoon, its dusty streets were abuzz with activity \u2013 children kicking a football down a narrow alley, a mussel-seller hawking his wares on the corner, and several open-air markets offering cut-rate clothes on the main drag. Down the street, 37-year-old Zafar Ciger sat in a small teashop overlooking a busy green park and recalled when the government first announced plans to rebuild his neighbourhood, back in 2005. Transformation efforts began that year in Istanbul\u2019s Sulukule neighbourhood, where Roma were forced from homes they\u2019d lived in for centuries. But in Okmeydani, residents united in protest and halted the work shortly after it began. Years of community-municipality meetings followed.     The Zorlu Centre under construction in Istanbul's Zincirlikuyu district. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    Then, two years ago, the government raised the stakes, launching a national $400bn plan to knock down or reinforce all buildings found to be at risk of earthquake damage. The initiative would involve hundreds of thousands of buildings across dozens of Istanbul neighbourhoods, including some 70 hectares of Okmeydani. \u201cOkmeydani will be the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es,\u201d the mayor of Beyoglu municipality, Ahmet Demircan, said in April. Years ago he made a similar remark to promote renewal efforts in Tarlabasi, an Istanbul neighbourhood near Taksim. That area is undergoing renewal today after dozens of low-income families were forced from their homes, according to Amnesty International. Okmeydani is diverse, but its sense of solidarity is strong. At street level, most concrete apartment blocks are spray-painted with phrases in Turkish: \u201cshoulder to shoulder against demolition\u201d; \u201ccome together against fascism\u201d; and the most common, \u201cBerkin Elvan is immortal\u201d, which refers to the 15-year-old who died months after getting hit by a police teargas canister while going to get bread during the protests last June. \u201cThis is a neighbourhood of others: Alevis, Kurds, socialists,\u201d explained Ciger, an accountant and long-time member of a local environmental advocacy group, referring to Turkey\u2019s two biggest minority groups. Okmeydani\u2019s demolition day seemed to inch closer in June, when the municipality declared a vast swathe of the district an earthquake risk zone, paving the way for the destruction of 5,600 buildings. Areas that receive this designation can be redeveloped without the consent of homeowners. \u201cThe most important issue for us is not to lead people to suffer from these projects,\u201d Demircan has said of the neighbourhood transformation plan. \u201cWe have held hundreds of meetings, explained to them our projects and gotten their opinions.\u201d Yet community organisations have filed nearly a dozen lawsuits against the municipality over the years because it has failed to follow the laws on urban transformation. \u201cAfter transformation, where will I live?\u201d said Ciger. \u201cThey are not telling us. They are not following protocol. Nothing is clear about what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Many question the rigour of the risk zone designation. Turkey&apos;s highest court recently found that the designation of another Istanbul district, Tozkoparan, had been based on the inspection of just 14 of the area\u2019s 5,500 buildings, and that these were \u201cvisual inspections, not scientific\u201d.     Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan after laying the first stone of the new Istanbul airport. Photograph: Ozan Kose/AFP/Getty Images    A pro-government newspaper provided an alternative justification for the designation, which now applies to 25 Istanbul districts. \u201cThose districts host shanty neighboruhoods where houses and other buildings lack building permits,\u201d wrote Daily Sabah. \u201cAnother common characteristic of many areas in those districts is that they provide recruitment for terrorist organisations which find support amid impoverished, unemployed youth and children of migrant families.\u201d Whatever the accuracy of this view, in the long run, a certain amount of reconstruction and beautification is probably unavoidable in many of Istanbul\u2019s older neighbourhoods. So too is some demographic change, as central Istanbul districts become increasingly desirable. But Turkey is undertaking gentrification by fiat and force \u2013 a top-down, lightning-fast version of a process that in mature cities happens more organically, and even then often leads to tension and reluctant relocation. \u201cIt is easy for us to pontificate about the beauty, or the horror, of what is taking place in those neighbourhoods,\u201d said Kaya Gen\u00e7, a Turkish novelist who grew up in Istanbul and now lives in the expat-heavy district of Cihangir, which has witnessed some western-style gentrification in recent years. \u201cI think it is for the people living there to decide about the kind of environment they want to live in. If they want transformation, you can\u2019t accuse them of having false consciousness, and if they are against transformation, you can\u2019t just force it on them.\u201d Actually, there is a precedent for precisely that. In the American boom years after the second world war, the US government went on a national crusade of urban renewal, forcing some 300,000 families to relocate and rebuilding more than 2,000 neighbourhoods in dozens of cities. A 2011 study by two Vanderbilt University professors somewhat revived the legacy of these initiatives, finding that urban renewal cities saw greater relative increases in income, population and property values. But there\u2019s little doubt that during the 1950s and 60s the mostly minority residents of these purportedly blighted urban areas were herded like cattle. \u201cSan Francisco is engaging, as most northern cities now are engaged, in something called urban renewal, which means moving the negroes out,\u201d the novelist James Baldwin said in a 1963 interview. \u201cIt means negro removal, that is what it means. The federal government is an accomplice to this fact.\u201d Similarly, Turkey\u2019s government is today bulldozing through many of its less fashionable, minority-dominated urban areas. And just as urban renewal in the US sparked animosity and a reappraisal of city living \u2013 which ultimately led to Jane Jacobs and the urbanist movement that has come to dominate the urbanisation discourse in the west \u2013 Turks are dealing with considerable bitterness, and could be on the verge of similar revelations. More creative responses, however, can be found in innovative organisations such as Design Atelier Kadikoy (TAK, after the Turkish initials). Founded in April 2013 in a smartly renovated former storage depot at the end of a quiet street in Kadikoy \u2013 a lively, liberal district on the city\u2019s Asian side \u2013 TAK is an unprecedented collaboration between a planning consultancy, the local municipality and a cultural and environmental foundation.     A TAK meeting discusses concerns related to Kadife Sokak, widely known as 'Bar Street' on account of its rowdy nightlife    On a recent afternoon, volunteer designers tapped away at laptops in a simple, open-plan office space overlooking a central, skylit auditorium. Over tea in a small conference room, TAK\u2019s two coordinators \u2013 Sila Akalp, an urban planner, and Omer Kapinak, an architect \u2013 explained that TAK aims to improve local quality of life through innovative, collaborative projects. In one initiative, TAK brought nearly 30 designers together to come up with a modern cart for selling simits, Turkey&apos;s famed sesame-encrusted bagel. In another, TAK sought to address concerns related to Kadikoy\u2019s Kadife Sokak, which is widely known as Barlar Sokak (Bar Street) on account of its rowdy nightlife. Locals complained of late night noise, increased petty crime, trash in the streets and heightened tensions between different social groups. After bringing residents, bar owners, street users and officials together for a discussion, TAK designers visited the street then proposed better cleaning and monitoring from the municipality, public art to increase awareness of locals\u2019 concerns, more events along the waterfront to draw people away from the area, and new landscaping, lighting and infographics to foster a more civil public setting. After 15 months, Akalp and Kanipak have learned that working with bureaucracy can be slow-going and that fundraising will be a significant part of their job. But they feel they have begun to make an impact, and after several meetings, are looking forward to working with the new Kadikoy administration, which took over in April. \u201cI feel really positive about this mayor,\u201d said Akalp. \u201cHe consults with people rather than taking his own decisions.\u201d That\u2019s music to the ears of many residents of Istanbul, or any city where domineering officials send locals into the streets with their abrasive, top-down plans.

And ultimately, could it improve outcomes for the residents of urban transformation areas such as Okmeydani? In truth, with so much of Istanbul doing so well, any change is likely to be slow.

An extended meditation on the nature of America | Jeb Lund", "article": "America&apos;s Fourth of July celebrations always provide fodder for uncomfortable conversations. Sure, there&apos;s that sophomore back from college running a Baby&apos;s First Howard Zinn rap to remind you that America owes its entire existence to the French military, a gay Prussian inspector general of the Continental Army, two giant oceans and a genocide. But those aren&apos;t big-picture issues. I&apos;m talking about whether a hot dog is a sandwich. It&apos;s a question widely posed \u2013 and how we approach it speaks to who we are, as individuals and as a nation.  Consider: neither the hot dog nor the sandwich were invented by America, yet we feel a passionate possessiveness over both. (You can turn on the Food Network, the Discovery Channel, CNN or \u2013 by now \u2013 the History Channel and see a show ranking the world&apos;s best sandwiches, all without leaving the continental United States, followed by a nauseating closeup of Guy Fieri&apos;s Baconated Hamape\u00f1o Chipotle-Chicken Despair Ziggurat.) We define ourselves and our sandwiches as much by what they are as by what they are not, finding an identity in both recognition and rejection. Others have engaged the Hot Dog-Sandwich debate in the past, but they have not gone far enough in exploring the scope of sandwich ontology. For instance, my colleague at Sports on Earth, Patrick Hruby, addressed this a couple years ago by citing the dictionary:   According to the American Heritage Dictionary, a sandwich is &quot;two or more slices of bread with a filling such as meat or cheese placed between them, or a partly split long or round roll containing a filling.&quot; Thus, bun-plus-Dodger Dog equals ... Voila!  But appeals to etymological authority get us nowhere. I&apos;ve seen definitions that omit the mention of non-meats (essentially defining the grilled cheese sandwich out of existence) or the presence of a partly split long or round roll (rendering the existence of such manifestly sandwiched meals as the hoagie or sub impossible). Though appeals to history often create stifling parameters, the alleged story of the sandwich&apos;s invention \u2013 the Earl of Sandwich needed a way to enjoy a portable meal without utensils or much mess \u2013 should inform our approach to understanding the sandwich&apos;s apotheosis as, ultimately, an American form pairing necessity with an elegance of individual expression. That the mass adoption of the sandwich during the industrial revolution followed his lead (and provides ample evidence as to the utility and common appearance of the sandwich as a meal) likewise should inform our conceptions of a normative sandwich state.     Joey Chestnut is widely favored to win this year's International Hot Dog Eating Contest again. The contest speaks to hot dogs' portability and minimal mess. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton / Reuters    Thus the Great Hot Dog-Sandwich Debate should be over as soon as it begins: if a sandwich is a portable, relatively tidy meal of meat inside a bread conveyance, the fact that the bun is sliced lengthwise but not all the way through affects nothing in this discussion. The bread is in essence no different when fully sliced and presenting a more familiar sandwich form. To quibble further, one might say, is to simply argue about hinges. Stopping here, though, is actually the action of a fool \u2013 because this conclusion naturally opens up further counterarguments to sandwich ontology that sandwich reactionaries invariably make in bad faith. For instance, the various Charles Krauthammers of the sandwich punditocracy employ the &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument to deny the hot dog&apos;s sandwich-status by going into hysterics (like those parodied by my colleague The Hot Take Man) about a taco being a sandwich \u2013 which, of course, it manifestly is. Sandwich segregationists generally prefer to designate tacos and the like with the separate-but-equal designation of &quot;wraps&quot; \u2013 which is a distinction without a difference. Arguing against the wrap&apos;s inclusion in the sandwich category merely returns us to the hinge contention militating against the hot dog. Its functionality, however, easily demonstrates a means of conveying meat or other fillers with portability and a lack of utensils. Thus, not only is a taco a sandwich, but so is a burrito (and its Levantine antecedent, the gyro) \u2013 the only difference being that one is more neatly packaged than the other, analogous to the difference between a sloppy-pressed reuben and the near-hermetic sandwich tubes of Jimmy Johns. (Meanwhile, the taquito is a finger sandwich.)     Don't pretend this isn't a sandwich. Photograph: Alexandra Grablewski/Getty Images    But! you might protest, what of the nature of the wrap itself? Well, what of it? If you wish to argue that the substance encasing the meat in a wrap cannot qualify as bread because it is too flat, then the rabbi Hillel the Elder&apos;s willingness to dine on unleavened sandwiches over 2,000 years ago dispatches that argument. A flour tortilla is just a flat loaf of bread without yeast in it and, as for a corn tortilla, that is processed just like wheat flour.  (If you, however, wish to argue that it is not the processing but the corn itself that cannot become bread, then you have just radically postulated the nonexistence of cornbread, whose breadedness has heretofore never been in dispute.) Still, there are some limits to what makes a sandwich. The presence of some form of bread alone is not criterion enough. As soon as &quot;bread&quot; transitions from noun to verb form it transgresses the space between sandwich and non-sandwich. Breading food does not make a sandwich, tempura offers no challenge to our understanding, and fried chicken is merely seasoned chicken. Likewise, while the flaky pastry of a Croissan&apos;wich makes for a kind of sandwich, the same pastry baked around a steak filet does not make beef wellington a sandwich. And, despite its possible shape, I cannot agree with my friend that the universe is a sandwich.  Here, then, we can best understand the boundaries of sandwich taxonomy via intentionalism. While breads might abound in the world&apos;s cuisine, whether they are employed as a means of making a reasonably tidy portable meal limns the sandwich classification. Breaking off bits of flatbread to dip into hummus does not create hummus sandwiches. (You know damn well that you are snacking.) On the other hand, a calzone is a sandwich, while a pizza is not. That a diner may adapt the shape of a sliced subsection of the latter to create a portable meal does not reflect the intent of its crafting; that is a secondary, user-generated adaptation. The former, however occasionally ill-crafted, possesses an inherent form that is both portable and independent of utensil intervention. (To argue that the presence of sloppy, boiling-hot calzones belies their sandwich nature is a debate on elaboration, not intention, like saying that a leaky building proves that buildings are not a form of shelter.) This brings us naturally to the biggest red herring of the sandwich debate \u2013 the open-faced sandwich, which, via an intentionalist approach, is not a sandwich at all. The open-faced sandwich is a plate-bound horror, largely dependent on utensils and usually drenched in a humiliating amount or variety of sauces, that, if eaten by hand, make your face look like the aftermath of a hollandaise bombing in a farmer&apos;s market. That an open-face sandwich is named sandwich makes it a sandwich as much as calling the team the &quot;New York Giants&quot; makes the New Jersey-based games played in New York. If we&apos;re going to give open-faced sandwiches whatever vaguely inappropriate appellation we want \u2013 and not something more physically descriptive of their splayed form, like &quot;glutenated lunch vaginas&quot; \u2013 we might as well come closer to the truth. As my friend Chareth Cutestory (a pseudonym) once said before security dragged him kicking and screaming away from a city council meeting, &quot;AN OPEN-FACED SANDWICH IS A PIZZA!&quot;.     This open-faced vegan seitan \"sandwich\" fails as a sandwich, but not because it is made of seitan. Photograph: madprime/Flickr    Please don&apos;t misunderstand me: I argue for these boundaries not because I fear some slippery slope of sandwich identity, but because I want to better appreciate the new sandwiches I encounter and not be led astray by mislabeled foodstuffs that alter our perception of the sandwich universe. I am, at heart, a sandwich expansionist and will always argue for inclusionary sandwichism. But I understand how frightening those ideas are to others whose worldviews have been warped and terrified by Guy Fieri&apos;s &quot;Mondo Pita-Partied Hemorhhagic Meated Wads with Volcano Adobo Mayo and You-Don&apos;t-Know-Chedder-Jack\u2122 Agglutinate&quot;. America is a country founded by people from someplace else on ideas borrowed from someplace else, ultimately to try to distinguish itself from every place else. It is a fraught balance of identity \u2013 to take and be of an other, yet define yourself by contrast to that other. This is the strange impulse of our &quot;exceptionalism&quot;, to always borrow something and modify it slightly, then declare the end result definitively, uniquely American. You can see this at play with the hot dog: the sandwich and sausage were both invented elsewhere, so to celebrate them separately as uniquely American on America&apos;s day of independence would present an empty gesture, immediately undermined by the tools used to make it. Combining the two, however, to create a distinct third entity creates something singularly American in our minds. The hot dog qua hot dog thus becomes a patriotic novelty \u2013 and slamming the door on any debate over its place in a pre-existing internationalist universe of sandwiches allows us to avoid confronting other issues, like the changing nature of what it is to be American. But if we accept that a neat meal package of either hinged or wrapping breads or the classic two-slice model are the ontological bases for a sandwich, suddenly we must introduce new food to that classification \u2013 arepas, banh mi, a disruptive new egg roll out of Shanghai the size of a football or an infant. The sandwich evolves and broadens as we do, without abandoning the intent that informs it and animates it. A hot dog is a sandwich. A taco is a sandwich.

The trial of Peter Humphrey and Chinese-born American Yu Yingzeng will be closed to family members and consular officials &quot;on the grounds of privacy&quot;, said the friend, who requested anonymity because of the case&apos;s sensitivity. The couple were detained last July soon after Chinese authorities accused GSK \u2013 one of Humphrey&apos;s clients \u2013 of bribing doctors and hospital administrators to sell its products. GSK had employed the couple three months earlier to investigate emails containing allegations of widespread bribery at the company \u2013 and a sex tape featuring the then head of GSK China. &quot;I am very worried that family and consular officials are not allowed to attend my parents&apos; trial,&quot; the couple&apos;s 19-year-old son, Harvey Humphrey, said on Wednesday after US consular officials visited his mother. &quot;This does not involve state secrets. This does not involve national security. It is about two private individuals, my parents. &quot;I am surprised at this decision since China wants to promote openness and the rule of law, and I hope that they will relent and let me in. I haven&apos;t seen them for a year. I am shocked and upset. I miss my parents, who are not in good health.&quot; The trial date has been pushed back from 29 July to 7 August, Humphrey said. Peter Humphrey, a former reporter, operated the Shanghai-based consultancy ChinaWhys with his wife from 2003, conducting fraud investigations and risk management services for international companies. According to the company&apos;s website, Humphrey spent two decades as a Reuters journalist in Asia, eastern Europe and the Balkans before becoming a &quot;risk management specialist and corporate detective&quot;; Yu had served as &quot;a high-level advisory consultant in China&quot;. They were detained on suspicion of operating an illicit business and illegally purchasing private information on Chinese citizens. Chinese authorities have not publicly announced any connection between the GSK investigation and their case. The charge of operating an illicit business has been dropped, according to the friend. In September, the couple were paraded on state television in handcuffs and orange prison vests. &quot;The way we acquired information was sometimes illegal,&quot; Humphrey said in Mandarin. &quot;I feel very regretful about it and want to apologise to the Chinese government.&quot; While televised confessions are common for disgraced Chinese officials, they are vanishingly rare for foreigners. The London-based NGO Fair Trials International expressed concern over the closed hearing. &quot;In China, whose supreme people&apos;s court proclaims an astonishing 99.5% conviction rate, criminal justice is used as a way of reinforcing state control, rather than finding truth and pursuing justice,&quot; said Jago Russell, the group&apos;s chief executive. &quot;Despite the UK&apos;s growing economic links with China, the UK government should be raising its concerns about China&apos;s clear violations of international fair trial standards \u2013 like parading Peter Humphrey on national television to &apos;confess&apos; to his crime.&quot; In March 2013, a video showing GSK&apos;s then-China boss Mark Reilly having sex with his Chinese girlfriend in his Shanghai flat was sent to 13 GSK executives, including its CEO Andrew Witty, the Sunday Times reported this week. It is still unclear who shot the video, and why. GSK considered the video a security breach, and Reilly hired Humphrey&apos;s firm to trace its origin. GSK did not tell Humphrey about the bribery allegations until two months later, the newspaper reported. Last month, Chinese authorities formally accused Reilly of running &quot;a massive bribery network&quot;, implying that he could face jail time. He had left China last June after Chinese authorities raided GSK offices in Shanghai, but returned in October to aid in the investigation.

As the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, heads to China on Saturday with a delegation of business chiefs in tow, it is a poignant reminder of the People&apos;s Republic&apos;s appetite for luxury goods made in Deutschland. Economically, the two industrial giants have never been more reliant on each other. Since the economic crisis diminished demand for German exports in Europe, China has become the most important emerging market for Siemens and Volkswagen, both of whose CEOs are on Merkel&apos;s trip. Audi announced on Friday that it had delivered more than 50,000 cars to China in a month for the first time in June \u2013 for VW and Mercedes&apos; S-Class, China is already the biggest export market. Since 2009, exports to China have almost doubled: in 2013, \u20ac67bn (\u00a353bn) worth of German goods made their way to the world&apos;s most populous country, five times as many as from Britain. Total trade reached \u20ac140bn last year, making China a bigger trade partner for Germany than the US. Political goodwill has been crucial in paving the way for these deals: Merkel&apos;s three-day trip, which starts with a visit to a VW plant in Chengdu on Sunday, will be the seventh of her leadership, her meeting with president Xi Jinping on Monday one of three this year alone. Yet this weekend&apos;s German delegation will travel to Asia more sceptically than in the past. If Merkel during her first term in office was unusually forthright in her criticism of Chinese human rights abuses, her diplomatic stance in recent years has come to echo her predecessor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der&apos;s credo for dealing with Russia: Wandel durch Handel (&quot;change through trade&quot;). How much change can be effected through trade remains unclear, however. &quot;Merkel has realised that meetings with Xi Jinping are a lot more important for her leadership than meetings with the Dalai Llama,&quot; said Eberhard Sandschneider of the German Society for Foreign Affairs. On Friday, Ai Weiwei told German press that he hoped Merkel would draw attention to his situation \u2013 he has been freed from jail but is unable to leave China \u2013 in the hope that he can visit his Berlin exhibition before it closes on 13 June. But while German officials said that the chancellor still saw &quot;many deficits&quot; in China&apos;s human rights records, they also made clear that criticism would not be made in public. When a delegation of German politicians and industrialists visited Beijing in the wake of Ai Weiwei&apos;s arrest 2011, a German journalists asking critical questions was loudly booed \u2013 by German businessmen. But just as the stand-off over the Ukraine has revealed Germany&apos;s over-reliance on Russian gas, there are also growing concerns over German industry&apos;s dependency on the Chinese export market. While only 6% of Germany&apos;s overall exports may be China-bound, some individual companies, particular in the machine tool sector, sell as much as 40% to the Chinese market. &quot;That figures does worry me,&quot; Klaus Meyer of the China Europe International Business school told the Guardian. &quot;It&apos;s never a good idea to be too reliant on one country.&quot; The nightmare scenario of an &quot;Asian Crimea&quot;, such as a standoff with Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China sea, was actively discussed in German government circles last month, according to Hans Kundnani of the European Council of Foreign Relations: &quot;There is an increasing sense that Germany&apos;s close ties with China could become very problematic.&quot; While growth of the Chinese export market looks certain, concerns over the profitability of Chinese-German joint ventures persist, with Chinese companies accused of reverse-engineering foreign technologies. Shanghai&apos;s high-speed Maglev train, just like Ai Weiwei&apos;s Han-Dynasty vases, may have the glossy look of German-style engineering. Underneath the surface, however, lies a home-made Chinese product. &quot;The Chinese approach to trade deals is very instrumental,&quot; said Steve Tsang, director of Nottingham&apos;s China Policy Institute. &quot;Siemens may have exported a lot to China, but will their profits outweigh their expenses?&quot;", "tags": ["Germany", "China", "Europe", "World news", "Ai Weiwei", "Asia Pacific", "Manufacturing sector", "Business", "Automotive industry"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-04T16:29:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/04/zadie-smith-jg-ballard-crash", "sentences": ["As has been noted many times, not least by the author himself, his gift for defamiliarisation was, in part, a product of his own unusual biography: &quot;One of the things I took from my wartime experiences was that reality was a stage set \u2026 the comfortable day-to-day life, school, the home where one lives and all the rest of it \u2026 could be dismantled overnight.&quot;     JG Ballard at home in 1989 Photograph: David Montgomery/Getty Images    At age 15, he left decimated Shanghai, where he&apos;d spent the war, for England, to study medicine at Cambridge, and found it understandably difficult to take England seriously."], "title": "Sex and wheels: Zadie Smith on JG Ballard's Crash", "article": "I met JG Ballard once \u2013 it was a\u00a0car crash. We were sailing down the Thames in the middle of the night, I don&apos;t remember why. A British Council thing, maybe? The boat was full of young British writers, many of them drunk, and a few had begun hurling a stack of cheap conference chairs over the hull into the water. I was 23, had only been a young British writer for a couple of months, and can recall being very anxious about those chairs: I was not the type to rock the boat. I was too amazed to be on the boat. (Though it was no pleasure barge, more like a Travelodge afloat, with an interior that put you in mind of a Shepperton semi-detached. A Ballardian boat. Everything brown and grey with accents of tube-seat orange.) I slunk away from the chair-hurlers and walked straight into Ballard. That moon of a face, the shiny tonsure, the lank side-curtains of\u00a0hair \u2013 ghost of a defrocked priest. An\u00a0agonising 10-minute conversation followed in which we two seemed put\u00a0on earth to vivify that colloquial English phrase &quot;cross purposes&quot;. Every book I championed he hated. Every film he admired I&apos;d never seen. (We didn&apos;t dare move on to the visual arts.) The only thing we seemed to have in\u00a0common was King&apos;s College Cambridge, but as I cheerily bored him with an account of all the lovely books I&apos;d read for my finals, I could see that moon face curdling with disgust. In the\u00a0end, he stopped speaking to me altogether, leant against a hollow Doric column, and simply stared. I was being dull \u2013 but the trouble went deeper than that. James Graham Ballard was a man born on the inside, to the colonial class, that is, to the very marrow of British life; but he broke out of that restrictive mould and went on\u00a0to establish \u2013 uniquely among his literary generation \u2013 an autonomous hinterland, not attached to the mainland in any obvious way. I meanwhile, born on the outside of it all, was hell bent on breaking in. And so my Ballard encounter \u2013 like my encounters, up to that point, with his work \u2013 was essentially a missed encounter: ships passing in the night. I liked the Ballard of Empire of the Sun well enough, and enjoyed the few science-fiction stories I&apos;d read, but I did not understand the novels and Crash in particular had always disturbed me, first as a teenager living in the flight path of Heathrow airport, and then as a young college feminist, warring against &quot;phallocentricism&quot;, not at all in the mood for penises entering the leg wounds of disabled lady drivers. What was I so afraid of? Well, firstly that west London psychogeography. I spent much of my adolescence walking through west London, climbing brute concrete stairs \u2013 over four-lane roads \u2013 to reach the houses of friends, whose windows were often black with the grime of the A41. But this all seemed perfectly natural to me, rational \u2013 even\u00a0beautiful \u2013 and to read Ballard&apos;s description of &quot;flyovers overla[ying] one another like copulating giants, immense legs straddling each other&apos;s legs&quot; was to find the sentimental architecture of my childhood revealed as monstrosity:  The entire zone which defined the\u00a0landscape of my life was now bounded by a continuous artificial horizon, formed by the raised parapets and embankments of the motorways and their access roads and interchanges. These encircled the vehicles below like\u00a0the walls of a crater several miles in\u00a0diameter.  Those lines are a perfectly accurate description of, say, Neasden along the North Circular, but it can be shocking to be forced to look at the fond and familiar with this degree of clinical precision. (&quot;Novelists should be like\u00a0scientists,&quot; Ballard once said, &quot;dissecting the cadaver&quot;.) And Ballard was in the business of taking what seems &quot;natural&quot; \u2013 what seems normal, familiar and rational \u2013 and revealing its psychopathology. As has been noted many times, not least by the author himself, his gift for defamiliarisation was, in part, a product of his own unusual biography: &quot;One of the things I took from my wartime experiences was that reality was a stage set \u2026 the comfortable day-to-day life, school, the home where one lives and all the rest of it \u2026 could be dismantled overnight.&quot;     JG Ballard at home in 1989 Photograph: David Montgomery/Getty Images    At age 15, he left decimated Shanghai, where he&apos;d spent the war, for England, to study medicine at Cambridge, and found it understandably difficult to take England seriously. This\u00a0set him apart from his\u00a0peers, whose habit it was to take England very seriously indeed. But if\u00a0his scepticism were the only thing different about Ballard he would not be\u00a0such an extraordinary writer. Think of that famous shot in David Lynch&apos;s Blue Velvet, when the camera burrows below the manicured suburban lawn to reveal the swarming, dystopian scene underneath. Ballard&apos;s intention is similar, but more challenging. In Ballard the dystopia is not hidden under anything. Nor is it (as with so many fictional dystopias) a vision of the future. It is not the subtext. It is the text. &quot;After this sort of thing,&quot; asks the car-crash survivor Dr Helen Remington, &quot;How do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?&quot; But drive she does, as we all do, slowing down on motorways to ogle an accident. Like the characters in Crash we are willing participants in what Ballard called &quot;a pandemic cataclysm that kills hundreds of thousands of people each year and injures millions.&quot; The death-drive, Thanatos, is not what drivers secretly feel, it&apos;s what driving explicitly is. &quot;We live in a world ruled by fictions of every kind \u2026 We live inside an enormous novel \u2026 The fiction is already there. The writer&apos;s task is to invent reality.&quot; The world as text: Ballard was\u00a0one of the first British novelists to\u00a0apply that French theory to his own literary practice. His novels subvert in particular the world that advertising presents, with its irrational convergences sold to us as if they were not only rational but natural. In the case of\u00a0the automobile, we have long been encouraged to believe there is a natural convergence between such irrational pairs as speed and self-esteem, or leather interiors and family happiness. Ballard insists upon an alternate set of convergences, of the kind we would rather suppress and ignore. It is these perverse convergences that drive the cars in Crash, with Ballard&apos;s most notorious creation, Dr\u00a0Robert Vaughan, at the wheel, whose &quot;strange vision of the automobile and its real role in our lives&quot; converges with Ballard&apos;s own. And once we are made aware of the existence of these convergences it becomes very hard to un-see them, however much we might want to.     The cover of the 1973 first edition of Crash.    There is a convergence, for example, between our own soft bodies and the hardware of the dashboard: &quot;The aggressive stylisation of this mass-produced cockpit, the exaggerated mouldings of the instrument binnacles emphasised my growing sense of a new\u00a0junction between my own body and the automobile.&quot; There is a convergence between our horror of death and love of spectacle: &quot;On the roofs of the police cars the warning lights revolved, beckoning more and more passers-by to the accident site.&quot; And there is an acute convergence, we now know, between the concept of celebrity and the car crash: &quot;She sat in the damaged car like a deity occupying a shrine readied for her in the blood of a minor member of\u00a0her congregation \u2026 the unique contours of her body and personality seemed to transform the crushed vehicle. Her left leg rested on the ground, the door pillar realigning both itself and the dashboard mounting to avoid her knee, almost as if the entire car had deformed itself around her figure in a gesture of homage.&quot; This vision of a fictional Elizabeth Taylor \u2013 written 25 years before the death of Princess Diana \u2013 is as prescient as anything in Ballard&apos;s science fiction. How did he get it so right? How did he know that the price we would demand, in return for our worship of the famous and beautiful (with their unique bodies and personalities) would be nothing less than the bloody sacrifice of the worshipped themselves? Oh, there were clues, of course: the myth of decapitated Jayne Mansfield, Jimmy Dean with his prophetic licence plate (&quot;Too fast to live, too young to die&quot;), Grace Kelly&apos;s car penetrated by a tree. But only Ballard saw how they were all\u00a0related, only he drew the line of convergence clearly. Once you see you cannot un-see. What are all the DUIs of\u00a0Lindsay Lohan if not a form of macabre foreplay? Still, it&apos;s easy to be shocked the first time you read Ballard. I was for some reason scandalised by this convergence of sex and wheels, even though it is enshrined in various commonplaces (not to mention the phrase &quot;sex on wheels&quot;). What else do we imply when we say that the purchase of a motorbike represents a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot;, or that a\u00a0large car is compensation for a lack of\u00a0endowment? But, of course, in the\u00a0fictional version of our sexual relationship with cars, it is we, the humans, who are in control; we determine what we do in cars. In\u00a0Ballard&apos;s reality it is the other way\u00a0round:  What I noticed about these affairs,\u00a0which she described in an unembarrassed voice, was the presence in each one of the automobile. All had taken place within a motor-car, either in the multi-storey carpark at the airport, in the lubrication bay of her local garage at night, or in the laybys near the northern circular motorway, as if the presence of the car\u00a0mediated an element which alone made sense of the sexual act.  In 1973, horrified readers condemned such passages as fantastical pornography. Thirty years later, in England, a very similar scene burst on to the front pages and even received an official term: dogging. (And at the centre of that scandal was one of the biggest television stars in the country, natch.)     Illustration by Alison Sampson    The real shock of Crash is not that people have sex in or near cars, but that technology has entered into even our most intimate human relations. Not man-as-technology-forming but technology-as-man-forming. We had hints of this, too, a long time ago, in Marinetti&apos;s Futurist Manifesto of 1909, which makes explicit the modernist desire to replace our ancient gods and myths with the sleek lines and violent lessons of the automobile. It also features an orgasmic car crash: &quot;When I came up \u2013 torn, filthy, and stinking \u2013 from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy deliciously pass through my heart!&quot; But Marinetti&apos;s prose is overwrought, deliberately absurd (&quot;We went up to the three snorting beasts, to lay amorous hands on their torrid breasts. I stretched out on my car like a corpse on its bier,\u00a0but revived at once under the steering wheel, a guillotine blade that\u00a0threatened my stomach&quot;) where Ballard is calm and collected. That medic&apos;s eye, dispassionate, ruthless:  Braced on his left elbow, he continued to work himself against the\u00a0girl&apos;s hand, as if taking part in a dance of severely stylised postures that\u00a0celebrated the design and electronics, speed and direction of an\u00a0advanced kind of automobile.  Marinetti&apos;s hot-headed poets and artists wrestled with the icon of the motorcar. Ballard&apos;s ciphers coolly appraise it. The iciness of Ballard&apos;s style is partly a consequence of inverting the power balance between people and technology, which in turn deprives his characters of things like interiority and individual agency. They\u00a0seem mass produced, just like\u00a0the\u00a0things they make and buy. Certainly his narrators and narrators manqu\u00e9s are not concerned with the personalities of human beings:  Vaughan&apos;s interest in myself was clearly minimal; what concerned him was not the behaviour of a 40-year-old\u00a0producer of television commercials but the interaction between an anonymous individual and his car, the\u00a0transits of his body across the polished cellulose panels and vinyl seating, his face silhouetted against the\u00a0instrument dials.  It&apos;s almost as if the stalker-sadist Vaughan looks at humans as walking talking examples of that Wittgensteinian proposal: &quot;Don&apos;t ask for the meaning; ask for the use.&quot; When Ballard called Crash the first &quot;pornographic novel about technology&quot;, he referred not only to a certain kind of content but to pornography as an organising principle, perhaps the purest example of humans &quot;asking for\u00a0the use&quot;. In Crash, though, the distinction between humans and things has become too small to be meaningful. In effect things are using things. (And a crazed stalker like Vaughan becomes the model for a new kind of narrative perspective.) Now, I don&apos;t think it can be seriously denied that some of the deadening narrative traits of pornography can be\u00a0found here: flatness, repetition, circularity. &quot;Blood, semen and engine coolant&quot; converge on several pages, and the sexual episodes repeat like trauma. But surely this flatness is deliberate; it\u00a0is with the banality of our psychopathology that Ballard is concerned:  The same calm but curious gaze, as\u00a0if she were still undecided how to make use of me, was fixed on my face shortly afterwards as I stopped the car on a deserted service road among the reservoirs to the west of the airport.  That seems to me a quintessential Ballardian sentence, depicting a denatured landscape in which people don&apos;t so much communicate as exchange mass-produced gestures. (Reservoirs are to Ballard what clouds were to Wordsworth.) Of course, it was not this lack of human interiority that created the furious moral panic around this book (and later David Cronenberg&apos;s film). That was more about the whole idea of penetrating the wound of a disabled lady. I was in college when the Daily Mail went to war with the movie, and found myself unpleasantly aligned with the censors, my own faux-feminism existing in a Venn diagram with their righteous indignation. We were both wrong: Crash is not about humiliating the disabled or debasing women, and in fact the Mail&apos;s campaign is a chilling lesson in how a superficial manipulation of liberal identity politics can be used to silence a genuinely protesting voice, one that is trying to speak for us all. No one doubts that the abled use the disabled, or that men use women. But Crash is an existential book about how everybody uses everything. How everything uses everybody. And yet it is not a hopeless vision:  The silence continued. Here and\u00a0there a driver shifted behind his steering wheel, trapped uncomfortably in the hot sunlight, and I had the sudden impression that the world had stopped. The wounds on my knees and chest were beacons tuned to a series of beckoning transmitters, carrying the signals, unknown to myself, which would unlock this immense stasis and\u00a0free these drivers for the real destinations set for their vehicles, the paradises of the electric highway.  In Ballard&apos;s work there is always this mix of futuristic dread and excitement, a sweet spot where dystopia and utopia converge. For we cannot say we haven&apos;t got precisely what we dreamed of, what we always wanted, so badly. The dreams have arrived, all of them: instantaneous, global communication, virtual immersion, biotechnology. These were the dreams. And calm and\u00a0curious, pointing out every new convergence, Ballard reminds us that dreams are often perverse. \u2022 Crash by JG Ballard is reissued this week by 4th Estate for \u00a38.99.", "tags": ["JG Ballard", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-04T19:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/05/china-christianity-wenzhou-zhejiang-churches", "sentences": ["The town of Sanjiang lies on a flat strip of land opposite the city of Wenzhou, where the Ou river broadens before pouring its mass of grey water into the South China Sea, 350km south of Shanghai.", "In early 2014, church demolitions were reported in several towns in Zhejiang province, Shanghai&apos;s rich hinterland."], "title": "China's Christians fear new persecution after latest wave of church demolitions", "article": "When we reached Sanjiang, in Zhejiang province, an elderly woman was angrily telling the pastor how at the end of April police dispersed members of her congregation and neighbouring ones who had come to protect their new Protestant church from being bulldozed. Several pastors were arrested and many detained, including those from the Sanjiang church \u2013 one of the officially sanctioned (and government controlled) &quot;patriotic&quot; churches. Many supporters were also arrested, including pastors from the underground house church movement. One, who asked to be referred to only as W, escaped the police raid by hiding in a nearby warehouse. For years, during her evening walks, the woman had watched the construction work taking place on the massive church, which was just a few hundred metres along the main road from her house. When we were there in May, flashing lights warned us of the police roadblock that had closed off access to the church weeks ago, after the Chinese government ordered it to be pulled down. &quot;They want to remove every trace,&quot; said W. The old woman added: &quot;During the Cultural Revolution they burned Bibles, but they didn&apos;t remove the crosses.&quot; The old church survived the Cultural Revolution, but in such a dilapidated state that it was converted into a mat-weaving factory. The town of Sanjiang lies on a flat strip of land opposite the city of Wenzhou, where the Ou river broadens before pouring its mass of grey water into the South China Sea, 350km south of Shanghai. The township has been earmarked for a new business district alongside the market gardens, so the local government encouraged a plan for a church worthy of its entrepreneurial ambitions. About 15% of Wenzhou prefecture&apos;s 9 million inhabitants are Christian. Wenzhou has a history of its inhabitants migrating to Europe in the last century. It has been neglected by the Chinese government in recent years. Nevertheless, since the economic reforms, the city has been celebrated as the Chinese capital of private enterprise and Christianity, a mutually advantageous relationship that has given rise to it becoming known as China&apos;s &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. In the urban sprawl between sea, river and mountain, red crosses dot the skyline, marking \u2013 mostly Protestant \u2013 places of worship. The city boasts 1,500 churches in every possible architectural form, from elongated white buildings bearing the Chinese character that means love to squat grey brick ones to massive edifices in fake freestone with domes and colonnades. Cao Nanlai, a Chinese anthropologist, published a book, Constructing China&apos;s Jerusalem, about the town&apos;s particular social dynamics, with its Christian bosses devoted to both conquering new markets and converting their workers. The budget for the church in Sanjiang was close to $5m. After nine years of dealing with bureaucracy, raising funds and building work, the massive structure rose from the ground with a 60-metre high tower, a 30-metre long transept and a 50-metre long nave bordered by pilasters and arches. It resembled a European gothic cathedral. An annexe served as a home for the elderly. The cross was mounted on 8 August 2013. In early 2014, church demolitions were reported in several towns in Zhejiang province, Shanghai&apos;s rich hinterland. Many crosses deemed too obtrusive were forcibly taken down. Early in April, a Catholic church in a rural county of Wenzhou was demolished and the cross on a Protestant church destroyed. A dozen other churches received ultimatums to pull down buildings or crosses in a campaign against &quot;illegal structures&quot;, launched in Zhejiang in 2013. However, Christians in Wenzhou observed that the campaign only targeted churches. Orders were obeyed in some places, but Sanjiang resisted. &quot;We knew that even if we removed the cross it wouldn&apos;t stop there, and therefore we had to stand firm,&quot; said W. Although the surface area of the building had exceeded the authorised size, the Sanjiang church administration was confident because its &quot;model church&quot; had received local government approval. &quot;Finally, a compromise was reached when the authorities agreed only to knock down the top two floors of the annexe. But they didn&apos;t keep their word,&quot; said one evangelical minister from Wenzhou, who asked to be referred to as &quot;Peace&quot;.     Chinese security officials monitor a religious parade at a Catholic cathedral in Donglu, Hebei Province. Photograph: Mark Ralston/Getty    On 26 April, 1,000 people, many from neighbouring congregations, came to pray in front of the church in the hope of preventing its destruction. The following day, some 40 church leaders identified as having influence on their congregations were arrested, including official cadres and members of the house church movement. Pastor Peace spent 20 hours in police custody. The riot police intervened at 4am on 28 April, and by 8.30pm the massive church was reduced to rubble. A pastor in Beijing who monitors the persecution of Christians said: &quot;By making a clean sweep of Sanjiang, the government wants to set an example and show that nothing will stop it.&quot; Six other churches or their adjoining buildings were earmarked for demolition in Wenzhou in May. One Protestant church was converted into a &quot;cultural auditorium&quot;. In the weeks that followed, the crosses on 15 churches in the Wenzhou region were destroyed and removed by crane. According to the American NGO China Aid, since\u00a0the beginning of the year 60 churches in\u00a0Zhejiang province have received notice that either their crosses or their buildings must be demolished \u2013 more than 40 of these are in China&apos;s &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. Christians in Wenzhou have not seen such sustained persecution since the Cultural Revolution. According to pastor Joy, a member of the same evangelical network as pastor Peace: &quot;The local government and the churches have always got along well here.&quot; Only the heads of the free churches dare to speak out \u2013 anonymously of course \u2013 because they know that their churches are under threat. The &quot;official&quot; pastors have been forbidden to speak out. The fear now is that the government will turn its attention to the house churches. China&apos;s government-approved churches, such as the one in Sanjiang, have not been targeted in this way before. The officially authorised Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement, and the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, are organised in such a way as to cloister Chinese Christians from foreign influence. This necessarily gives rise to compromises. For instance, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement encompasses all Protestant denominations in a single doctrine. Chinese believers have always been able to adapt, and some frequent the official churches as well as the free ones. The clergy also compromise \u2013 for example, there are &quot;official&quot; bishops who obtain secret benedictions from the Vatican. In fact, the patriotic churches, be they Catholic or Protestant, have been encouraged by the government to absorb the Christian explosion in China as much as possible. In addition to the official 24 million Protestants and 6 million Catholics, there are reportedly tens of millions of &quot;clandestine Christians&quot; in the country today. In Sanjiang, people weren&apos;t blaming the Wenzhou authorities. They believe that the orders came from Xia Baolong, the Communist party chief and former governor of Zhejiang province. &quot;It comes from much higher up, Wenzhou is just a testing ground for a widespread offensive against Christian influence,&quot; said one pastor, citing internal sources. Xia was Xi Jinping&apos;s deputy from 2003 to 2007, before the latter became the country&apos;s president. Xi, a leading promoter of China&apos;s economic renaissance, incarnates an unashamed patriotism in which neo-Maoism and neo-Confucianism coexist \u2013 so long as they contribute to assuring the Communist party&apos;s supremacy and promoting its sacred heritage. &quot;The number of Christians has grown to such an extent that there are now more Christians in China than party members and that scares them,&quot; said pastor Joy. &quot;But Christians still have a negative image in China where there is a history of persecution. All that has played a part.&quot; For the Beijing pastor, this anti-Christian campaign is part of a stated objective by the new leadership to promote Chinese cultural traditions such as Confucianism and Buddhism. It is no coincidence that much media attention was devoted to Xi&apos;s visit to Confucius&apos;s birthplace in February. On that occasion, according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, Xi called for the propagation of a nationwide &quot;ethical doctrine&quot; with &quot;fundamental socialist values&quot; based on &quot;traditional Chinese culture&quot;. According to pastor Joy, among themselves party members often use the pejorative expression yang jiao to designate Christianity. It translates as &quot;foreign teaching&quot;.

A group of retail entrepreneurs are brainstorming about how their industry will look in 30 years&apos; time as the ferris wheel spins, and it&apos;s enough to make you dizzy: online shopping done without lifting a finger and changing-room mirrors with a hotline to your best friend. The future is so bright, we&apos;re going to need (Google Glass) shades. With the hyperbolic title 30/30 Vision, the event has the hallmarks of a Sir Richard Branson stunt and indeed it is part of a series being run by the business-to-business arm of Virgin Media \u2013 with the carrot of an audience with the leonine entrepreneur himself. But it has a serious undercurrent as technology rewrites the rulebook for traditional high street retailers, who are being forced to reinvent themselves in a digital age. &quot;The last 30 years have seen dramatic developments in how businesses operate and interact with their customers, not least the enormous possibilities generated by the internet and digital technology,&quot; Branson told a hushed audience of entrepreneurs back on terra firma. With clever ideas ranging from 3D-printed fashion accessories to theft-proof backpacks, &quot;imagination and enthusiasm&quot; would help shape their industries in the coming decades, he said. &quot;Consumers are setting the pace, they are very engaged and pick up on things quicker,&quot; added Alison Lancaster, interim marketing director at McArthurGlen, who chaired the retail debate. &quot;These small companies are important because as technology evolves it&apos;s hard for big companies to be agile and fluid \u2013 which is why we are seeing a lot of retailers setting up tech incubators.&quot; Among the key trends to emerge were: VOICE OPERATED SHOPPING APPS &quot;Tesco, I want the same shopping as last week and I want it delivered on Thursday at 9pm.&quot; If only buying your groceries online was as easy as barking an order at your phone. Mark Loosemore, commercial director of &quot;voice assistant&quot; technology firm Capito Systems, thinks it soon will be. &quot;This is very, very new but we think this technology has quite broad applications,&quot; he says. &quot;We find that young people are much quicker to have a go than perhaps people who grew up with a desktop.&quot; With Siri, the iPhone&apos;s inbuilt personal assistant, many Britons have already started to use voice-operated software every day. But Capito&apos;s software is specifically designed for mobile commerce, with the company recently creating an app for bookmaker Paddy Power ahead of the World Cup. The Go Brazil Nuts app lets you &quot;bet by voice&quot; without having to input details by hand. Loosemore believes the technology will simplify shopping online, particularly for those who find inputting bank card details on their phone fiddly and frustrating. The company, which raised seed capital from private investors in 2013, has also received funding from the government&apos;s Technology Strategy Board. &quot;A lot of people struggle to find what they want quickly and easily on an app and often don&apos;t complete a transaction,&quot; adds Loosemore. &quot;For people who don&apos;t like or struggle to input information we think speaking to an app is an awful lot easier.&quot; DIGITAL WALK-IN STORES With a website now de rigueur for retailers, the industry is looking for the next generation of sites. One version of the future is websites that use high definition panoramic images to bring the three-dimensional store experience to your mobile or laptop. &quot;It&apos;s not like a video game,&quot; explains Nicolas Rossi, chief executive of London based start-up Avenue Imperial. &quot;Our website makes the online shopping experience more immersive than the flat, catalogue-style e-commerce we have all got used to.&quot; With the click of a mouse, customers are able to virtually &quot;walk&quot; through the store, zooming in on products they like or taking a picture that instantly connects them with staff in the store, who can advise on whether the product is available and arrange payment and shipping. The company is the brainchild of Rossi, a former derivatives trader, and tech industry veteran Julian Ball. &quot;Virtual shopping&quot; websites are likely to appeal to luxury goods companies, which spend millions of pounds creating high street temples for their brands, and will enable well-heeled shoppers in Shanghai, Hong Kong or Los Angeles to browse stores in Paris, London or Milan without leaving their homes. &quot;The quality of the technology and imagery we have developed over the past 12 months is outstanding and really pushes the boundaries of online shopping expectations,&quot; said Ball. &quot;We are starting with fashion and see a future for galleries, furniture stores and specialist shops \u2013 anything with a unique offer and store experience to share.&quot; INTERNET CHALLENGER BRANDS   The internet has levelled the playing field for big and small companies, with the latter able to reach wider audiences than ever before. &quot;The beauty of the internet is you have more opportunities to get to consumers. Before, the only way to do that was to be listed by one of the big four supermarkets,&quot; says James Ecclestone, managing director and owner of the Grown Up Chocolate Company. With names like &quot;fruit and nut hunky dory&quot; and &quot;crunchy praline wonder bar&quot; the London company&apos;s chocolate bars are reminiscent of childhood treats, but with an adult twist. &quot;In many ways the consumer is doing the innovating because they are getting in touch on social media and telling us what they want,&quot; he adds. &quot;If 2,000 of our Twitter followers tell us they want a cherry and coconut bar we can respond and then show retailers the demand for our product.&quot; The quirky brand has recently been listed by internet grocer Ocado but Ecclestone also points to smaller, local delivery networks such as Hubbub, which are helping it \u2013 and brands like it \u2013 to widen their distribution. SOCIAL SHOPPING &quot;Does my bum look big in this?&quot; It&apos;s an age-old question, but imagine you were standing in front of a mirror that your best friend could log on to and give you instant feedback. &quot;Retailers haven&apos;t capitalised on social shopping yet,&quot; says High Spirit co-founder Joshua Okungbaiye. &quot;Everyone yearns for a second opinion from people we trust. When my sister is on Asos she is sharing stuff with her friends all the time. Imagine if she was shopping for a dress and her friend could tell her straight away &apos;you need that dress. Your ex is going to be at that party and you want him to want you back&apos;.&quot; Although it is a pipe dream at the moment, Branson was enthusiastic: &quot;Mirror, mirror on the wall, I love it, I think you should get on and do it.&quot; Lots of retailers are already playing with offering interactive technologies in store. Earlier this year, Japanese chain Urban Research let shoppers play a grown-up game of Paper Doll with a screen that used augmented reality to map their body shape, enabling them to try on hundreds of outfits without even taking their coats off. In a similar vein, Superdrug&apos;s new Cardiff store features an interactive mirror that lets customers try out different hairstyles, and a large interactive screen where customers can take &quot;selfies&quot; and share them on social media.", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Technology", "Social media", "Social trends", "Apps", "Business", "Shops and shopping"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-05T23:04:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/08/was-academy-trust-tipped-off-ofsted-inspection", "sentences": ["This spring, its chief executive, Rachel de Souza, visited schools in Shanghai with the Norfolk MP Elizabeth Truss, a schools minister."], "title": "Was academy chain tipped off about Ofsted inspection?", "article": "UPDATE On 27 January 2015 Ofsted published a review into alleged inspection irregularities at three academy schools in Norfolk. The reviewer, Julian Gizzi, has concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, no-one associated with any of the three schools in question received more than the requisite half a day&apos;s notice of the date of their inspection. The full report is available here. Did Agnew&apos;s trust get prior Ofsted notice?  A high-profile academy trust with very close links to ministers appears to have been given early warning of an Ofsted inspection of one of its schools. If this is true, then who told it \u2013 and will there be an investigation? Inspectors visited the Thetford Academy, in Norfolk, on Tuesday 1 and Wednesday 2 July. Schools are supposed to only get half a day&apos;s notice of an inspection visit, and the school, sponsored by the Inspiration Trust, was told officially on Monday 30 June. But Education Guardian was told of the likely inspection of Thetford \u2013 with the correct inspection dates \u2013 from sources close to the trust the previous Saturday \u2013 28 June. A source said the trust had known about the upcoming monitoring inspection of Thetford for &quot;at least two weeks&quot;, and, on 28 June, said that there was talk of &quot;lots of feverish activity&quot; there in preparation for a possible visit. It seems as if only sources within Ofsted could have released the inspection date. Last month, chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said he had pushed for schools to be given no notice at all of inspections, to enable inspectors to &quot;see schools as they normally are&quot;. The Inspiration Trust is sponsored by Theodore Agnew, who chairs the DfE&apos;s academies board. This spring, its chief executive, Rachel de Souza, visited schools in Shanghai with the Norfolk MP Elizabeth Truss, a schools minister. Speaking last month in the wake of the &quot;Trojan horse&quot; affair, Michael Gove said: &quot;Schools have used the notice they have been given of inspection to evade proper scrutiny&quot;. So he must surely be concerned about this apparent leak. However, the DfE is saying only that: &quot;We are not informed of Ofsted inspections in advance.&quot; And Ofsted declined to comment on how information about the inspection could have been leaked, or say whether it was investigating, confirming only that Thetford had received its official pre-inspection notice on 30 June. Inspectors: we did warn AET chain of visits Another academy chain has been subjected to a blitz of inspections, although, again, it was given prior notice, officially this time, by the inspectorate. The Academies Enterprise Trust, England&apos;s largest chain with 71 schools, had 12 of them inspected last month, we can disclose. The move follows similar probes at the E-Act and TKAT trusts. But a teacher in one of AET&apos;s primary schools told us that, at a staff meeting in early June, they had been told that the trust &quot;had notice that it was going to receive several visits from Ofsted across the chain&quot;. The teacher&apos;s school was actually inspected on 25 and 26 of June. AET has been under pressure, with ministers saying it is not allowed to take on any fresh academies. But the prior notice issue, again, would seem to give academies in chains at least a chance to prepare. Is this a level playing field, with non-chain schools treated the same? Ofsted, again, said little in response, stating that it had written to AET to inform them it would inspect 12 of their academies. &quot;These academies were not identified in our letter and were subject to the same [individual] notice period as any other kind of school,&quot; it stated. DfE leaks report on former Downhills There have long been suspicions that the DfE might be leaking positive Ofsted reports on favoured schools before they are published. Now the department has been caught red-handed, in the form of an email sent from the DfE press office to reporters, urging them to cover the very upbeat Ofsted report on the former Downhills school in Haringey, north London. The email was sent on Wednesday 24 June, with a link to the inspection report. And yet Ofsted&apos;s report was not published until Friday 26 June. The email reminds the journalists that their organisation had reported on parental protests about the school being forced to become an academy under the Harris chain in 2012, and that therefore &quot;I am sure you&apos;ll want to report&quot; the latest inspection verdict. The report on the newly named Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane is indeed glowing. One parent, who had criticised the takeover, said that there had been some improvements under Harris, with specialist art, music and PE teachers recruited. But this was partly because &quot;a lot of extra resources&quot; had been directed at the school, she said. Teachers concerned over US speaker Staff at another primary academy, in Mitcham, south London, are asking questions after a speaker from the US addressed teachers despite, it is claimed, budget cuts that reduced school trips for pupils. And that is not the only concern. James Conway, of the Minneapolis-based Search Institute, an organisation with evangelical links which bills itself as &quot;working to promote positive change with and for young people&quot;, was invited to Benedict primary by its Christian sponsors, Chapel St, which says that Conway spent three days training principals and teachers from across its eight schools in supporting disadvantaged children. Which sounds good. But our sources want to know how much the visit cost, given, they say, that school trips are being restricted to those which have no entry charge, because of what management has told them is a &quot;budget deficit&quot;. One source adds: &quot;It is all very well talking about child development, but all this organisation is interested in is data. We have been told, for example, to forget about high- or low-achieving children because only the ones in the middle are important for the school&apos;s statistics.&quot; Russell Rook, Chapel St&apos;s chief executive, says the \u00a37,500 training was funded through the organisation&apos;s charitable arm, rather than public funds. He adds: &quot;With regards to comments made about a focus on certain pupil groups or school trips, I have spoken at length to the principal and this is simply not the case.&quot; Questions are also being raised about the Search Institute itself, given that its founder, Merton Strommen, appears to have written that homosexuality is a &quot;disorder that can be changed&quot;. Rook did not respond on this. Chapel St&apos;s annual accounts say that, in its schools, &quot;every action and interaction is an expression of love&quot;. But with 20 of Benedict&apos;s 60 staff leaving this year, not everyone is feeling adored.", "tags": ["Ofsted", "Education", "Schools", "Academies", "Faith schools"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-08T06:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/08/transformers-age-extinction-highest-grossing-china", "sentences": ["Studio Paramount cast local icons Li Bingbing, the famous actor, and boxing champion Zou Shiming in the film, which also features a number of Chinese landmarks and saw premieres in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing."], "title": "Transformers: Age of Extinction becomes highest-grossing film of all time in China", "article": "Transformers: Age of Extinction has become the highest-grossing film of all time in China, overtaking James Cameron&apos;s Avatar. Michael Bay&apos;s film, the fourth in the long-running saga about warring races of giant robots, has so far taken a staggering $222.74m in just 10 days. That compares to a total of $222m for Avatar over a two-month period in 2010. Age of Extinction&apos;s success has been fuelled by a campaign to woo Chinese filmgoers which is arguably the most aggressive ever seen by Hollywood. Studio Paramount cast local icons Li Bingbing, the famous actor, and boxing champion Zou Shiming in the film, which also features a number of Chinese landmarks and saw premieres in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. The film has attracted a degree of bemusement in China after clumsy product placement led to American characters clearly drinking the Chinese version of Red Bull during scenes set in Texas. Paramount&apos;s efforts to build relationships with Chinese businesses have not always run smoothly. The famous dragon-shaped Pangu Plaza hotel in Beijing reportedly paid $1.6m to appear in Age of Extinction, then threatened to sue when, they claimed, the hotel did not appear for as long as was originally agreed. The matter was later resolved. Other editorial decisions appear rather more sinister. A politician representing China&apos;s autocratic ruling communist administration appears decisive and resolute in the face of Decepticon attacks in the film, while the democratic USA&apos;s chief of staff proves himself a hapless idiot. The moves appear to have paid off. Age of Extinction has so far made more money in China, the world&apos;s second-largest film market, than it has in the US. But some local figures remain displeased by the film&apos;s ubiquity. Prior to its release, Zhang Hongsen, chief of film bureau of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, called for cinema owners to ensure local movies were not squeezed out. With a potential 1.34 billion cinemagoers, China is predicted to overtake the US as the world&apos;s biggest box office by 2020, and Hollywood studios are increasingly looking east in an effort to offset sluggish growth back home. The world&apos;s most populous nation is currently in the middle of a five-year plan to add 25,000 new cinema screens to cope with demand from an increasingly wealthy population. Growth will also be fostered by the government&apos;s 2012 decision to relax the number of foreign movies allowed to screen each year from 20 to 34.", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Transformers: Age of Extinction", "Michael Bay", "China"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-08T11:17:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jul/08/les-nudes-skin-tones-v-and-a-christian-louboutin-high-heels-controversy", "sentences": ["Mostly when people talk of nudes they are talking of their own colour of skin.&quot; Now, five different Louboutin models are available in the five &quot;Les Nudes&quot; colours, and the disembodied arms are more than just slightly spooky props: Louboutin has stores in Shanghai, Beijing, Mumbai and New Delhi and in\u00a0some store windows, &quot;where there is a sensitivity about female nudity&quot;, shoes are displayed on arms, rather than\u00a0legs, to demonstrate the skin match, says Gardner."], "title": "Les Nudes: how high heels in a variety of skin tones became museum pieces", "article": "The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum&apos;s newest gallery, the Rapid Response Collecting Room, is a far cry from the vaulted ceilings and marble statues of the museum&apos;s most famous exhibition halls. Tucked away in a modest gallery on the third floor, its purpose is to showcase topical pieces of design as soon as possible after news stories break. From a 3D gun to six small chrome domes, better known as anti-homeless spikes, many of the items are unsettling. In one display case, though, glamour reigns, as five pairs of Christian Louboutin high heels sparkle under the spotlights. This is Louboutin&apos;s &quot;Les Nudes&quot; collection, a range designed to match a variety of skin tones. Each shoe is clasped by the elegant fingers of a mannequin&apos;s arm, and each disembodied limb is painted the same colour as the shoe in its grip. According to the museum&apos;s curator of contemporary product design, Corinna Gardner, the collection can be seen to be highlighting issues that are &quot;equally as important&quot; as those raised by the grittier items in the gallery. &quot;The shoes tell a global story,&quot; she says. &quot;They signal change in the world economy and a change in where fashion consumers are located and who they are.&quot;     Victoria Beckham. Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImage    By the time Louboutin launched Les\u00a0Nudes, in 2013, putty, stone and blush-coloured high heels had become a fashion phenomenon, uniting the royal family, the Hollywood A-list and the cast of The Only Way Is Essex. Angelina Jolie wore towering blush pumps to promote the film Salt in 2010. Victoria Beckham was famously photographed in perilous pink platforms while holding her baby daughter in 2011. The Duchess of Cambridge wore biscuit-coloured LK Bennett &quot;Sledge&quot; pumps so often throughout 2011 and 2012 that the Daily Mail&apos;s Liz Jones was forced to ask the important question: &quot;Does\u00a0Kate only own ONE pair\u00a0of\u00a0shoes?&quot; The trend was intrinsically linked with Christian Louboutin; the designer&apos;s beige, patent, pointy Pigalle pumps were launched in 2004, and his camel-coloured Lady Daf platforms, Prive peep-toes and spiked Yolanda heels all had their moments in the spotlight. Louboutin&apos;s shoes tend to be cut very low on the foot, designed to show the top of the toes and lengthen the legs, while the sexy shape and signature glossy red soles remove any orthopaedic associations. &quot;I have always been interested in the concept of nude,&quot; he says. &quot;Not just as one colour but the various colours of skin. Nude elongates your leg and doesn&apos;t take space away from your body. It is one thing about a shoe which is dedicated totally to the woman \u2013 it disappears completely and dissolves into your legs.&quot; Tamara Mellon, who was creative director of Jimmy Choo until 2011, says the brand started producing beige patent heels in around 2003: &quot;I\u00a0just remember there was something in the zeitgeist. I don&apos;t remember seeing them on the catwalk, not even before Jimmy Choo, when I was accessories editor at British Vogue. It was customer-led. The colour felt modern \u2013 you could wear it with anything \u2013 and they sold so well. When I left Jimmy Choo, the nude platform was the No\u00a01\u00a0selling style.&quot; Matching high heels to leg skin tone is a strategy that has been quietly deployed by stylists and fashion editors for decades. US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, for example, is constantly photographed in biscuit-coloured heels. Cabaret artists and podium dancers, who know more than most about creating flattering costumes, have long worn flesh-match or transparent high heels, too. The fact that Louboutin spent his teens as an apprentice in the dressing rooms of Parisian music hall the Folies Berg\u00e8re, surrounded by showgirls, is no coincidence. Wearers sometimes look a little like Barbie dolls \u2013 permanently on tiptoes \u2013 or like figure skaters, who wear tights rolled over their boots for seemingly neverending lines. In the age of glossy, image-obsessed reality TV shows such as The Hills and Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and as Hollywood stylists such as Rachel Zoe became famous in their own right, disseminating their tips on the internet, those cult tricks became widespread. As the trend gained traction, &quot;nude&quot; became the blanket term used by fashion magazines and designers to describe a shade which could only really be compared to nudity if the customer was white. Jezebel&apos;s deputy editor Dodai Stewart expressed concern about the word in Lucky magazine&apos;s &quot;nude shoe special&quot; in 2008, of which she asked: &quot;Yeah, nude. But for whom?&quot; She wrote about the issue again in 2010, when &quot;nude&quot; was used to describe a peachy gown worn by Michelle\u00a0Obama.     The Duchess of Cambridge. Photograph: Dave M. Benett/Getty Images    Celebrities ranging from Rihanna to Beyonc\u00e9 to Mariah Carey all wore blush and sand-coloured courts on the red carpet, but to describe them as &quot;nude&quot; \u2013 as many fashion journalists did \u2013 seemed bizarre. Debates about the use of pale pink as a shorthand for skin are not new \u2013 Crayola renamed its &quot;flesh&quot; crayon &quot;peach&quot; in 1962 \u2013 which is exactly why it hit a nerve, says Stewart. &quot;I think I had a crayon called &apos;flesh&apos; as a kid, so it was always in my consciousness. In very specific settings,&quot; she says, &quot;when it is supposed to look like the person is actually nude \u2013 like with illusion netting \u2013 perhaps the word is correct, and I feel like that&apos;s what Louboutin is trying to do. But more often than not people say &apos;nude&apos; when they mean beige or peach or champagne or honey. Get creative, people! Otherwise it&apos;s a little lazy.&quot; Claire Sulmers, the editor of Fashion Bomb Daily, a site focusing on multicultural fashion, felt that many readers were left out by the trend. &quot;They were writing to me asking where they could find a &apos;nude&apos; shoe because the ones that were out there didn&apos;t match their skin tone. We&apos;ve seen it before, with Band-Aids, which are supposedly skin colour. Some other designers, like Jimmy Choo, have always had shoes that match different tones, though they don&apos;t overtly market them that way, but there aren&apos;t many other brands doing it. I suppose a lot of designers just focus on their core customer and don&apos;t think beyond that.&quot; &quot;It definitely seems a little bit of capitalising on the controversy,&quot; says Stewart, of the Louboutin range \u2013 which even comes with a skin-colour matching app \u2013 &quot;but why shouldn&apos;t there be a bunch of different flesh tones? I can&apos;t afford them, but for the person who can I think it&apos;s great. Even if it&apos;s just a hat tip to people complaining, I love to see brands stepping up and embracing criticism. I\u00a0also think it&apos;s a very modern approach \u2013 if Louboutin hadn&apos;t addressed this issue it would look very backwards.&quot; Sulmers agrees: &quot;I think this is a shrewd business move. Designers should take a\u00a0global perspective.&quot; It is this global perspective that fascinates the V&amp;A, according to Gardner. Christian Louboutin is booming in popularity in emerging luxury economies and &quot;the fact that a pair of \u00a3500 shoes is within the income bracket of women living across the world, of many different ethnicities, is\u00a0critical to\u00a0our interest,&quot; she says. &quot;The inspiration came from my travels,&quot; says Louboutin. &quot;When you travel to many different places you realise that nude does not mean the same thing in every country. Mostly when people talk of nudes they are talking of their own colour of skin.&quot; Now, five different Louboutin models are available in the five &quot;Les Nudes&quot; colours, and the disembodied arms are more than just slightly spooky props: Louboutin has stores in Shanghai, Beijing, Mumbai and New Delhi and in\u00a0some store windows, &quot;where there is a sensitivity about female nudity&quot;, shoes are displayed on arms, rather than\u00a0legs, to demonstrate the skin match, says Gardner. &quot;That adds another\u00a0layer to the object.&quot; Still, the dripdown effect in fashion has yet to be felt. &quot;I haven&apos;t really seen lots [of shoes in a variety of skin tone colours],&quot; says Stewart, &quot;but maybe that trend is not as big as it once was. I see a lot of eye-catching shoes now, whereas that trend was about downplaying the shoe.&quot; Indeed, the biggest catwalk trends this season are clompy, hiking-inspired &quot;ugly&quot; sandals and haute trainers. But while skin-coloured shoes may not be cutting-edge now, they have become something of a staple. The Duchess of Cambridge still wears hers and they still rule the red carpet. The hot new name in leg-lengthening shoes is Stuart Weitzman, whose Nudist\u00a0model is so-called not because of its colour but because the straps are barely visible at all. Weitzman&apos;s Nudists come in a variety of shades \u2013 the\u00a0lightest\u00a0are not &quot;nude&quot; but Pan, Nappa and Light Gold. &quot;I do think that magazines and designers are using the term &apos;nude&apos; less,&quot; says Stewart. So that&apos;s progress of sorts, if a little too late for the boom time of nakedly sexy, leg-lengthening shoes.", "tags": ["Fashion", "Women's shoes", "Life and style", "V&A", "Culture", "Museums", "Art and design"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-08T17:13:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jul/08/giorgio-armani-haute-couture-paris", "sentences": ["The simple but effective pairing of black and red, matt and gloss, seemed to reference both the classic Parisian chic of the 1970s and 1980s, when Yves Saint Laurent was creating couture collections, and an exotic, Shanghai aesthetic \u2013 a fitting set of alternate allusions for a brand which has its roots in those decades, but now spans the globe."], "title": "Giorgio Armani's couture show is red carpet window shopping for stars", "article": "Giorgio Armani, who turns 80 on Friday, recently celebrated his 40th anniversary in fashion. His brand is a blue chip name all over the world; his legacy still relevant, a recurring reference at the recent Milan menswear shows. His name sells lipsticks, hotel rooms, table settings. And yet when Paris haute couture rolls around \u2013 a roster where his name has been on the biannual schedule for a decade \u2013 he still feels like the outsider. This is not a criticism of Armani. If anything, it is a reflection on haute couture. Haute couture, the bespoke arm of fashion, is a world steeped in whimsy and a courtly attention to historical accuracy seldom seen outside of period dramas \u2013 and that, with the greatest respect, is not Armani&apos;s thing. Armani entered haute couture in order to showcase his red carpet designs. The Hollywood connection is central to Armani DNA, and a Paris catwalk debut gives gowns a heritage which appeals to a red carpet coterie which is headed by Cate Blanchett, but also includes Kate Hudson, who attended this latest Paris fashion show. When those gowns appear on the catwalk \u2013 in this collection, for instance, when Look 14, a one-shouldered dress in black organza with floral embroidery and chenille polka dots \u2013 they have a visceral effect on the audience, who know they are previewing next season&apos;s red carpet standouts. Gorgeous, also, are those pieces where Armani utilises the extraordinary skill of a couture atelier to realise his signature looks in their most refined form. This collection of haute couture looks for Autumn/Winter 2014 was drawn entirely in red and black, with occasional splashes of oyster, and shown in an underground theatre close to the Eiffel tower, clad for the occasion as a black lacquered box. The simple but effective pairing of black and red, matt and gloss, seemed to reference both the classic Parisian chic of the 1970s and 1980s, when Yves Saint Laurent was creating couture collections, and an exotic, Shanghai aesthetic \u2013 a fitting set of alternate allusions for a brand which has its roots in those decades, but now spans the globe. The godfather of the sexy trouser suit reimagined the brief for evening wear, creating a series of stunning shorts suits. Jackets had trademark peaked shoulders, and deceptively loose fastenings which nailed the perfectly-imperfect look every time. Shorts had just the right volume in the pleats to give them a beguiling ease, while remaining eternally flattering. The shorts suits, and the red carpet gowns, were sublime. It is when Armani tries to elaborate upon a straightforward red carpet brief, and build a catwalk fantasy world along the lines of the other names on the haute couture schedule, that there is a sense of disconnect. When the show notes speak of a &quot;bustier dress with flounces, featuring red polka dots and black veil net embroidered with black sequins, rhinestones and red chenille polka dots&quot; one can&apos;t help wondering whether Giorgio&apos;s serious and minimalist heart is really in these clothes, or whether they simply serve \u2013 like a Borgia wedding feast in Renaissance Rome \u2013 as a demonstration of pomp and skill and power for a family brand. By contrast Karl Lagerfeld, designer of Chanel, is entirely at home in an imaginarium of whimsy. (Example: his kitten, Choupette, has 37,000 Twitter followers, and is soon to publish her autobiography.) For his latest Chanel show, the Paris successor to the infamous Chanel Supermarket extravaganza in March, Lagerfeld brought together Le Corbusier, Versailles, and the Tour de France. Lagerfeld&apos;s genius is to turn the ridiculous into the sublime. The curved lines of a pristine white set were echoed in clothes constructed on a seamless curve, which reached their finale with a bridal dress finale. The gilded mirror hung proud on the white wall was echoed in the rich embroidery set on to the simple silhouettes. (After the show, Lagerfeld referenced Baroque, but also said that tiny squares of concrete were used in the embroidery, as a tribute to Le Corbusier.) Into this mix, Lagerfeld threw a neatly-aimed grenade of timeliness, with a series of Tour de France tributes: caps, cycling shorts, and cyclists&apos; courier bags.", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style", "Paris", "France"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-08T19:09:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/09/jarvis-cocker-jack-white-beck-song-reader-compilation-album", "sentences": ["- Please Leave A Light On When You Go3 Tweedy - The Wolf is on the Hill4 Norah Jones - Just Noise5 Lord Huron - Last Night You Were A Dream6 Bob Forrest - Saint Dude7 Jack White - I\u2019m Down8 Beck - Heaven\u2019s Ladder9 Juanes - Don\u2019t Act Like Your Heart Isn\u2019t Hard10 Laura Marling - Sorry11 Jarvis Cocker - Eyes That Say \u201cI Love You\u201d12 David Johansen - Rough On Rats13 Jason Isbell - Now That Your Dollar Bills Have Sprouted Wings14 The Last Polka - Marc Ribot15 Eleanor Friedberger - Old Shanghai16 Sparks - Why Did You Make Me Care?17 Swamp Dogg - America, Here\u2019s My Boy18 Jack Black - We All Wear Cloaks19 Loudon Wainwright III - Do We?"], "title": "Jarvis Cocker and Jack White to appear on Beck compilation LP", "article": "Two years after releasing an album purely as sheet music, Beck has announced that he is turning Song Reader into a compilation LP.

It amazes me to hear how these musicians have made the songs their own and in the process revealed that the interpretation is the living breathing soul of the piece. These interpretations have made the book something new - something better.&quot;  Besides Cocker and White, the 20 songs on Song Reader include versions by Laura Marling, Sparks, Loudon Wainwright III, Norah Jones, Fun. and actor Jack Black.

Africa and Asia &quot;will face numerous challenges in meeting the needs of their growing urban populations, including for housing, infrastructure, transportation, energy and employment, as well as for basic services such as education and healthcare&quot;, it adds. Future development targets should focus on creating inclusive cities with adequate infrastructure and services for all residents, said John Wilmoth, director of the UN&apos;s population division. &quot;Managing urban areas has become one of the most important development challenges of the 21st century,&quot; he said. &quot;Our success or failure in building sustainable cities will be a major factor in the success of the post-2015 UN development agenda.&quot; The report says rapid urbanisation will bring opportunities for governments to improve access to important services. &quot;Providing public transportation, as well as housing, electricity, water and sanitation for a densely settled population is typically cheaper and less environmentally damaging than providing a similar level of services to a predominantly rural household,&quot; it says.      Africa is projected to experience a 16% rise in its urban population by 2050 \u2013 making it the most rapidly urbanising region on the planet \u2013 as the number of people living in its cities soars to 56%. The report predicts there will be more than 40 megacities worldwide by 2050,each with a population of at least 10 million. Delhi, Shanghai and Tokyo are predicted to remain the world&apos;s most populous cities in 2030, when each is projected to be home to more than 30 million people. &quot;Several decades ago most of the world&apos;s largest urban agglomerations were found in the more developed regions, but today&apos;s large cities are concentrated in the global south,&quot; the UN says. &quot;The fastest growing urban agglomerations are medium-sized cities and cities with fewer than 1 million inhabitants, located in Asia and Africa.&quot;      The world&apos;s 3.4 billion-strong rural population will start to decline as urbanisation becomes more common, the report says. The UN projects that rural populations will increase in only a third of countries between 2014 and 2050, as states with large rural communities will take longer to urbanise. &quot;In general, the pace of urbanisation tends to slow down as a population becomes more urbanised,&quot; the report says. The UN cautions that sustainable urbanisation requires cities to generate better income and employment opportunities, and &quot;expand the necessary infrastructure for water and sanitation, energy, transportation, information and communications; ensure equal access to services; reduce the number of people living in slums; and preserve the natural assets within the city and surrounding areas&quot;. Urbanisation has historically taken place in wealthy countries, but such expansion is now happening most rapidly in upper-middle-income countries, where gross national income per capita is between $1,046 and $4,125.

As US film studios look further afield for profits, the Hollywood sign now looms over China. On a Thursday afternoon at the Polybona Cinema in the city&apos;s east, a few dozen Chinese movie-goers pay about \u00a313 \u2013 the price of about 30 bottles of local beer \u2013 to watch Transformers: Age of Extinction in 3D. During the screening, the overtures to Chinese cinemagoers are as clunky as the film itself. The small crowd laughs sporadically at the Chinese product placements \u2013 a China Construction Bank debit card, a can of Chinese Red Bull \u2013 scattered throughout the blockbuster&apos;s first half, mostly set in rural Texas. Nonetheless, this approach has worked: the film has become China&apos;s biggest ever box-office success, generating ticket sales of more than $222m (\u00a3130m) in less than a fortnight. Yang Yunfan, 33, an advertising professional, says he enjoyed the film more than the prior entry in the long-running franchise, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, which also set box office records in China. &quot;You know Transformers, the animated series, was really big in China in the late 1980s and early 90s, when I was in middle school,&quot; he says. &quot;So many things in these movies pull directly from the cartoon \u2013 that&apos;s something they&apos;ve done really well. &quot;But there were really too many advertisements.

In a bid to win over a Chinese audience, a large chunk of the action is set in Hong Kong, with roles for Chinese star Li Bingbing and boxer Zou Shiming, albeit smaller parts than those of their American co-stars. Producer Paramount has also pulled out all the stops to make a film that will please China&apos;s censors, as well as state-run CCTV China Movie Channel and its online film streaming partner Jiaflix Enterprises, who backed the movie for an undisclosed sum. While real-life Hong Kong residents took to the streets in their tens of thousands to march for democracy, the Transformers film shows a local leader calling on central government to save the day when the territory faces an invasion by the mutant robots.

He estimates the Chinese cinema market will be worth $4.6bn in 2014, almost a one-third increase on last year. And China has a lot further to go: it had 18,200 screens at the end of last year, compared with 40,000 in the US. If China had the same number of screens per capita as the US it would have 133,000. &quot;We are talking about a very, very large market,&quot; says Hancock, who made that calculation. &quot;Within six years China will probably be the largest film market in the world.&quot;     Mark Wahlberg, left, as Cade Yeager and Jack Reynor as Shane Dyson in Transformers: Age of Extinction. Photograph: Andrew Cooper/AP    Transformers is hardly the first attempt at buttering-up the Chinese filmgoer: James Bond turns up in Shanghai and Macau in 007&apos;s most recent outing, Skyfall, while Chinese stars Fan Bingbing and Wang Xueqi had small roles in the Chinese version of Iron Man\u00a03, although audiences reacted angrily when it emerged their scenes were cut for the international version. The chase for the Chinese market also appears to have heightened the big studios&apos; natural risk-aversion to comedies, traditionally a bigger gamble, and more likely to be lost in translation. Figures from Nomura and Box Office Mojo show comedies now account for just 13% of new releases from the four big Hollywood studios, compared with almost a third in 2010. &quot;The centre of gravity of the film business is moving towards Asia,&quot; says Hancock, who notes that Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and India are also increasingly important for Hollywood. The US studios have been shooting films abroad for decades, but the interest in cultivating Asian filmgoers is a more recent trend. &quot;The internationalisation of production is already a fact. What we are having now is the Asian turn to be dominant in terms of consumption of movies and if you are a studio you have to stay in line with that trend; and that means focusing a lot of your attention or having a strategy to get into those markets.&quot; Not all Chinese officials sound convinced that the influx of Hollywood&apos;s mutant cars and aliens is a good thing. In a recent comment piece entitled &quot;Beware of superhero films&quot;, the state-controlled China Daily worried that US superheroes may not be ideal role models. &quot;The problem is that children and, even some adults, lap them up, helping them promote American lifestyle and values that do not necessarily conform to their own cultural values.&quot; In another report in the Chinese state media, Zhang Hongsen, a senior official in the State Administration of Press Publication, Radio, Film and Television, ticked off studio exhibitors for their &quot;irrational&quot; wish to give Transformers space at the expense of local films. His complaint comes as box-office takings show just how far the scales have tipped in favour of US film-makers. Hollywood has dominated Chinese cinemas since the start of the year: the likes of Godzilla, X-Men and Captain America mean only three Chinese-language films feature in the top 10 highest-grossing releases of the year, according to Rentrak \u2013 and one of these was made with American money. In 2013, only three Hollywood films made it into the top ten and the most popular was a homegrown comedy, Journey to the West (Xi You Xiang Mo Pian). Concern over preserving China&apos;s own film-making means that strict government rules on foreign films are unlikely to disappear anytime soon: only 34 foreign films can be shown each year, while foreign studios can take no more than 25% of profits. As a result, James Mudge, director of the London-based Chinese Visual Festival, expects to see &quot;a bit more blurring of the line in what you consider a Hollywood film and a Chinese film&quot;, as foreign studios look to pair up with Chinese counterparts to get round the restrictions. Hollywood is still the world leader in making big special-effects-laden action films, but China is getting better at them, he says, pointing to this year&apos;s hit fantasy epic The Monkey King. However, Chinese films will remain &quot;a tough sell&quot; for a mass audience in the west, where audiences avoid subtitled films. &quot;Even a [subtitled] commercial film will be seen as an arthouse film,&quot; says Mudge.

Hony Capital won an auction process ahead of Citic, another Chinese investment group, and four other private equity firms in what is the biggest European restaurant sector deal in the last five years. Pizza Express opened its first outlet in Beijing two months ago. It already has 12 restaurants in Hong Kong and nine in Shanghai. The Pizza Express chief executive, Richard Hodgson, said the sale was a positive development for the 504-outlet chain: &quot;Asia is a key part of our future growth strategy and Hony&apos;s expertise in this region will be invaluable. We are looking forward to working with them on this as well as our ambitious UK growth plans.&quot; Hodgson and the management team will remain with the business following the deal.

The company aims to open another 200 restaurants in the UK. The chain, which was founded in Soho, central London, in 1965, has changed hands several times, with Cinven buying it for \u00a31bn at the end of 2006 shortly before the financial crash.

It employs 9,000 people worldwide. The chain was owned between 1993 and 1999 by the entrepreneur Luke Johnson, a former Channel 4 and Royal Society of the Arts chairman, along with Hugh Osmond. During that time it expanded from 12 outlets in the UK to more than 250. Pizza Express was the biggest asset in the Cinven-owned Gondala Group, which includes other &quot;fast casual&quot; chains Zizzi and ASK Italian.

On Tuesday and Wednesday this week, leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa will gather in Fortaleza and Bras\u00edlia for the sixth Brics summit. High on an agenda that stresses social inclusion and sustainable development are final discussions on the creation of two financial institutions that could reshape the global economic landscape. The proposed New Development Bank (NDB) is intended to function in a similar way to the World Bank \u2013 financing infrastructure and sustainable development projects through a $100bn fund \u2013 while the Contingency Reserve Arrangement (CRA) would help protect member states from financial shocks and reduce their dependence on western institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The advent of the new financial bodies would underline the increasing importance of this loosely linked group of countries \u2013 which comprise 46% of the world&apos;s population and account for more than 18% of the global gross domestic product \u2013 and signal the Brics&apos; growing desire for a fresh approach to global financing. &quot;The Brics have consistently advocated for the reform of existing institutions of international governance, including the World Bank and the IMF,&quot; said Fl\u00e1vio Damico, head of the department of inter-regional mechanisms of the Brazilian foreign ministry. He added that while the NDB and the CRA &quot;have their own purposes, in line with the members&apos; shared interest of incrementally changing international governance&quot;, they were not intended to compete with the World Bank and the IMF, but rather to play a complementary role. Others are more sceptical about the impact the two new institutions are likely to have, pointing out that the CRA resembles the Chiang Mai Initiative, launched four years ago, which requires the borrowing country to rely initially on the IMF. &quot;While many developing countries have criticised the IMF&apos;s obsession with the Washington Consensus policies of budget austerity, trade liberalisation and privatisation, we hear from [Brics] negotiators that countries who want to access more than 30% of their CRA will need to have a programme with the IMF,&quot; said Sameer Dossani, advocacy coordinator at ActionAid. &quot;And while the World Bank has been criticised for its funding of large infrastructure projects that displace people without their free, prior and informed consent, it seems likely that a Brics bank would do precisely the same.&quot; The new bank, which will probably have its headquarters in Shanghai, will open in 2016 with an initial capital of $50bn, contributed in\u00a0equal parts by each country. Other states, banks and multilateral institutions wishing to do business with the bank will have to be approved by the Brics, which will retain a controlling interest. &quot;The bank will finance projects in developing countries and emerging economies in the areas of infrastructure and sustainable development,&quot; Damico said. &quot;Each project will be assessed on its merits without additional conditionalities.&quot; The CRA, meanwhile, &quot;will serve as an additional line of defence available to Brics \u2026 It will not have a permanent secretariat, nor legal personality. It will be run directly by the governments and respective central banks.&quot; Its initial $100bn of capital will be contributed in line with the size of the Brics economies: China will provide 41%, Brazil, Russia and India 18% each, and South Africa 5%. Damico said the CRA, which has been conceived as a tool to steady the currency markets, will afford &quot;a measure of self-reliance among Brics and enable the IMF to devote its resources to more troubled countries&quot;. Agreements on the NDB and the CRA are due to be signed in Fortaleza on Tuesday by the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, and her counterparts: Russia&apos;s Vladimir Putin; China&apos;s Xi Jinping; South Africa&apos;s Jacob Zuma, and the new prime minister of India, Narendra Modi. The Brics bank will then need to be approved by the five national parliaments over the next year. Dossani warned that the new financial bodies would need to demonstrate a clear committment to human rights from the outset. &quot;If these institutions are going to be true alternatives, we need a cleaner break from the past,&quot; he said. &quot;Development must put the human rights of people first and that means better consultation and more transparency.&quot; The view was echoed by Maria Laura Canineu, director of Human Rights Watch in Brazil, who said: &quot;There are well-established international human rights principles and standards that should guide any financial institution.&quot; Although the summit was preceded on Monday by meetings between trade and finance ministers, central bank governors, national development bank authorities and two bodies representing the private sector, it has been criticised for failing to include rural movements, unions and NGOs working on rights, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. &quot;It&apos;s regrettable that in a country which has recognised and promoted civil society, non-governmental organizations were not included in the official meeting agenda,&quot; Canineu said. Damico acknowledged that there had been &quot;huge interest&quot; in the new financial institutions and promised proper consultation with civil society as soon as the ink was dry on the agreements. &quot;We will take advantage of the year-long parliamentary ratification period to establish the mechanisms for interaction with civil society,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Global development", "Governance", "Environmental sustainability", "Brics", "Business", "Brazil", "Americas", "South Africa", "Africa", "India", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Russia", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-14T13:01:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jul/15/china-town-aedas-architecture-giant-london", "sentences": ["We think that&apos;s the way London needs to densify.\u201d Based in Hong Kong since 1983, when he worked on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters with Norman Foster, Griffiths has built up an empire of offices across Asia, with bases in 13 cities, from Shanghai and Singapore to New Delhi and Dubai."], "title": "China town: meet the architecture giant with Asian designs on London", "article": "Their buildings dot the globe, but you probably couldn&apos;t name one, nor would you ever guess they had come from the same practice. They have built a gargantuan conference centre in China that looks like a teetering stack of mirror-clad Jenga blocks, an enormous concert hall in Singapore in the shape of a crumpled beetle, and over 9.3m sq metres (100m sq ft) of shops, offices and hotels in variously sculpted towers across Asia and the Middle East. Now Aedas, one of the largest architecture practices in the world, plans to bring its flashy brand of mixed-use huge projects to London. And there is very little to stand in their way. \u201cOur Chinese clients have their sights set on London, and they know what they want,\u201d says Keith Griffiths, the Welsh-born chairman of Aedas, who presides over the 1,400-strong practice from its Hong Kong headquarters. \u201cThey are used to high rise, high density, truly mixed-use developments \u2013 having everything on one site, so you can live, work and play without ever leaving the building. We think that&apos;s the way London needs to densify.\u201d Based in Hong Kong since 1983, when he worked on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters with Norman Foster, Griffiths has built up an empire of offices across Asia, with bases in 13 cities, from Shanghai and Singapore to New Delhi and Dubai. Last week Aedas announced a demerger from its European offices, where the scale of work was on a &quot;different trajectory&quot; (i.e. too small), but it has already set up a new base in London with the aim of importing its high-octane brand of gigantic Asian projects to Europe. The company has come to specialise, Griffiths says, in a particular kind of urban development that has grown out of these fast-paced emergent economies. It is a design philosophy that conceives chunks of cities like self-contained ocean liners: clusters of high rise buildings that are \u201cglued together\u201d at their bases on podiums that brim with retail and leisure, usually perched on top of major transport nodes.     The Star Performing Arts Centre in Singapore. Photograph: Aedas    \u201cThe closest London has come is Canary Wharf, but that&apos;s just a shopping mall servicing office blocks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt dies when the offices turn their lights off. We&apos;re talking about full 24-hour occupation, with a continuity of excitement between all the different floors, and blocks linked by elevated walkways above the streets.\u201d It is a form of mall urbanism that is now ubiquitous across Asia, as urban street patterns are trampled beneath galumphing glass behemoths. The city&apos;s ground level is surrendered to cars, while pedestrians scuttle between air-conditioned retail hubs overhead. They are self-contained commercial ecosystems, built and managed by single private interests, on a scale that makes London&apos;s biggest developments look like tiny specks on the planner&apos;s map. Such projects, says Griffiths, are usually between 465\u2013930,000 sq metres (5-10m sq ft) in China. Westfield Stratford City, London&apos;s Olympic shopping Mecca whose developers claim is Europe&apos;s largest such complex, is just 177,000 sq metres (1.9m sq ft). On the edge of Beijing&apos;s Olympic site, Aedas has completed the North Star mixed-use development, comprising a six-storey podium of swooping shopping arcades, from which 100m-tall towers rise into the smoggy skies. It is built on a plot measuring 200m x 200m, which the company&apos;s design director, Andrew Bromberg, describes as an \u201cextremely small site\u201d. By no means the worst of its kind, it is one of many such generic developments that are increasingly defining the nature of the Chinese capital: hermetic indoor worlds sprouting above stations, with little connection to the life of the street outside \u2013 because the street is usually a six-lane motorway.     The six-storey North Star development in Beijing. Photograph: Aedas    \u201cIn Asia you can easily get away with six storeys of retail, no problem,\u201d says Bromberg, before flicking to a slide of the practice&apos;s Nanfung complex in Guangzhou. Opposite the world&apos;s largest conference centre, it&apos;s a pair of hulking towers of staggered blocks that look like the result of a glitch in the computer modelling programme. \u201cPeople see the photos of the project and say, &apos;Where&apos;s the humanism in this?&apos;\u201d he admits. \u201cBut when you see it in China, you realise it&apos;s actually very contextual.\u201d He flicks through more slides of wide-angle photos and dazzling renderings, showing floor plates stretched into ever more unlikely shapes and cladding systems wrenched around twisted lumps, as different global cities merge into one free-form soup of contorted mirror glass. There is Centre 66 in Wuxi, a 372,000 sq metre (4m sq ft) complex of shops and office towers clustered around a Ming dynasty hall, and renderings for Xihongmen in Beijing, a 465,000 sq metre (5m sq ft) development on the Fifth Ring road, shaped like a troupe of streamlined golden tanks ready to charge at the city. Each sculpted carapace contains interiors of sparkling shopfronts arranged around swirling atria, visions of economic growth and prosperity, unperturbed by the fact that the country&apos;s largest mall still stands empty almost a decade after it was completed. Such inward-looking buildings, which often span several city blocks, may be \u201ccontextual\u201d to the new cities of China in some architects&apos; eyes, but how such ambitions translate to London remains questionable, where news of 230 new towers planned across the city has renewed scrutiny of the skyline.     Plan for the Xihongmen development in Beijing. Photograph: Aedas    China&apos;s biggest developers \u2013 from Greenland and Vanke, to Dalian Wanda and ABP \u2013 are already flocking to the capital in response to demand from the country&apos;s burgeoning billionaire class, looking to park their money overseas. Last year ABP signed a \u00a31bn deal to transform the Royal Docks into an Asian business district, while Greenland bought Wandsworth&apos;s Ram Brewery, slated for a 36-storey tower, and a site in Canary Wharf, where it plans the tallest residential building in Europe. In 2013 the Chinese were granted the most tier-one investor visas for the UK (which fast-tracks the immigration process for those investing more than \u00a31m in the country), overtaking Russia for the first time. In 2003 there were no dollar billionaires in China; this year, the Hurun Global Rich List recorded 358. With the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the strength of the renminbi versus the pound, London is an increasingly attractive proposition \u2013 and practices like Aedas are only too ready to provide the same services their clients are used to back home. But at what cost to the city? \u201cLondon can&apos;t continue just putting these towers up everywhere,\u201d says Griffiths. \u201cThe city&apos;s infrastructure can&apos;t cope with densification across the board. It needs to densify at nodal points, and we think these big integrated mixed-use developments, connected around stations at first and second-floor level, are the answer.\u201d It might sound like a vision from Blade Runner, but it is a proposition that dates back more than half a century, to a grand plan for a future London connected by elevated walkways. In 1947, in a wave of postwar optimism, Charles Holden and William Holford developed a plan for a network of routes at first-floor level that would connect buildings across the City. Most extensively completed around the Barbican estate, the Pedway scheme was abandoned by the 1980s, incomplete and partially demolished, as the tide turned against the idea of separating pedestrians from the streets below. (Its history is loving documented in the film Elevating London). The same happened in many US cities that had adopted elevated skywalks, from Milwaukee to Minneapolis to Cincinnati, where raised walkways resulted in empty pavements and deserted downtowns, forming cities that were physically separated by economic class, socially stratified in concrete and steel. After 30 years in Hong Kong, the spiritual home of the elevated walkway and urban escalator, Griffiths is optimistic that its lessons can be transferred. \u201cIf you have enough pedestrian activity, then the street doesn&apos;t die,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are three levels of the city in Hong Kong, and they&apos;re all flourishing.\u201d As London&apos;s increasingly international development market brings not only overseas investment, but the physical realities of urban forms spawned in the high-speed laboratories of Asia&apos;s developing cities, the skyline debate might end up being the least of our worries. The next frontier will be a wave of ground-scraping mega-buildings looking to gobble up our streets, making an ever more privatised, polarised city, all conveniently swept indoors.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Cities", "China", "Planning policy", "Society", "Culture", "Retail industry", "Business", "Commercial property", "Real estate", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-15T14:29:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/17/brics-development-bank-africa-world-bank-tyranny", "sentences": ["South Africa\u2019s argument was too narrow, however; and it appears, according to documents prepared for the summit, that the bank will be based in Shanghai."], "title": "The Brics development bank can release Africa from World Bank tyranny | William Gumede", "article": "The leaders of the Brics countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 have signed a treaty in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza to launch a Brics development bank. The bank will rival the US- and European-led World Bank and its private lending affiliate, the International Finance Corporation, which have dominated development finance since the second world war. The Brics bank is positioned as a financial institution that will provide developing countries with alternative funding minus the punishing strings attached to World Bank lending, which strip recipient countries of the power to make their own policies. It also promises to make lending processes for developing countries faster, simpler and cheaper. The Brics members will set up a $100bn contingency reserve pool (called the contingent reserve arrangement, or CRA), to help members who face sudden foreign capital flights. China will contribute $41bn, Russia, Brazil and India $18bn each, and South Africa $5bn. Developing countries have long failed to get industrial nations to either give them a bigger say in decision-making at the World Bank and IMF, or to get these institutions to ease up on punishing and inappropriate structural adjustment programmes (that wealthy countries themselves would never implement in their own economies) in return for funding. The new bank and the contingency fund are therefore the first real and practical attempts by developing countries to create a monetary, development-finance and trade alternative to the IMF, World Bank and the dominance of the US dollar. The bank\u2019s creation will have to be ratified by the parliaments of the individual Brics countries. The hope is that it will start lending two years after ratification. But disputes over such things as voting rights and where the bank should be situated have so far delayed this process. China lobbied to host it, but India feared the domination of Chinese financial institutions. South Africa wanted Johannesburg as a \u201cneutral\u201d venue and also to serve as an African infrastructure bank. \u201cAfrica feels the bank should be established here, particularly because the greater need for the bank is on the continent of Africa,\u201d Jacob Zuma, the South African president, told the World Economic Forum on Africa last year in Cape Town. South Africa\u2019s argument was too narrow, however; and it appears, according to documents prepared for the summit, that the bank will be based in Shanghai. Africa desperately needs reliable and cheaper long-term development finance, without restrictive World Bank and IMF conditions. The Brics bank could also be a vital source of finance for infrastructure that Africa so desperately needs. But it could also provide finance to expand Africa\u2019s manufacturing sectors \u2013 so crucial if the continent wants to create jobs, and reduce inequality and poverty. The mere presence of a Brics bank that does not adhere to the structural adjustment philosophy of the World Bank and IMF could strengthen the hands of African governments to produce more independent \u2013 and relevant \u2013 national development policies, rather than the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach enforced by traditional lenders. The Brics bank could also help Africans to secure better investment deals in their negotiations with traditional multilateral banks and the private sector. However, there is no guarantee that a Brics bank would not attach conditions as onerous as those of the World Bank or other development banks \u2013 or that it would prioritise the development and infrastructure policies important to African economies, rather than just the Brics economies. Most current development banks in individual states, such as the Brazilian development bank, lend at market rates to African countries. Also, there is absolutely no guarantee that the Brics bank will be more development-oriented than other developmental banks. Africans will have to strike smart partnerships with the Brics bank, through African development banks, state-owned enterprises and the private sector. And, crucially, the bank will have to be based on good corporate governance.

Founded in 2000, the CPO was heard at the Barbican five years later; Yu, meanwhile, returned to conduct the BBC Symphony last year. A fine orchestra, with superb woodwind, they play with fastidious precision and considerable elegance. Yu, however, seemingly favours interpretative detachment. Though there are strengths and weaknesses in his approach, the emotional pitch of the evening was, if anything, too cool. The love scene from Tchaikovsky&apos;s Romeo and Juliet admirably avoided syrupy sentimentality, though the Capulet-Montague brawls were short on both violence and excitement. Mussorgsky&apos;s Pictures at an Exhibition, in Ravel&apos;s orchestration, contained some ravishing things, such as the poised, dreamy Vecchio Castello, though the work&apos;s darker moments, Gnomus and The Hut on Fowl&apos;s Legs, failed to disturb. Yu&apos;s choice of a curtain-raiser, meanwhile, was Elgar&apos;s Pomp and Circumstance March No 4, done with a metronomic rigidity more military than ceremonial. The two very different concertos at the programme&apos;s centre were more satisfactory. Haochen Zhang was the soloist in Liszt&apos;s First Piano Concerto, flamboyantly moody throughout and injecting some much-needed passion into proceedings. After the interval came the UK premiere of Joie Eternelle, a set of variations on a traditional Chinese melody for trumpet and orchestra, written for Alison Balsom by Qigang Chen, Shanghai-born, Paris-based and a pupil of Messiaen. Beautifully crafted, the score has a haunting, timeless beauty and proved a fine vehicle for Balsom, though its subtle gradations in difficulty more than once took her to the limits of technique and virtuosity. \u2022 The Proms continue until 13 September.

As they walked through its small central cluster of high-rises \u2013 some in use, many long-ago abandoned \u2013 they were impressed by what they saw. Amid the urban decay, they were shown art spaces, colourful tech startup offices, and other testaments to reinvention. \u201cRebirth of Detroit\u201d read one elaborately-stencilled mural. Wedged into an empty window frame of a crumbling mid-rise, a wood block carving depicted an Atlas-like figure hoisting a giant \u2018D\u2019 on his shoulders. \u201cRising from the ashes,\u201d it said. In September, the Shanghai-based developer Dongdu International (DDI) made its first move. In an online auction, it snapped up three iconic downtown properties, all built during the city\u2019s early 20th-century heyday as an industrial powerhouse. DDI purchased the David Stott building, a 38-storey art-deco skyscraper built in 1929, and the former Detroit Free Press newspaper headquarters, a T-shaped edifice adorned with bas-relief sculptures of biplanes and locomotives. Later, it acquired the 10-storey Clark Lofts, an inconspicuous residential building with a manual, pre-second world war elevator \u2013 the oldest in Detroit.  Altogether, DDI spent $16.4m (\u00a39.6m) on the properties, slightly more than a top-market apartment in Shanghai. The company plans to transform the buildings into vibrant offices and upscale apartments, according to the CEO of DDI\u2019s leisure branch, Peter Wood. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve shown to the locals in Detroit that we\u2019re deadly serious, then other things will happen,\u201d Wood says, sitting in his corner office on the 10th floor of a Shanghai skyscraper, a dozen or so Chinese employees typing diligently in cubicles outside. \u201cDetroit is planning for this area to come back. It\u2019s all about rejuvenation.\u201d      The 302,000-square-foot Detroit Free Press building,  abandoned since 1998, has fallen into an advanced state of disrepair. Photograph: Jonathan Kaiman    China has in recent years become the second largest foreign investor in US real estate after Canada \u2013 the dollar is weak, the yuan is strong, and the country\u2019s own real estate market is cooling down after years of explosive growth. While most buyers \u2013 individuals as well as companies \u2013 focus on reliable investments in cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, others are seeking new frontiers. Many have family in the US and degrees from US universities; they are attracted to complex, high-risk projects which require a deep understanding of local real estate markets, politics and laws. Even for them, though, Detroit is an ambitious target. While some parts are staging a comeback \u2013 the Quicken Loans billionaire Dan Gilbert moved his corporate headquarters there in 2010 \u2013 tens of thousands of the city\u2019s properties still lie abandoned among overgrown lots. Images of Detroit\u2019s urban blight have become a defining visual symbol of American rust-belt decline. Not surprisingly, DDI has run into problems with its investments: the 302,000 sq ft Detroit Free Press building, abandoned since 1998, has fallen into an advanced state of disrepair. After DDI took over the David Stott building, its best-known tenant, Detroit Yoga, relocated citing landlord concerns. One of the building\u2019s only other tenants, SkyBar, is currently suing DDI over a rent dispute. Neither DDI nor SkyBar\u2019s management would comment on the case. \u201cThey had these grand plans to dump millions into the [Stott] building,\u201d Ryan Snoek, a real estate consultant who coordinated the sale, told Crains Business Detroit. \u201cI&apos;m starting to become concerned that may not be the case, that they just bought the buildings and will just hold on to it.\u201d Ken Creighton, a local representative for DDI, said the company will be begin renovating the buildings in the \u201cfirst or second quarter\u201d of next year. &quot;We&apos;ll do the Free Press building first ... All of the buildings will be redone \u2013 their mechanical, electrical and plumbing, their elevators. Most of these buildings haven\u2019t had anything done to them in years, maybe decades.\u201d     The SkyBar, in the David Stott building, is suing new owner DDI in a rent dispute. Photograph: Jon Kaiman    Soon after Detroit declared bankruptcy last July, China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV ran a special report claiming that Detroit properties were selling for less than a pair of leather shoes. Immediately, real estate broker Caroline Chen\u2019s phone began ringing off the hook. Chen, who was born in Taiwan but has lived in Michigan for decades, works for RE/MAX Crown Properties in the affluent suburb of Troy, and she has become the go-to resource for Chinese investors looking to buy up Detroit real estate. Three years ago, she opened a second office in Shanghai. Chen says that she still receives countless calls from curious Chinese buyers, five to 10% of which eventually end in transactions. Altogether, her firm has sold about 300 homes to Chinese clients, most for between $500 and $10,000. Many of them don\u2019t understand how bleak much of Detroit has become. \u201cMost buyers, on a small scale, they think they can leave the property sitting there, and since everybody\u2019s buying, its value will go up,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s wrong. If everybody does that, then everything just sits there.\u201d In June 2014, one Chinese developer flew to Detroit to explore the possibility of building a Detroit Chinatown. \u201cMost of what I told him was negative, but that didn\u2019t scare him,\u201d Chen said. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s because Detroit\u2019s bad, that\u2019s why I want to develop,\u2019 he told me. \u2018We have seen so many examples of this \u2013 just look at Pudong in Shanghai.\u2019\u201d Two decades ago, the city\u2019s Pudong district was mostly marshland. Now, it\u2019s home to some of the most expensive real estate in the world. DDI\u2019s Detroit investments seem more calculated. The company already maintains properties in Shanghai, Nanjing, Chengdu, and California. It\u2019s also building a resort in Nova Scotia. Li Hailin, its 51-year-old chairman, has hosted government officials from Detroit\u2019s Wayne County at his home in central Shanghai. Li quit a government job at the age of 26 to become an entrepreneur in Shenzhen, the site of China\u2019s first experiments in free market capitalism. He made his fortune building migrant worker dorms.     The Pudong development zone in Shanghai. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cOur chairman sees a lot of things that other businesses don\u2019t \u2013 or don\u2019t want to try,\u201d says Solomon Wong, DDI\u2019s business manager for international projects. On a rainy day in March, Wong walks through a new row of 16-storey residential buildings in Shanghai\u2019s far-flung suburbs. DDI finished building them three years ago, he says; already, they are almost fully occupied. The complex is porcelain themed \u2013 at its centre is a small museum, featuring copies of ceramic masterpieces under glass display cases. Its walls are lined with photographs of other DDI properties \u2013 a gleaming commercial centre and a row of houses along a canal.  \u201cWe need to follow the rules of historical protection on these first few projects in Detroit,\u201d Wong says. \u201cBut for other projects, later, we could possibly build these kinds of things.\u201d The company has ambitions beyond real estate: DDI could soon bring Chinese auto industry savvy to the midwest, he says. China, in turn, could someday benefit from Michigan\u2019s celebrated universities and healthcare system. Analysts and competitors said that the firm would fail in Shenzhen, and then in Shanghai, according to Wong. Again and again, Dongdu has proved them wrong.

Witty, who is battling to repair GSK&apos;s corporate reputation, was speaking as Britain&apos;s largest drugmaker announced a 14% fall in second-quarter profits to \u00a31.3bn, missing analysts&apos; forecasts. The company&apos;s shares fell nearly 5% to \u00a314.81, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index. Profits were hit by competition from generic products and the strong pound. The firm now expects full-year earnings per share to be similar to last year. In China, where GSK has been rocked by serious bribery allegations since last summer, sales continued to fall, dropping 25% to \u00a3129m in the second quarter. Chinese authorities are investigating claims that GSK&apos;s sales reps paid doctors and health officials up to 3bn yuan (\u00a3284m) to push the company&apos;s drugs. The China scandal knocked four percentage points off GSK&apos;s otherwise stellar sales growth in emerging markets for the latest quarter. GSK staff have also been accused of bribing doctors in Poland, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Witty said: &quot;I remain very concerned about allegations concerning our China business. The situation is complicated and difficult and while the investigation is active there is little I can add.&quot; He said the allegations were &quot;contrary to the values&quot; he believed in. &quot;In a company of our size operating in almost every country in the world there&apos;s always a small potential for some people to step outside procedure,&quot; Witty said. &quot;This isn&apos;t acceptable, and where we are aware of misconduct, we take action including dismissal from the company.&quot; He added that the company had changed the way it did business, including &quot;how we reward our sales representatives, and stopping payments to doctors to speak on our behalf or to attend medical congresses&quot;. Last week GSK admitted it had dismissed staff in China in 2001 for bribing health officials. Britain&apos;s Serious Fraud Office recently began a criminal investigation into the drugmaker&apos;s sales practices around the world and said on Wednesday that it was working with the Chinese authorities for the first time ever. SFO head David Green told Reuters the Chinese government had a clear interest in rooting out bribery and corruption, though it might have &quot;slightly different perspectives&quot; from the SFO. The US department of justice is also investigating GSK for possible breaches of the foreign corrupt practices act. A British-US couple, who have been charged with illegally obtaining private information by China, will now be tried in public rather than in secret after the US and British governments raised concerns. This could mean the trial date, previously scheduled for 7 August, is moved. Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng, who ran a Shanghai corporate investigation consultancy for foreign firms operating in China, were hired by GSK last year to investigate a break-in after a video of the company&apos;s former China boss, Mark Reilly, having sex with his girlfriend in his Shanghai home was emailed anonymously to 13 GSK executives, including Witty. The whistleblower sent a series of other emails containing detailed allegations of fraud. Reilly has been accused by Chinese authorities of running a &quot;massive bribery network&quot; and could face a long prison sentence. Humphrey said he felt &quot;cheated&quot; by GSK, because he had not been given the full details of the corruption allegations. GSK hired his firm ChinaWhys to investigate the &quot;serious breach of privacy and security&quot; relating to Reilly rather than the allegations themselves. GSK&apos;s internal investigations have not found any evidence of widespread fraud. Witty said he was unable to comment on Humphrey&apos;s assertion. Despite the problems in China, emerging markets put in a strong performance, with GSK sales up 11% , which partially offset declines in Japan and the US of 7% and 10%. European sales were flat. Turnover in the second quarter fell 4% to \u00a35.6bn. GSK has introduced new inhaled medicines \u2013 Breo and Anoro \u2013 to offset the decline in its biggest seller, the asthma drug Advair, which still makes up nearly a fifth of sales but has come off patent. Uptake of Breo has been slow while Anoro, which has just come on to the US market, looks more promising, Witty said. He said GSK was in a period of transition, and stressed that it had a strong pipeline of new medicines, with six drugs approved last year and more than 40 in late-stage development. The worst of the patent losses are behind it. GSK believes Tivicay, to treat HIV, could become one of its most successful launches.", "tags": ["GlaxoSmithKline", "Pharmaceuticals industry", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Emerging markets", "Business", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-23T13:28:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/23/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-us-tour-ed-woodward", "sentences": ["Last summer, when United toured Australasia, the club made a 24,000-mile round trip and in 2012 they covered 22,000 miles when visiting Durban, Cape Town, Shanghai, Oslo and Gothenburg."], "title": "Louis van Gaal fears Manchester United are too big for their own good", "article": "Louis van Gaal has questioned whether Manchester United are \u201ctoo big a club\u201d for their own good as he outlined his concerns that commercial demands could hamper the team\u2019s success. Ed Woodward will seek a compromise with the manager over lucrative overseas tours. Woodward is insistent that United\u2019s commercial commitments should not have an impact on Van Gaal\u2019s work, with the executive vice-chairman clear the manager\u2019s demands for the side will always take priority. Van Gaal has complained that long travelling times and jet lag are disrupting his preparation of the team on their current trip to the United States. The Dutchman is with the squad in California on the first leg of United\u2019s 17-day tour, which will feature at least four matches, the first of which is on Wednesday evening, Pacific Time, against LA Galaxy in Pasadena. He told MUTV: \u201cMaybe it is too big a club. Not only in a sporting sense but also commercially. We have to do a lot of things that normally I don\u2019t allow. I have to adapt to this big club but I think also this big club has to adapt to Louis van Gaal. I hope we can have some balance to that.\u201d Van Gaal\u2019s complaints come despite this tour being a maximum 13,471-mile round trip, if United reach the final in Miami on 4 August. Last summer, when United toured Australasia, the club made a 24,000-mile round trip and in 2012 they covered 22,000 miles when visiting Durban, Cape Town, Shanghai, Oslo and Gothenburg. At Tuesday\u2019s pre-game press conference Van Gaal aired his concerns , saying: \u201cWe have to prepare the season and when you have commercial activities and dreadful distances, having to fly a lot and the jet lag, it is not positive for a good preparation.\u201d Van Gaal said he hoped next summer\u2019s tour, the destination of which is to be decided, will be shorter. Woodward, who is no longer on the tour because of work commitments, argues that United cannot ignore the potential of the US. Speaking on Monday, before Van Gaal\u2019s comments, Woodward said: \u201cAmerica and Asia are the two core places we tend to go to and both of them deliver a huge amount. The Premier League has been very clear in saying America is the No1 developing market. \u201cIt may be strange to describe the US as a developing market but if you look at the stats from the World Cup, the NBC numbers were two and a half times the previous Fox and ESPN [World Cup] numbers and despite finishing seventh we were the No1 most watched team [on US TV]. \u201cThis is a very good country [for us] from a potential sponsorship perspective, a potential media perspective. We\u2019ve got more fans here than we have in the UK.\u201d Woodward indicated that Van Gaal would be listened to. \u201cThe facilities in the US are excellent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe core of the tour is preparation for the season. That remains the core. That is the central part. \u201cOne of the things we will do differently on this tour is sit down with Louis very early [so he can] tell us how he wants the tour to be constructed. He will give us the skeleton of the tour. We will discuss that [where United go next] with him.\u201d Wayne Rooney said that the fan base in America was growing, when speaking on Sirius FM. \u201cIt\u2019s been a massive change since the first time we came here with the team,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve come back it\u2019s grown and grown.\u201d Van Gaal also said that it would be months before he would know whether United\u2019s seventh place last season under David Moyes and then Ryan Giggs was an underachievement. \u201cI cannot judge that because I am also new in the Premier League and when you see the Premier League there are also a lot of clubs capable of playing higher-level football and also the financial situation for the clubs in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have much more chance to buy players \u2013 much more than, for example, the Dutch teams. To be the champion in the Premier League is much more difficult than in the Netherlands or Germany. Because in Germany you don\u2019t have so much money as in the Premier League to give money out. I have to wait three or four months and give you a clearer answer.\u201d Paul Scholes has not burned his bridges with United despite his public criticism of Rooney and Woodward, and the executive is hopeful he can have a role at the club. Scholes was employed on an ad hoc basis as a coach by Giggs during the Welshman\u2019s temporary, four-match tenure as manager at the end of last season. At the end of May Scholes wrote in a column that Woodward \u201chas an awful lot to prove this time that he\u2019s good enough at his job\u201d and stated of Rooney: \u201cThere\u2019s a chance he\u2019s worn out.

The survey also confirmed some national stereotypes. Beer was cheapest in Germany, while New Yorkers have the lowest prices for Coca-Cola. Potatoes are a bargain, guess where, in Ireland. And Britain? We have the cheapest bananas. Europeans generally fared better than North Americans or Australians. The vast prairies of the US make it the bread basket of the world, yet shoppers in New York pay twice the price for a loaf of bread than those in London or Berlin. In Toronto, sky-high prices for meat pushed a typical trolley of goods to the highest in the survey. We don&apos;t claim our survey is an exhaustive or scientific analysis of grocery prices around the world. We asked our correspondents and contributors in the seven cities to go to their usual supermarket \u2013 which may not necessarily be the cheapest. Kaiser&apos;s in Berlin is pricier than Lidl. Auchan may not have had the same offers as Carrefour in Paris. We created the shopping list in London, and it inevitably reflects British purchasing habits. Fresh milk appears madly expensive in Paris \u2013 more than double the price charged in London \u2013 but the French buy relatively little fresh milk, preferring UHT instead. We tried to match items as closely as possible, yet local variations make comparisons difficult. Some chains offer ultra-cheap &quot;basics&quot; items, such as Tesco&apos;s &quot;everyday value&quot; sliced white bread, which at 47p a loaf is one third the price of Kingsmill wholemeal bread. Parisians might turn up their noses at such low-cost items \u2013 in Auchan, loaves started at around \u00a31.40, but they are probably a very different product to English sliced white. And how should we account for local tastes? In London, our shopper bought cheddar, in Paris it was camembert and in Berlin, gouda. We didn&apos;t even try to compare with Shanghai or Tokyo, where dairy products remain a very infrequent purchase. New York presented the biggest challenge. Our shopper used a mix of local stores \u2013 reflecting the fact that while Londoners might see a Tesco on every major shopping street, New Yorkers do not have a Walmart on their doorsteps. Interestingly, our New York and Toronto shoppers specified that they had bought &quot;free from hormones&quot; meat; in the EU, beef with injected hormones is banned. Finally, fluctuating exchange rates make price comparisons treacherous. Both the Australian and Canadian dollars rapidly appreciated against sterling, and although the pound has recovered some ground this year, it is still a long way below its peak \u2013 making prices in those countries appear very high, although compared with local wages they are much less so. However, the examples below do represent the experience of local people in real supermarkets, and give a flavour of who is, and who isn&apos;t (that&apos;s you, Canada) getting a good deal. Berlin Cheapest for bread, butter, eggs, sugar, apples, olive oil, beer, toilet paper Pricey for almost nothing     berlin    The Guardian&apos;s Berlin correspondent Philip Oltermann and his partner (above) went shopping at Kaiser&apos;s, a pricier and more upmarket chain than fellow German giants such as Lidl or Aldi \u2013 yet he was still charged significantly less than at any other supermarket we surveyed around the world. Most German supermarkets have copied the discounters, offering cheap prices on milk and meat, and as in Britain, there has been a significant shift from branded to own-brand goods. &quot;Whereas both Lidl and Aldi are enjoying runaway success abroad, their situation has been less comfortable in Germany,&quot; says Oltermann. &quot;If anything, the past few years have seen a trend of shoppers moving away from discounters towards premium supermarkets like Edeka and Rewe, many of whom have copied their cheaper rivals&apos; success and offer own-brand goods. According to Germany&apos;s biggest market research institute, GfK, the percentage of branded goods across German supermarkets has sunk by 9% since 2008.&quot; Meanwhile, German shopping habits are evolving fast. According to a GfK survey from October last year the number of people who say they deliberately buy less so they don&apos;t have to throw away has risen from 44% to 52% since 2010. &quot;Demographic change plays a crucial role in this trend. In Germany, the number of large households who do their weekly shop in one go is shrinking. Young, single-household shoppers tend to shop more spontaneously, and are more likely to ignore supermarkets altogether in favour of eating out, or do their shopping at local markets.&quot; London Cheapest for milk, bananas, baked beans, cornflakes, carrots Pricey for mince, wine, cheese, Coca-Cola     london    London may be viewed internationally as a very expensive city, but in our survey it was second cheapest for groceries. Some things appear crazily cheap \u2013 for example, bananas in Tesco are half the price of those at Auchan in Paris and a quarter of those in Loblaws in Toronto. Milk is also a fraction of the price charged in other international cities, and eggs too. But these super-low prices have attracted controversy. When Tesco slashed the price of a four-pint 2.27 litre carton from \u00a31.39 to \u00a31 earlier this year, it prompted howls of outrage from dairy farmers. The Fairtrade Foundation says the price war over bananas is seriously damaging developing countries. But British shoppers fare poorly in some areas. Duties make wine prices high while, oddly, Tesco sells Coca-Cola at almost three times the price we found in New York. And what explains why Tesco sells beef lean steak mince for \u00a38 a kg in the UK , while in Dublin it sells Irish lean steak mince at \u00a34.31 a kg (mind you, that&apos;s about the only bargain in Ireland)? Money writer Jill Papworth (above) shops for her husband, son and daughter at Tesco, and reckons her bill is around \u00a3150 a week. She buys bread locally and has milk delivered. Like many British shoppers, she finds she has to play a cat-and-mouse game with Tesco&apos;s myriad offers (some real, some less authentic) to keep costs down. &quot;I only buy washing-up liquid when it&apos;s on offer, and then I buy in bulk. I do the same with the three-for-two offers. Every time I look at my bill I expect to see that I&apos;ve saved around \u00a35 from these offers, although how real they are I&apos;m not so sure.&quot; She could save more by switching to &quot;everyday&quot; basics, but is hesitant about the quality. &quot;I&apos;ve got quite a fussy family. I steer clear of a lot of the basics offers on food, although I&apos;m quite happy to buy own-brand on non-food items.&quot; Paris Cheapest for wine, onions Pricey for milk, lamb, bananas     paris    Freelance journalist Judith Prescott (above), who has lived in the French capital for two decades, shops at supermarket chain Auchan for her husband and two daughters, and reckons her bill is around \u20ac100 a week (\u00a379), although that doesn&apos;t include the fruit and veg she tends to buy in local markets. Prices, she says, have stayed fairly constant in recent years. &quot;For the French, culturally and psychologically, any real rise in living costs is reflected in the price of a baguette \u2013 still a daily purchase for many. A standard baguette costs around \u20ac0.90 at the local boulangerie, a figure that hasn&apos;t changed significantly for over two years.&quot; But the stereotype of French shoppers merrily heading from boulangerie to charcuterie doesn&apos;t quite ring true. &quot;Figures show 87% of French people prefer to shop for most items at the supermarket,&quot; says Prescott. The low cost of wine \u2013 and quality wine at that \u2013 helped to keep Paris towards the bottom of the table for the total cost of our basket of goods. &quot;Autumn sees annual wine fairs in most supermarkets, where you can stock up on cases of excellent, well-priced wines for a fraction of the price in the UK \u2013 with even a wine expert on hand to discuss the best bargains. But it&apos;s a struggle to buy what are termed &apos;foreign&apos; wines \u2013 those from Italy, Spain, Australia, Chile etc. You have to head to the dust-covered shelf at the back of the shop for those.&quot; The same goes for cheese. &quot;You will find a huge range of French cheeses at affordable prices such as brie at just \u20ac7.05 a kg, but again you won&apos;t find much that isn&apos;t French. For a nice chunk of mature cheddar, it&apos;s off to Marks &amp; Spencer, which has just reopened in Paris. On the downside, the cost of everyday toiletries is expensive. You won&apos;t get much change from \u20ac4 for a standard 250ml bottle of shampoo, and the same for a name-brand deodorant or shower gel.&quot; Prescott adds that French supermarkets rarely have the two-for-one or buy-one-get-one-free offers common in Britain. &quot;Instead shoppers are offered substantial discounts on a range of goods if they choose a particular brand. This earns points on their loyalty card, which are then converted into cash.&quot; Dublin Cheapest for potatoes, mince, peas Pricey for toothpaste, washing powder, dishwasher tablets, wine     dublin    During the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; years, Ireland became renowned for eye-watering prices, with a hugely popular TV show called Rip-Off Republic reflecting despair over soaring costs for basic items. But despite the country&apos;s economic crash, our survey found groceries still remain significantly pricier than in other European capitals. Dublin may not quite be the mega-size of other cities featured in our survey, but is interesting because we were able to directly compare the prices at Tesco.com in the UK with virtually identical items (with identical packaging) at Tesco.ie in the Republic \u2013 and found some shocking differences. As is the case in Britain, Tesco is Ireland&apos;s biggest supermarket chain. Tesco eggs in Dublin are 44% pricier than in London. Tesco onions are 51% more. Weirdly, broccoli is 201% pricier (\u20ac5.35/\u00a34.22 per kg vs \u00a31.40 a kg). The same pack of Finish dishwasher tablets were half the price in the UK compared to Ireland. But it raises a cheer to see that potatoes, at 59p a kg, were the cheapest in our survey and compare to 80p a kg at Tesco in Britain. Dubliner Karen Murphy (above) reckons her family food spend is around \u20ac200 (\u00a3158) a week, spread over Tesco, Lidl and local butchers and fruit and veg markets. &quot;What is annoying is that we all get the British TV channels here, and we know from the adverts that we are paying way over the odds,&quot; she says. &quot;I tend to use Tesco for branded household goods such as shampoo, Lidl for things such as pasta and tinned tomatoes \u2013 and the local butchers for meat.&quot; Hard-pressed Irish shoppers, though, benefited from a vegetable price war that broke out between new arrivals Aldi, Lidl and local Dunnes Stores just before Christmas last year. Dunnes began offering 500g of Brussels sprouts, parsnips or clementines at just 6c (5p), while Lidl countered with a price of just 5c (4p) for a bag of potatoes, onions and carrots. &quot;It was mad. I got four bags of carrots for just 20c,&quot; says Murphy. But Irish farmers descended on the capital to protest, joined by smaller store keepers who saw their sales of vegetables decimated as shoppers switched to the discounters. New York Cheapest for Coca-Cola, cheese, rice Pricey for toilet paper, beer     new york    New York is unlike any other major world city in that the deep-discount supermarkets \u2013 such as Walmart and Costco \u2013 have zero presence in the city. Our survey, which showed that prices in New York were second highest after Toronto, gives a skewed picture of the United States overall. Many Manhattan residents shop at smaller stores, which don&apos;t have huge buying power, but they also tend to eat out more than residents in other capitals. Our shopper, Georganne MacCallum (above), an English teacher in Brooklyn, says keeping costs under control is a constant struggle, and that with four children her monthly grocery bill is typically $1,400 (\u00a3820). &quot;New York is not the easiest place to save money on groceries. We have many small grocery stores with limited choices. Now, we have a few newer, larger grocery stores, but they are higher priced because the quality of food is better (organic, free-range, hormone free). These stores have lower priced good-quality foods but few bargain brands to choose from. &quot;We eat a lot of whole foods, but limit our organic produce and meats because we just can&apos;t afford them. Fish is very expensive so it is not a regular product.&quot; Toronto Cheapest for salmon Pricey for almost everything else Canada&apos;s biggest city came out the surprise loser in our survey, with our basket of goods costing 40% more in Toronto than in Berlin. Meat prices were especially high, as was wine and beer. Canada, like Scandinavia, strictly controls the sale of liquor and has set minimum prices for alcohol, designed to reduce excessive drinking. High prices in Canada come as no surprise to local residents, who have long complained they pay more for groceries than their neighbours in the US. Critics say price competition is limited by the concentration of store ownership in just a few major chains. But some things in Canada are relatively low-cost, with salmon the lowest price in the survey. Our Toronto shopper, environmental consultant Nicola Crawhall, headed to Loblaws, Canada&apos;s biggest supermarket chain, where she shops for her partner, Nicky, and their two young boys. &quot;It is considered a bit upscale, but not quite as upscale as, say, Waitrose in Britain. Loblaws&apos; prices are fairly competitive, but it has irresistible speciality products that jack up the weekly shopping cost to well over $200 (\u00a3110) for our family of four. &quot;The grocery list provided by the Guardian was uncannily close to our regular shopping list, save for the leg of lamb (very expensive in Canada, and rarely fresh), the Coke (not good for the teeth!), and the chips (OK, we buy tortilla chips). &quot;The price of meat has skyrocketed this past year. Mince is so expensive that we buy one packet, not two, a week. Same with chicken breasts. Some weeks it is so expensive that I&apos;ll buy chicken thighs instead. I also buy hormone-free meat, which adds several dollars per pack. Meat easily adds $35-40 to my grocery bill. Sydney Cheapest for ice cream Pricey for tomatoes, coffee, cornflakes, oranges, apples, potatoes British tourists to Australia return home with stories of gob-smacking local prices \u2013 largely the result of the vertiginous rise in the Australian dollar on the back of a two-decades long economic boom. When commissioning this survey, we expected prices in Sydney to be the worst \u2013 yet we found that with meat and wine prices relatively in line or even below other places, our basket of goods came in below the level of Toronto. There was even one item cheaper than anywhere else: at Coles supermarket in Sydney basic vanilla ice cream costs just 60p a litre. Giles Rafferty and Kate Musgrove live in Sydney&apos;s inner west with their two boys, Ruari, four, and one-year-old Fionn. They moved to Australia from London 18 months ago and reckon they spend up to $200 a week (\u00a3110) on the weekly shop. The biggest difference Giles has noticed between the UK and Australia is the high price of &quot;some seasonal fresh foods like grapes and potatoes&quot; but also fresh meat and washing detergents/fabric conditioner. To keep costs down, he has little brand loyalty, buying own-brand where he can. He adds that local house prices and rents are ridiculously high, placing a significant drain on take-home pay and forcing people to tighten their belts on the weekly shop. And why, he asks, do Mars Bars cost so much here?", "tags": ["Household bills", "Supermarkets", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Food & drink", "Retail industry", "Life and style", "Cities", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-26T06:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/26/dijon-town-planning-elderly-age-friendly-cities", "sentences": ["City councillors from Shanghai visited Dijon recently to view its achievements."], "title": "Dijon adapts its urban thinking to the needs of an ageing population", "article": "When you reach a certain age, the difference between a friendly place and a hostile one may depend on apparently insignificant details. Like benches, essential if you need a rest, or steps that can delay you or trip you up, and of course shops and public transport. As studies have shown, movement is a key factor in ageing well and isolation should be avoided at all costs. &quot;A little activity does a huge amount to slow ageing,&quot; says Christiane Gindre, a pensioner and member of the Age Observatory in Dijon. This city in eastern France is working to ensure that planners and other public services make full allowance for such factors. In 2010 the capital of Burgundy became the lead partner in a network of towns, Villes Amies des A\u00een\u00e9s, in four French-speaking countries \u2013 France, Belgium, Switzerland and Canada (Quebec). On 30 June it held its second annual forum in Paris. The network, which is chaired by Fran\u00e7ois Rebsamen, the former Socialist mayor of Dijon and current minister of labour, now comprises about 30 French municipalities, including Bordeaux, Toulon, Nice and Toulouse. The World Health Organisation coordinates the corresponding global network, Age-friendly Cities, with about 1,000 members worldwide. City councillors from Shanghai visited Dijon recently to view its achievements. As in many other places, Dijon&apos;s population is ageing. &quot;The authorities&apos; usual response is to lay on services: clubs, meals, home-helps and specialist amenities for looking after those in need of care,&quot; says Pierre-Olivier Lefebvre, tasked with senior policies at the city council and delegate-general for the French-speaking network. &quot;But recent retirees will no longer accept that. They want services but also to use public transport and go on shopping at the market. They want to carry on operating as conventional residents.&quot; In practical terms this means, for instance, that eight fold-down seats have been fitted in the covered market, so shoppers can catch their breath without upsetting the stall-holders who sometimes need the space. There is also an experimental scheme to take people to the market and deliver their purchases. Many towns are scrapping benches, where groups tend to congregate, triggering resident complaints. But in the centre of Dijon there are still quite a few \u2013 though some say not enough \u2013 and even public armchairs. After a trial period, a poll was organised to choose the design. Voters preferred seats with armrests because it was easier to get up from them. Groups of residents went on exploratory walks to find the most suitable spots to site them. In the town centre, much of the road surface is even. Work in preparation for the new tram lines, launched in 2012, provided an opportunity to remove a lot of steps. Stops have raised platforms for level access to trams, making it easier for disabled people and those with pushchairs to use them. Another important feature is public toilet provision in the city. Lastly, a free mini-bus service criss-crosses the city centre. On the edge of the city a new development, comprising 24 homes, is experimenting in designs that accommodate the needs of an ageing population. Each home has 50 square metres of floor space, all on one floor. There are no fences between the gardens. Resident Annie Royant, 70, is pleased with her home. &quot;It&apos;s like in a village,&quot; she says. &quot;There are rose bushes but me and my neighbour have added other plants.&quot; Shops and a pharmacy are located nearby, as well as a bus stop.     A cafe in Dijon    &quot;Studies for which seniors were fitted with GPS tracking devices show that they operate within a radius of between 300 and 500 metres, at the most,&quot; says Pierre-Marie Chapon, a researcher and WHO adviser. &quot;If amenities are located in their vicinity, they&apos;ll go out every day, but much less if there are no shops.&quot; The experimental housing scheme, which is reserved for people who work or have worked locally, includes a refectory serving meals for residents. A &quot;housekeeper&quot; organises group activities and keeps an eye on tenants. Cultural activities are in high demand among the aged, so a lift has been installed in the local theatre and access to the city museum has been redesigned. Some shows start in the morning. Libraries stock large-print books and magnifying aids. Through the Dijon Senior Citizens Association, the council offers subsidised activities such as cooking, driving and swimming, mainly attended by women. &quot;We would like to attract more men,&quot; says Alain Pelletier, another member of the Age Observatory. &quot;When they stop work, they don&apos;t see themselves doing anything else.&quot; A Seniors&apos; House has opened in the same building as the observatory. Inquiries range from finding a home help to how to use a tablet computer, through to what&apos;s on at the theatre. Policies are decided in consultation with members of neighbourhood groups and the Age Observatory. &quot;It&apos;s important to make allowance for such factors at all times,&quot; Lefebvre explains. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to begin with. Ageing has a negative image. But if people can gain several years&apos; autonomy, over and above the happiness of individual residents, it also benefits the community as a whole.&quot; The bill on adapting society to accommodate ageing, approved by the French cabinet on 3 June, places no mandatory requirements on local authorities. What progress is made will depend exclusively on their individual commitment.

While hardly occupying the same space in terms of mood and genre, the TV spinoff sucked up a huge cinema audience, and Rise fell 49% at the box-office that weekend. This time, with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, it&apos;s a different story. Ever since Warners moved the Wachowskis&apos; Jupiter Ascending off the 25 July date, the slot in the release calendar has looked exceptionally soft, especially for a weekend that essentially kicks off the English school summer holiday. Fox presumably couldn&apos;t have been happier that the strongest competition Dawn would face on its second weekend came from Brett Ratner&apos;s Hercules, hardly one of the most enticing prospects of summer.           The result? Dawn fell 47% on its second weekend, an almost identical drop to Rise&apos;s. For a summer blockbuster, plunging by half is pretty much par for the course \u2013 Transformers: Age of Extinction declined 52% in its second session \u2013 but the weak competitive environment seemed to promise a more gentle fall on this occasion. Now that the school holiday has begun, cinemagoing becomes less concentrated into the weekend, more spread across the week, and Fox can point to a healthy result overall. The last seven days saw Dawn gross a nifty \u00a38.26m, bringing its total to \u00a316.97m after just 11 days. That&apos;s the third-highest total this year for a film after two weekends of play, behind The Lego Movie (\u00a321.88m at this stage of its run) and X-Men: Days of Future Past (\u00a319.47m). Dawn will easily cruise past Rise&apos;s lifetime total of \u00a320.77m. \u2022 Mark Kermode reviews Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\u2022 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: The ape of things to come The runner-up           Since Hercules was always highly unlikely to knock the Apes off the top spot, Paramount will be happy to have landed in second place with its swords-and-sandals action adventure. But the opening number, \u00a31.45m, is hardly cause for great cheer. That&apos;s only the 27th biggest debut of 2014 so far, even if previews are excluded from all films&apos; opening tallies. It&apos;s lower than the first sessions of titles including The Monuments Men, Need for Speed and Last Vegas: hardly films that captured the popular imagination. Within the Dwayne Johnson oeuvre, comparisons are hard to make, since so many of his bigger hits are franchise pictures originating with other actors: Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, GI Joe: Retaliation and Mummy spinoff The Scorpion King. Last August, Pain &amp; Gain, co-starring Mark Wahlberg, began with \u00a31.02m including previews of \u00a3367,000. Two months before, Snitch kicked off with \u00a3268,000. Hercules at least opened significantly (more than seven times) bigger then Kellan Lutz starrer The Legend of Hercules. That film kicked off in March with \u00a3190,000 from 276 cinemas. \u2022 Little Hercules: Stuart Heritage eats and exercises like The Rock for a day\u2022 Peter Bradshaw reviews Hercules The genre hit           With a production budget of just $9m (\u00a35.3m), as against a reported $100m (\u00a359m) for Hercules, The Purge: Anarchy looks a much more profitable proposition, if UK box office is anything to go by. The latest from low-budget genre hitmaker producer Jason Blum (Paranormal Activity, Insidious) lands with a nifty \u00a31.17m from 385 cinemas, yielding a \u00a33,026 average. That&apos;s slightly ahead of the debut of the original The Purge in May 2013: \u00a31.02m from 348 venues. In that session, The Purge faced five other films all grossing \u00a31m-plus, collectively representing rather tougher competition faced on this occasion by sequel Anarchy. \u2022 Mark Kermode reviews The Purge: Anarchy\u2022 The Purge: Anarchy - Six of the worst masked men in horror The first six months           Admissions numbers \u2013 which take significantly longer to arrive than box-office data collected by Rentrak \u2013 are now in for June, and thus for the first six months of the year. Given the Fifa World Cup kicked off on 12 June, with the inevitable knock-on effect on the film release calendar, it&apos;s no great surprise to see UK admissions (number of tickets sold) for June 2014 trailing behind 2013 levels (10.40m vs 13.03m). More worrying for the film industry is the overall picture: admissions down 8% on 2013 for the first six months of the year. Cinema owners will be hoping that Guardians of the Galaxy and The Inbetweeners 2 can end the summer on a high note, with the year&apos;s fourth quarter offering Chris Nolan&apos;s Interstellar, David Fincher&apos;s Gone Girl, the next Hunger Games and the final Hobbit, among other likely winners. The arthouse market           Once again, Richard Linklater&apos;s Boyhood is the top arthouse title, in fact rising one place to No 7 in the chart. The film has made another significant expansion of footprint, now playing at a wide 253 cinemas, with the site average tumbling by 44%. That drop is likely a reflection of the film now playing at less-targeted sites, and it will be holding up better at core arthouse venues. (The film fell a slimmer 30% at London&apos;s Curzon Soho, for example.) After 17 days of play, Boyhood has grossed \u00a31.43m, which compares with \u00a3932,000 lifetime for the best-performing entry in the director&apos;s Before trilogy (2004&apos;s Sunset). School of Rock, with \u00a310.50m, is the only previous Linklater film to have exceeded \u00a31m in the UK. Boyhood opened the same weekend as John Carney&apos;s Begin Again, and the two films have gone on opposite trajectories. Boyhood began with 89 cinemas, expanding to 159 and then 253 venues, while Begin Again has followed a more conventional pattern of steady contraction following an initial release at 347 theatres. While Begin Again originally scored better than Boyhood (\u00a3456,000 vs \u00a3333,000), it&apos;s now seven places lower in the chart, with a gross this past weekend of \u00a383,000. Its total to date is a decent \u00a31.32m.           Top new entry among arthouse titles is David Gordon Green&apos;s Joe, with \u00a334,000 from 37 cinemas. The film was released simultaneously on video-on-demand, although earnings from this platform have not been disclosed. \u2022 Richard Linklater and Ellar Coltrane: &apos;Making Boyhood was a dear process&apos;\u2022 Oscar predictions 2014: Joe The tail end With 15 new films released at the weekend \u2013 pretty much par for the course these days \u2013 once again a number of titles have eluded the attention of audiences. The bottom five in the &quot;Other openers&quot; chart (see below) managed less than \u00a32,000 between them. And spare a thought for Scar Tissue, which recorded an official gross of just \u00a310. The 18-certificate thriller (tagline: &quot;Evil leaves its mark&quot;, although evidently not at the UK box office) played lunchtimes only at London&apos;s Rich Mix cinema in Bethnal Green. The film has now switched to London&apos;s Peckham Multiplex, and is on DVD and on demand from 4 August. The future Given the relatively weak field of new releases, grosses predictably trailed the equivalent weekend from 2013 (by 25%), when The Wolverine landed at the top spot. Cinema bookers now hope takings will bounce back with the arrival on Thursday of Marvel&apos;s Guardians of the Galaxy, which is picking up warm buzz. Also in the mix: dance sequel Step Up 5: All In, animation The Nut Job and a range of smaller pictures including period romance A Promise and Michel Gondry&apos;s whimsical Mood Indigo. The following week (6 August) sees The Inbetweeners 2, and the exhibition industry will be ardently hoping that audience enthusiasm hasn&apos;t dimmed any since the original The Inbetweeners Movie scored an amazing \u00a345m in 2011.

When inequality grows in a nominally communist society, who watches out for the poorest? Millions have risen out of a hand-to-mouth existence over the last 30 years, but 12% still live in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. And although China became the world&apos;s second largest economy in 2010 (and will soon overtake the US as the first), it ranks 83rd on per capita income, behind Botswana, Romania and Venezuela. As the economy grows, the state \u2013 which was originally set up to provide cradle-to-grave care \u2013 has become more tolerant of civil society and NGOs. The Economist reported in April 2014 that 500,000 NGOs have registered in China over the last 25 years, and there has been a loosening of restrictions on official registration over the last three years. Over a million more NGOs work without being registered, The Economist adds. Yet the political environment in China creates a challenging landscape for civil society. An unpredictable legal system, restrictions on protest and limitations on internet access as well as freedoms of speech, assembly and press, mean that is difficult for civil society to thrive. Some groups are navigating successfully around these restrictions. Environmentalists have made the most progress. The Green Volunteer League of Chongqing successfully stopped illegal logging in an ancient forest with the support of China&apos;s largest TV channel CCTV and won the first public interest case against the state to court in 2011. Human rights defenders however, are treated as enemies of the state. International and foreign-funded NGOs meanwhile are regarded with suspicion. The 2008 Sichuan earthquake marked a turning point as the government coordinated the emergency response with national and international NGOs. But the ensuing allegations of corruption at the Chinese Red Cross and limitations on fundraising mean the civil society-state relationship is still tense. How can Chinese civil society work with, or at least around, the state? What are the most reliable revenue streams that filter through the restrictions? Can China&apos;s growing middle class be persuaded to forgive the corruption scandal and make regular donations to the third sector? Or are China&apos;s two-million millionaires a more profitable source? Join us on Thursday 7 August, 1-3pm BST, to discuss.

Another 150 people were injured in the blast on Saturday morning in Kunshan, a city in the eastern province of Jiangsu near Shanghai. Workers in the factory were producing parts for cars for US companies including General Motors, state media said. &quot;We heard the explosion and we were all shocked,&quot; a security guard from a nearby factory told Agence France-Presse. He said the blast happened as workers were changing shifts, resulting in higher casualties. Photographs posted online showed a charred body being wheeled on a stretcher, and people with burned clothing sitting on the ground outside a factory complex that was billowing black smoke. Forty people died at the scene, and more than 20 others died in hospital, Chinese broadcasters said. Medical staff were sent from Shanghai to treat burns victims, according to the People&apos;s Daily. Preliminary investigations suggest that the blast was caused by dust produced as workers polished metal meeting with high temperatures or an open flame, China&apos;s ministry of public security said. &quot;The scene is a mess, it&apos;s unrecognisable,&quot; a witness at the scene wrote on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Chinese state television identified the factory as Zhongrong Plating. Company officials could not be reached for a comment. Its website says it employs 450 workers and counts General Motors and other US companies as clients. No one at General Motors in China was immediately available for comment. Jiangsu province is on China&apos;s coast, where many local and foreign companies have facilities producing goods for export. Kunshan is a centre for Taiwanese investment, with factories supplying China&apos;s vast automotive manufacturing industry. Industrial accidents are common in China, where safety standards are often lax. A fire at a poultry plant in the north-east of the country killed 119 people last year. Reports at the time said managers had locked doors inside the factory to prevent workers from going to the toilet, leading to the high death toll.

Outside, Fringe-goers hunched their way through the sheeting rain, damply seeking out entertainments that might or might not prove worth the ticket price. Inside the Commonwealth Pool The Daley Show was playing. And for one night only it was the best solo act in town. It was supposed to be a two-hander. Daley\u2019s rivalry with Australia\u2019s Matthew Mitcham has enjoyed as many twists and turns as their trademark moves, ever since Daley emerged as a young teenager to steal the world 10m title \u2013 and the limelight \u2013 from an Olympic champion six years his senior. Four years ago Mitcham had to settle for silver to Daley\u2019s gold in Delhi. This was his opportunity to redress the balance and win his first individual Commonwealth title. But someone had thrown out the script. The head-to-head between these two turned out to be the worst flop of the night and Daley struck out on his own, with a gigantic lead of 82.85 over the eventual silver medallist, Malaysia\u2019s Ooi Tze Liang. It finished off England\u2019s best ever diving performance at a Commonwealth Games, with 10 medals, four of them gold. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very long season,\u201d said Daley, \u201cit\u2019s been very tiring for all the athletes and there it was about who could hold it together in their heads. I\u2019m just finally happy to have something to show for all the hard work I\u2019ve put in.\u201d It was also a resounding answer to the criticism that Daley has become preoccupied by his television commitments. \u201cI used to do school full-time and nobody used to worry,\u201d he said, with a wry humour that would no doubt get him a booking at The Gilded Balloon. Ironically it was Mitcham \u2013 who has been touring a one-man cabaret about his life in Australia, complete with Alanis Morissette songs on the ukulele \u2013 who looked as if his mind was elsewhere. The 26-year-old hinted at retiring after the competition, saying he no longer wants to \u201ckeep putting my life on hold\u201d and \u201cwould totally want a career in the entertainment industry\u201d. Only Mitcham knows if treading the boards has affected his ability to leap from them but things went wrong from the start. A judging conflab left him waiting on the platform and he rolled over on his first and easiest dive. The defending champion followed him, his legs ratcheting skyward to his armstand with agonizing slowness, then \u2026 tumble, tumble, tumble, and he slid into the water like syrup. Mitcham had scored 6.5s and Daley was holding 9s against them. After round two Mitcham was languishing in ninth place, his most difficult twist dive scoring a full 12 points fewer than it had in the morning preliminaries. By the halfway point of the competition the Australian\u2019s challenge was a busted flush and even being outdone by his 19-year-old synchro partner Domonic Bedggood. To make it worse, whatever he did, Daley immediately followed it with a smoothness and composure that reinforced the disparity between the pair. Even the \u201cdemon dive\u201d that Daley had tanked in the morning session did not let him down. It was a performance that showed how mature a sportsman he has become and there was a pleasing symmetry in the debut appearance of his 14-year-old England team-mate Matthew Dixon, who could have been the ghost of Daley\u2019s past. The latest little prodigy from Plymouth looked as if he had stumbled into the line-up while queuing for a bag of chocolate buttons. But when he nailed his fourth dive, even the replays got a huge cheer. In the women\u2019s 3m springboard final earlier in the evening England\u2019s Hannah Starling had saved her best dive to secure bronze behind Australia\u2019s Esther Qin and Canada\u2019s Jennifer Abel. But the 19-year-old from Leeds did not realise when she won her first senior international medal here. \u201cIt was a complete shock to me,\u201d said Starling, who admitted she had not even looked at the scores. \u201cMy coach just gives me this look whenever I get fourth, because I get fourth all the time. He had the same look on his face and I thought, \u2018Oh no, oh no, I came fourth.\u2019\u201d That is a feeling Mitcham currently knows only too well. Towards the end of the 10m final he began to opt for safer options, only to see even the bronze medal slip out of reach. When Tze Liang and Vincent Rindeau of Canada shared the podium with Daley, it was the closest they had got to him all night. \u201cThere\u2019s every possibility I can mix it with the Chinese now,\u201d said Daley, who was quick to reaffirm his commitment to Rio 2016. \u201cI came back from Shanghai and all of a sudden I saw that I was retiring after the Commonwealths!

Businesses recorded growth rates only slightly below the previous month&apos;s record as the US continued to rebound from freezing weather in the spring that sent the economy&apos;s recovery into reverse. But the Markit purchasing managers&apos; index (PMI) contained warning signs that the 4% annualised GDP growth in the second quarter was unlikely to be maintained after service sector businesses reported a fall in confidence and a slowdown in job creation. Meanwhile analysts also said a fall in service sector activity growth in China last month to a record low would dent confidence in the global economy&apos;s growth prospects and its ability to maintain recent rises in output during the second half of this year. Chris Williamson, Markit&apos;s chief economist said the summer months could represent a peak in the rate of growth. &quot;The surveys indicate that the rate of job creation has waned, as have inflows of new business. Business confidence has also fallen to the lowest since late 2012 as companies have noted greater economic uncertainty and mounting risk aversion.&quot; The US economy suffered in the spring after the country was blanketed in freezing snow, closing factories and cutting transport links. The bounce was rapid and revealed all major sectors recovered most of the lost output. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve have hinted at an early rate rise should the momentum continue into the latter half of the year, but appear to be vindicated in their warnings that it is unlikely while the recovery remains bumpy. China, the world&apos;s second largest economy, saw its services sector slow sharply in July to its lowest level in nearly nine years. The HSBC/Markit China services PMI fell to 50 in July, the lowest reading since data collection began in November 2005, indicating a recovery in the broader economy is still fragile and may need further government support. A reading above 50 indicates growth while a fall to 50 shows the sector stagnated in July. Services, which account for about 46% of GDP and roughly half of all jobs in the country, have been one of the few bright spots in China&apos;s economy this year. Analysts said the sudden signs of weakness raised the question of whether Beijing will need to do more to shore up growth as well as consumer and business confidence. Qu Hongbin, HSBC&apos;s chief economist in China, said: &quot;The weakness in the headline number likely reflects the impact of the ongoing property slowdown in many cities as property related activity such as agencies and residential services see less business.&quot; He added: &quot;Today&apos;s data points to the need of continued policy support to offset the drag from the property correction and consolidate the economic recovery.&quot; China&apos;s main stock markets fell on the news. The Shanghai Composite Index ended down 0.2% at 2,220. The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.3%. Some economists blamed a slowdown in the housing market for the weak reading, as property-related activities saw less business. China Vanke, the country&apos;s biggest residential property developer, lost 2.1% of its value after posting July sales which showed a big drop from June. Poly Real Estate also slid 1.7%.

It asserts overtly that if global public institutions \u2013 specifically the IMF and the World Bank \u2013 are not going to reflect the new power structures in the globalised economy, they will simply become redundant. So will the Argentinian \u201cdefault\u201d (Report, 2 August) be a turning point in private financial markets. Argentina is being held ransom by a few, grossly self-interested vulture funds. However, equally important in the long-term consequences, is that so are the other investors and that this is being enforced through the legal jurisdiction of the US. Sovereign issuers \u2013 including those far more powerful and assertive politically, and with large domestic capital surpluses compared to Argentina \u2013 as well as investors will demand bond issuance in alternative jurisdictions that allow for payouts to investors in the event of minority hold-outs. If New York or London won\u2019t adapt, then the financial markets and legal jurisdictions of Sao Paulo, Hong Kong and Shanghai will. Globalisation is radically restructuring public institutions that fail to recognise and respond to the new power structures. The question remains open as to how this will take shape in relation to private markets, including in financial markets where New York and London remain the dominant global centres. But the Argentina default opens the door to speculation. Judith Tyson Research fellow, International Finance, Overseas Development Institute \u2022 Larry Elliot writes that states should be able to seek some protection against creditors (States must be allowed to go bust, 1 August) But at least the ruling about Argentina\u2019s debt was given in open court, with rights of appeal. Under the investor-state dispute settlement provisions of the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership, cases like this would take place through an unaccountable international arbitration process, outside any existing legal systems, with no rights of appeal. It\u2019s no surprise that TTIP is being negotiated in secret between the EU and US, if it is intended to transfer so much power away from democratic control into the hands of private corporations.

They came sporadically throughout the first two months of 2013 \u2013 long, unsigned, highly detailed missives alleging malfeasance at the China office of UK pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. The sender was &quot;gskwhistleblower&quot;. Recipients included the chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, and 12 other GSK executives. They received the sex tape in March. The male subject was clearly the company&apos;s then China boss, Mark Reilly, 52, who had been living in Shanghai since 2009. The tape had been filmed surreptitiously in his guarded luxury home. The woman was his Chinese girlfriend, a young secretary at a travel company. Reilly was troubled and GSK approved an investigation, so he called in Peter Humphrey, a UK citizen, and his American wife, Yu Yingzeng, known as two of the best corporate detectives in China. They had operated the small firm ChinaWhys since 2003, conducting &quot;wide-ranging discreet inquiries into difficult commercial matters&quot;, according to the firm&apos;s website. Humphrey had previously spent two decades as a foreign correspondent for Reuters, based in Asia and eastern Europe, before breaking into corporate investigation. Yu, 61, was trained as a forensic accountant. Humphrey, 58, has a round, affable face; he wears gold wire-frame spectacles beneath a shock of salt-and-pepper grey hair. Reilly offered him \u00a320,000 from GSK&apos;s coffers to find out how the camera had ended up in his home. Humphrey named the investigation &quot;Project Scorpion&quot; and spent months reviewing the emails. Although he never found a definitive answer, bit by bit, he began to suspect the corruption claims \u2013 accusations that health officials had been bribed to buy GSK drugs \u2013 were true. The couple had planned for the GSK investigation to be one of their last jobs in China. Their 19-year-old son was to attend university in the UK, and they hoped to move back too. But last summer their world came crashing down. In late June, authorities raided GSK&apos;s China headquarters in Shanghai, confiscating documents and detaining employees. Over six years, they said, GSK may have spent \u00a3285m on bribing doctors and hospital officials to sell their drugs. On 10 July, the authorities ransacked the ChinaWhys office and detained the couple on suspicion of &quot;running an illegal company&quot;. Humphrey and Yu &quot;illegally trafficked a huge amount of personal information on Chinese citizens to seek profits&quot;, state media reports said. A few weeks later, they appeared on state-run television. &quot;To obtain this information, I sometimes used illegal means,&quot; Humphrey said, handcuffed and in an orange prison vest. &quot;I&apos;m extremely repentant for this, and want to apologise to the Chinese government.&quot; Humphrey and Yu go on trial on Friday accused of illegally purchasing personal information about Chinese nationals, an unprecedented charge for foreigners in China. Last week, their son, Harvey, was allowed to visit them at Pudong detention centre in Shanghai for the first time since their arrest. Both had lost a lot of weight, he said. Yu was emotional \u2013 &quot;shocked&quot; to see her son. They discussed books she had read in prison, mainly tomes on philosophy and US politics that she was given by consular officials. &quot;I guess she uses them as a psychological barrier,&quot; Harvey said. Humphrey was was more stoic, advising him on practical matters: arranging his tuition fee status for university, managing family assets. &quot;We did touch on GSK very briefly,&quot; Harvey said. &quot;I did mention Reilly to my dad, and he expressed a very low opinion of him.&quot; Throughout the fiasco, one figure has lurked in the background: Vivian Shi, GSK&apos;s former government relations manager. Reilly suspected she was the whistleblower, although she has denied it. Shi spent four years at the company, but left in December 2012, shortly before GSK executives began receiving the emails. She is supposedly well-connected in public security, and her father was a senior communist in Shanghai. Humphrey was jailed soon after she learned of the investigation. &quot;[Humphrey] hit a nerve in this investigation, a really deep nerve,&quot; said Kerry Brown, a Chinese politics expert at the University of Sydney and a former diplomat in Beijing. &quot;And when this happens to somebody with his experience in China \u2013 a real professional \u2013 it makes you take a breath and go, no one can really say that they are invulnerable in this market.&quot; Reilly, who remains a GSK employee, was in the UK when GSK&apos;s China headquarters were raided, but returned to aid the investigation. He was barred from leaving and remains in China; his movements are restricted. In May, prosecutors accused him of overseeing a &quot;massive bribery network&quot;. If found guilty, he could spend years in jail. &quot;For the foreign business community in China, for a long time, there was a feeling that the worst that could happen is you&apos;d get kicked out,&quot; said Duncan Clark, the head of BDA China, a consultancy in Beijing, and former chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China. &quot;That&apos;s over, clearly.&quot; For GSK, there is a lot on the line. It has spent hundreds of millions trying to crack China&apos;s pharmaceuticals market, now the second largest in the world, after the US. Witty has trumpeted a zero tolerance attitude towards corruption at the company. He reiterated on 23 July that he was &quot;very concerned&quot; by the allegations, saying they were contrary to his values. Referring to China, he said: &quot;We have new management there on the ground, and are focused on building a robust business.&quot; The drugmaker has kept ChinaWhys at arm&apos;s length. GSK says the charges against Yu and Humphrey may not be related to GSK, and Chinese state media have never explicitly made the link. One company insider said GSK managers had not identified the whistleblower, and insisted it was not important. The priority, they said, was determining whether the fraud allegations were true. Chinese prosecutors had been keeping GSK in the dark, the insider said, refusing to disclose the investigation&apos;s findings, even its timeline. Harvey Humphrey said: &quot;[GSK] didn&apos;t extend any supporting hand at the beginning \u2013 they went into survival mode, denying all connection with my parents, which I found quite disingenuous, to put it lightly. I&apos;m not particularly critical of the Chinese \u2013 I&apos;m more critical of GSK. The Chinese are what they are, and we&apos;re used to it.&quot; In May, Britain&apos;s Serious Fraud Office began a criminal investigation into GSK&apos;s sales practices across a number of countries. GSK also faces corruption allegations in Poland, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Although its internal investigations have not found evidence of widespread corruption in China, the company has hired an American law firm, Ropes &amp; Gray, to conduct an independent inquiry. GSK reiterated last month that it &quot;takes these allegations seriously and is continuing to co-operate fully with the Chinese authorities in this investigation. The group has informed the US department of justice, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK Serious Fraud Office regarding the investigation and is co-operating fully with these agencies.&quot; If convicted, Humphrey and Yu could be sentenced to one to three years in jail. Consular officials say they have both had medical problems in detention: Humphrey has a hernia, arthritis, prostate problems, and compression fractures in his upper spine. Fumes from a rubbish incinerator near the prison have given him asthma. Yu has joint problems and a blocked kidney. Both are in cramped rooms with six or seven other inmates; chronic bunk shortages mean they occasionally must sleep on the floor. In a letter to his son in mid-June, reproduced by the South China Morning Post, Humphrey wrote: &quot;When I became a business consultant 16 years ago, I concentrated on helping distressed companies and individuals who were victims of crime.

The switch by Hampton to the top role at Britain&apos;s biggest pharmaceutical company is expected to be confirmed next month. He would replace Sir Christopher Gent, the current chairman, who has indicated he intends to stand down at the end of 2015 after almost 10 years in the role at the pharmaceutical company, which is battling for its reputation in the midst of bribery allegations. The RBS chairman has been facing questions about his intentions to remain at the 81% taxpayer-owned bank since Stephen Hester quit as chief executive in June 2012. At the time Hampton said he had &quot;no imminent plans&quot; to quit until Hester&apos;s replacement had &quot;their feet under the table&quot;. Hester&apos;s successor Ross McEwan has now been at the helm of the bank for a year, while Hampton&apos;s remarks that a chairman should serve between five and seven years have been interpreted as meaning he would seek to leave after the bank&apos;s annual meeting in 2015. If he does take the chairman&apos;s seat at GSK, which Sky News reported would be confirmed next month, he will joining a business facing severe reputational challenges. The trial is due to start on Friday in Shanghai of the private investigators brought in to investigate a covert sex tape of the former head the pharmaceutical company&apos;s China division. The secretly filmed video of Mark Reilly and his Chinese girlfriend in his Shanghai flat was sent to GSK executives while Reilly was accused by the local authorities of running a bribery network. The investigators brought in by GSK \u2013 Peter Humphrey, a Briton, and his wife Yu Yingzeng, an American national \u2013 are now facing trial for illegally purchasing information about Chinese nationals. The allegations of bribery sparked the GSK chief executive Andrew Witty to declare the company had a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach to any attempts at corrupt sales practices of the type it faces in China and other countries in which it operates. However, GSK also faces of bribing doctors in Poland, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. In May, the Serious Fraud Office said it had launched a formal criminal investigation into GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s sales practices. For Hampton to take up the chairman&apos;s role at GSK he would likely be appointed to the board as non-executive director first with his elevation to the chairman&apos;s seat at a later point in 2015. A former corporate financier, Hampton has held a number of roles in the boardrooms of major companies including finance director of British Steel and a short stint at Lloyds before the 2008 banking crisis. He was chairman of supermarket group J Sainsbury when he was parachuted in to chair RBS after its \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout. The government is yet to sell off any of its stake in RBS and had indicated that it does intend to do so before May 2015, unlike Lloyds Banking Group where a 43% stake has been cut to 24%. Hampton last month oversaw the release of RBS&apos;s interim results a week early because of better than expected profits of \u00a32.6bn \u2013 the highest since the 2008 bail out.

GSK&apos;s China office, which is the target of a separate corruption investigation, was one of their last clients. The year-long case has caused concern among the country&apos;s foreign business community. And while court proceedings on Friday were ostensibly open to the public, authorities only allowed family members and consular officials inside the courthouse. The court broadcast transcripts of the proceedings via its official feed on the microblog Sina Weibo.

Humphrey, testifying first, accepted the charges but refused to comment on each one specifically, citing a lack of familiarity with Chinese law. He spent hours responding to highly specific questions about his company&apos;s operations. The firm was registered in Hong Kong and Shanghai, he said.

He conducted his investigations via internet searches, interviews, and site inspections. &quot;The majority of our work is done using public information,&quot; he said, adding that the firm occasionally contracted third-party firms to track down private information on citizens.

Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters    Humphrey was a Reuters foreign correspondent for nearly two decades, and Yu was an accomplished accountant; they opened their Shanghai-based firm ChinaWhys in 2003. Last summer, GSK hired them to uncover the provenance of a tape reportedly showing the firm&apos;s then-China boss, Mark Reilly, having sex with his girlfriend in his Shanghai home. The video was sent to GSK executives along with a string of emails accusing the firm of mass-scale bribery. The 19-year-old son of Humphrey and Yu said in an interview before the trial that he was &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; about its outcome. &quot;If they did do something illegal, I assure you it wasn&apos;t intentional,&quot; said Harvey Humphrey. &quot;I don&apos;t see what else [the government] can get out of holding them for longer.&quot; His parents have had medical problems while in detention, he said. Peter Humphrey has arthritis, spinal problems and a hernia while Yu has joint and kidney problems. Yet their son said that despite the grim conditions, he has not seen any evidence of mistreatment, and both of his parents have befriended their warders. Many observers say that Humphrey and Yu were prudent, experienced businesspeople, and they were detained because it was likely that their investigation trod on the toes of someone powerful. Humphrey&apos;s inquiries centred on a GSK government relations officer, Vivian Shi. She had left the company the previous December, and Reilly suspected her of being the whistleblower. Humphrey and Yu were detained soon after they completed their report. Harvey Humphrey said that he blames GSK for his parents&apos; situation, not the Chinese government. The pharmaceutical firm, he said, told his parents that the whistleblower&apos;s allegations were untrue. &quot;From the outside, it looks like deception to me,&quot; he said. &quot;If they admitted the allegations were true in the beginning, my dad would have used a different style of investigation.&quot;", "tags": ["GlaxoSmithKline", "Pharmaceuticals industry", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-08T08:37:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/08/world-in-a-week-hundreds-dead-in-southwest-china-earthquake", "sentences": ["Bad week for Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng, the GlaxoSmithKline consultant and his wife are on trial in Shanghai for trafficking personal data."], "title": "World in a week: hundreds dead in southwest China earthquake", "article": "Good week for Raudhatul Jannah, an Indonesian Tsunami survivor who was reunited with her parents after nearly ten years.

Peter Humphrey, 58, was also fined 200,000 yuan (\u00a319,300), and his wife, Yu Yingzeng \u2013 a naturalised American citizen \u2013 was sentenced to two years and fined 150,000 yuan in the first case of its kind involving foreigners in China. Humphrey will be deported at the end of his sentence. GSK was not mentioned during proceedings that shed rare light on the operation of corporate sleuths in the world&apos;s second largest economy, but the firm is at the centre of a complex web of allegations. Humphrey and his wife have been detained since July last year on suspicion of using illegal means to collect data. GSK had hired them to investigate why the company&apos;s then head of China operations, Mark Reilly, had been filmed surreptitiously having sex with his Chinese girlfriend in his guarded luxury home. &quot;I am very sad about the court&apos;s verdict, but I hope the authorities will take into account their poor health conditions,&quot; Harvey Humphrey, the couple&apos;s 19-year-old son, said in a statement after the court&apos;s announcement. Harvey said his father has been suffering from arthritis, compression fractures in his upper spine and a hernia; his mother has a blocked kidney. The verdicts came as GSK finds itself the target of a separate corruption investigation in China after a whistleblower raised allegations of widespread bribery. Although Chinese authorities have not publicly linked the two cases, Humphrey has blamed GSK for his situation. GSK declined to comment yesterday. In his closing statement during the day-long trial, Humphrey said he had been fascinated by China since the 1970s and wanted to contribute to Chinese society by fighting corruption. He said he failed because he misunderstood a change to the country&apos;s criminal law on privacy in 2009. &quot;My wife and I still love and respect China passionately,&quot; he said. Yu asked for forgiveness. The case has sent chills through the country&apos;s foreign business community. While proceedings at the Shanghai first intermediate people&apos;s court on Friday were ostensibly open to the public, authorities allowed only family members and consular officials inside the room. The court broadcast transcripts of the proceedings via its official website feed. Prosecutors accused Humphrey and Yu of illegally obtaining 256 items of information on Chinese citizens, including IDs, mobile phone numbers and travel records for between 800 and 2,000 yuan (\u00a377-\u00a3193) each, the court heard. However, that information was not linked in court to the investigation they carried out on behalf of GSK. Humphrey accepted the charges but refused to comment on specifics, citing a lack of familiarity with Chinese law. He said his and his wife&apos;s Shanghai-based company, ChinaWhys, was chiefly concerned with uncovering instances of fraud. Humphrey spent hours responding to questions about the company&apos;s operations. The firm was registered in Hong Kong and Shanghai, he said. His clients were &quot;large or medium-sized companies&quot; operating in manufacturing and finance, as well as law firms, both foreign and Chinese. He conducted his investigations via internet searches, interviews and site inspections. &quot;The majority of our work is done using public information,&quot; he said, adding that the firm occasionally contracted third-party companies to track down private information on citizens. Prosecutors questioned Humphrey over the alleged tailing of a target during a past operation called Operation Blackthorn, in which he investigated the general manager of a Finnish company for fraud. Humphrey said a third-party contractor tailed the target. His lawyer added that tailing a person did not necessarily constitute illegal behaviour. Humphrey was a Reuters foreign correspondent for nearly two decades and Yu was an accountant. They founded their company in 2003. In her testimony, Wu emphasised that ChinaWhys did not directly buy and sell private information. Instead it used the information to compile reports, which it then sold to clients for between 20,000 and 200,000 yuan. Sometimes, she said, she and Humphrey would assume aliases, posing as business contacts to receive information. She admitted that she bought private information from three agents: Liu Yu, Cai Zhicheng and a lawyer named Zhou Hongbo. She did not believe that purchasing the information was illegal. &quot;Do you think it would infringe upon your privacy if your husband&apos;s or son&apos;s private information was bought and sold?&quot; a prosecutor asked Yu. &quot;I have lived abroad for a very long time,&quot; she replied. &quot;My US phone number and address can be found in the yellow pages \u2013 in the US, it&apos;s very easy to find such information.&quot; The prosecution claimed that before the trial, both Humphrey and Yu testified to police that they knew the company was operating in a legal &quot;grey zone&quot;. Prosecutors said the company made about \u00a32m in revenue between 2005 and 2013. In their closing statement, prosecutors said Humphrey and Yu had &quot;severely&quot; broken the law by systemically violating people&apos;s privacy over a period of nine years, bringing them substantial profit. &quot;Let us consider, if our citizens live in fear in such an environment, how can they feel secure, free or have human rights?&quot; they asked. Harvey originally intended to enrol in university this year to study mechanical engineering. Instead, he has spent most of the past year living in a flat in Surrey, communicating with his parents through consular officials and managing the family assets. On the day Humphrey and Yu were detained, he was in Hong Kong on a summer internship, he said in an interview before the trial.

Boris already has an ambitious &quot;Smart London&quot; plan. Now he has to deliver all those commitments, including affordable ultrafast broadband. Set up a London Innovation Lab whose remit is to identify, pilot and help roll out &quot;smart&quot; innovations. That could be anything from Santander&apos;s air-quality monitors or Boston&apos;s Citizens Connect app for reporting local problems such as graffiti or damaged signs. Esther Rantzen, CBE Founder of ChildLine and The Silver Line Adopt the New York City Bench scheme , and allow 1,000 Londoners a year to choose where to place a bench paid for by the GLA and by donations. I know it works. As I wander around Hampstead Heath I always read the names carved on the backs of the benches. It may be narcissistic of me, but I would love future generations to pause as they stroll along the banks of the Thames and relax on a bench which is named after me. I hope they will be joined on the bench by other Londoners and maybe make new friends. It&apos;s one way to combat the loneliness that abounds in our overcrowded city. Satish Kumar Editor-in-chief of Resurgence &amp; Ecologist magazine Installing solar panels on every Londoner&apos;s roof, and improving home insulation, could trim 20% off our soaring domestic fuel bills, cut pollution and carbon emissions, and help boost the capital&apos;s environmental reputation, as well as that of the mayor&apos;s. Britain is facing an energy crisis which burning expensive imported gas or proposing cripplingly expensive \u2013 and politically divisive \u2013 nuclear power stations won&apos;t solve. Now that a majority of the world&apos;s population lives in cities, our capital should be leading the way in sustainable, decentralised ways of living. And while you&apos;re up there, Boris, how about some schemes to encourage rooftop gardening? We should be growing more of our own food, too. Rowan Moore Architecture critic When elected, Johnson promised he would reverse Ken Livingstone&apos;s fondness for permitting tall buildings, that he would not allow a &quot;Dubai on Thames&quot;. On this he has executed a perfect U-turn, except that it is an insult to Dubai to compare it to the mediocrity of the 200-plus towers now in the pipeline in London. His excuse is that London faces a severe housing shortage. But there is no evidence that flats in residential skyscrapers are the answer to the city&apos;s needs. In his remaining time he can enforce existing policies on the quality and location of towers more seriously. He can review London&apos;s ramshackle apparatus of planning provisions on height, with a view to their reform. He can create a digital model of the city so that Londoners can see what is proposed for it. He can appoint a commission of people who know about urban design to help him with all of the above. David Robinson Founder of Change London Create 1,000 weekend play streets and show a mayoral determination to make London the greatest city in the world to bring up a child. Astonishingly, roads make up 80% of our public space in London and we have surrendered them almost entirely to the car. Busy streets mean fewer chats over the wall, fewer impromptu gatherings and fewer children playing out and drawing adults in. It is no coincidence that cul-de-sacs sustain the highest levels of social cohesion vital to health and happiness. At 30 streets per borough, a target of 1,000 play streets is eminently achievable, as the trailblazers in Bristol and Hackney have shown. Samantha Heath Chief executive,  London Sustainability Exchange Tackle London&apos;s air pollution problem. An estimated 4,000 Londoners every year die prematurely from causes related to air pollution, which contributes to myriad health problems, including strokes, heart and lung diseases. Children are particularly at risk because of their smaller lung capacity. In parts of London air pollution can be up to four times higher than the EU limit in areas such as bus stops, built-up areas, under bridges and where traffic is often at a standstill. Meanwhile, the EU has launched legal action against both France and the UK on account of its dangerously poor air quality. London&apos;s mayor, via cleaning up taxis and buses, strengthening planning regulation and logistics centres to aid zero-emission deliveries, could help to give London much cleaner air over the next 12 months. Alison Garnham, chief executive,  Child Poverty Action Group London has the highest rate of child poverty in the UK, with almost four in 10 children in the capital living in poverty. This is partly because the city&apos;s job market is not working for mothers. Employment rates for women with children in London are 12 percentage points lower than the national average. Boris Johnson has huge influence with employers , who could be encouraged or incentivised to offer high-quality part-time or flexible jobs. He could make it easier for parents to access and afford childcare, including a pan-London information service, and help with the upfront costs and deposits. Will King Founder of King of Shaves Heathrow was in the right place, at the right time. Having flown into many airports around the world, what strikes me is how &quot;small&quot; Heathrow is, compared with the airports in, for instance, Shanghai or Hong Kong. And right now small does not attract big. Britain is great at carrying out innovative strategic infrastructure projects \u2013 Eurotunnel, for example. So why don&apos;t we build the coolest airport in the world, in the coolest city in the world, in a part of Greater London which isn&apos;t &quot;way out&quot; \u2013 as is the case with Stansted or Gatwick? Philip Colligan Executive director, Innovation Lab Nesta Offer prizes for innovation to help entrepreneurs create products and services that could be sold to cities around the world. Boris should also use the GLA&apos;s huge estate and land holdings to provide more of the flexible, low-cost space that start-up businesses need, alongside supporting the accelerator programmes that help them flourish. Duwayne Brooks Director of Active Community Engagement and Development Trust in the Met in some boroughs is at an all time low. Building on the work of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, Boris should promote local road shows with senior officers and publish regular figures on local incidents, arrests and numbers charged. I want Boris to publicly reward the great and good at the Met, to champion how this wonderful city is policed 24 hours a day, to remind the public there is no them and us.\u2022This article was amended on 11 August 2014 to correct the name of the London Sustainability Exchange.", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "UK news", "London", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-09T23:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/12/china-ngo-government-civil-society", "sentences": ["Leigh-Anne Russell, founder, Nestworks, Shanghai, China, @NestworksChina Government restrictions are easing: Since April, the regulations for registering as an NGO in Shanghai became easier.", "Xi (Hank) Qizheng, director of programmes, Me to We, Shanghai, China, @hankxi Going up the government hierarchy gets things done: Just like governments elsewhere, China&apos;s consists of many layers: central, provincial, municipal, county, township, rural village.", "Richard Hsu, adjunct professor, school of design and innovation, Tongji University, Shanghai, China, @hsu901 A progressive generation Y is alive and well in China: I am in the midst of many young students, high school and university.", "Richard Brubaker, founder, Collective Responsibility, Shanghai, China, @richbrubaker Keeping your head down is the best way to make progress: The key is to maintain a focus on the work, solve problems, and engage as many people as one can in the process so that pilots can be proven, programmes can be stabilised, and trust can be developed."], "title": "13 things you need to know before starting an NGO in China", "article": "Leigh-Anne Russell, founder, Nestworks, Shanghai, China, @NestworksChina Government restrictions are easing: Since April, the regulations for registering as an NGO in Shanghai became easier. Local NGOs no longer need to get a sponsor, although foreign NGOs still have to. I am certainly seeing a lot more activities around capacity building, social entrepreneurship and training in how to apply more business world strategies for NGOs. Charity corruption scandals have left their mark: With the recent earthquake in Yunnan, people have been circulating warnings on social media about getting duped by fraudsters stealing donation funds and the Red Cross scandal has been in the news again because girl who was the catalyst, Guo Meimei, was recently arrested in Macau. Ruge (Sally) Gao, researcher, Cornell University, Beijing, China A sponsor makes it easier for NGOs to work: It is much easier to establish an NGO with an Chinese government sponsor. A large Chinese corporation may also do. The key to success for NGOs wishing to bring in aid to China is to identify themselves as non-threats to existing cultures. The softly softly approach builds more possibilities for the future: NGOs in China are working towards a careful, curbed and partial success, but small victories nevertheless pave the way for future momentum. If NGOs in the education sector are more accepted for their ability to bring in teachers than their ability to advise on overall education policy, then work with the cards you&apos;re given. Civil society can be approached little by little. Whatever reputation an NGO creates paves the road for future organisations. Mark Sidel, professor of law and public affairs, International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, Madison, USA, @marksidel Not all NGOs are created equal: The state could treat all environmental public interest groups the same, or treat all disability rights groups the same \u2013 but it doesn&apos;t, and that&apos;s very interesting. So a complex situation gets even more complex, as the state allows space for some advocacy groups, while not for others. Charitable giving is on the rise: As a general trend we are seeing enhanced giving, with jumps and dips in particular years, but the trend is upward. And it&apos;s diversifying \u2013 giving for local groups, online giving, formation of foundations and other philanthropic entities, even some giving overseas \u2013 and that makes it all the harder to measure with precision. Xi (Hank) Qizheng, director of programmes, Me to We, Shanghai, China, @hankxi Going up the government hierarchy gets things done: Just like governments elsewhere, China&apos;s consists of many layers: central, provincial, municipal, county, township, rural village. Depending on the mission of an NGO, identifying the appropriate layer of government to work with is key. From our experiences, the &quot;two levels up&quot; rule usually works wonders. Richard Hsu, adjunct professor, school of design and innovation, Tongji University, Shanghai, China, @hsu901 A progressive generation Y is alive and well in China: I am in the midst of many young students, high school and university. They want to contribute, act, change ... The common question is: how can we bring change? Civic mindedness is not prominent: When money, wealth and winning are the foremost prominent thoughts in a population&apos;s mind, how can they be distracted with civic activities? This problem is not exclusivel to China - look at Singapore, Hong Kong, London, New York and Los Angeles. Richard Brubaker, founder, Collective Responsibility, Shanghai, China, @richbrubaker Keeping your head down is the best way to make progress: The key is to maintain a focus on the work, solve problems, and engage as many people as one can in the process so that pilots can be proven, programmes can be stabilised, and trust can be developed. I don&apos;t know if that is thriving, but it is progress, and progress worth maintaining. Maya Wang, China researcher, Human Rights Watch, Hong Kong, @wang_maya Human rights are not getting better: In the past year since President Xi Jinping came into power we&apos;ve seen a worsening of human rights. Xi has staged a strategic, multi-pronged crackdown, with a focus on the press, internet, and NGOs. The needs are great: As China moves rapidly from communism to capitalism, many groups find themselves losing the basic &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; or any other social security they used to have. These people are also finding the government largely unresponsive to their needs because of corruption, lack of effective channels for redress, lack of democracy. So there&apos;s tremendous needs in society, and NGOs are moving in to fill them. You need to be creative to survive, but be aware of the risks: To work around restrictions NGOs can work on less sensitive topics, with friendly government officials, partner with local organisations and try to funding sources that aren&apos;t considered &quot;sensitive&quot;. All of that is being done very creatively by many on the ground. But, we have to ask ourselves whether doing so might compromise one&apos;s original intentions. Helping the government maintain the status quo in some ways undermines long-term prospects, as ultimately civil society does need a free press, a democratic government and freedom of association.

Unlike their British ancestors, the vehicles will be purpose-built to handle the extreme temperatures of an Australian summer.

The London Taxi Company has been given permission to roll out 100 of the cabs throughout the city after a successful trial in Perth which began in December.  The company\u2019s chief executive, Evan Simeon, said Perth had been chosen for the initial fleet because of its extreme temperatures \u2013 they can reach upwards of 40C (104F) in summer. \u201cWe wanted to introduce them into a hot environment to see if the air conditioning and engineering could withstand the heat,\u201d he said. \u201cCustomer feedback indicated that the air conditioning could be a bit cooler, so we\u2019ve made the changes necessary and have upgraded the vehicles in Perth, which will be the same as the ones we will now bring to Melbourne. \u201cWe also improved the cooling system for the engine, and increased the insulation.\u201d Fares would be set the same as standard yellow taxis, but the cars could carry an extra person. Melbourne taxi drivers had been contacting him about driving the cars. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see the 100 out there by the end of the year but that all depends on bureaucratic processes,\u201d Simeon said. A Victorian Taxi Services Commission spokesman confirmed the fleet had been approved.  Last year, the Victorian Taxi Drivers Association said it would be watching the Perth trial closely, but was not available for comment on Thursday. The London Taxi Company is owned by the Chinese company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. The cars are manufactured in Shanghai and Coventry, north-west of London.

The contribution made by the Chinese Labour Corps was barely recognised at the end of the war, and has almost been obliterated since. There is no tribute to them among Britain&apos;s 40,000 war memorials, there are no descendants in Britain because they were refused any right to settle after the war, they were literally painted out of a canvas recording all the nations who joined the war effort, and many of the records of their service were destroyed in the blitz of the second world war. However, a campaign has now been launched by the Chinese community in Britain to create a permanent memorial in London to the Chinese Labour Corps and the dirty, dangerous, vital work they did behind the lines on the western front. Steve Lau, chair of the Ensuring We Remember campaign, was invited to the service of commemoration at Glasgow Cathedral 10 days ago. &quot;My invitation was probably the first time the British government properly recognised the Chinese Labour Corps since the end of the war,&quot; he reflected. Recruitment of the Chinese began in 1916 as ever escalating casualties meant labourers became disastrously scarce. Many came from such remote farms that when they reached the tall buildings and busy waterfront of Shanghai, they thought they had arrived in Europe. In fact it was only the start of an appalling journey on which many died \u2013 by ship across the Pacific, six days crossing Canada in sealed trains to avoid paying landing taxes, on by ship to Liverpool, by train again to Folkestone, and on to France and Belgium, where they lived in labour camps and worked digging trenches, unloading ships and trains, laying tracks and building roads, and repairing tanks. Some who died on the voyage are buried in Liverpool, and 2,000 more lie in Commonwealth war graves, but some sources believe 20,000 died. They worked 10-hour days, seven days a week, and had three holidays including Chinese New Year. When the war ended and other men went home, they worked on until 1920, clearing live ordnance and exhuming bodies from battlefield burials and moving them to the new war cemeteries. China declared war on Germany in August 1917, when a German torpedo sank the French ship Athos, with the loss of 543 Chinese lives. In 1919 China refused to sign the treaty of Versailles, in bitter disappointment over the breaking of a promise that in return for their support for the allies, the Shandong peninsula would be returned from Japanese control. Lau said that when Britain distributed 6m commemorative medals to all who took part in the war, those received by the Chinese bore only their numbers, not their names, and were bronze, not silver. Painfully symbolically, the Chinese were also painted out of a giant canvas exhibited in Paris at the end of the war. It was believed to be the largest painting in the world, and showed a victorious France surrounded by her allies. It was begun in 1914, but had to be changed in 1917 to include the arrival of the United States \u2013 the space was found by painting over the Chinese workers. When the Imperial War Museum reopened last month after a \u00a340m rebuild, the campaigners were saddened but not surprised that there was no mention of the Chinese labourers&apos; contribution in the new first world war gallery. The broken promise at Versailles led in part to Lau&apos;s own birth in Birmingham, son of a Chinese chef. His father left as a boy when, as predicted, war broke out again with Japan over Shandong, making his way first to Hong Kong and then England. The campaign to create a permanent memorial in central London, to be unveiled in 2017 sited either in Southwark or Westminster, is backed by the Chinese embassy and the Chinese in Britain Forum. Lord Wallace of Saltaire, who attended the launch representing the Foreign Office and is a member of the official advisory group on the first world war commemorations, said the campaign was a useful corrective to what he called &quot;the Daily Mail approach&quot; to the war, portraying plucky little England standing alone against the enemy. &quot;It was never a purely English effort: it required the effort of a great many people from a great many countries, willingly or unwillingly.&quot;", "tags": ["First world war", "China", "UK news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-14T17:02:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice/2014/aug/15/chinas-environmental-problems-cai-guo-qiang", "sentences": ["Upon entering the Power Station of Art in Shanghai, visitors come across the massive installation The Ninth Wave, also the title of the exhibition.", "Cai had planned for the fishing boat installation to sail from Quanzhou to Shanghai but failed to get all of the permissions necessary.", "He had also hoped to sail the boat along the Huangpu River in Shanghai but permission for this was refused and instead it was brought along the river on a barge.", "Another piece in the exhibition, The Bund Without Us is a huge work that was made using gunpowder which was then exploded to blur the famous Shanghai skyline.", "It represents the city of Shanghai with no human life and has been overtaken by nature.", "The Bund Without Us re-imagines the city of Shanghai without humans and overtaken by nature.", "Cai Guo-Qiang: The Ninth Wave takes place at the Power Station of Art in Shanghai until 26 October."], "title": "China's environmental woes inspire art | Jennifer Duggan", "article": "A dilapidated wooden fishing boat laden down with animals who are just skin and bone, a sort of dystopian Noah\u2019s ark trying to escape the end of the earth and an empty city devoid of human life that has been overtaken by nature. These nightmarish scenes are not science fiction but part of a new art exhibition by one of China\u2019s most famous artists, Cai Guo-Qiang. The exhibition by New York-based Cai aims to shed light on China\u2019s environmental problems. Cai said he likes to look at issues within a society and express them in his art. \u201cChinese people have access to most things except clean air so I have a sense of how severe environmental problems are in this country,\u201d he said.  Upon entering the Power Station of Art in Shanghai, visitors come across the massive installation The Ninth Wave, also the title of the exhibition. It is a towering fishing boat with 99 fabricated animals on board. The boat comes from the artists\u2019s home town, Quanzhou in Fujian Province. The inspiration for the piece came from the incident last year of 16,000 dead pigs found floating in the Huangpu river.  Cai had planned for the fishing boat installation to sail from Quanzhou to Shanghai but failed to get all of the permissions necessary. He said that he has had to play \u201chide and seek a little\u201d with the authorities because his subject matter is related to a sensitive topic in China. \u201cOf course there are occasions where I encounter resistance from the authorities,\u201d he said. He had also hoped to sail the boat along the Huangpu River in Shanghai but permission for this was refused and instead it was brought along the river on a barge. The museum, a former power station, along with the air quality and smog in China also influenced some of Cai\u2019s works for the exhibition. Another piece in the exhibition, The Bund Without Us is a huge work that was made using gunpowder which was then exploded to blur the famous Shanghai skyline. It represents the city of Shanghai with no human life and has been overtaken by nature.     The Bund Without Us re-imagines the city of Shanghai without humans and overtaken by nature. Photograph: Zhang Feiyu/Courtesy Cai Studio     In the piece Cai uses animal and plant motifs, references to traditional Chinese forms of artwork which allude to a time when people lived in harmony with nature. \u201cIn ancient times, people were more respectful of the environment. The problems we have now are a symptom of the times where people are more aggressive and materialistic and are exploiting nature\u2019s resources to make money for their own means,\u201d Cai said. Cai has a fondness for making a bang, literally, often working with fireworks and other explosive materials. The exhibition kicked off with what the artist called a \u201clarge-scale explosion event\u201d using coloured smoke pyrotechnic effects. Called Elegy, the display projects an image of nature in decline.  Ironically the pyrotechnic display garnered some concerns from the Chinese public. On the Chinese social media site Weibo, some users expressed alarm at the explosions and others said they were concerned about pollution from the smoke. However, Cai\u2019s PR team said that environmentally safe products were used including food colouring, fabric dyes and other non-toxic materials.

With Gordon Willis\u2019s gorgeous cinematography, Manhattan is rendered in a lustrous, glowing monochrome, fetishing the city, erasing its poverty and crime \u2013 then at its notorious zenith \u2013 and making of it a shangri la of sophistication. The opening sequence is a famous montage: static exterior shots of Manhattan, daytime and then night-time, to Gershwin\u2019s Rhapsody in Blue. Those images have almost eclipsed memories of the story itself. Allen\u2019s camera is out and about on the streets of New York, and he is always gloriously at home there. London in It Always Rains On Sunday  Released in 1947, directed by Robert Hamer            There are plenty of movies that use London\u2019s tourist locations as establishing shots. Aerial images of the House of Commons or, nowadays, the Gherkin are so interchangeable that film-makers might as well use stock footage. Robert Hamer\u2019s excellent 1947 melodrama is quite different. He sometimes uses built sets, but he also uses real locations in a recognisable working city, shooting in places like Stratford and Chalk Farm. Notably, the film stays out of the centre. There are comparisons with Marcel Carn\u00e9\u2019s Les Enfants Du Paradis, with its teeming market scene. It is a very intelligent use of London. Belfast in Odd Man Out  Released in 1947, directed by Carol Reed            Carol Reed is a brilliant director of cities in films. In Odd Man Out, the city becomes a character in its own right. Everyone remembers abject, poverty-stricken and war-ravaged Vienna in his The Third Man. This is just as powerful. Set in Belfast, it brings a documentary vividness to the city. Belfast really deserves the title \u201ccity\u201d here \u2014 a booming place before its troubles, bustling, vital and prosperous. A place where a packed tram can visibly head for the Falls Road without any fear, other than that which is disclosed by the story, which is itself a premonition of the city\u2019s future woe. James Mason is an IRA man holed up in a safe house, who leaves his confinement to lead a bank robbery. A great city film. Nanjing in Spring Fever  Released in 2010, directed by Lou Ye            In 2009, Chinese film-maker Lou Ye made an intriguing noir about sexual transgression, gay and straight. Noir movies are always set in big cities, of course, but they tend to be places of shadows and darkness. This is different: it is set in Nanjing, one of China\u2019s cities with almost exponential growth, a megacity only outsized by places like Beijing and Shanghai. Lou deploys fascinating images of the big city in daytime: eerily colossal new buildings and gigantic pedestrian piazzas \u2014 impressive in some ways but weirdly featureless, without the poetry conferred upon Manhattan by its denizens. Lou works imaginatively with its very impersonality. Paris in Cl\u00e9o De Cinq \u00c0 Sept  Released in 1962, directed by Agn\u00e8s Varda            The film-makers of the French new wave were brilliant in their passionate connoisseurship and celebration of Paris, a place virtually re-invented by popular culture. In fact, this movement\u2019s relationship with the city has still not been investigated and researched as thoroughly as it might be. Truffaut, Godard and Rivette all made brilliant films with Paris as a virtual character, but Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s delicate, witty, sad, ambulatory movie is of particular interest: in some ways the work of a cin\u00e9-fl\u00e2neur. A woman tours around Paris, waiting for the results of a medical test, and modern-day lovers of the film can recreate her journey. Varda\u2019s Paris is sited with concrete specificity in the film. Tehran in Fireworks Wednesday  Released in 2006, directed by Asghar Farhadi            Tehran has tended to be a closed and alien place to Western media. For many, it is represented by journalists\u2019 images of the hostage crisis or the Ayatollah funeral. The work of film-maker Asghar Farhadi shows us a Tehran which is much more like a European city than cinema-goers here had suspected, a place with recognisable people whose stressed working lives are not governed just by geopolitical issues that make it onto the news. His Fireworks Wednesday is a fascinating drama, centred around the city\u2019s traditional New Year\u2019s celebrations involving fireworks in the street. The city is a thrumming beehive of middleclass lives, all buzzing with secrets and lies. Los Angeles in Heat Released in 1995, directed by Michael Mann            Michael Mann\u2019s Heat, in which Al Pacino\u2019s cop faces off against Robert De Niro\u2019s gangland villain, is a real LA film. A film set in a huge, sprawling, de-romanticised metropolis. It portrays LA as a place where criminals are rootless, almost weightless. They have not put down roots in LA; they have made no emotional investment. When the heat is on, they have to be ready to walk away. Mann\u2019s LA is a city of glass and steel modernity, a city which will provide a suitably glamorous sheen for its sexy shootouts and confrontations. The place is anathema to pedestrian dawdling: very different from the LA historical sites in, say, Alex Holdridge\u2019s In Search Of A Midnight Kiss. The sleek forms of LA inspire a kind of eroticism, but not love. Venice in Don\u2019t Look Now  Released in 1973, directed by Nicolas Roeg            One of the greatest representations of a city in film. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play a couple whose child has died in an accident. They come to Venice and are tormented by visions of what may be the child\u2019s ghost. The Venice of Nic Roeg\u2019s great film is mysterious and exotic \u2014 replete with a kind of Western-style orientalism, in fact \u2014 but never touristy. Roeg is never content with the visual cliches, and there is none of the usual imagery of Saint Mark\u2019s Square. He evokes the city\u2019s disorientating waterways and passageways: echoing places where one could easily lose one\u2019s bearings at night. There are also the duller, more workaday parts of Venice, in which one is introduced to the disquieting idea that the entire city is an occult conspiracy, leading inexorably to death.  Dakar in Touki Bouki  Released in 1973, directed by Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty            This bizarre and challenging movie by the African experimentalist auteur Mamb\u00e9ty in many ways questions how we live in cities, how we experience them and how our identities are formed by them. Conventional, realist films place their characters in the streets, squares and open spaces of a city, or in their houses and apartments, and show them working out their rational social lives. Mamb\u00e9ty invents a couple who live in Dakar in Senegal, but show them yearning to escape to Paris. Their lives are a confusing new wave swirl, their actions and motivations obscure. It is as if it takes place as much in Paris as Dakar, or in a city of the mind. Rome in The Great Beauty  Released 2013, directed by Paolo Sorrentino              I can\u2019t think of any city so drenched with infatuated love, and yet also a kind of disillusion and disenchantment, as the Rome of Sorrentino\u2019s The Great Beauty. Toni Servillo plays a jaded middle-aged man about town who is astonished to hear something about a woman with whom he was once deeply in love back in the distant past:. It inspires a final, ecstatic rapture for his city. The movie is in a sense about his leave-taking, his final passeggiata, which savours of sadness and mortality. Sorrentino\u2019s camera swoops and veers around Rome, concentrating on its historic metropolitan glories in the manner of Fellini in La Dolce Vita. It is a film about Romanit\u00e0, or Romanness.

The Baltic Dry daily index of shipping costs has jumped by more than 40% in a month, soaring to 1,042 since it hit a post crash low of 732 in July. The jump in prices for sending freight goods around the world indicates that shipping firms are seeing a sharp rise in demand for their services. Figures from Lloyds List show the index performed badly throughout 2013 and the first half of 2014, when many shipping companies reported losing money on each container ship, many of which sailed half empty. A gentle rise in prices charged by shippers since early July has accelerated in the last two weeks, taking many analysts by surprise. Jim Leaviss, head of fixed interest at M&amp;G Investments, said: &quot;Although it&apos;s a pretty volatile indicator there is a strong relationship between the cost of shipping bulk cargo \u2013 generally intermediate goods like metals \u2013 and the strength of the global economy. So the recent 40% rise in the Baltic Dry Index might well be telling us that the global recovery is back on track after a pretty patchy first half of 2014.&quot; Leaviss added that the timing of the Russian sanctions against the EU and the rise in the index might not be a coincidence, possibly reflecting that Russia might be having to ship goods, including food, from further away now that it cannot import from the EU. David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and a former Bank of England policymaker, said the Baltic Dry was traditionally a key indicator of the health of global economy, illustrated by the sharp fall in the index between May and December of 2008. &quot;The fall in 2008 was the most catastrophic collapse of any indicator in the Great Recession. The question now is, does it indicate a turnaround? The rise might be driven by an increase in demand, or a fall in ship supply, or both.&quot; On Monday one of the major container shipping organisations urged fleet owners to raise rates on their Asia to US routes by at least $600 per 40-foot container, an increase of 14% from current levels. Transpacific Stabilisation Agreement (TSA), a lobby group for operators between the US and Asia, said the planned increase followed strong cargo demand and higher capacity levels in recent months, which forward bookings suggest will continue through September. Its members include 15 of the world&apos;s biggest container shipping lines such as Denmark&apos;s Maersk Line, a unit of A.P. Moller-Maersk, privately owned Switzerland-based Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), French privately held CMA CGM, China&apos;s COSCO Shipping and Korea&apos;s Hanjin Shipping. TSA executive administrator Brian Conrad said prices should go up from 1 September to reflect higher demand and offset losses from last year. &quot;Lines have made modest revenue gains to date this year, but they continue to struggle in terms of returning to profitability,&quot; he said. The container shipping industry has been struggling as vessel capacity has outstripped the volumes of goods for transport in the global economic downturn. More than 90% of the world&apos;s trade is carried by sea, but the overcapacity meant freight rates plunged to unprofitable levels for most carriers in 2013. Spot freight rates are calculated and published every week by Shanghai Shipping Exchange. Last week rates for transport of 40-foot containers from Asia to the U.S. West Coast stood at $4,218. The Baltic Dry, which is a composite of costs across all major shipping routes, is issued daily by the London-based Baltic Exchange and provides &quot;an assessment of the price of moving the major raw materials by sea&quot;. Mearsk parent, AP M\u00f8ller-Maersk, gave a further indication of a return to health on global shipping route after it said better than expected profits in the second quarter of the year meant it would offer shareholders a \u00a31bn buyback. The Danish owner of the world&apos;s largest container shipping line also upgraded its prediction of full year profits to more than $4.5bn, up from its already raised forecast of $4bn three months ago.

The version of it that I know best, however, is in the suburbs of Shanghai: this themed Chinese subdivision, modelled on the posh Californian suburb, features the same Mission-style homes with red tile roofs and the same lush green lawns encircling driveways mounted with basketball nets. There\u2019s at least one car in each garage, terracotta planters overflowing with flowers, and a clubhouse with tennis courts and swimming pools to soothe the stress of a long day at the office. And just in case the connection isn\u2019t clear enough, China\u2019s neighbourhood even has a familiar name: its developers called it \u201cRancho Santa Fe\u201d. But as I sat in a beat-up Buick not long ago, snarling through bumper-to-bumper traffic in a slow trek from Rancho Santa Fe, in the suburbs, to Shanghai\u2019s city centre, it was clear that Chinese developers had done more than duplicate California\u2019s Mediterranean-themed architecture. McMansion communities like Rancho Santa Fe have also helped recreate the golden state\u2019s car headaches and endless sprawl, thanks to planners and policymakers who have repeated the urban design sins of developed countries. For China, California dreaming has turned into a nightmare. In the wake of economic reforms in the 1990s that helped set off the largest urban migration in history, China had the rare opportunity to embrace cutting-edge city-building approaches as it expanded its skyline. It could have avoided the mistakes that made Los Angeles into the land of gridlock, or bypassed the errors that turned the banlieues of Paris into what one American planner calls \u201cfestering urban sores\u201d.     \u2018Ten years ago American planners told Beijing: \u201cDon\u2019t eliminate cycle lanes for cars! We made that mistake!\u201d But they didn\u2019t listen\u2019 ... traffic in Taiyuan. Photograph: Corbis    But China looked back instead of forward. Over the past decade and a half, the nation\u2019s developers and government officials have replicated discredited urban planning templates, importing ideas that were tested, failed and long since abandoned in places like Europe and the US. Planning authorities have committed \u201cessentially all the mistakes that have been made in the western world before\u201d, says Yan Song, director of the programme on Chinese cities at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She recalls how 10 years ago, a delegation of planners from the US convened with Chinese officials, who were then working on eliminating Beijing\u2019s cycle lanes to make room for more cars. \u201cThe American planners were saying, \u2018Don\u2019t do that, please! We\u2019ve done that, we have made that mistake. Don\u2019t follow us,\u2019\u201d says Song. \u201cBut at the time, when you have that kind of modernisation, people love cars \u2013 so unfortunately the planners there didn\u2019t listen.\u201d (A few years later, Beijing backpedalled, and since 2010 it has been working to bring back the bicycles.) Besides expunging cycle lanes, China\u2019s leaders have also inflicted Dallas\u2019 car culture and Atlanta\u2019s endless sprawl on their country. The \u201ctowers in a park\u201d housing blocks championed by Le Corbusier and others have found a second life in cities from Shanghai to Suzhou \u2013 never mind their mixed-results elsewhere. The desire to escape sardine conditions in these superblocks, where greenery often consists of sickly shrubs gasping between six-lane roads, has in turn multiplied the number of land-devouring compounds like Rancho Santa Fe. Homeowners there have contributed to the gridlock and pollution, owing in part to another problematic template that\u2019s enchanted China\u2019s planners: Houston-style financial districts packed with towering glass boxes that are inhospitable to street life, all but abandoned in the evenings and far from people\u2019s homes.     China\u2019s leaders have embraced Dallas\u2019 car culture and Atlanta\u2019s sprawl. Photograph: Bianca Bosker    These ideas have worked about as well in China as they have everywhere else. Which is to say congestion, smog and competition for scarce resources are on the rise. A 2011 IBM survey found Beijing and Shenzhen had the most miserable commutes in the world, after only Mexico City. Cars now generate a third of the hazardous air pollution in Beijing caused by fine particles known as PM 2.5. And a report from the World Bank released this past March found China\u2019s urban expansion had put the country\u2019s available farmland \u201cclose to the \u2018red line\u2019 of 120 million hectares\u201d \u2013 also known as \u201cthe minimum necessary to ensure food security.\u201d This is worrying China\u2019s citizens, too. Not far from Rancho Santa Fe, a gated compound called Fontainebleau Villas offers palatial homes on ground its previous tenants used to grow food. \u201cThat land is wasted \u2013 they should be planting rice,\u201d griped a neighbour on my visit there several years ago. He lived in an older, far more modest house just down the road and harvested a variety of vegetables on a plot no larger than a mattress. China\u2019s \u201cdeja vu design\u201d binge has been driven in part by policies that provide incentives for the real estate equivalent of pawning jewellery to pay bills. Local bureaucrats have financed their operations to a large extent by hawking property to developers, who in turn expand the suburbs farther and farther from the urban core. Last year, land sales accounted for 55% of local governments\u2019 revenues, according to China Daily. In 2010, that figure reached as high as 80% for some cities, the paper reported.      Architecture that is not energy- or space-efficient and relies on car ownership proliferates in estates such as this one in Shanghai. Photograph: Rex    \u201cIn China, the government owns the land and sells the land to the developer, and that\u2019s the last dollar that the local government gets off that piece of dirt. So then what do? They have to sell another piece of dirt. They have to plan for a bigger city,\u201d says Chip Pierson, a senior principal with the Dahlin Group who has spent more than a decade working on architecture and urban design projects in China. \u201cThis is why they\u2019re coming up with schemes about a technology city in the middle of God-knows-where.\u201d While government officials are motivated to sell off land, developers have every incentive to fill it with opulent single-family homes like those at Rancho Santa Fe or Fontainebleau Villas. Six-bedroom houses command higher prices than modest apartments, and help builders quickly recoup their costs.  But China\u2019s politicians haven\u2019t been completely blind to their planning problems. In 2006, the Communist party outlawed the use of land for luxury villas and tried to encourage more efficient housing with a policy that required new communities to build at least 70% of their units smaller than 90 square meters. Villa construction slowed for a year or two, but Pierson says the ban is \u201cbarely mentioned anymore\u201d. (The third phase of Rancho Santa Fe was finished two years after the guidelines were announced, in 2008.) Sometimes, says Pierson, developers will circumvent the rule by striking a deal with local leaders, who may allocate some portion of the land for villas so the firms can raise enough money to complete the mandated superblocks. At other times, companies just cheat. Developers know each square meter of a home\u2019s outdoor space counts for only a fraction of its actual area, so they\u2019ve been building apartments with colossal balconies that owners can easily wall off to create an extra room.     \u2018Like pawning jewellery to pay bills\u2019 ... land sales account for 55% of local government revenue, encouraging rampant development. Photograph: Bianca Bosker    This points to a deeper issue that has allowed deja vu designs to proliferate: China\u2019s bureaucrats and homebuyers are drawn to the same trappings of success that moneyed classes elsewhere have enjoyed. There\u2019s the sense, for example, that to become a financial centre, China must look like a financial centre \u2013 which means replicating the plans for the Loop in Chicago or Canary Wharf in London. Businesses want the appearance of modernity that, it seems, only stacked glass boxes can provide. And homeowners want the white picket fence that defines the Chinese dream as much as the American one.  \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s the Louis Vuitton complex: \u2018because everyone else has a Louis Vuitton, I have to have one, too,\u2019\u201d says Laurence Liauw, author of New Urban China and the principal director of Spada, a multi-disciplinary design firm based in Hong Kong. \u201cWe [the Chinese] want to be like everyone else. We want to be like Palm Springs, or Portofino, or whatever is the latest fashionable address.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it,\u201d says Liauw, except that \u201cit comes at a very, very high cost to humanity, to the environment and in resources.\u201d Third- and fourth-tier cities \u2013 smaller metropolises like Wuxi and Yingkou \u2013 have been slower to abandon these old, foreign models. But over the past few years, China\u2019s planning authorities have made meaningful progress toward more creative and sustainable urban design solutions.  This spring, China unveiled the national new-type urbanisation plan (2014-2020), an initiative that is almost a reversal of urban planning errors of the past, and an effort to encourage smarter infrastructure. The policy \u2013 the first urbanisation scheme led by central government \u2013 aims to expand mass transit, increase the number of \u201cgreen\u201d buildings, control suburban sprawl and generally prioritise the wellbeing of urban dwellers rather than pouring concrete on new parcels of land.      China\u2019s bureaucrats and homebuyers are drawn to the same trappings of success that moneyed classes elsewhere have enjoyed. Photograph: Karen Robinson    Architects and planners in China believe it will prove to be more than a slogan, and say that even before it was announced, they had already noticed signs of improvement. Liauw says he has watched cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai increase access to public transport; and Shenzhen, like Beijing before it, is restoring cycle lanes. Urban designer Peter Calthorpe, author of Urbanism in the Age of Climate Change, was hired to revise the plan for the built-from-scratch city of Chenggong, a ghost town of superblocks and eight-lane highways that, in 2010, had more than 100,000 empty apartments. Calthorpe is massaging Chenggong\u2019s first design to bring it closer to a template that he and others think China should adopt more broadly: he has championed mixed-use areas that combine homes and businesses; an intimate network of roads to encourage walking and active streetlife; and dense public transit networks that are easily accessed from homes.  And even homeowners\u2019 tastes are evolving. They are no longer as charmed by developments with lavish homes marketed by glossy brochures as \u201cmodeled on the sumptuous and classical US West Coast villas\u201d. Instead, \u201chealth and livability are now major, major factors that developers are taking seriously into account for how they promote new developments\u201d, says Liauw. The same top-down decision-making that has led to suburban sprawl and traffic jams could rescue China from its design mistakes by ensuring new ideas are swiftly implemented. \u201cOnce they decide to make a change they can really make a change,\u201d says Calthorpe. \u201cSo on that level, I\u2019m quite optimistic.\u201d      Despite sprawling plans such as this one at Tianducheng, some cities are looking to newer models, encouraging mixed-use areas, streelife and dense public transit. Photograph: Bianca Bosker    China\u2019s 2011 five-year plan, for example, called for the expansion of the railway system. Three years later, China boasts 100,000km of track, 10,000km of high-speed rail and the longest bullet train in the world. By comparison, Californians have yet to see much progress on the high-speed train between Los Angeles and San Francisco for which they allocated funds in 2008. As China\u2019s planning authorities consider how they will change course, some are still looking to the west coast of the US. Only instead of being enthralled by California\u2019s gas-guzzling highway system and ever-expanding suburbs, they\u2019re considering a city slightly further north, one well-known for sustainable planning: \u201cThey love Portland,\u201d says Song. \u201cPortland is a really great model.\u201d  Bianca Bosker is the author of Original Copies: Architectural Mimicry in Contemporary China \u2022 From Tower Bridge to Sydney Harbour, welcome to China\u2019s city of clones", "tags": ["Cities", "China", "Planning policy", "Asia Pacific", "Housing", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-20T09:22:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/aug/20/my-favourite-city-film-is-blade-runner", "sentences": ["When Deckard (Harrison Ford) visits a cabaret bar, it has all the French-inflected Chinese glamour, cocktails and opium pipes of 1920s Shanghai."], "title": "My favourite city film is \u2026 Blade Runner", "article": "From its opening panorama of Los Angeles in November 2019, plumes of flame billowing from refinery towers in an endless cityscape of skyscrapers and pyramids, Blade Runner changed the way the future was created on film. Of course, it didn\u2019t get everything right. Cars fly, people smoke inside, computer interfaces are 1980s clunky-clicky, and payphones exist. Yet 32 years on from its creation, Blade Runner\u2019s Los Angeles remains a remarkable evocation of a future megalopolis, rooted in that city\u2019s own diverse cultures and hard-boiled past. Director Ridley Scott understood two things futurologists back then often missed: the future wouldn\u2019t be exclusively American, and it would be grimy. The LA of Blade Runner has Japanese street food, an Egyptian souk and characters speaking fluid combinations of languages from Hungarian to Korean. Strikingly, the culture that jostles up most closely against American noir is Chinese: prescient, considering that in 1982 Deng Xiaoping\u2019s reforms were still in their early stages. China\u2019s rise to global economic power would begin a couple of years after Blade Runner was released, and really kicked in during the 1990s.             Yet the look of this LA incorporates the east-west fusion of Hong Kong \u2013 narrow, multilevel streets, crowds hurrying through the rain with illuminated umbrellas. When Deckard (Harrison Ford) visits a cabaret bar, it has all the French-inflected Chinese glamour, cocktails and opium pipes of 1920s Shanghai. Crucially, not everything looks new. The last act takes place in an abandoned, decaying neoclassical building, a remnant of a grand American past; heaps of rubbish outside and rain pouring through the ceilings.  Blade Runner drags the dark, lonely, dirty Los Angeles of Raymond Chandler and film noir into a darker, lonelier and dirtier future. It\u2019s a triumph of production design; imitated constantly, but never surpassed.

A recent survey by the Reputation Institute found that only 15% of people trusted what companies\u2019 communicated in their adverts and 43% were unsure if goods and services were of a high quality. The CEO of the Reputation Institute blamed high levels of mistrust on a mix of critical customers and social media.  But the advent of social media is a double edged-sword. It potentially holds the key to brand\u2019s success through finding ways of telling their brand narratives in a way that regains the trust of their consumer and goes beyond the simplistic and often superficial \u2018like\u2019 or \u2018dislike\u2019. The modern consumer is incredibly well connected. A 2013 internet trend report by Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &amp; Byer estimates that the typical smartphone user checks their phone 150 times a day and can spend up to 20% of their time on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Instgram.  However, in some cases the use of digital communications have cut down on face-to-face interaction and in-store experiences which can lead to a complete lack of understanding as to where most of our products come from. This presents a problem as consumers are not hard wired to trust and enjoy goods made by \u2018unknown hands\u2019, according to a new book by customer loyalty expert Chris Malone and social psychologist Susan Fiske, The Human Brand. Building consumer trust lies both in brand transparency and product provenance. The value behind the provenance and story of a product is beginning to be realised in the mainstream market. Harrods\u2019 Made with Love series of in-store events seeks to reconnect the consumer with the craftsmen behind some of Harrods\u2019 most prestigious brands. The project takes away the \u2018unknown hands\u2019 element of fast fashion where products appear on a shelf with the consumer having no prior knowledge of their journey, instead reconnecting the consumer with the craftsman allows transparency into the value chain enhancing the value in the quality and durability of the product.  Likewise, Gucci arriving at the Chelsea Flower Show with a special edition of one of its handbags and the presence in London of Petit h, showcasing the innovations of the Herm\u00e8s craftsman tasked with the pain-staking two year effort to create one of its scarves, has reinforced the desirability of these brands. The most successful campaigns have reflected digital innovation in these brand experiences. In April, Burberry launched its Shanghai store with musical performances and simultaneously enabled users of China\u2019s largest social networking platform WeChat to unlock more details of the brand and event by swiping or tapping their devices in accordance with digital displays. Speaking to industry blog Business of Fashion at the time, creative director and new CEO Christopher Bailey acknowledged: \u201cI think [story-telling] is important globally, but in China it stops things from being [just] product and starts to give it life. Everything has a story, your clothes, buildings, videos, music: I think it\u2019s important people go along with this journey or it becomes a faceless product.\u201d The brand subsequently posted an 11% sales growth in China for 2013/2014. Evoking brand loyalty and understanding needn\u2019t be as extravagant as putting on an exhibition in the heart of Shanghai or Knightsbridge. Instead, brand managers need to find ways of communicating narratives simply at every stage of the value chain around who makes their products, where they source their materials and even the techniques used in production designed to enhance the longevity of a product. In particular, when these stories are connected to sustainable initiatives, this will engage the consumer with the true value of the product, and the human story behind it. Ultimately, respect for production, wages and quality will see a shift towards durable products, made in an honest way empowering the consumer to make responsible choices, to compete not on price point but to innovate on quality and sustainability instead.

Each NikeLab embraces core Nike design principles, such as less is more, lightweight, and modularity to inform the fixtures, materials used in the construction, and the functionality of the spaces.  The approach is evident throughout the stores, including cash wrap desks. They are constructed from blocks of a recycled polymer composite made by combining Nike Grind, a premium grade raw material derived from recycled athletic shoes and materials left over from the manufacture of Nike product, with non-toxic, odorless eco-polyurethane. The blocks are sectional by design and can be rearranged and repurposed throughout the stores.      NikeLab.

Nike designer Tim Rupp and team partnered with Arthur Huang, founder of design firm Miniwiz, to develop innovative materials created from computer motherboards and casings that hint at the potential of re-using materials to push retail design forward.

The quest was made in advance of the forthcoming British Museum exhibition, Ming: 50 years that changed China, which is devoted to the beginning of the 1400s, a crucially formative half century in the nation&apos;s enduring idea of itself. The tour took in museums and temples and historic sites in Beijing and Shanghai, Nanjing and Jinan; the treasures included dragon-embroidered silks and the finest gold jewellery; nine-masted ships and intricate, princely tomb relics \u2013 doll&apos;s house artefacts for the afterlife; scrolled calligraphy and \u2013 naturally \u2013 the peerless porcelain vases and vessels that are the headline acts of the early Ming era. Many of these objects will be leaving China for the first time for the London show, which opens next month. Collectively they represent a unique insight into the establishment of power and government in Beijing and beyond; they also, inevitably, cast light on the power and government of China&apos;s extraordinary present moment. Having spent a good part of the past century attempting to erase &quot;decadent&quot; evidence of China&apos;s imperial history \u2013 some of the irreplaceable exhibits in the Ming show were rescued from the scrapheaps and landfill of the Cultural Revolution \u2013 the party leadership in Beijing has lately made the celebration of that history a national priority. In the five-year plan of 2011 the Central Committee announced that culture is the &quot;spirit and soul of the nation&quot;, and would become a &quot;pillar industry&quot; \u2013 representing 5% of GDP. The plan dictated that China was to build up to a thousand new museums by 2015, a target already achieved. Existing national and regional collections have been rehoused in vast marble halls. Private museums have been created to showcase the trappings of the newly minted elite. Liu Yiqian, for example, a cab driver before he discovered Shanghai&apos;s stock market and became a billionaire, bought the world&apos;s most expensive wine goblet \u2013 a Ming porcelain cup decorated with chickens \u2013 with his Amex card for \u00a319.6m at Sotheby&apos;s in April and, having scandalised the curatorial community by drinking tea from it, will put it on display in his new \u00a322m Long Museum. The repatriation of such items, as well as the industrial-scale excavation and recovery of Chinese history, represents a resurgence of national pride, but also a kind of national necessity \u2013 all the empty new museums need things to fill them.            This surreal expansion provides another perspective on the epic scale of China&apos;s ongoing reinvention (the five-year plan also legislated, for example, for the creation of 45,000km of new high-speed rail track to link the nation&apos;s major cities, much of which is already being constructed \u2013 HS2 might eventually provide about 400km). It was by high-speed rail that we travelled south from Beijing to Nanjing, on the Yangzte. The colossal rebuilt Nanjing Museum contains 100,000 items from the former imperial collection. Nanjing was the ancient capital of China, and it was there that the Ming dynasty was established in 1368. In those days the journey between capitals old and new took 20\u00a0days. It now takes under four hours. That particular journey was emblematic of the changes of the early Ming (literally &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;shining&quot;) period. Having overthrown the Mongol dynasty of the Yuan, the new ethnic Chinese emperor sought to live up to his own adopted name Hongwu, meaning &quot;vast military power&quot;. To this end he created a society that supported an army of one million troops and established the navy&apos;s dockyards in Nanjing as the largest in the world. Those dockyards are in the process of a multimillion-pound excavation, and one huge pot-bellied Ming ship \u2013 then the cutting edge of naval technology \u2013 has been reconstructed, but little of the original remains. To get a real sense of the power of the Hongwu emperor \u2013 who began adult life as a wandering beggar \u2013 you have to travel outside the city to his mausoleum. We visited near dusk; a light rain was falling on the newly recreated pavilion roof that houses a monumental stone stele erected and inscribed in his honour. The stele marks the entrance to the 2km Sacred Way, a wide road to the emperor&apos;s tomb guarded by pairs of enormous carved animals (including camels, lions, elephants then native to China) to ward off grave-robbers. A hundred thousand men built the mausoleum site and its walls over two decades. Jungly vegetation has encroached around the great tomb itself, a closely guarded secret for centuries, and you can now get a golf buggy along the Sacred Way, but the original sense of granitic and autocratic power remains intact. Hongwu sought to spread that power to the four corners of his vast nation state by establishing the most capable of his 36 sons in regional power bases. He armed them with a set of written dynastic instructions concerning responsibility and filial duty. Some adhered to these tenets better than others. Zhu Tan, Prince Huang of Lu died aged 19 from the overdose of a drug he believed to be an elixir of eternal life. His tomb, excavated in recent decades with exquisite items preserved in the (new) Shandong regional museum and loaned to the London exhibition, gives a flavour of the life he briefly enjoyed \u2013 his best imperial primrose silk coat was laid across his body; his favourite zither, already an antique from the Tang dynasty by the time he came to use its jade tuning mechanism, was buried beside him. Neither did Hongwu&apos;s edicts survive his death. His chosen teenage heir, his nephew, the Jianwen emperor, was quickly overthrown by another son, Zhu Di, who became the Yongle (or &quot;perpetual happiness&quot;) emperor in 1402. One of the seismic changes introduced by Zhu Di was to develop his own fiefdom, Yan, as a secondary capital and to rename it Beijing. Many thousand of artisans and slaves were press-ganged to work on the construction of the palace complex that became the Forbidden City. Zhu Di dispatched fleets of ships on voyages of discovery and trade and created a multicultural imperial court, with artists absorbing influences from wider Asia and the Middle East, to create work of enduring beauty. By the time of the accession of Zhu Di&apos;s grandson the Xuande &quot;propagating virtue&quot; emperor in 1426, much of the Forbidden City was complete (it has since been razed and rebuilt). The political heart of the imperial nation was not without its pleasures, as recorded in remarkable scrolls. One of these, six metres long, memorably unfurled for us at the Palace Museum of the Forbidden City, and which will be loaned to the London exhibition, depicts a kind of mini Olympiad. The emperor spectates at a version of football keepy-uppy among the beardless palace eunuchs, while other ink-on-silk panels depict archery competitions and see the emperor participating enthusiastically in a throw-the-arrow-in-the-jar challenge. The final panel shows the larger than life Xuande, with his wispy\u00a0beard, borne away at the end of the day in a sedan chair, contemplating his idea of fun.     The Xuande emperor \u201cparticipating enthusiastically in a throw-the-arrow-in-the-jar challenge\u2019. Photograph: \u00a9 The Palace Museum, Beijing     The ideal of the early Ming emperors was to be &quot;complete in the arts of both peace and war&quot; \u2013 until the sixth emperor failed disastrously in the latter and was captured by the Mongol armies in 1449 to bring a relatively harmonious era abruptly to a halt. Prior to that, in pursuit of &quot;wen&quot;, the arts of peace, the emperors were all devotees of porcelain, and the new techniques introduced into the dozen imperial kilns produced ever more delicate pots and ever more brilliant glazes. It is a heart-in-mouth moment to watch curators blithely handling an imperial Ming vase (the trick, Harrison-Hall observed, before expertly manipulating a wonderful large blue-and-white wine jar decorated with ladies of the court at\u00a0play, is just to hold it as you would any other object of similar heft \u2013 and never once give a thought to its priceless price tag). The Yongle emperor, by necessity, and to propagandise his legitimacy, sought to spread his particular cultural revolution in different ways. When he appeared in public, a 2,000-strong choir sang and drums, cornets, cymbals and bells sounded (echoes of which we heard in the free-form harmonies of the 27th generation of imperial palace musicians, five of whom, trained in Ming notation, and playing authentic instruments, will travel to London to accompany the show). In an effort to extend his influence still further, the emperor enlisted a comrade from his original march to power, the eunuch Zheng He, to make seven great voyages to the Middle East and East Africa, and to establish a &quot;maritime silk route&quot;. Zheng He, a Muslim, was Marco Polo in reverse, taking the idea of China to the world in a fleet of treasure ships, some reputedly 140 metres long, and spreading the word of the great wealth and power of the Ming empire. It is no surprise that Zheng He, virtually forgotten for centuries, has lately been reclaimed as a pioneering hero of an outward-looking and technologically advanced nation. The kinds of treasures he carried to foreign courts will once again be in transit this week, en route to the British Museum, generous loans from one gilded age of China&apos;s history that echo to the present.

At first sight this remote village seems to have little connection with the 21st-century economy. But step inside the company started by Hua Yongle, on the main street, and you will soon see why it is one of the 20 Taobao villages selected by internet e-commerce giant Alibaba. The firm launched by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma (due to be floated soon on the New York stock exchange) \u2013 or more exactly its Taobao subsidiary \u2013 has completely changed the face of Peixie. Over a quick tea Hua, 32, explains how he started his business. Behind him two staff members respond by email to potential buyers, register orders and sort stacks of invoices. The hammer-and-sickle Communist party emblem hangs on the wall. He is a member, but sees nothing odd about devoting all his time to trade. Hua has been particularly successful in growing a retail business, which delivers all over China, selling locally manufactured bamboo mats. Like many young Chinese, Hua often made purchases on Taobao, the country\u2019s equivalent of eBay. Four years ago he realised the site\u2019s potential for marketing locally sourced bamboo mats. He reckons he owes a great deal to Ma, who started Alibaba about 15 years ago with a group of friends. It launched as a business-to-business venture enabling companies all over the world to find the right supplier in China. Then in 2003 Ma added Taobao, for consumers. Wall Street brokers probably have little idea how much Alibaba\u2019s various portals have changed the lives of ordinary Chinese. With a smartphone and Alibaba\u2019s online payment service, people can settle their utility bills in just a few seconds. They can call a cab too and pay the fare on arrival, with no need for cash. Even in the remotest areas a huge range of products can be had at competitive prices. Look in any bookshop in China and you will find countless biographies, all claiming to explain the key to success following Ma\u2019s example. Logistics have developed apace. Mats made in Peixie, Fujian province, are delivered in two or three days, in an area reaching 1,000km to the north and all round Shanghai. Although labour costs have increased in China, they are still low enough for transport to only account for one-10th of the price of the product. The benefits of the digital economy are not lost on local officials. Quite simply it has saved the mat factories, first established after the economic reforms of 1993. Finding the right distributors used to be a struggle, but Taobao has changed all that. In the summer of 2013 party leaders in Peixie decreed that e-commerce now counted as one of the pillars of the local economy and must be encouraged. This is consistent with Beijing\u2019s drive to modernise the whole economy. \u201cChina is developing this type of service very fast,\u201d says Liu Jianqiong, the deputy village chief. He has been tasked with ensuring that this new form of retailing has access to optimal logistics. The local authorities have decided to exempt online businesses from paying rent and have provided them with a shared warehouse and canteen. Liu says they simply needed to support a growing trend, fed by the younger generation. \u201cThey open their shops here and then they can hire older people, so it\u2019s good for jobs,\u201d he adds. Peixie is witnessing an unexpected change of fortune. In most rural districts of China the lure of the cities is taking away young people, but here in the south-east corner of the country the trend has been reversed. \u201cSome are only 18 or 19. In other places they would be moving away, leaving only children and old people. But here they can do business,\u201d Liu says. Hua endorses this view. He is relieved that he will not have to choose between staying close to his ageing parents in the country and the need to earn a living in the city, a wrench all too familiar to most young people. Plenty of his contemporaries started by going off to the big cities in search of work. Some have since returned to their birthplace and set to work on a laptop.

And in just the last three weeks, Lookout discovered a new form of ransomware called ScareMeNot, which has already managed to infect more than 30,000 Android devices. Victims get infected with the ransomware through a method known as a &quot;drive-by download&quot; in which they simply need visit a website \u2014 in some cases a pornography site \u2014 to inadvertently download the ransomware onto their machine. In other cases, they download the ransomware by downloading fake apps that masquerade as popular services such as Adobe Flash or an anti-virus product. Once infected, it is very difficult to remove.

Amazon will acquire Twitch for more than $1bn &gt;&gt; Re/code  Google had been in talks to acquire the company, but that deal died, according to the source. Amazon then entered the picture and completed what is one of its biggest acquisitions to date, this person said. For the uninitiated, Twitch is a platform for making and talking about videos of videogame play. About a million users a month record themselves playing videogames, while the rest \u2014 pegged at 50 million unique viewers in July \u2014 watch and comment on the videos. In January, Twitch reported that 58% of its viewers spent more than 20 hours per week on the site. It originated as an offshoot of a general-purpose live video site, Justin.tv, but in time surpassed its original home; earlier this month, Twitch said Justin.tv would shut down. Amazon&apos;s past video efforts have been more like Netflix than Twitch, with a library of streaming movies, TV shows and original series that have thus far failed to mount much of a challenge to Netflix. Bringing the videogame streaming site into the fold arms it with a totally new vertical of YouTube-style user-generated content, since anyone is able to broadcast his or her games to Twitch for free. One big question: Will Amazon let Twitch operate as a standalone business as Facebook did with Instagram and as Google, according to a source, had contemplated doing with Twitch? Or will Amazon try to integrate it into its current video business in some way? Either way, the Seattle-based online retailer likely has its eyes on the site&apos;s video advertising potential, since it mostly attracts young men, who are an attractive but hard-to-reach shopper demographic.  Read on for something Amazon is doing that will be a good fit with this purchase. The rumoured iOS screen fragmentation &gt;&gt; Rusty Rants Russell Ivanovic (whose Shifty Jelly does podcasting apps for iOS and Android:   What does this mean in practice? It means iOS developers will now have to do more work than their Android counterparts in order to support the increased variation in iOS screens. The best tools for that exist in iOS 8, which also makes it likely a lot of apps will go iOS 8 only to avoid the manual layout pain. It&apos;s not all bad news though, this might actually result in better large screen iOS apps vs their Android counterparts. This is because on the 5.5\u2033 iPhone there would be more content being shown, rather than everything just being bigger.  The fasinatng \u2026 frustrating \u2026 fascinating history of autocorrect &gt;&gt; WIRED Gideon Lewis-Kraus explains that we all have Dean Hamachovitch of Microsoft to thank:   The notion of autocorrect was born when Hachamovitch began thinking about a functionality that already existed in Word. Thanks to Charles Simonyi, the longtime Microsoft executive widely recognised as the father of graphical word processing, Word had a &quot;glossary&quot; that could be used as a sort of auto-expander. You could set up a string of words\u2014like insert logo\u2014which, when typed and followed by a press of the F3 button, would get replaced by a JPEG of your company&apos;s logo. Hachamovitch realised that this glossary could be used far more aggressively to correct common mistakes. He drew up a little code that would allow you to press the left arrow and F3 at any time and immediately replace teh with the. His aha moment came when he realised that, because English words are space-delimited, the space bar itself could trigger the replacement, to make correction \u2026 automatic!   Shanghai to San Francisco in 100 minutes by Chinese supersonic submarine &gt;&gt; South China Morning Post  China has moved a step closer to creating a supersonic submarine that could travel from Shanghai to San Francisco in less than two hours. New technology developed by a team of scientists at Harbin Institute of Technology&apos;s Complex Flow and Heat Transfer Lab has made it easier for a submarine, or torpedo, to travel at extremely high speeds underwater. Li Fengchen, professor of fluid machinery and engineering, said the team&apos;s innovative approach meant they could now create the complicated air &quot;bubble&quot; required for rapid underwater travel. &quot;We are very excited by its potential,&quot; he said. Water produces more friction, or drag, on an object than air, which means conventional submarines cannot travel as fast as an aircraft. However, during the cold war, the Soviet military developed a technology called supercavitation, which involves enveloping a submerged vessel inside an air bubble to avoid problems caused by water drag.  The problem was always that it went fast, but couldn&apos;t be steered (because the steering gear was inside the air bubble). Now the Chinese say they may have solved that. Could have big implications militarily - superfast submarines would be a big threat. GT Advanced Technologies is on target to produce sapphire for the iWatch and iPhone 6 &gt;&gt; Seeking Alpha Matt Margolis:   The latest Production Notification request from Apple and GT Advanced Technologies confirm that the Mesa, Arizona sapphire plant will be producing not one but two key sapphire components for Apple. The two components are distinct and different. \u2026The introduction of sapphire crackle into the sapphire growing process will lead to improved boule quality, which will lead to less defects and higher useable sapphire yields. Previous reports have indicated yield issues coming from Mesa and this latest request provides even more concrete evidence that GT has addressed the sapphire yield issues in an effort to maximize yield and improve overall production costs. One component is sapphire finished goods not suitable for jewellery and the other sapphire finished good is jewellery specific.

Amazon preps a challenge to Google&apos;s ad business &gt;&gt; Wall Street Journal  Initially, Amazon plans to replace those ads on its pages that Google chiefly supplies with a new in-house ad placement platform, said people familiar with the matter. In the future, that system could challenge Google&apos;s $50 billion-a-year advertising business and Microsoft Corp.&apos;s, they added. The Seattle-based retailer already has a limited business placing ads on other sites. In a sign that it has larger goals, Amazon is testing ways to expand that program with new types of ads. &quot;Amazon could use the data it has about buying behavior to help make these ads much more effective,&quot; said Karsten Weide, an analyst at researcher IDC. &quot;Marketers would love to have another viable option beyond Google and Facebook for their advertising.&quot;  The Internet of Things will cost companies more than they&apos;re ready for &gt;&gt; VentureBeat Paul Brody:   Today, smartphones are powerful hubs surrounded by less intelligent objects. Each device is managed and operated from a few centralized data centers. This is not yet a major issue as devices currently last only a year or two before being decommissioned. The cost of managing data centers is limited in duration and underwritten by a constant flood of replacement devices with short lives. Not so in the Internet of Things era: an LED lightbulb has an expected life of 20+ years; aircraft are expected to remain in service for decades; the average car on the road in the US is now more than a decade old. Applying a centralized cloud-based business model to these devices will mean decades of expense without decades of associated revenue. At IBM we already see clients that are struggling with device-related services that have failed to meet revenue targets, but cannot be switched off for fear of angering an installed base.

But the kind of water we can drink, wash with and use to irrigate our fields is actually incredibly rare \u2013 freshwater makes up just 3% of the world\u2019s water, and two-thirds of it is inaccessible. Far from an abundance, according to WWF\u2019s 2012 Living Planet Report (pdf), 2.7 billion people live in catchments that experience severe water scarcity for at least one month a year. Of the freshwater available to us, an estimated 70% is used for irrigation, 8% goes towards domestic use, and 22% is used by industry \u2013 the fashion industry among them. From growing thirsty fibre crops, to dyeing fabrics and washing clothes at home, fashion needs water.  With a growing population competing for water resources, and an increasingly volatile climate, the textile and apparel industry needs to get to grips with the sustainability of its water stewardship or risk being left high and dry. There are a few examples of big brands working to improve and safeguard their water usage. Levi\u2019s, in partnership with one of its Chinese suppliers, recently made 100,000 pairs of jeans using 100% recycled water. As a result, it claims to have saved 12m litres of water, the equivalent of almost five Olympic-size swimming pools. Levi\u2019s now provides all its supplier factories with technical guidance on reusing and recycling water with its new water-saving standard, a body of requirements the brand will share with other textile industry stakeholders. In 2012, WWF and H&amp;M conducted a wholesale evaluation of H&amp;M\u2019s water related challenges, to inform the company\u2019s new water strategy.

Created by the US Treasury in the wake of the Asian financial crisis at the end of the 1990s, the G20 was designed to get the major \u201cemerging market\u201d states to take responsibility alongside the G7 for the \u201cnew international financial architecture\u201d. This was seen as providing legitimacy for the continuing central role of the US in superintending a greatly expanded but increasingly volatile global capitalism.  This especially included what the US Treasury called \u201cfailure containment\u201d in the face of recurring financial crises. With this concern uppermost in mind, the G20 heads of state were summoned to Washington DC, in November 2008 to prevent the first global capitalist crisis of the 21st century from turning into a repeat of the 1930s breakdown of international capitalism. In this respect, the \u201ccommitment to an open global economy\u201d in the final communiqu\u00e9 from the 2008 Washington Summit was especially significant:   We underscore the critical importance of rejecting protectionism and not turning inward ... we will refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services.  This commitment has been reinforced at every annual G20 meeting since, including the preparatory ones for Brisbane this November. When the finance ministers and central bank governors at their February 2014 meeting in Sydney promised \u201cto remove constraints to private investment\u201d, this met the central US condition for sustaining global capitalism.  This is not to say that the US has ceded much operational control to the G20, any more than it ever did to the G7. The key policy decisions are made in Washington DC where the IMF and World Bank are headquartered, but even more decisively where the Treasury and Federal Reserve are located. The coordinated G20 fiscal stimulus in 2009 was significant, but mainly because it made it easier for the US Congress to accept the Treasury\u2019s initial plan for massive deficit spending to prevent a spiral into another great depression.  After Congress turned its face sharply against this in 2010, the centerpiece of policy shifted to the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cquantitative easing\u201d monetary policy, and has remained there ever since. The impact of this was felt as much internationally as domestically, as the Fed effectively acted as the world\u2019s central bank through its role in setting benchmark interest rates and its streaming of dollars to foreign as well as US banks.  There were widespread expectations that \u2013 with the great financial crisis having had its origins in the US, let alone the subsequent unorthodox \u201ceasy money\u201d policy - the \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d of the dollar in the financial networks linking the Brics into global production and trade would be undermined. Brazil, Russia, India and China, who were not so na\u00efve as to imagine the G20 would be the venue for overseeing the demise of the dollar, also held their own first summit meeting at a meeting in Yekaterinburg in 2008.  Joined by South Africa in 2010, they soon began hatching plans for their own international bank, autonomous from the US and the Washington-based financial institutions. These plans were reinforced when the US Congress refused to endorse the larger vote for the Brics in the IMF and World Bank, agreed at G20 meetings. For Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-prize winning ex-chief economist of the World Bank, the announcement of the new Brics bank at Forteleza signalled a clear challenge to the US-led world order, reflecting \u201ca fundamental change in global economic and political power\u201d. Fidel Castro associated it with his own country\u2019s resistance to \u201cthe most powerful empire ever to exist\u201d, and expressed his confidence that the Brics leaders promotion of \u201ccooperation and solidarity with the peoples \u2026 in the achievement of sustainable development, and the eradication of poverty,\u201d would culminate in \u201cone of the greatest feats of human history\u201d. Yet, the main reason for the continuing central role of the dollar has very little to do with the institutional structure of the IMF, or the greater size of its capitalisation relative to what the Brics bank will muster. It primarily reflects the absence \u2013 even in Shanghai, where the new bank will be headquartered \u2013 of anything like the depth and range of the financial markets centred on Wall Street and its satellite in the City of London. And it is the ways in which these markets are, in turn, so deeply intertwined with the US Treasury and Federal Reserve that explains the latter\u2019s dominant role in global economic management.  What is more, the room for manoeuvre the Brics bank would allow from the IMF is distinctly limited. Indeed, to obtain the full benefit of borrowing under the Brics bank\u2019s \u201ccontingent reserve arrangement\u201d would still be contingent on a country having an \u201con-track arrangement\u201d with the IMF. Indeed, this looks very much like the 2000 \u201cChiang Mai Initiative\u201d arrangement for currency swaps among China, Japan, South Korea and Asean countries after the 1998-98 financial crisis, which was little used and proved largely symbolic.  The alacrity with which the World Bank has welcomed the Brics bank also relates to the fact that its goals as a development bank look not very different from the resource-depleting, export-oriented economic strategies that have heretofore governed the emerging markets participation in capitalist globalisation. Along the lines of Brazil\u2019s BNDES development bank, it might promote the Brics own multinational corporations, but this stands in sharp contrast with the cooperative socialist principles of the now defunct Latin American Bank of the South that revolutionary governments in Venezuela and Bolivia initially had in mind. At Fortaleza, a \u201cBrics from below\u201d meeting of civil society groups and independent unions stressed the extent to which the dominant classes and governments of each of the Brics members were themselves committed to neoliberal policies, often brutally administered in their own countries.  They were in this respect at one with the recent L20 trade union statement for the Australian G20 meetings, which in criticising \u201causterity policies and structural \u2018reforms\u2019 that reduce wages and workers protection\u201d saw the Brics as no model for an alternative. Indeed, it noted that \u201cif in emerging Asian economies income distribution had not worsened over the past 20 years, the region\u2019s rapid growth would have lifted an extra 240 million people out of poverty\u201d. For all the fanfare that attended the announcement of the Brics Bank at the Fortaleza summit, it will in fact do little to shift the balance and, even more important, the substance of global financial power. There is an old lesson here, which also certainly applies to what will be heard about the \u201cBrisbane Action Plan\u201d this Autumn: real change begins at home.  \u2022 Leo Panitch will deliver the 2014 Ted Wheelwright memorial lecture in political economy on Wednesday 3 September at the University of Sydney", "tags": ["Australia news", "G20", "Asia Pacific", "Brics", "Financial sector", "Financial crisis", "Economics", "Banking", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-27T05:43:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/28/million-dollar-arm-cricket-baseball-reel-history", "sentences": ["Recruitment Inspired by the tale of Yao Ming, the 7ft 6in basketball player from Shanghai who became a megastar in the US, Bernstein and Vasudevan decide they&apos;re going to find a baseball player in India."], "title": "Million Dollar Arm: 20% Hamm, 30% cream, 50% historical batting average", "article": "Million Dollar Arm (2014) Director: Craig Gillespie Entertainment grade: B- History grade: B- In 2008, American sports agent JB Bernstein ran an Indian reality-TV contest called Million Dollar Arm. It aimed to find rough-diamond young cricket players who could be polished up into baseball stars back in the US. People           JB Bernstein has failed to sign a major star to the independent agency he has started with Ash Vasudevan (Aasif Mandvi), and his business is slowly collapsing. The prospect of having to downsize his lifestyle and \u2013\u00a0horrors\u00a0\u2013\u00a0maybe even sell his flashy car sends him into a panic. The film&apos;s characterisation of Bernstein as a total princess is fair and, if anything, toned down. By page seven of his memoir, also called Million Dollar Arm, he&apos;s bragging in American Psycho-like detail about his designer clothes and absurd watch collection (&quot;30 timepieces, lined up as neatly as soldiers \u2026 Patek Philippe, Rolex, Audemars Piguet and Breitling \u2013 the reward I gave myself for doing well&quot;). The only way to make such a character sympathetic is to cast Jon Hamm, who has an unusual ability to express the vulnerable core beneath highly strung men&apos;s control-freak exteriors. Fortunately for this film, it has cast him. Recruitment Inspired by the tale of Yao Ming, the 7ft 6in basketball player from Shanghai who became a megastar in the US, Bernstein and Vasudevan decide they&apos;re going to find a baseball player in India. They get Chinese businessman Will Chang (Tzi Ma) to finance their effort, and are off. In real life, it was Chang who brought Vasudevan and Bernstein together \u2013 and some sources imply that he was responsible for the original idea, too. International relations     Rinku, Dinesh and Amit introduce Bernstein to Indian blessings. Photograph: Ron Phillips/Unit    On arriving in Mumbai, Bernstein discovers that it&apos;s noisy, crowded, sweaty and rather idiosyncratically organised, all of which absolutely blows his mind. It&apos;s also an endless supply of cheap (in this movie, free) labour. The film&apos;s portrayal of the massive scale of the contest is accurate, with 38,000 Indians trying out for the Million Dollar Arm show in real life. The west has, of course, seen India as a source of people to exploit since the days of empire. Bernstein isn&apos;t taken with the romance or magnificence of India, anyway: &quot;It&apos;s white, apart from the bit that&apos;s red,&quot; he says testily of the Taj Mahal. &quot;And there&apos;s a little dog in the foreground.&quot; Structure As in the film, the real Bernstein discovered two young talents: Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal). Million Dollar Arm has been made by Disney according to classic Disney principles, but there&apos;s an oddness in the structure. Normally, Disney audiences would expect to root for the people actually undergoing a life-changing transformation, not for their fairy godfather. The film has a bash at letting Singh and Patel express their own personalities, but the focus is on Bernstein&apos;s transformation from selfish white man to enlightened white man. This can be achieved only when he realises it&apos;s possible to feel emotions for the Indians he previously viewed as product, and for the chaotic, kooky female doctor, Brenda (Lake Bell), who rents out his pool house. Charm     'She made seven figures a year' \u2026 Lake Bell as Brenda. Photograph: Ron Phillips/Unit    The film has sharpened some of Bernstein&apos;s experiences to make his transformation more humbling and therefore, theoretically, more charming. In real life, Singh and Patel did not move into Bernstein&apos;s home; that they lived in a &quot;beautiful mansion that Ash had found for us right on the USC campus&quot;. Brenda was really an immaculately groomed aviation executive. The real Bernstein&apos;s awestruck description: &quot;She made seven figures a year, drove a Porsche 911, and owned a yacht.&quot; Reader, he married her. As for whether Million Dollar Arm tells Singh and Patel&apos;s stories fairly, the real Singh \u2013\u00a0who now speaks English \u2013\u00a0has said: &quot;I would say the movie&apos;s 80% a completely true story \u2026 You know, they have to put a little cheap cream on top of it to make it taste better.&quot; Verdict     Appealing characters \u2026 Madhur Mittal and Suraj Sharma.

He has never set foot in the gigantic home of the Duke of Marlborough, but is preparing to install the largest exhibition to date of his work in the UK. When it opens on 1 October, more than 50 new and archive works will sit among the Van Dyck portraits of Churchill ancestors and tapestries of battles fought and won 300 years ago. &quot;In the beginning, we sent him photographs and detailed plans, but he&apos;s an absolute perfectionist and every inch of where works are placed matters to him. So in the end we lasered all the rooms to make the model for him,&quot; Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill said. &quot;We still hope he may be able to come himself, that would be the greatest blessing for this exhibition,&quot; said Michael Frahm, director of Spencer-Churchill&apos;s newly founded Blenheim Art Foundation, which, following the example of other grand country estates, has ambitious plans for major contemporary art exhibitions at the palace. Danish-born Frahm visited the artist several times in Beijing, bringing him a goody bag from the Blenheim gift shop as an extra inducement. &quot;We both think Ai Weiwei is one of the greatest artists working today, whose work is embraced by a wide variety of people on many different levels, but who also has something really important to say about freedom of speech and personal liberty,&quot; said Spencer-Churchill, who is the eldest surviving son of the third of the present duke&apos;s four marriages. Many of the works make subtle reference to Ai&apos;s situation. A towering cabinet will be emptied of spectacular Meissen porcelain \u2013 reputedly swapped by a Churchill ancestor for a pack of hunting dogs \u2013 to hold plates being handpainted with the artist&apos;s &quot;freedom flowers&quot;. Frahm witnessed how every morning Weiwei puts a flower into the basket of a bicycle just outside his studio, which he will continue until he is free again to ride it out through the gates. A brilliantly coloured mob of 2,300 porcelain river crabs, which will fill one of the grandest state rooms, relates to the party he threw for hundreds of guests, with the crabs the main delicacy at the feast, before the government destroyed his studio in Shanghai. The palace, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh in 1705, and later landscaped by Capability Brown, is a stupendous building covering seven acres, and has been a Unesco world heritage site since 1987. One of its most celebrated spaces is the staggering library, 55 metres long, which holds the largest pipe organ in any private house in Europe, a giant marble statue of Queen Anne, an array of ducal coronets and ermine-trimmed robes, and, soon, pieces including a hand-carved marble model of one of the security cameras that watch the artist&apos;s every move. A new carpet piece, Soft Ground (Great Hall), is being woven specially for the echoing double height great hall, Spencer-Churchill&apos;s favourite room. &quot;Blows me away every time,&quot; he said cheerfully. The golden heads of zodiac animals, a reference to a famous set that decorated a fountain in an imperial palace outside Beijing until they were looted by Anglo-French troops during the opium wars, will stand keeping watch in the enormous dining room, which is still used by the family on grand occasions. Since Ai first drew attention to them, many of the originals have been returned to China by wealthy collectors, including two which resurfaced at the auction of the collection of the late designer Yves Saint Laurent.     Ai Weiwei's snake from his circle of animals zodiac heads.    Spencer-Churchill&apos;s mother, Rosita Douglas, is an artist, and he collects contemporary art \u2013 including the Chapman brothers, though he doesn&apos;t think Blenheim is quite ready for their work yet. He says Ai was aware of the history of the palace, including the connection with Winston Churchill who was born there, child of a younger son of the seventh duke, in 1874. He proposed to his wife in a folly temple in the grounds. It was originally conceived as a gift from the grateful nation to the first Duke of Marlborough, John Churchill, for victory during the war of the Spanish succession, when after marching his army 250 miles, he defeated the French at the battle of Blenheim. His formidable duchess, Sarah, was first the best friend and then bitter enemy of Queen Anne. When they fell out, funds for Blenheim, only half-built with \u00a3220,000 spent, stopped abruptly. The Churchills were forced into exile, but returned on the queen&apos;s death, banned Vanbrugh from the site, and paid his former friend and partner Nicholas Hawksmoor to continue. It was finished, after Sarah insisted on cheaper materials and lower wages, long after the Duke&apos;s death in 1722, including a chapel with his towering sarcophagus dwarfing the altar. The monster house almost bankrupted generations of Marlboroughs, who sold some spectacular works of art including a Van Dyck, a Rubens \u2013 now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York \u2013 and a Raphael. However, the most spectacular fundraiser was not the auction room but a wedding, when the ninth duke married the American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt, securing a gigantic dowry, a fortune in shares and an annual allowance. The house flourished but the marriage was bitterly unhappy and ended in divorce. Blenheim opened to the paying public in 1950, following the lead of many stately homes forced by soaring costs, taxes and death duties either to sell up or to open their doors. Recently, many of the grandest, including Chatsworth, family home of the Duke of Devonshire, and Waddesdon, a Rothschild home now owned by the National Trust, have spotted a potential new audience through exhibiting contemporary art. Spencer-Churchill hopes the exhibition, and others to follow, may help break down the barriers between the mutually suspicious white-box-gallery-art crowd and the country-house-visitor crowd. &quot;Downton Abbey is a disaster, people expect to look in through the window and see us living a totally Downtonised life. But these houses can&apos;t just stand still, frozen. They have to find a way of showing that they still have relevance today. &quot; \u2022 Ai Weiwei at Blenheim Palace, 1 October 2014 to 26 April 2014", "tags": ["Art and design", "Culture", "Ai Weiwei", "China", "Sculpture"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-28T15:02:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/28/novak-djokovic-jo-wilfried-tsonga-us-open", "sentences": ["The world No1 had difficulty staying upright during rallies in Cincinnati two weeks ago, before exiting early, echoing balance problems he experienced in Shanghai last year, and there was concern that the man who pays such close attention to his diet and preparation might have been having undisclosed health issues."], "title": "Novak Djokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga through to US Open third round", "article": "Novak Djokovic bullied, teased and ultimately demolished Paul-Henri Mathieu for the cost of just four games on day four of the US Open to announce a return to his frightening best when it mattered most.

Djokovic, often on a mental knife-edge recently, looks for now to be in a good place, after a brief, worrying period of concern. The world No1 had difficulty staying upright during rallies in Cincinnati two weeks ago, before exiting early, echoing balance problems he experienced in Shanghai last year, and there was concern that the man who pays such close attention to his diet and preparation might have been having undisclosed health issues. At last, his feet are firmly back on the ground \u2013 even in the wind that swirled around Arthur Ashe Court on Thursday. He struck 13 aces \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not a big number for Boris [Becker, his coach], but it is for me\u201d \u2013 and his serve matched the power and precision of his groundstrokes as he swept past the Frenchman to win 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 in under an hour-and-a-half, hitting 33 clean winners. \u201cI have nothing to complain about,\u201d he said, when asked if he would have liked a longer workout. \u201cI wanted to get my job done as quick as possible. I don\u2019t have to play long matches to get into my groove.\u201d That is debatable but, asked if marriage and the pending arrival of a baby had distracted him, he said: \u201cMy full priority and energy goes to my family. I\u2019m doing everything I can, respecting the same daily routines I had for many years with my team. We are all on the same page. There is nothing significant going to change.\u201d If it stays that way, he could win this tournament. If not? He will implode. There are rarely any halfway measures with Djokovic.

Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, like Djokovic, has had an incomprehensible season, swaying between unplayable and unfathomable, but he was in splendid form on Thursday. The world No10 \u2013 who might well have been happy to be drawn in the same quarter as Djokovic and Andy Murray, given he beat them handsomely in Toronto this month as well as Grigor Dimitrov and Roger Federer, who reside on the other side of the draw \u2013 arrived in New York uncertain even if he would make it to the first weekend. He could take only five games off the Russian Mikhael Youzhny in the 68 minutes their first-round match in Cincinnati lasted. However, in an hour and 47 minutes on Grandstand, the third of the site\u2019s main courts, Tsonga flexed his muscles in front of the Kazakh Aleksandr Nedovyesov to win 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 and ensure what appears on the face of it a friendly third-round encounter with the Spaniard Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta, who took four sets to get past Tsonga\u2019s compatriot Beno\u00eet Paire. Tsonga\u2019s was the sort of comforting result he needed in the early stages of a slam. If he builds up some steam \u2013 and he should beat Busta \u2013 he might do some serious damage. He belted 13 aces (battering the speedometer at a high of 139mph) and 38 winners past Nedovyesov, who never came to terms with his opponent\u2019s power or the wind that made several matches a little difficult on Thursday.", "tags": ["Novak Djokovic", "US Open Tennis 2014", "US Open tennis", "Tennis", "Sport", "US sports"], "publicationDate": "2014-08-28T20:40:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/food-blog/2014/aug/29/food-industry-elliot-review-supply-chain-scandal", "sentences": ["McDonald\u2019s has seen sales across Asia plummet after withdrawing chicken and beef products from sale because the supplier (Shanghai-based company, Husi Food) which provided 20% of the meat for its chicken nuggets has been accused of repackaging old meat as new."], "title": "Food industry shouldn\u2019t wait for Elliott Review to make changes", "article": "Professor Chris Elliott\u2019s long-awaited review of the food industry, which was commissioned in the wake of the horsemeat scandal, is expected to be published at the start of September. Based on the review\u2019s interim findings published last December, the final report is expected to include recommendations to introduce a new requirement for all parties operating or managing the food chain to put consumers\u2019 interests first over all other aims, along with laboratory services that use standardised, validated methodologies for inspecting food. Warning that the sector is a \u201csoft touch\u201d for criminals, the Elliott Review is also expected to recommend a new food crime unit, given that there is currently no unit within major police organisations, such as the Association of Chief Police Officers or the Metropolitan police, that speaks out on food crime. Despite complaints at an industry level about the time it has taken to complete the review, the writing is on the wall and positive action should already have been taken to shorten supply chains and improve visibility. The horsemeat scandal is a classic example of what can go wrong if a supply chain is left to evolve without appropriate checks and safeguards. Food quality and safety have long been the industry\u2019s priority concerns but the constant nature of price pressure in what is a highly-competitive sector chipped away at this over time. The consequences have been disastrous \u2013 a reputational crisis for the industry and a complete breakdown in consumer trust. One year after the scandal broke in January 2013, an Ipsos MORI poll found that 95% of UK adults could recall the incident and 31% claimed to have changed the way they chose or bought food. A number of hard-hit retailers and food producers have sought to publicise their attempts to take proactive action to simplify their supply chains and introduce more secure procurement processes. In June 2013, Waitrose announced plans to source all its own-brand beef products from a single supplier and Birds Eye committed to sourcing all beef from the UK and Ireland. However, it remains unclear how effective these strategies have been to date. Supply chain-related food scandals are here to stay as more recent events in China and Japan demonstrate. McDonald\u2019s has seen sales across Asia plummet after withdrawing chicken and beef products from sale because the supplier (Shanghai-based company, Husi Food) which provided 20% of the meat for its chicken nuggets has been accused of repackaging old meat as new. The meat scare also affected Burger King and Starbucks in China and Japan which had been sourcing meat from the same supplier. The sheer scale of reputational risk and its potential to impact directly on a brand\u2019s business performance means doing nothing is not an option. Food producers accept that supply chain scrutiny is increasing and buyers up and down the supply chain are taking a more active interest in food quality and sources of supply. This is a positive step and will help to promote self-regulation, but further industry controls are needed to ensure such changes remain in the longer term. Ahead of Elliott\u2019s recommendations, there are some immediate steps that food businesses can take to decrease their exposure to risk. 1. Make supply chain management a priority Supply chain management has become a front-line reputational issue for businesses across industry sectors and the growth of consumer activism is driving this. Making a board member directly responsible for supply chain management will ensure it is treated the same as any other significant risk affecting the business. 2. Move to buy local Consider changing the way you source supplies. Following the local-sourcing trend, could help to reduce supply chain risk significantly but it is vital that this is done gradually over time and in partnership with your supplier in order to avoid placing the chain under undue pressure. In March, Tesco announced plans to increase the amount of Northern-Ireland sourced fresh meat and poultry on its supermarket shelves to 90% \u2013 up from 20%. 3. Have clear and well-communicated policies in place  These must be understood internally at all levels, and across the supply chain too. These policies would be likely to ensure adherence to health and safety and ethical considerations, relating to working conditions, for example. Regular supplier audits should be carried out to ensure the appropriate policies are in place. Clarity here is vital to ensure that procurement decisions aren\u2019t taken that could cause reputational damage to the business in the future. 4. Pursue transparency across the supply chain It\u2019s no longer enough to take a \u201ctier one only\u201d approach to supply chain management. Make sure appropriate policies including checks and balances are in place across the board and monitor this closely. 5. Collaborate but don\u2019t compromise  By all means be prepared to work together with suppliers to drive value and to achieve the required price point, but never compromise on food quality and safety.

US-based journalist Cara Anna was following the coverage closely. However, unlike other reporters, her interest in the subject was more personal than professional. As someone who tried to take her own life twice and has since gone on to campaign for better support for people who have attempted suicide and lived, another high-profile death served as a stark reminder of how much still needs to be done in the area of suicide prevention. Since trying to take her own life in 2010 and 2011 while working as a foreign correspondent in China, Anna, 41, has become known as one of a rapidly expanding and increasingly vocal cohort of suicide-attempt survivors in the US who are &quot;coming out&quot;. They have been arguing that the time is long overdue to address the taboo surrounding the &quot;hidden&quot; suicide-attempt survivors who all too often feel shunned and left without adequate support while they recover. &quot;Is [attempted suicide] just so terribly shameful that we all have to walk around in silence after something so traumatic and dramatic?&quot; she asks. &quot;We&apos;re just supposed to zip it up and pretend it never happened?&quot; The dearth of tailored support for survivors in the US and other countries, including the UK, is serious not least because previous suicide attempts are a major risk factor for eventual death by suicide, she says. And she finds this all the more bewildering in the light of the fact that an estimated 1\u00a0million people in the US alone attempt suicide annually. &quot;This is not a small group,&quot; she says. While people living with a mental illness have been speaking out in greater numbers in the US and UK in recent years, Anna points out that, by contrast, suicide-attempt survivors remain largely in the shadows. She is an admirer of Alastair Campbell who, after Williams&apos; death, wrote about his recurring suicidal thoughts, and of the UK&apos;s anti-stigma campaign, Time to Change, for featuring attempt survivors in its projects. However, it is the rarity of examples of people with first-hand experience of suicide attempts being given a voice or supported that has driven Anna over the past three years to speak at public events and lobby on behalf of survivors. It was her own fruitless searches for support groups online that spurred her to action. The vast majority of &quot;survivor sites&quot; and support groups she found were for people who had been bereaved by a suicide. &quot;I thought, surely there are organisations just for people like me. But there was this growing sense of amazement to find that there was nothing out there. You can find support groups for anything online, so to have this big echoing nothing was really startling. Do we no longer exist after an attempt?&quot; On a guest blog on Campbell&apos;s website last year, Anna wrote: &quot;Anonymous suicide forums were shadowy and focused on feeling bad, not feeling better. I tried joining a depression forum or two, only to be solidly told that &apos;we don&apos;t talk about that here&apos;.&quot; In response, she launched her own support website, talkingaboutsuicide.com. The site harnesses her journalistic skills through blogging and by hosting interviews with other survivors. It soon made an impression and led to her being asked by the American Association of Suicidology (AAS) to manage a site for them, attemptsurvivors.com, on which she mostly curates the contributions of other survivors. Both sites point visitors to established organisations such as Samaritans that help people in crisis, and Anna makes it clear she is not an expert, therapist or counsellor. She has recently joined forces with other outspoken survivors on a range of projects, including a documentary due for release in 2015, The &quot;S&quot; Word, which features another resourceful survivor, Dese&apos;Rae L Stage. Her website, livethroughthis.org, uses photography and first-person stories of survivors to demystify the subject. Anna has also contributed to an online documentary released this year, A Voice at the Table, and to a report, The Way Forward, published in July as part of a taskforce set up by the US National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention. The report proposes sweeping changes for the way suicide-attempt survivors are addressed and included. The AAS, &quot;after decades of nervousness&quot; about involving attempt survivors in its activities, has this year created a specific division and hosted a &quot;new voices&quot; panel at its annual conference. Anna says the reticence of survivors, wherever they live, to speak about their experience is often due to fear that it will come to &quot;define&quot; how they are seen or lead to discrimination. &quot;It&apos;s such a heavy subject,&quot; she says, adding that being unable to talk or find the right support can exacerbate feelings of isolation \u2013 something that is another risk factor for suicide. Describing her own experience she adds: &quot;[You think] &apos;What if everybody backs off? What if nobody wants to talk to me any more?&apos;&quot; She is keen to work with survivors and prevention organisations in the UK as part of a burgeoning international advocacy network. Says Anna: &quot;I am doing my best to break open a long-held and really dangerous taboo \u2013 dangerous in the sense that people are dying because they are too scared to talk about\u00a0it.&quot; Curriculum vitae Age: 41.

As unpredictable as Monfils is \u2013 bamboozling Grigor Dimitrov in three sets on day nine \u2013 he will do well to take a set off the Swiss, who was masterful again in dismissing the accomplished Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.  \u201cHe\u2019s looking so good now, he\u2019s scary,\u201d John McEnroe observed.  Federer was relaxed and cool afterwards on a desperately hot New York night and revealed the reason he has rediscovered his best tennis at 33 after a dire 2013, a comeback that has thrilled his fans and surprised his rivals.  \u201cThere\u2019s no rocket science behind it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as you can train you\u2019re going to feel all right. As simple as that, basically. But, because of the issues I had last year [a minor back injury in March] I had to be unbelievably careful what I did. We had to cut back on a few things I usually would do but were scared to do. That was not what I wanted to do.  \u201cSometimes if that\u2019s what it is and it means don\u2019t run on the treadmill or don\u2019t do jumps or whatever it is, well, there\u2019s other ways you can train that. I\u2019m happy that basically today I can do whatever and I don\u2019t have any more setbacks. Once you can do that, then you really start to feel the benefits down the road.\u201d And other players here have been feeling the whip of that revival: the Australians Marinko Matosevic and Sam Groth, the Spaniard Marcels Granollers and, on a sweltering Tuesday night on Arthur Ashe, Agut, a very good player blossoming late who had not a clue how to counter Federer\u2019s sophisticated tennis. Federer said of Monfils: \u201cHe\u2019s got easy top 10 potential. He\u2019s a great mover. He\u2019s got a wonderful serve, which nobody talks about because of his athletic movement, which stands out so much. His issues have been his fitness and the setbacks he\u2019s had because of injury, then sometimes maybe not wanting to play because of reasons only he can explain.\u201d The explanation Monfils offered after beating Dimitrov 7-5, 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 in a relatively rapid two hours 24 minutes was hilarious. \u201cFor me tennis is a sport. It\u2019s not a job. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s bad to say it \u2013 and for sure I will use, like, bad words in English \u2013 but it\u2019s like, you know, I don\u2019t give a shit. It\u2019s, like, OK, next one. It sounds bad in English, but what I mean is I care about the match; I don\u2019t care about, you know, other things. It\u2019s, like, if I\u2019m not happy, OK. I want just to be happy, you know. If I\u2019m not happy, fine.\u201d Monfils, the most exotic flower in the tennis forest, lit up the tournament with a performance at least in the top 10 of his outlandish performances, occasionally slowing to a stroll midpoint to nonchalantly slap a winner, as his stamina failed to match his invention, and Dimitrov left an exasperated and frustrated opponent.  The Bulgarian should have won, could have done so, so erratic was the Frenchman, but he picked the worst day to let his tennis fall apart.  Monfils somehow survived the hottest day of the year (and who would have predicted that?), perplexing the seventh seed with his stop-start game before mustering his skills to win. He ranted, raved and ultimately prevailed, against most predictions \u2013 perhaps even his own.  Monfils has beaten Federer twice in nine matches, most recently in Shanghai last year, and took a set off him in Cincinnati last month \u2013 but he goes into this match excited to be sharing a court with him rather than convinced he can beat him again.  He is one of the few top-line players who doesn\u2019t have a coach \u2013 a victory for old-fashioned flair and self-belief, at least.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a year and a half,\u201d he said. \u201cFor sure it\u2019s better to have a coach, I won\u2019t lie to you. I need it. But it\u2019s not easy to feel [comfortable with] someone. That person has to be, for me, good, first of all, but has to be hard and also understand my personality. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m easy, but I think I\u2019m quite a good worker.\u201d  Dimitrov insisted the Frenchman\u2019s peculiar behaviour did not distract him - \u201cHe\u2019s been like that throughout all the matches and I think all the years,\u201d he said \u2013 but there it must have contributed in some small part to the Bulgarian\u2019s 38 unforced errors and four double faults. Monfils, intermittently brilliant, belted 14 aces, as well as six double faults. As for his prospects of upsetting Federer, Monfils said, \u201cI played Rafa one time here and I think it was pretty much even, so why not?\u201d ", "tags": ["Roger Federer", "US Open tennis", "Tennis", "US Open Tennis 2014", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-03T04:05:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/03/china-psychiatrists-talking-therapy-counselling", "sentences": ["Zhao Xudong, of Tongji University, in Shanghai, has said there are just 20,000 psychiatrists in the country.", "At the International Federation for Psychotherapy&apos;s conference in Shanghai this summer, Chinese speakers ranged over subjects from psychocardiology and psychoanalysis to the application of standardised rating scales in treating children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.", "Sometimes the problems reflect prosaic cultural differences, such as an incomprehension of formal aspects of western practice: &quot;They can&apos;t understand why they have to see you every week at the same time \u2013 &apos;If I like you, why can&apos;t we go out for dinner?&apos;&quot; Many of those at the Shanghai conference identified more fundamental contradictions between psychotherapy as practised in the west and Chinese traditions."], "title": "It's good to talk: China opens up to psychotherapy", "article": "The first year of college was punishingly lonely for the young medical student. Brought up in a poor village, he had little in common with his wealthier urban peers. He made no friends. No one listened to him. All he did was study. It might be a tale of China&apos;s growing social divisions. But instead of begrudging the other students their advantages, or bemoaning cliques, Zhang Yin concluded that the problem lay inside. Agonised by his sense of isolation, he turned to a counsellor for help. What began as a search for meaning in his life became his vocation: he is researching stress and depression at Changsha University and hopes to train as an existential therapist. &quot;I want to know how others relieve their pain and anxiety and discomfort,&quot; the 24-year-old said. Zhang&apos;s enthusiasm for the &quot;talking cure&quot; reflects a wider surge in interest, as China&apos;s citizens seek meaning beyond the quest for prosperity. &quot;Chinese people have been hungering and searching for something for a long time since the collapse of Maoism. Every so often there&apos;s a certain &apos;fever&apos; sweeping the country,&quot; said Huang Hsuan-ying, an ethnographer who has been studying the boom in psychotherapy in China since 2007. &quot;It fits into that long-term search for something that is not only material.&quot; Others suggest the hunger is sharpened by the traumas of China&apos;s modern history \u2013 war, famine and the cultural revolution \u2013 and the turn to private enterprise, which has boosted economic wellbeing but uprooted identities and dislocated families. Although Sigmund Freud&apos;s work was translated into Chinese in the 1920s, the initial flurry of interest was soon suppressed. Under Mao, psychology was banned in 1966 and psychiatry followed a largely medicalised model. Desperate gaps remain in mental health services in general, particularly in the countryside. Zhao Xudong, of Tongji University, in Shanghai, has said there are just 20,000 psychiatrists in the country. Yet evidence from other countries suggests China will need 100,000 more to meet the population&apos;s needs in coming years. Although there are 400,000 psychological counsellors registered with the country&apos;s ministry of labour, many in the profession believe the licence is too easy to obtain. However, public interest is now matched by official recognition: China&apos;s first mental health law, 27 years in the making, came into force last year. It acknowledges the role of psychotherapy and introduces a framework for its practice. Practitioners say patients often report problems such as stomach ache or insomnia, and may expect drug-based treatments \u2013 even when they acknowledge psychological causes. Younger, better-educated people are more open to the idea of therapy, rather than drugs, than older ones. Zhang says his parents simply do not understand what psychotherapy is. Even so, another student noted that older relatives have begun to turn to her for advice. Famous therapists such as Li Zixun appear on the TV show Psychology Talks and write columns on the subject. Psychological intervention is common after disasters. Broader cultural changes are helping psychotherapy flourish. Many of the generation taking an interest &quot;can&apos;t say &apos;I love you&apos; to their parents, and their parents would never say it to them \u2013 but they would say it to their children&quot;, said Huang, of the Australian National University&apos;s Centre on China in the World. At the International Federation for Psychotherapy&apos;s conference in Shanghai this summer, Chinese speakers ranged over subjects from psychocardiology and psychoanalysis to the application of standardised rating scales in treating children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. At times, the event had the air of a fan convention, with young acolytes rushing up after talks to have their picture taken with the speakers. Chinese conferences often invite amateur enthusiasts alongside experts \u2013 asked why she was taking part, one woman replied: &quot;I have three children.&quot; Huang said many people train but never become professionals, or abandon the work soon after they begin. Fees for public work are set low \u2013 at about 70 yuan (\u00a37) an hour \u2013 but while private sessions can command 10 times that, it is hard to build a stable client base. Sometimes the problems reflect prosaic cultural differences, such as an incomprehension of formal aspects of western practice: &quot;They can&apos;t understand why they have to see you every week at the same time \u2013 &apos;If I like you, why can&apos;t we go out for dinner?&apos;&quot; Many of those at the Shanghai conference identified more fundamental contradictions between psychotherapy as practised in the west and Chinese traditions. They argued that western culture seeks to build a stronger self, while eastern culture seeks to overcome the self; or that European and US thinkers tend to focus on the individual, while Chinese thought considers the person in context. &quot;Harmony is first: the individual is second,&quot; said Zhong Jie, an assistant professor at Peking University. He cited the case of a patient who quit when she realised treatment was making her confront her conflict with her husband. Others see unexpected alignments and convergences between aspects of traditional Chinese thought \u2013 particularly Daoism \u2013 and psychotherapy. Bao Tiankui runs group sessions: a practical response to the lack of trained therapists, but one that might seem particularly unsuited to a culture so deeply imbued with emotional privacy. Chinese participants seem to have a stronger sense of self-protection at first, he said. Yet once they start to open up, they are actually more willing to discuss their problems and get closer to the group. &quot;Chinese thinking and psychoanalysis \u2013 I think it&apos;s a good encounter,&quot; said Teresa Yuan, an Argentinian who has been visiting China to teach since the mid-1990s. &quot;Maybe there will be a new beginning to psychoanalysis that can be fed by Chinese thinking.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Mental health", "Health & wellbeing", "Health", "Society", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-03T16:15:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/04/andy-murray-falls-to-novak-djokovic-in-us-open-quarter-final", "sentences": ["I\u2019ll likely play a tournament before Shanghai."], "title": "Andy Murray falls to Novak Djokovic in US Open quarter-final", "article": "Separated by seven days of life on the planet, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic for much of last night\u2019s quarter-final resided in their own world, and it was the Serb who prevailed in a fight nearly as intense as their final on the same court two years ago. Both squandered chances and rescued lost causes throughout the three hours and 32 minutes they held a Murray-friendly house enthralled on Arthur Ashe court, which takes on the appearance and feel of a bear pit in matches such as this one. Djokovic won 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (1-7), 6-2, 6-4 and meets Japan\u2019s Kei Nishikori for the right to go through to Monday\u2019s final, but had Murray been able to sustain the quite terrifying power he injected into his flat forehand in the second and third sets, he would be staying a little longer in New York. But the world No 1, who has been in splendid form all tournament, after a brief dip in form and spirits after winning Wimbledon, deserved his win. He fought hard through some rough patches and found a little extra at the finish, when Murray began to tire. \u201cWe both gave our best,\u201d Djokovic said courtside. \u201cAt times it was not that nice, a lot of unforced errors (48 for the winner, 64 for Murray), but it was a very physical battle. I didn\u2019t expect anything less. The last five times we played we went over three or four hours.\u201d On Murray\u2019s wicked forehand, which at times resembled a Wladimir Klitschko right cross, and his all-round power and aggression, Djokovic said, \u201cHe has changed his game for the better in the past couple of years, working with Ivan [Lendl]. He has immense quality on any surface. We played a five-set match here a couple of years ago and I knew he was going to go for his shots - and that the more aggressive one was going to win it.\u201d As for how he might prepare for Nishikori, he observed, \u201cMy thoughts are just directed to sleeping \u2013 or what do you say, let\u2019s party!\u201d which the dregs of the capacity crowd greeted with approval at gone 1am. \u201cNo, I think my coach would chase me with a baseball bat if I did. We haven\u2019t played against each other for a while, but he is a very talented player, serves very well for his height.\u201d Murray was predictably downcast later and, in a hushed voice, conceded, \u201cI\u2019d say definitely physically he was fresher, Well, he appeared fresher than me. Whether he was or not I don\u2019t know; maybe he does a better job of hiding it than me. Towards the end I tried to hang in as best I could. The pace of my serve slowed significantly towards the end of the third set.\u201d He added: \u201cBut I played well. Especially in the first couple of sets, there was some good tennis. I was down in the first set and I fought back, although I played a poor tie-break. I was down in the second set and a break and I fought back. So I fought hard - but it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d The first set was ragged and tight, with Murray the less consistent at key moments, and he pretty much fell apart in the tie-break. The second set was a mirror image of the first, with Djokovic this time succumbing to the onslaught of Murray\u2019s rapier forehand that shot after shot landed hard, low and deep. The third was closer than the score suggests, although there were signs that Murray\u2019s concentration was beginning to dip. At two-all in the fourth on Djokovic\u2019s serve, Murray asked the umpire to call for the trainer, an unusual request in running play \u2013 only to put on an undershirt. Moments later, he took delivery of a heat pack to place on his lower back on the changeover. The fight was taking its toll in familiar places. Behind in the serving circle, Murray held his nerve, showing no obvious discomfort as he drew level in the eighth game, which he held to love for only the third time in the match. Trailing by a set, he could not afford to let his level dip against one of the most ruthless finishers in tennis; perhaps, also, he had to fight subliminal thoughts of settling for a second straight impressive showing against a top 10 player, having seen off Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the fourth round to break that streak against his peers since he won Wimbledon. More likely, his phenomenal thirst for a win began to swell, as it did when he ground Djokovic into the court for his breakthrough slam win here in 2012. That night, a swirling wind accompanied his path to victory; for the first time in this tournament, their match last night was played out in the still of the night. However, serving to stay in the tournament at 4-5, Murray paused on his first ball-toss as some comedian let his evening\u2019s beverage intake get to him interject with some childish heckling. Murray lost the point. Djokovic then worked him over on the backhand like a surgeon to move within two points of his eighth successive semi-final here. When Murray hit long to hand Djokovic two match points the tension rose appreciably \u2013 and the joker in the crowd surfaced again. After a botched first serve, he got the ball in play but his final effort was a backhand that drifted into the net, and it was done. John McEnroe was tough on Murray afterwards, pointing out that too often \u201cthings happen\u201d in his matches when he loses. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he was looking for excuses,\u201d he added, when that was exactly what he was saying. Murray said he was not overly concerned about missing the end-of-season ATP World Tour Finals, suggesting rest might be a priority. \u201cTo be honest, it was not a massive goal of mine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously nice to qualify for it. It\u2019s a good tournament. I played a number of years and enjoyed it. But I don\u2019t want to overplay. I\u2019ll play the right schedule. I\u2019ll likely play a tournament before Shanghai. I\u2019m not sure exactly which one yet.\u201d Earlier, Nishikori scored an extraordinary five-set win over Stanislas Wawrinka in the first of the men\u2019s quarter-finals \u2013 just a day after finishing a five-setter at nearly 2.30am against Milos Raonic. Wawrinka, the Australian Open champion and seeded three here, had chances to burn \u2013 and duly set them alight, his final forehand handing the Japanese his first slam semi-final with a 3-6, 7-5. 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 win that he will do well to recuperate quickly from. But he has lived up to his reputation here as one of the finest all-round players in the game. He will still be tough for even a prime Djokovic to beat. In the slightly delayed first night match, Serena Williams started like a three-wheel rollerskate and finished like a train to beat Flavia Pennetta 6-3, 5-2 in a couple of ticks over an hour. The Italian won the first three games before the reigning champion found her rhythm, shrugging off the effects of a turned ankle in her lost doubles match the day before, and pretty much blew the 11th seed off the court.", "tags": ["US Open tennis", "US Open Tennis 2014", "Andy Murray", "Novak Djokovic", "Tennis", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-04T06:01:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/04/top-10-bandbs-bruges-ghent-belgium", "sentences": ["Shanghai is a riot of red velvet furnishing and Buddha statues, resembling a decadent 1900s Chinese bordello, and comes with its own jacuzzi in the garden."], "title": "Top 10 B&Bs in Bruges and Ghent, Belgium", "article": "Only half an hour apart by train, Bruges and Ghent make the perfect combination for a weekend trip to Belgium.

BRUGES B&amp;B La Maison Zenasni Difficult to imagine a better B&amp;B in town than this enormous mansion, converted and decorated by Algerian Djamil Zenasni and his Belgian wife. Built on the site of an ancient church, the property dates back to 1782 and is so large that for the last century it was divided into two houses. Zenasni has ripped down the divisions, and lives in one part with his family while the other consists of a magnificent lounge and breakfast room for guests on the ground floor with five rooms upstairs. The owner has his own interiors boutique just round the corner, and rooms are furnished with plush sofas he upholsters himself.

There is a metal and glass corridor running from the kitchen to the garden rooms \u2013 so guests don\u2019t get wet going for breakfast \u2013 and the red, blue and yellow rooms resemble a colourful spaceship inside with a self-contained bathroom and mezzanine chill-out zone.

The Herring\u2019s Residence This is a new addition to the Bruges B&amp;B scene, and although it is not cheap, the Herring\u2019s Residence is a unique place to stay. The Herring in question is the renowned Michelin-starred restaurant, Den Gouden Harynck, whose chef, Philippe Serruys, bought a small, whitewashed 17th-century cottage in a nearby courtyard, transforming it into a chic guesthouse, where for the price of a double room, the guest has the run of the whole place. On the ground floor is an ultra modern kitchen, with a snug lounge, bedroom and bathroom on the first floor, plus another sitting room and work space under the attic\u2019s ancient timber beams. In the morning, guests tell Philippe what time they want breakfast and it is delivered straight from the restaurant.

The Troitsky (Trinity) Bridge across the Neva River in St Petersburg: a historically complex root of Soviet urban ideology. Photograph: Steve Raymer/Corbis    If, as Chinese philosopher Wang Hui observed in his book The End of Revolution, socialism was the door through which China passed on its voyage into modernity, then it was Russia that opened that door, by exporting models and expertise that laid the foundation for much of what constitutes modern China. Perhaps the most tangible of these legacies is the look and feel of the contemporary Chinese city; and since China is a centrally planned economy, this look and feel is remarkably unified. The prime shaping factor for the modern Chinese city was Soviet urbanism \u2013 or more precisely, Stalinist urbanism. In 1949, when the Communist party came to power, Beijing was a city of half a million people: 95% or more of both the population and built structures in today\u2019s 20 million-person agglomeration emerged from the revolution, and from the Soviet advice that the new government relied on.  In his book Beijing Record, Wang Jun makes clear the scale of this influence: \u201cOn 16 September [1949], a group of Soviet experts in municipal administration arrived in Beijing. They were supposed to help the new government in its work to plan the city\u2019s development. In reality, however, they were to have absolute say in everything.\u201d These Soviet town planners and architects delivered a report, Proposals on Improving Beijing\u2019s Municipal Administration, which was to largely shape the development of the city to come. They had come to China not only for geopolitical reasons, but, like the Japanese urban theorists who had come in the 1920s and 1930s, and like the western \u2018starchitects\u2019 who come today because of China\u2019s ability to undertake vast projects, to offer planners speed and huge power.      Skyscrapers and modern buildings stand behind a traditional Chinese housing complex in Beijing. Photograph: Diego Azubel/EPA    The Soviet model city could be realised on Chinese soil, when it could not be in Russia, because there were fewer impediments; Mao was willing to tear down all old buildings, making the Chinese city a tabula rasa. Moreover, Mao combined in one person the radical revolutionary desires of a Lenin with the total power of a Stalin; he both desired to, and was capable of, completely remaking urban society. A \u201ctruer, purer\u201d version of the Soviet urban ideology could be materialised in the Chinese urban desert \u2013 literally empty fields and illiterate peasants who were being \u201cmodernised\u201d \u2013 in the historically complex, ideologically overdetermined spaces of Moscow or St Petersburg. As the Beijing model was replicated all through the country, in rural and agricultural areas that had never known large cities, this vision became ubiquitous: Soviet architectural typologies and the models of Soviet urban planners constituted the first vision of cities ever glimpsed by Chinese peasants in a rapidly modernising society. To this day, migrant workers from the countryside are hustled into the sort of large suburban tower blocks that dominate the edges of Russian cities. The ring roads, the tower blocks, the black taxis, the dingy restaurants, the sidewalks lined with empty liquor bottles: the urban templates of contemporary China are identical to those of the Soviet Union, just multiplied. The similarities do not end there: a frequent traveller from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, or indeed from Beijing to Moscow, can\u2019t help but note the same asymmetrical haircuts of the billionaires, the same suburban replications of Versailles and the same endless buzzing in the city centre.     Moscow\u2019s newest developments offer a tempered version of the Soviet model city more freely built in China. Photograph: Calle Montes/Photononstop/Corbis    This Soviet model of urbanism \u2013 a centrally planned component within a national economic unity \u2013 is thriving. The clearest indication of its survival in today\u2019s China is the concept of \u201ctiered\u201d cities, with Shanghai and Beijing being \u201cfirst tier\u201d, Hangzhou, Chengdu or Tianjin being \u201csecond tier\u201d and so forth.  This is a long way from what Dutch architect and theorist Rem Koolhaas has termed \u201cdelirious\u201d urbanism: the Chinese city is meticulously planned as part of a holistic national grid of transportation networks, communication networks, and commodity distribution networks \u2013 the vast bulk of which is either state-owned or state-controlled.  We should not forget that some of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities in China \u2013 like Zhengzhou, Hefei, Shijiazhuang and Changsha \u2013 are in some way the mutated children of the Stalinist belle \u00e9poque. The ultimate objective of Stalinism \u2013 to rapidly expand the economy in order to destroy western hegemony \u2013 is being realised as we speak, by people who have been members of a Communist party all of their lives.  The creation of generic architectural typologies which can be infinitely duplicated, the model of an economic system which puts everyone and everything into a collective aspiration to increased production \u2013 this \u201cChinese\u201d model of urbanism, which has deep roots in the Soviet theorists\u2019 work, is today growing everywhere that Chinese state-owned companies operate, and often in former Soviet states themselves. The Stalinist-Maoist model, which instrumentalises the relationship between people and their environment in order to generate industrial wealth, even at tremendous cost to those people and environments, is alive today and expanding fast.

The conflict, with the heartbreak, devastation and division that have ensued, has also crept into sport \u2013 one of the few distractions and pleasures of many away from the suffering \u2013 dividing players, leading authorities, coaches and managers into three camps: pro-Assad, pro-democracy and neutral. Players such as Abdul Basit Saroot took off his boots to join the revolution, becoming an instant icon, while his compatriot, the Syrian international Musab Balhous \u2013 before he reverted after his release \u2013 spent time in prison accused of sheltering armed rebels and strengthening an armed organisation composed of Al-Karamah club-mates against the nation\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. Others left the country either in protest or for their own safety. Firas Al-Khatib \u2013 regarded as one of the finest footballers Syria has produced \u2013 has refused to represent his national side in solidarity with those seeking freedom and liberation and now plies his trade with China\u2019s Shanghai Shenhua. \u201cThere are players who have refused to represent the national team for the time being because they believe they represent a certain side,\u201d states Tareq Hindawi, who plays for Al-Ittihad and is captain of Syria\u2019s under-20 national team. \u201cBut I disagree with their position. We represent our flag and our allegiance is towards this country. We play to carve a smile on to the lips of every Syrian supporter.\u201d Before the civil war Syrian football was experiencing a bright and prosperous period highlighted by the fine campaign Al-Karamah, based in the city of Homs, had in the Asian Champions League when they reached the final of the competition in 2006. It was the furthest any Syrian side has progressed in Asia\u2019s biggest club tournament, thanks largely to their strong home record at the iconic Khalid bin Walid Stadium, a base for Syrian resistance, where they seemed almost unbeatable. They finally succumbed to the South Korean side Jeonbuk Motors \u2013 but that does not blight or blemish their astonishing campaign against all odds. The brilliant run did not end there as the national team also managed to pull off qualification for the 2011 Asian Cup tournament, their first in 15 years, after finishing as group leaders ahead of China. Unfortunately for the Eagles of Qasioun, they were given a tough and awkward group alongside the former champions Japan and Saudi Arabia and packed their bags early but with their heads held high. This upturn in fortunes reflected well on their managers, particularly Nizar Mahrous, who has since led the recently established Shabab Al-Ordun to historic domestic and continental glory during his successful three-year stint with the club, and Maher Bahri, who managed Al Ahli back to Jordan\u2019s Premier Division for the first time in three seasons since their disappointing withdrawal back in 2010-2011. \u201cOf course, the status of Syrian football was going to a better and brighter tomorrow in light of players plying their trade outside of the country,\u201d Bahri said. \u201cThe performances of Al-Karamah, Al-Jaish and Al-Wahda in the Asian Champions League and Asian Cup respectively prove that \u2013 as well as the increased following of Syrian football throughout every province in the country\u201d Only a few months after the national side\u2019s participation in the Asian Cup, however, the prospects for Syrian football took an unanticipated turn. As the Arab Spring continued to sweep across the region, thousands of Syrians marched on the streets of Daraa, demanding reform and democratic changes. Some players left for their safety \u2013 managers as well. Clubs have toiled financially \u2013 even struggling to pay their players\u2019 wages \u2013 sporting facilities have suffered damage from the fighting, matches have been postponed, the entire 2010-2011 season was called off, match attendances have shrunk and those involved within the sport, such as Al-Wathbah\u2019s Youssef Sleiman, lost their lives. \u201cSyrian football is in an unimaginable situation,\u201d Omar Abdulrazaq, a player who plies his trade in Jordan, says. \u201cThe league is very weak, a good number of players have left the country and the domestic matches are currently held in very difficult conditions. When you watch what\u2019s happening in Syria on a daily basis, it\u2019s natural to feel sad.\u201d Mohammed Muselmani, a player who left Syria after the civil war broke out and is currently trying to find a club in neighboring Lebanon, says: \u201cIt is all politics, it doesn\u2019t feel like football any more. The opposition wants to create a separate national side, while pro-Assadists want to maintain the same order and system. Many players have left the country and now the national side consists of players from the country\u2019s youth teams.\u201d Despite the unbearable situation, the Syrian Arab Federation for Football has reinstalled the domestic league, which runs under a new system, with 16 teams divided into two groups and the top four from each group qualifying for the final stage. Al-Ittihad and Al-Karamah, two of Syria\u2019s best clubs who hail from two of the most beleaguered cities, Aleppo and Homs, have struggled to cope under such fraught circumstances, while stadiums such as Al-Hamadaniah in Aleppo \u2013 sometimes used by Al-Ittihad \u2013 and Latakia stadium have been utilised as military bases and detention centres by Assad\u2019s forces. Al-Karamah, who won the league four seasons in succession, from 2006-2009, are a shadow of their former dominant selves and have been forced \u2013 until very recently \u2013 to play away from home because of the conditions in Homs, while Al-Ittihad have been relying on their third-string side as a result of the departure of so many first-choice players. Clubs hailing from Damascus have taken full advantage of their rivals\u2019 struggles amid the constant shelling and destruction of their cities, gaining the upper hand in the league, with Al-Shorta and Al-Jaish winning the last two titles since the league was restarted. \u201cAs a sportsman I struggle and suffer just like the rest of the Syrian people who have become weary with the war,\u201d Saif al-Haji, an unattached footballer in Syria, says. \u201cThe living situation is extremely difficult, especially monetarily and financially. I have received many offers to leave and play abroad but since I have never served in the military I can\u2019t receive a passport.\u201d According to the Syrian football expert Mohammed Nasser, there are more than 200 players who have left the country, with the most popular destination being Iraq. Among the 25 players representing the national side in the last tournament, only three of them reside in Syria. \u201cDuring the first year of the revolution the sport went into a bit of decline amid the destruction caused by opposition forces. By its second year, though, we Syrian people have adapted to the ongoing events and circumstances,\u201d Nasser said. \u201cThe league has once again resumed and we try to bring in as many supporters to the stadiums as possible because sport is the only thing that lightens the hearts amid this crisis.\u201d Despite the daily struggles Syria\u2019s national side and domestic teams have still exceeded expectations in the continental arena, winning the 2012 West Asian Cup. For all those performances, however, no amount of sport can distract or alter the grim reality of everyday life. The resumption of football: the goals and entertainment it provides rings hollow to the more than 150,000 lives lost as a result of this bloody conflict. \u201cThe regime\u2019s persistence on resuming sporting activities is an irresponsible decision in light of the risks and dangers athletes could potentially face,\u201d says Yasser al-Hallaq, the executive director of Athletes for Syria. \u201cThis decision only validates the notion that the ruling regime wants to show the public that life is normal, which is absolutely not the case at all.\u201d", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Syria", "Bashar al-Assad", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-07T12:56:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/08/the-films-to-watch-in-autumn-2014-from-gone-girl-to-mr-turner", "sentences": ["A courtroom thriller of frayed familial relations and diminished responsibility, this marks the first attempt at drama by David Dobkin, best known for larky farces like Shanghai Knights, The Wedding Crashers and The Change-Up."], "title": "The films to watch in autumn 2014: from Gone Girl to Mr Turner", "article": "September              Pride This rousing film from Matthew Warchus is about the help that gay campaigners gave to miners during the strike of 1984-85.

Great performances from Bill Nighy, Imelda Stanton, Dominic West and Paddy Considine. Peter BradshawUK 12 September, US 19 September.            A Most Wanted Man Philip Seymour Hoffman managed what would prove to be a potent, bittersweet swansong in Anton Corbijn\u2019s pungent adaptation of the John le Carr\u00e9 thriller. Cigarette in one hand, glass of scotch in the other, he stars as G\u00fcnther Bachmann, the crumpled, committed frontman of German intelligence.

The Riot Club Big-screen adaptation of Laura Wade\u2019s play Posh, about a fictionalised Bullingdon Club, starring up-and-comers Max Irons, Douglas Booth, Freddie Fox and Sam Claflin. The danger is that the movie might glamorise the leads more than a stage version could \u2013 and turn a satire into a romance (director Lone Scherfig\u2019s last film was One Day) \u2013 but the trailer suggests the material is still drawing blood, however rich the matinee gloss. Catherine ShoardUK and US 19 September.            Magic in the Moonlight Woody Allen\u2019s latest comic confection is set in the glamorous French Riviera of the 1930s. Colin Firth plays Stanley, a professional magician who styles himself Wei Ling Soo from the mystic Orient, but offstage and incognito, he is committed to rooting out fakers and charlatans who pretend their tricks are the real thing. Emma Stone plays Sophie, whose supposed telepathic powers have fashionable society entranced. Stanley sets out to take her down, and chaos ensues. PBUK 19 September.              20,000 Days on Earth This quasi-doc self-portrait by Nick Cave has startled and entertained audiences. It is a picture of Cave on the occasion of his 20,000th day on earth, giving a view of his artistic impulses, his friends, his collagues, his opinions, his worldview and most importantly, his music. What we get is not exactly a snapshot of Cave as he is, nor precisely a day in the life of a rock star, but a guide to Cave\u2019s sense of his imaginary and creative self. We see him talking to an analyst and also interviewing Kylie Minogue. It has been hailed as a \u201cmuso\u201d film that can be enjoyed by non-fans. PBUK 19 September, US 17 September.              Maps to the Stars David Cronenberg\u2019s latest is a gripping and exquisitely horrible movie about Hollywood \u2013 positively vivisectional in its sadism and scorn \u2013 written by industry satirist Bruce Wagner. Julianne Moore plays a washed-up actor trying to get the lead role in a film about her mother, a star from the bygone age. Mia Wasikowska is her intense assistant and Robert Pattinson plays a limo driver and wannabe screenwriter. PBUK 26 September, US 27 September, Australia 16 October.            The Equalizer Denzel Washington gets strapped and steps into the old Edward Woodward role as a justice-obsessed former special-ops guy, now out on the street and on a mission to straighten the odds. Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz is the primary helpee, a teenage girl menaced by the Russian mafia \u2013 against whom Denzel must pit his trademark steely-eyed everymannishness. The director is Antoine Fuqua, who called the shots on Washington\u2019s Oscar-winner Training Day, so a superior product is more than likely.

October              Gone Girl David Fincher directs this adaptation of the bestselling thriller by Gillian Flynn about a man whose wife disappears and who then becomes the centre of a media circus when suspicion falls on him. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike star. Although the movie version is understood to have significant changes from the novel, the question of whether we believe the husband\u2019s protestations of innocence are an important part of the experience. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross supply the score. PB UK and US 3 October, Australia 2 October.            The Rewrite Hugh Grant and director Marc Lawrence are one of the most quietly committed teams in Hollywood: they\u2019ve made Two Weeks Notice (2002), Music and Lyrics (2007) and Did You Hear About the Morgans? (2009). The dicey quality of that last instalment might explain the substantial wait for their latest, but everything about The Rewrite looks promising. Grant is a once-successful screenwriter fallen on hard times who accepts a teaching job at a US university. He ogles the teens, annoys colleagues (Allison Janney, JK Simmons) and meets single mum and mature student Marisa Tomei. CSUK 8 October.

Dakota Fanning plays Gray \u2013 the woman who left critic John Ruskin for painter John Everett Millais after establishing her husband was \u201cdisgusted with my person\u201d \u2013 while Thompson plays her friend and confidante Lady Eastlake. Thompson\u2019s screenwriting chops were definitively proved by her Oscar-winning adaptation of Sense and Sensibility; this darker-sounding study of emotional entanglements ought to bring out her best. AP UK 10 October, US November 2014.            The Judge Roberts Downey Jr and Duvall face off in the dock, despite being on the same side and father and son. A courtroom thriller of frayed familial relations and diminished responsibility, this marks the first attempt at drama by David Dobkin, best known for larky farces like Shanghai Knights, The Wedding Crashers and The Change-Up. Vera Farmiga plays Downey Jr\u2019s high-school sweetheart, Billy Bob Thornton a formidable courtroom opponent. CSUK 17 October, US 10 October, Australia 9 October.              Jimi: All Is By My Side 12 Years a Slave screenwriter John Ridley hammers out a squalling pre-fame biopic of Jimi Hendrix \u2013 a twisty, mercurial take on the early days of a rock god. There\u2019s none of Hendrix\u2019s music (the estate said no) and it\u2019s factually dubious (Kathy Etchingham, Jimi\u2019s ex, called it \u201cinaccurate and nonsensical\u201d), but it\u2019s compelling for all its flaws. Outkast\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Benjamin does a decent Jimi, while Imogen Poots is on career-high form as Linda Keith, the Vogue model turned talent scout who helped introduce Jimi to the UK. Henry BarnesUK 24 October, US 26 September.            This Is Where I Leave You Jonathan Trotter has written four popular novels of moderate family dysfunction. This, the first he has adapted for the screen, stars Jane Fonda as a grieving widow and celebrity psychologist and the likes of Tina Fey, Jason Bateman and Adam Driver as the errant children who return home to sit shiva for a week. Secrets will out, slapstick will happen, bittersweetness will be served. Look out for Rose Byrne, one of the most charming female leads around at the moment, in a supporting role. CSUK 24 October, US 19 September US, Australia 23 October.              Fury David Ayer, writer-director of brocentric LA cop drama End of Watch, gets more macho with a tank movie starring Brad Pitt as \u201cWardaddy\u201d, the jarhead commander of a renegade bunch of soldiers fighting the Germans at the scraggy end of the second world war. The trailer shows Pitt and co blowing up, stabbing and shooting the enemy, yet Ayer \u2013 a US Navy veteran \u2013 has promised a thoughtful treatise on the corrupting influence of war on the individual. It\u2019ll be buried in the rumble there somewhere. HB UK 24 October, US 17 October, Australia 23 October. Serena Will it be third time unlucky for Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, who have already collaborated to such good effect on Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle?

Xan BrooksUK 24 October, Australia 27 November.            Nightcrawler An unlikely sounding thriller: Jake Gyllenhaal plays a videojournalist who joins the pack hunting for sellable crime footage in Los Angeles \u2013 the kind of ghouls who hang about waiting for something nasty to happen so they can film it. Bill Paxton, Rene Russo and Four Lions\u2019 Riz Ahmed are along for the ride, with script and direction from Dan Gilroy, brother of the slightly better-known Tony (Michael Clayton, The Bourne Legacy). Gyllenhaal apparently lost quite a bit of weight for the role, though perhaps not to a McConaughey-esque extent. APUK and US 31 October.              Mr Turner Mike Leigh rustles up a glorious portrait of the artist as harrumphing old dog with his labour-of-love biopic of JMW Turner. It\u2019s a film that romps from the ballrooms of Victorian London to the seafront at Margate, the source of our hero\u2019s inspiration. Timothy Spall deservedly picked up best actor at Cannes for his tour-de-force Turner. XBUK 31 October, US 19 December, Australia 22 January 2015. November              Interstellar Matthew McConaughey signs up to save the world, not from aliens or terrorists, but \u2013 because this is a Christopher Nolan film \u2013 from ourselves. Earth has run out of food. A widowed engineer (McConaughey) volunteers to lead a space mission to find new planets to inhabit. Nolan regulars Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine are along for the ride, while Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon pop up to look contemplative. Promises to be an angsty epic of galactic proportions. HBUK and US 7 November, Australia 6 November.            The Imitation Game Benedict Cumberbatch gets what might just be the Oscar push he needs in this biopic of Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing, adapted from the biography by Andrew Hodges. His fellow Bletchley Park whizzes include Matthew Goode, Charles Dance and Keira Knightley, apparently also outstanding as the woman to whom Turing becomes engaged before revealing his homosexuality. The presence of Norwegian director Morten Tyldum (Headhunters) should help steer this away from predictable period telly territory. CS UK 14 November, US 21 November.            The Drop  That this moody drama is the last film of James Gandolfini should not overshadow coverage of what looks like a terrific crime thriller, written by Dennis Lehane and directed by Micha\u00ebl R Roskam, whose Bullhead was a very sturdy Belgian Oscar nominee a few years back. The star of that film, Matthias Schoenaerts, returns for this, alongside Noomi Rapace and Tom Hardy, who co-stars with Gandolfini as owners of a Brooklyn bar used as a drop-off for illicit funds by local gangsters. CS UK 14 November, US 12 September, Australia 13 November.            Get on Up Hollywood has been trying to make a biopic of soul legend James Brown for years, and this one finally got there. Brits Jez and John-Henry Butterworth wrote the script, Mick Jagger is one of the producers, The Help\u2019s Tate Taylor got the nod to direct, and Chadwick Boseman, fresh from playing Jackie Robinson in 42, nabbed the lead role. It\u2019s already been and gone in the US, with largely positive reviews giving particular respect to Boseman \u2013 our critic, Tom Shone, called it \u201cone of the year\u2019s truly outstanding performances\u201d. With a soundtrack of live Brown performances, they could hardly go wrong. AP UK 21 November, Australia 30 October.            Winter Sleep The jury at this year\u2019s Cannes film festival fell over themselves to award top honours to Nuri Bilge Ceylan\u2019s rumbling 196-minute Chekhovian drama (\u201cI could happily have stayed there for another couple of hours,\u201d insisted judge Jane Campion). Haluk Bilginer (formerly of EastEnders) plays the moneyed old actor who dreams of playing god in a Turkish mountain community. Ceylan nudges him towards the rocks of self-awareness.

Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels re-team with the Farrelly brothers for a sequel to their 1994 hit. This time uber-morons Harry (Daniels) and Lloyd (Carrey) are on the trail of Harry\u2019s daughter, born without his knowledge two decades ago. The original was stupid but strangely heartfelt. Who knows if the reunion, arriving years after a clutch of comedies that liberally ripped off the puerility-plus format, can discover new depths to sink to?

Ridley Scott directs this account of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt, with the help of alpha-screenwriter Steven Zaillian. Christian Bale plays Moses, Aaron Paul plays Joshua and there are smaller roles for Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver. Will they reach the Promised Land? Will the parting of the Red Sea prove a showstopper, or has the ubiquity of CGI made such moments less interesting? We shall see, and it promises to be a spectacle of sorts.

Jack O\u2019Connell (Starred Up, Skins) takes flight for the big leagues as Zamperini, while Jolie enlisted the Coen brothers to rewrite the screenplay.

One of my favourite pages in the back of the book features one of my favourite subjects: getting a good night\u2019s sleep. Oliver Burkeman\u2019s column may not actually change your life, but it certainly feeds into a healthy discussion of how to slumber more soundly.

Treated like lepers and perverts by most societies, pursued and sometimes brutalised by agents of the state, persecuted by the bitter bigotry of their own neighbours. The desperation to conform \u2013 or even the internalisation of society\u2019s rejection \u2013 leaves many with lives stripped of happiness, having been forced into relationships based by a desire for an easy life, lovers left as collateral damage. And all this because of one of the most basic human urges: to love and be loved. That\u2019s why the story of Alice \u201cNonie\u201d Dubes and Vivian Boyack is so moving. The two fell almost instantly in love with each other in Iowa in 1942. In all too many corners of the United States today \u2013 or Britain, for that matter \u2013 the idea of two women having a loving, sexual relationship remains something to be rejected or ridiculed. But their story began in the middle of world war two, more than 25 years before the Stonewall riots, 36 years before Iowa\u2019s anti-gay laws began to be repealed, when Harvey Milk was only a 12-year-old boy, and decades before superstars like Ellen DeGeneres or Drew Barrymore could happily describe themselves as lesbian or bisexual. Could they possibly have imagined that \u2013 nearly 75 years later \u2013 they would be legally able to be married in a church, deemed equal before the law, no longer treated by the state as objects of persecution, pity or hatred? Alice and Vivian are important, because they show what struggle achieves. In the here and now, injustice often looks inevitable, too overwhelming and hegemonic to ever be swept away. The idea that their once forbidden love could be blessed in a church would \u2013 in 1940s America \u2013 have seemed like an impossible dream. And indeed the prejudice and repression faced by LGBT people did not sweep itself away; it was not a case of the powerful waking up, deciding as an act of compassion that equality should suddenly be granted from on high. Instead, people had to fight for it, often at great personal cost. We know of the inspirational American LGBT icons like Harvey Milk, but often those who all LGBT people owe for their liberation remain nameless, absent from the history books, but no less heroic. In China we see the same testament to struggle \u2013 and a reminder of the fight that still remains. The marriage of Brian Davidson \u2013 the 50-year-old British consul-general to Shanghai \u2013 to his US partner, in the British ambassador to China\u2019s official residence, became a social media sensation. In China itself, it spurred an online debate about whether the country should legalise gay marriage: a huge step, given that Chinese LGBT people still face persecution, including electroshock therapy. But an online poll for China\u2019s microblogging site Weibo found that 89,000 supported equal marriage, with only 8,000 opposed. There is still a long way for LGBT people to go. In much of the world, they remain persecuted by the state, even facing the prospect of death in countries like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Transgendered people still confront legal repression and widespread social stigma, with more than 200 transgendered people killed across the world last year. Even in nations like our own \u2013 where lesbians and gays have been granted formal equality before the law \u2013 homophobia persists as an invisible authoritarian regime, with the constant fear of abuse or attack for simply publicly demonstrating affection with a partner. Because of how they are treated, LGBT people are more susceptible to mental distress and \u2013 horribly \u2013 suicide. But, occasionally, it is important to take stock. Demonstrating how far we have come \u2013 and paying tribute to those who struggled against what seemed like insurmountable odds \u2013 helps to spur us on to finish the fight. Alice and Vivian \u2013 now both in their early 90s \u2013 are finally able to publicly confirm their love. And, as they do so, they stand on the shoulders of all those who fought against bigotry and persecution. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 September 2014 to correct the age of Brian Davidson.", "tags": ["Gay marriage", "Life and style", "Marriage", "Sexuality", "Society", "US news", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-10T10:42:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/syria-opposition-welcomes-us-air-strikes-isis-militants", "sentences": ["Zhang Xinfeng, head of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation&apos;s regional anti-terrorism agency, said China and its neighbours faced a threat as their own nationals return home after fighting in Iraq and Syria."], "title": "Syria's opposition welcomes US air strikes on Isis militants", "article": "Syria&apos;s main western-backed opposition group has welcomed Barack Obama&apos;s decision to bomb Islamic State (Isis) insurgents inside their country for the first time, but has also called for the removal of Bashar al-Assad&apos;s government. The Syrian National Coalition said it was siding with the international community to defeat militants who have seized control of parts of Syria and Iraq. &quot;The Syrian Coalition \u2026 stands ready and willing to partner with the international community not only to defeat Isis but also rid the Syrian people of the tyranny of the Assad regime,&quot; said Hadi al-Bahra, head of the coalition. Obama announced on Wednesday night that he was authorising US air strikes inside Syria for the first time, along with expanded attacks in Iraq, as part of &quot;a steady, relentless effort&quot; to &quot;degrade and destroy&quot; Isis. He also urged Congress to authorise a programme to train and arm Syrian rebels. Bahra said mainstream Syrian rebels desperately needed the kind of support that would enable them to form a reliable and well equipped force to fight the extremists. &quot;We urge the US Congress to approve the president&apos;s policy as soon as possible, and allow the training and equipping of the Free Syrian Army,&quot; said the coalition. It warned however that it was key to &quot;realise that the Assad regime represents the root cause of the violence, brutality and sense of impunity prevailing in Syria&quot;. A year ago, Obama was expected to announce air strikes against Assad&apos;s forces after a chemical weapons attack near Damascus. Obama backed down at the last minute, although he said a chemical attack by the regime marked a &quot;red line&quot; for the US. As Obama prepared America for wider military action against Isis, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, pressed on with efforts to build a coalition against the insurgents. Arriving in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from Iraq, he met counterparts from 10 Arab countries, and Turkey, after Obama outlined his strategy in a prime-time television address. The US wants Gulf countries to stop the flow of money to Isis by tackling oil smuggling and cracking down on contributions from private donors, a senior state department official told reporters travelling with Kerry. Kerry will also ask for help including overflight rights and using regional television news outlets, specifically al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya, to air anti-extremist messages. &quot;They need to get at the clerics because the clerics can get at the mosques in the neighbourhood and they have to expose Isil [Isis] for what it is,&quot; the official told reporters. Saudi Arabia&apos;s senior clergy have attacked Isis and al-Qaida in a series of messages over the past month, denouncing the militant groups as heretical and saying it is religiously forbidden to support or join them. The White House says it will target the group&apos;s leadership, logistical and operational capability, and attempt to &quot;deny it sanctuary and resources to plan, prepare and execute attacks&quot;. US officials said a critical component of the plan to train and equip Syrian insurgents was the Saudis&apos; willingness to allow use of their territory for US training efforts. These rebels have received only modest American backing so far. Saudi Arabia has taken part in efforts to train Syrian rebels alongside western countries, but on Jordanian territory, diplomats in the Gulf have said. They said those efforts were complicated by the difficulty of vetting individual rebels to ensure they did not harbour militant sympathies. Earlier in Baghdad, Kerry endorsed plans by Haider al-Abadi, the new Iraqi prime minister, to improve relations with Sunnis and Kurds. He said the new government was &quot;the heart and backbone&quot; of the fight against Isis. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, is due in Iraq on Friday, ahead of an international conference on Iraqi peace and security that Paris will host on Monday. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Yousef Al Oteiba, UAE&apos;s ambassador to the US, said his country was ready to join a coordinated international response that should to be waged not only on the battlefield but also against militant ideology. Zhang Xinfeng, head of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation&apos;s regional anti-terrorism agency, said China and its neighbours faced a threat as their own nationals return home after fighting in Iraq and Syria.

Photograph: Nadav Kander/\u00a9 Nadav Kander, courtesy Flowers Gallery London and New York    During the cold war, Kurchatov and Priozersk on the borderlands between Russia and Kazakhstan were secret cities, closed off to foreigners and not identified on official maps. These were the sites where, for four decades, Russian scientists created prototype atomic bombs and developed an advanced missile shield in a frantic effort to catch up with the US military\u2019s deadly adventure. In 1941 the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb near Kurchatov, unbeknown to the local population, who were monitored as the effects of radiation sickness spread for miles around, affecting the land, the crops and the animals that grazed the foothills of the steppes. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, the test sites now lie in ruins, having been dismantled by the Russian military with help from American experts. As shown in Nadav Kander\u2019s new series, Dust, they possess a strange, sometimes eerie beauty that he captures in his signature style: large-format landscapes full of stillness and light that continue his visual exploration of what he calls \u201cthe aesthetics of destruction\u201d. Kander\u2019s most celebrated series, Yangtze: the Long River, which won the Prix Pictet prize in 2009, was the result of a 4,000-mile photographic odyssey from Shanghai to Qinghai province in the rural west of China. The power of the images was suggestive, almost subliminal insofar as you sensed that something tumultuous \u2013 China\u2019s sudden urge towards modernity at whatever human cost \u2013 simmered beneath the formal calmness of the images of abandoned towns, submerged villages and vast new flyovers. Kander thinks big. The size of his prints reflects his ambition as well as his acute understanding of scale and architectural eye for composition. In their beauty, though, they also accentuate the paradoxical nature of his approach: the rendering of the desolate sublime. In his catalogue essay, the novelist Will Self writes: \u201cThese images do not make beautiful what is not, they ask of us that we repurpose ourselves to accept a new order of both the beautiful and the real.\u201d I am not entirely convinced by that claim. Digitally printed to a degree of verisimilitude that the darkroom could never produce, Kander\u2019s images possess a hyper-real aspect that to me makes them seem oddly unreal.     Priozersk II (Tulip in Bloom), Kazakhstan 2011. Flowers Gallery Photograph: courtesy Flowers Gallery London and New York    His works also possess a painterly quality, not just in their perfect composition but in the use of soft light and muted colour tones to bathe earth, trees and crumbling concrete in a warm glow. As with the similarly epic work of Edward Burtynsky, there is the lingering sense that something human has been lost in all the digitised grandeur, in this utterly faithful reproduction of the natural and the man-made. It was almost a relief to glimpse a discarded polythene bag in one photograph, a residue of ordinary \u2013 rather than epic and historical \u2013 human behaviour. In another image, a figure stands beneath a building, staring up at a high wall that looks like it may topple at any minute. This turns out to be Kander himself, the artist dwarfed by his subject and, in a rare moment of referential humour, looking as vulnerable as Buster Keaton in that famous scene where a house collapses around him. There is, of course, much to admire here formally and aesthetically. At heart, Kander is a craftsman: he still mostly shoots on film and is a master of composition, colour and atmosphere. His images evince a palpable sense of stillness and silence \u2013 though look closely and you will see the blur of the wind on grass and shrub. As the exhibition title suggests, the series deals with the fallout, physical and psychological, real and metaphorical, of the recent geopolitical past. One of the predominant colours is rust brown \u2013 as if the earth has somehow seeped upwards and outwards into grass, tree and rock. In one compelling image \u2013 the first one you see as you enter the newly redesigned Flowers East gallery \u2013 a city appears shadow-like in the far distance beneath a grey sky, an empty snow-covered field in the foreground giving way to a makeshift graveyard where rickety wooden crosses stand humbly against the elements. For all its epic scale, it is an affecting image of the kind of quiet human dignity that survives in even the most extreme circumstances. In another arresting image, a statue of a young woman gazes from atop a rust-brown rock across a vast sea, a relic of another time, when all this secrecy and disregard for human life went hand-in-hand with Soviet military might. With one leg and her arms now missing, she looks like something created by Marc Quinn and, in her imperfect way, stands as a symbol of the damaged land around here as well as the damaged political thinking that sacrificed its own citizens in its frenzy to create the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. These sublimely beautiful ruins are haunted and haunting, derelict monuments to a long winter of mutual enmity between Russia and the west that, of late, no longer seems so distant or, indeed, unreal.

In recent days, however, the struggle has been to cool down a standoff on the ill-defined and disputed border with China. More than 200 soldiers of the People&apos;s Liberation Army entered what India considers its territory last week and used cranes and bulldozers to build a 1.2-mile road, the Hindustan Times reported. Indian soldiers challenged the Chinese troops and asked them to withdraw, before demolishing a temporary track they had built, said the report, which has not been denied by Indian authorities. News of the confrontation broke a day before the arrival of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, in India, and has undermined official statements vaunting the goodwill between the two nations. Though similar incidents occur regularly along the 2,200-mile border, this new faceoff underlines the persistent tensions between the two emerging powers \u2013 even if both currently appear eager to improve a patchy relationship. China and India are keen to put a positive spin on Xi&apos;s first summit meeting with Narendra Modi, who won a landslide election victory to take power in Delhi in May. Xi will start his visit in Gujarat, the western state that Modi ran for 12 years and which is seen as a showcase for his policies for the nation. The two men are due to dine together with a handful of interpreters and selected aides in a specially constructed marquee erected on the newly refurbished riverfront in Gujarat&apos;s largest city, Ahmedabad. Wang Dehua, director of South and Central Asian studies at the Shanghai Municipal Centre for International Studies, said the visit \u2013 the first by a Chinese head of state to India in eight years \u2013 was likely to focus on economic cooperation, including investments in transport infrastructure and the creation of industrial zones. &quot;Japan offered their express [bullet] trains to India. But I think Chinese express trains are more competitive,&quot; he said. India&apos;s economic growth has flagged in recent years, and few commentators now talk of catching up with their regional rivals. This week several have noted that from economic parity in 1980, China&apos;s growth has outstripped India&apos;s fourfold. Others pointed out that since gaining independence from Britain in 1947 India has constructed 6,800 miles of railway track, while China added 8,700 miles in the five years to 2011. Modi is an admirer of China. The 64-year-old Hindu nationalist politician has talked of turning Gujarat into &quot;India&apos;s Guangdong&quot;. The state and the Chinese industrial powerhouse province are reportedly to be twinned formally this week. &quot;People have asked whether Modi is India&apos;s Deng Xiaoping,&quot; said Wang, referring to the Chinese leader who used Guangdong to pilot and power his country&apos;s economic transformation. China is now India&apos;s largest trading partner and bilateral trade currently stands at $65bn (\u00a340bn); the countries have set a target of $100bn by 2015. But Wang noted that India needed to close the rising deficit, which stood at $31bn last year. He said Beijing was also interested in maritime and &quot;southern Silk Road&quot; connections, especially an economic corridor across China, Burma, India and Bangladesh. Xi, who took power in 2012, arrives after touring the Maldives and Sri Lanka, two countries where growing Chinese influence has worried India. Delhi also has concerns about China&apos;s relationship with its hostile neighbour Pakistan and its growing role in Nepal. Beijing has been unsettled by Indian-US cooperation in the Asia Pacific region and Indian&apos;s stance on territorial disputes involving China and other nations in the South and East China Seas. Modi&apos;s apparent rapport with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, during a heavily publicised recent visit to Tokyo and his plans to meet Barack Obama later this month point to a carefully balanced approach to India&apos;s relations with world powers. Diplomats in Delhi say Modi is likely to balance his interest in other bigger players who can help with the transformation of India that he envisages with security concerns and a sharp sense of popular sentiment. &quot;It&apos;s complicated. On the one hand China is a great opportunity for investment and trade but any Indian will tell you that the big existential threat to their country is not Pakistan but China. That&apos;s the only superpower in the neighbourhood and one with which they have already fought a war,&quot; one diplomat said. That conflict, in 1962, ended in humiliating defeat for India. &quot;Let me assure you that our brave sentinels on the border will address any issue that happens on the border,&quot; said the foreign ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin. &quot;We are confident that our borders are in safe hands.&quot; He said Modi and Xi would discuss the ongoing border dispute this week. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 September 2014 because an earlier version said Ahmedabad was Gujarat&apos;s capital.

Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, said on a visit to Delhi that China would invest billions of dollars over the next five years in railways, industrial parks and, potentially, nuclear power in India. &quot;We can bring prosperity to Asia, and we can create opportunities for the world,&quot; Xi said during a ceremonial welcome at the presidential palace in the Indian capital before a meeting with Narendra Modi, India&apos;s newly elected prime minister. Modi claimed a landslide victory in May&apos;s elections after campaigning with a development agenda. The 64-year-old Hindu nationalist has often spoken of his admiration for the economic development achieved by China in recent decades and knows that his own country desperately needs a massive infusion of investment to improve its collapsing infrastructure. Experts said the amount pledged by Xi \u2013 $20bn (\u00a312bn) initially \u2013 was less than had been expected. &quot;It&apos;s disappointing. It did not match the hype created before the visit. There was even some rumours of $100bn being invested. This is $4bn a year, if it comes,&quot; said Srikant Kondapalli, an expert in India and China at Delhi&apos;s Jawaharlal Nehru University. Xi&apos;s visit to India started in the western state of Gujarat, which Modi ran for 12 years. The two men had dinner on Wednesday night in a tent set up on a redeveloped riverfront in the city of Ahmedabad. Trade between the two developing nations has increased rapidly in the last decade, reaching around $70bn last year, with China now India&apos;s largest trading partner. But India&apos;s trade deficit with China is already at about $40bn and there are fears that it could grow if China uses India as a dumping ground for cheap manufactured goods in the future. Despite the statements of goodwill, the visit has been overshadowed by a tense standoff in the Himalayas. Indian officials claim that hundreds of Chinese troops crossed the unmarked 2,200-mile mountain frontier between the two states last week. Modi told a press conference after the meeting with Xi: &quot;We need to ensure that there is peace along the border, and if there is, we can work together in mutual cooperation. If this happens we can realise true potential of our relations.&quot; Border incidents are common, though the timing of this confrontation has troubled observers. &quot;If some of the reports about the number of Chinese troops involved are true then it is the biggest mobilisation for a long time. It&apos;s not clear why. Perhaps there is some difference in the civil-military relationship and this is a message to Xi Jingping [from the military],&quot; Kondapalli said. Xi, who is only the third Chinese premier to visit India, described the border issue as a long-term problem. &quot;As the area is yet to be demarcated, there may be some incidents,&quot; he told reporters. Xi also said China would support India becoming a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a regional security body whose largest members are China and Russia. The relationship between the two regional powers is complex, with both looking for commercial advantages while mindful of core security concerns. One long-term irritation for Beijing is the presence of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader, in India. Despite tight security, dozens of Tibetan protesters held a noisy demonstration outside the building where the two leaders met on Thursday morning in central Delhi. Dorjee Tseten, of Students for a Free Tibet International, said: &quot;Xi Jinping is leading one of the most oppressive military offensives that Tibetans have faced in the past 50 years of China&apos;s occupation of our country.&quot; New Delhi had earlier asked the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet for India in 1959 and is considered a &quot;separatist&quot; by Beijing, to reschedule a conclave of religious leaders scheduled for this week in the capital so that it would not clash with the Chinese president&apos;s visit. The Tibetan leader says he seeks only greater autonomy for his homeland, and on Thursday he urged Xi to learn from India&apos;s democracy. &quot;I think the Chinese president should learn some of India&apos;s experience. Look, east India, south India, west India, north India, different language, different script. But no danger of separation,&quot; he said. &quot;Democratic rule, rule of law and free media \u2026&quot; In a column published in a local newspaper prior to his arrival, Xi said the &quot;Chinese dragon&quot; and the &quot;Indian elephant&quot; both cherished peace and shared one of the most dynamic and promising bilateral relations of the 21st century. Xi, who took power in 2012, arrives after touring the Maldives and Sri Lanka, two countries where growing Chinese influence has worried India. Delhi also has concerns about China&apos;s relationship with its hostile neighbour Pakistan and its growing role in Nepal. Beijing has been unsettled by Indian-US cooperation in the Asia Pacific region and Indian&apos;s stance on territorial disputes involving China and other nations in the South and East China Seas. Modi&apos;s efforts to build a rapport with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, during a heavily publicised recent visit to Tokyo and his plans to meet Barack Obama later this month point to a carefully balanced approach to India&apos;s relations with world powers.

It looks like a colony of mutant lifeforms has scuttled into Harrods\u2019 interiors department, which can only mean one thing: Zaha Hadid has taken on homewares. At the age of 63, the Iraqi-born architect has won every prize going, graced international power lists and erected buildings across the globe \u2013 and now she\u2019s making a bid for your dining table. Her collaborations beyond architecture have already stretched to extreme jewellery and improbable footwear, with knuckle-duster rings and a pair of shoes that look like metallic whirlwinds swirling around your ankles. She has designed a handbag for Fendi, vases for Lalique, and a perfume bottle for Donna Karan, as well as the obligatory luxury yacht \u2013 and even a raunchy range of swimwear, leading to rumours that she is starting her own fashion label (a suggestion hotly denied by her team). From Lacoste to Louis Vuitton, Alessi to Pharrell, everyone wants a piece of brand Zaha. But now she\u2019s cutting out the middle-man and doing it for herself.  \u201cWe\u2019ve done many different collaborations in the past,\u201d says Christian Gibbon, general manager of Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA). \u201cBut this is our own debut lifestyle collection. We\u2019re aiming for affordable pieces that can be bought on the high street, but which are also aspirational.\u201d Ranging from bone china cups (starting at \u00a338) to limited-edition serving platters (yours for \u00a39,999), the definition of affordable might be stretching it, but it\u2019s no doubt nothing out of the reach of regular Harrods shoppers \u2013 where the \u201ccapsule collection\u201d is on exclusive sale for the first month of its launch.     A snip at \u00a376 ... the Aqua placemat by ZHD homeware. Photograph: ZHD    The work of Zaha Hadid Design, one of seven companies registered in her name, and the branch of the office that handles interiors, products and exhibition design, the objects are the result of the practice\u2019s ongoing pursuit of fluid geometries and experimental organic structures. But in some ways it represents Hadid coming full circle. Like many young architects, she started out designing interiors in the 1980s, making side tables and sofas saturated with a Russian constructivist air, way before she began building. Following the trajectory of her architecture, this new collection is imbued with an interest in a much more supple language, Malevich shards exchanged for a voluptuous aesthetic of her own making. Although Gibbon insists that \u201cthey are not miniature buildings,\u201d the pieces nonetheless bear a definite family resemblance to recent projects, and many have been drawn from structures developed by the architect\u2019s in-house \u201ccode group\u201d, a kind of laboratory for producing alien forms. The Aqua platter \u2013 four teardrop swooshes that resemble the fanned petals of a bird of paradise flower \u2013 is based on a distorted version of London\u2019s Olympic Aquatics Centre, each tray flexing in a taut arc before coming to rest on three points, just like the building. CNC-milled from blocks of transparent acrylic, and hand-finished in Italy, they have an alluring jewel-like quality \u2013 which sadly evaporates when you touch them. Expecting the expensive ring of cast glass, you instead find the cheap rattle of a plastic picnic tray, which belies the \u00a310,000 price tag. Those on tighter budgets can make do with the Aqua acrylic placemat \u2013 a snip at \u00a376. Across the collection, the ghosts of Hadid\u2019s buildings begin to emerge. The closer you look, the more they start to form particular families, a mutant genealogy of creatures at different stages of evolution. They are like early embryonic forms of her buildings, plucked from the parametric womb before they have matured into fully fledged pieces of architecture, still slippery and gelatinous. It is as if, by some quirk of natural selection, the siblings were separated before birth \u2013 one went on to become an Olympic swimming pool, the other was destined to hold nuts and olives. One will soon be a skyscraper in Asia, while its stunted sibling will hold your scented candle in the downstairs loo.     Like the skyline of Shanghai squaring up to Dubai... the Field of Towers chess set by ZHD homeware.

For \u00a34,860, you can do battle with your very own armies of Zaha Hadid skyscrapers, the double rows of twisting totems facing off across the board, like the skyline of Shanghai squaring up to Dubai. There is a range of scented candles (a personal Zaha favourite) housed in blocky ceramic holders, modelled on the base of a tower proposed for Miami. As if squeezed into a futuristic corset, the building will braced by a concrete exoskeleton of bifurcating flow lines. When scaled down to tabletop size, the form recalls the entwined tendrils of art nouveau styling, with a slightly sinister sci-fi air \u2013 Victor Horta meets HR Giger on a dark night.

Hadid already has several, and it turns out they provide a useful indicator to her employees. \u201cZaha loves scented candles,\u201d says one designer. \u201cIf you smell a candle in the office, you know she\u2019s coming.\u201d For a practice whose work is so focused on the production of novel forms, it appears that the product-development line provides a useful scale of experimentation, before multi-millions are invested in buildings. \u201cArchitecture takes years and years to produce, but with products you can get something to market within a year,\u201d says Maha Kutay, co-director of the design team. \u201cAll the pieces are designed by architects, and it can provide a rejuvenating break from the monotony of working on a building.\u201d     Slightly sinister sci-fi air? The Prime Orientscented candle, \u00a3299, by ZHD homeware. Photograph: ZHD    In some ways it recalls the approach of the master architects of yore, from Frank Lloyd Wright and Arne Jacobsen, to Alvar Aalto and Eero Saarinen, who enjoyed a megalomanic control over every detail, each project conceived as a gesamtkunstwerk, from the door handle to the city block. It might seem like an unlikely return to such times, but there is increasing demand from clients, particularly in Asia, for Hadid to extend her attentions beyond the jazzy envelope of the building down to the interiors and furniture. In the case of ZHA\u2019s new homewares collection, however, it seems to be a process of reverse-engineering, scaling down her architectural proposals into trinkets. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge trying to adapt the structural language of a building into something the size of a piece of furniture,\u201d says Wandy Mulia, an architect who worked on the design of the Radia stools, little munchkin seats sprayed with sparkling car paint, which are based on another tower design. It makes you wonder if the extreme formal language of Planet Zaha isn\u2019t better suited to the tabletop, where there is less to go wrong, freed from the critical realities of context and function. Perhaps these sweeping sinews are more appropriate for the privacy of the devoted fan\u2019s living room, rather than imposed on the skyline for all to endure. They are the kind of bijou sculptural experiments that may work better when elegantly perched on a shelf, rather than forcefully lumbering across an urban block.

Behind the glamour and gloss, however, there was discernible anxiety that the mighty Chinese consumer, responsible for one third of luxury goods and fashion sales, is not living up to expectation as a consumer of fashion and bling \u2013 and could even be developing a resistance to ostentatious western brands. Leading luxury conglomerates, including LVMH (Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton) and Kering, owner of Gucci, as well as brands like Prada \u2013 which sent models down the catwalk wearing its spring/summer 2015 collection in Milan on Thursday \u2013 are reporting disappointing financial results, and have pointed their collective finger at China, where growth in the luxury goods market has slowed to 2% after rising 30% in 2011. Analysts warn that after years of chasing Chinese consumers, domestically and as voracious luxury shoppers in foreign capitals, the big brands may be no closer to understanding the market. With analysts warning that shares in luxury brands could fall as prominent investors dump stock, the fashion industry is seeking answers to the riddle of China&apos;s luxury consumer. &quot;China was everyone&apos;s dream but it&apos;s proved a lot more difficult than anyone expected,&quot; says HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg and author of The Bling Dynasty: Why the Reign of Chinese Luxury Shoppers Has Only Just Begun. In response to a government corruption crackdown that has curbed the practice of &quot;gifting&quot;, wealthy Chinese consumers are reported to be wary of wearing visibly branded clothes. Resistance to bling, says Rambourg, has harmed brands including Gucci, which showed in Milan on Wednesday, and Louis Vuitton \u2013 labels young consumers associate with their mothers. Without a radical shift in perception, changing patterns of consumption are unlikely to improve the outlook. In less than a decade, Chinese luxury consumers will be on average 10 years younger than their European counterparts and more than 15 years younger than consumers in the US. If projections hold, Chinese shoppers will account for more than half of all luxury sales by 2025. Chinese consumers have developed sophisticated sensibilities more rapidly than western brand managers anticipated. &quot;It&apos;s what I call the French paradox, says Rambourg. &quot;If you are a niche brand, everyone wants you. If you are a big brand, then by selling more you compromise a sense of exclusivity and the notion of luxury itself.&quot; Nor are Chinese consumers necessarily impressed by a luxury label alone. Raw material quality can be seen as a more important attribute than branding or fancy designs, Rambourg notes. &quot;They&apos;re not only much younger and super-demanding, they&apos;re also extremely well informed. If you&apos;re complacent and don&apos;t communicate the way they communicate, it&apos;s going to be difficult.&quot; In the early years of China&apos;s love affair with luxury, Chinese visitors to foreign capitals could be relied on to shop without restraint. Shoppers, often male, bought for their friends and relatives. Steep markups for products sold in China led to the growth of &quot;haiwai daigou&quot;, or overseas personal shoppers, estimated to be worth $12bn annually. Now, even as more Chinese travel abroad, they&apos;re spending less or choosing different destinations. Tax-refund claims by Chinese tourists in Europe grew 18% last year, compared with 57% in 2012. &quot;Hong Kong was cool. Western Europe was cool. But neither are true any more. The Chinese travelling abroad ditched Japan two years ago. So now they&apos;re discovering the US and US brands.&quot; At home, Chinese shoppers \u2013 now more likely to be female \u2013 are balking at paying inflated prices, often 50% higher than abroad. Retailers have begun to discount but analysts warn of the risk of training consumers to wait for price cuts before buying, often impulsively, items they don&apos;t want. Brands benefiting from the shift in perceptions include Burberry. &quot;They&apos;re the only legitimate global British brand competing against a sea of French and Italian brands. Its phenomenal appeal is linked to an association with Britishness and rock and roll rebelliousness,&quot; says Rambourg. The industry is taking corrective measures to rekindle the love of Chinese consumers. Last week, the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York announced that next May&apos;s fundraising ball at its new Anna Wintour Costume Centre will celebrate the influence of China on fashion, film and art. The chosen theme of the party, sometimes called the Oscars of fashion, offers a clear signal to designers to direct their research toward Chinese history and design. With the Chinese actress Gong Li and Wendi Deng, the ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, selected as co-hosts, and Wong Kar-Wai, director of the epic In The Mood For Love as artistic director, fashion could be about to have a Chinese moment. Luxury-brand managers will no doubt be hoping Chinese consumers will reciprocate the love. &quot;If they only try to mimic, consumers will know it&apos;s not genuine,&quot; warns Rambourg. As last week&apos;s $160bn public offering of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba shows, faith in Chinese consumerism remains strong. When the French brand Herm\u00e8s opened a substantial new store in Shanghai this month, chief executive Axel Dumas said the brand was still doing well. &quot;We are very, very confident about the Chinese market. People are now buying for themselves, there is also a refinement, a knowledge of what is luxury.&quot;", "tags": ["Fashion", "Luxury goods sector", "China", "Milan fashion week Spring Summer 2015 (autumn 2014 shows)", "Gucci", "Prada"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-20T23:05:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/22/yoshiko-yamaguchi", "sentences": ["Having depicted on screen Chinese women falling for members of the Japanese occupation forces, she read in the newspapers that she was to be publicly executed at Shanghai&apos;s horse track.", "It was films such as this that were produced as evidence for the prosecution in Shanghai.", "Up to the end of the war, Shanghai periodicals doted on the persona of Li Xianglan.", "Taking daily English and Russian lessons in Shanghai, Li was better equipped than most to deal with the defeat of her native Japan, but being put on trial for her roles seems to have come as a genuine shock."], "title": "Yoshiko Yamaguchi obituary", "article": "Filmic evidence has often been produced in war trials, but Li Xianglan, who has died aged 94, had the distinction, in 1945, of being prosecuted for treason in China for the fictional roles she had played. Having depicted on screen Chinese women falling for members of the Japanese occupation forces, she read in the newspapers that she was to be publicly executed at Shanghai&apos;s horse track. Then, as if in the plot of a baroque opera \u2013 a genre that would have suited her vocally \u2013 her family register was smuggled in, within the head of a doll. The document proved that Li had been born Yamaguchi Yoshiko, the daughter of Japanese parents in Manchuria, a colony of Japan before the second world war. Yamaguchi became one of millions to be repatriated to the main Japanese islands. But her singing talent, fame, and ability with languages was to propel her through careers in journalism and politics. When their daughter was born, Yamaguchi&apos;s parents had befriended two influential Chinese men; the girl became their goddaughter and so also acquired the Chinese name Li Xianglan. Her musical talent was developed by lessons with professional singers, often Russian. From the age of 13 and using another Chinese name bestowed upon her, Pan Shuhua, she attended high school in Beijing. Here she added to her proficiency in Mandarin \u2013 unusual enough among Japanese settlers \u2013 by acquiring all the mannerisms of Chinese girls. In 1934, recruited by a radio station to sing Chinese tunes, she used her adopted name of Li Xianglan, which she retained as her career developed. By the age of 18, she had been recruited by Manchuria Film Productions, or Man&apos;ei, the rapidly expanding film studio in Harbin, Manchuria. The initial idea had been for her to sing, but Man&apos;ei rapidly realised that it could develop her acting and personality to further its transnational aims. The problem for the commercially minded propagandists at Man&apos;ei was that its early films had little success in China, with films such as China Nights (1940) faring much better in Japan. The three Chinese characters of her stage name rendered into Japanese as Ri Koran, the performer always appeared in a Chinese qipao dress, and her recordings launched a craze for &quot;continental&quot; songs and films. Back in China, the film, where it was not boycotted entirely, caused particular offence by showing the star taking a violent slap from her Japanese admirer as a proof of affection, resulting in marriage in short order. It was films such as this that were produced as evidence for the prosecution in Shanghai. In reality, virtually no one had seen them, even after the considerable Chinese success of her later film Eternity (1942), from which came her hit song Stop Smoking, about opium. Up to the end of the war, Shanghai periodicals doted on the persona of Li Xianglan. Li&apos;s Japanese origin was never entirely obscured, even though the star continued to represent China&apos;s young women. Taking daily English and Russian lessons in Shanghai, Li was better equipped than most to deal with the defeat of her native Japan, but being put on trial for her roles seems to have come as a genuine shock. Back in Tokyo, her fame still lay in her persona as Ri Koran. The script of Desertion at Dawn (1950), initially an adaptation by Akira Kurosawa, went through six major rewrites under occupation censorship. Strongly condemning militarism, it depicted the love of a Japanese soldier for a Chinese &quot;comfort woman&quot;. Its success at the box office prompted further nostalgic musical memories of the empire that were less nuanced as the moral crusade of the occupation had dissolved. But Yamaguchi went on to star in a Kurosawa film, Scandal (1950), which dealt with the media-hounding of an actress. Yamaguchi travelled to the US that year, taking the first name Shirley. She starred in two Hollywood films, and befriended figures such as Charlie Chaplin, working on the musical soundtrack of Limelight (1952). Her marriage to the American sculptor Noguchi Isamu in 1952 lasted only a few years, and she was later denied entry to the US because of her association with names such as Chaplin. Her final acting appearances came in some Hong Kong films, apparently lost in a fire. By this time, she had married a Japanese diplomat, Otaka Hiroshi; formally, she kept her married name Otaka Yoshiko after his death in 2001. To later generations in the 1960s and 70s she was known as a television journalist on Asian subjects, often focusing on Palestine and women&apos;s issues. She pursued these concerns as a representative of the upper house of the Japanese legislative body, the Diet, for 18 years. A musical of her career ran in Tokyo for more than 20 years. Her voice may yet be her most enduring legacy. Recordings from Russia, seemingly acquired and treasured by postwar Red Army soldiers, can be heard on YouTube, and testify to a voice that hits every note in the middle, without a hint of vibrato. \u2022 Yoshiko Yamaguchi (Li Xianglan), actor, journalist and politician, born 12 February 1920; died 7 September 2014", "tags": ["World cinema", "Film", "China", "World news", "Japan", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-22T16:17:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/23/london-overtakes-hong-kong-worlds-most-expensive-city", "sentences": ["Sydney came eighth at $63,630, Shanghai tenth at $43,171 and Rio eleventh at $32,179."], "title": "London overtakes Hong Kong as world\u2019s most expensive city", "article": "London has overtaken Hong Kong as the world\u2019s most expensive city to live and work in, with a new study suggesting it is almost twice as pricey as Sydney, and four times more than Rio de Janeiro. The estate agent Savills said that in London, rising rents and the strong pound had pushed up the typical cost per individual employee of renting somewhere to live and leasing office space to $120,000 (\u00a373,800) a year. That puts the UK capital well ahead of other global hubs such as New York and Paris which, aside from Hong Kong, are the only other locations where the combined annual costs of renting residential and office space top $100,000 per employee. London\u2019s rise to first place in the rankings was blamed in part on its soaring property prices, which have jumped by 18.4% in the past year, according to Savills. Office rents have also risen significantly. In its most recent quarterly report on the commercial property sector, the rival estate agent Knight Frank said that over the previous 12 months, prime office rents had risen by 9% in the City and by 8% in the West End area. Someone with \u20ac100m to spend would be able to buy just 2,700 square metres of prime office space in the West End, but would get 17,000 square metres or more for their money in Berlin or Amsterdam. The pound\u2019s strength against the dollar has made the situation worse. According to the Savills study, London\u2019s overall real estate costs grew in US dollar terms by an annualised rate of 10.6% in the first six months of the year, making the it \u201cthe world\u2019s most expensive city for companies to locate employees\u201d. That in turn prompted Savills to warn that it risks becoming less competitive as a result. \u201cFor example, the availability of low-cost office space in and around Silicon roundabout, coupled with affordable residential accommodation, helped put the capital on the technology map. But gentrification has priced out new startups, and the vitality of central London locations are at risk as they become too expensive for the types of occupiers that made them attractive in the first place,\u201d the report said. By contrast, falling residential rents and a weakening currency contributed to Hong Kong, which had previously topped the table for five years running, dropping to second place. Savills\u2019 12 Cities report is designed to help companies assess the costs of relocating employees. It measures the total cost per employee in US dollars of renting living and working space in some of the world\u2019s global hubs. The calculations are based on the cost of two seven-strong staff teams that are representative of start-up businesses, one based in a \u201cprime financial sector location\u201d and the other in a slightly less prime or creative area, in order to give a representative figure. The annual per person cost of renting somewhere to live is also factored in, on the basis that employers are interested in these costs because upward pressure on wages may be stronger in areas where the cost of accommodation is high. The annual cost per employee in London was put at $120,568, with Hong Kong close behind at $115,717. New York and Paris were in third and fourth place, at $107,782 and $105,550 respectively. Sydney came eighth at $63,630, Shanghai tenth at $43,171 and Rio eleventh at $32,179. Mumbai was bottom of the table at $29,742. \u201cDespite its climb in the rankings from fifth to first place since 2008, London is still a way off the live/work accommodation costs record, set by Hong Kong in 2011 at $128,000 a year,\u201d Savills said, adding that Hong Kong was still \u201cby far the most expensive city\u201d in which to buy residential property, with prices 40% higher than London \u2013 although the gap was narrowing. \u201cComparatively affordable\u201d Rio and Sydney had seen significant increases in live/work costs since 2008 \u2013 up 85% and 58% respectively \u2013 but Savills said Rio still looked \u201chighly competitive\u201d. Yolande Barnes, the company\u2019s director of world research, said: \u201cThis year has seen much more modest real estate price growth in nearly all our world cities, and some have shown small falls. We expect this subdued trend to continue as investor interest and market activity shifts to second-tier cities. \u201cThis lower level of price growth means that currency fluctuations have produced some of the biggest changes in our rankings, which are expressed in dollar terms. For multinationals looking at their local costs, it is this which is likely to exercise them more than property markets over the next year.\u201d Beauty at a price Hong Kong is a beautiful city, a sub-tropical forest of gleaming skyscrapers set against a backdrop of turquoise water and verdant hills. Its beauty, however, comes at a price. Asia\u2019s financial capital is one of the world\u2019s wealthiest cities and one of its most densely-populated. Its 7 million residents share 1,104 sq km of space - London\u2019s 8.3 million share almost half as much space again - and the combination has created a nightmare scenario for the city\u2019s frugal flat-hunters. Even modest Hong Kong homes can sell for millions of pounds, and an average family can easily spend 50% of its income on accommodation. One developer recently listed the world\u2019s most expensive home by square foot: a \u00a364m, four-bedroom mountaintop abode featuring a private pool and rooftop terrace. Wealthy locals and mainland Chinese trade Hong Kong apartments as readily as many westerners do shares, and a speculative buying spree has caused prices to double since 2009. Rising living costs have been cataclysmic for the city\u2019s working class. About 170,000 people don\u2019t have apartments of their own, and some live in cage-like cubicles in mercilessly subdivided flats. Some of the city\u2019s pleasures, however, still come cheap. A ferry ride across Victoria harbour offers sweeping skyline views for no more than 60p, and a short metro ride costs less than \u00a31. An unpretentious street lunch - a bowl of wonton soup, some Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce - costs about \u00a34, inexpensive by western standards, but twice as much as a similar meal in Shenzhen, just across the border in China.

Speaking on the fringes of Climate Week in New York, Eduardo Paes said: \u201cThey should have more autonomy, it would make a difference.\u201d Most cities are subject to regulations and policy set at the national level, which can fail to take account of their individual needs and characteristics, he said. \u201cNational governments make decisions but do not consider what cities are doing [on energy and climate] and therefore do not properly support cities,\u201d he argued. That can also result in a lack of financing for cities to be able to make vital changes, such as improving energy efficiency and public transport, he said. In many countries, mayors of large cities have extensive powers, including over policing, transport, building and large aspects of health and education. But energy policy is usually dictated by national governments, with cities having little say in how their residents and businesses are powered. Paes, who hosted the 2012 environmental conference Rio+20 and is chair of the C40 group of cities which have pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change, added: \u201cCities need to work with national governments and regional governments on this. Cities have the capability to cut global emissions by 3 gigatonnes, our research has found - this is a big opportunity.\u201d As part of Climate Week, which kicked off on Sunday with a 300,000-strong march through New York and similar marches around the world, the C40 group presented its annual prizes to cities that have come up with innovative ways to improve the environment. Among the ten awards were two for London, on air quality and carbon accounting. The former was criticised by green campaigners as the UK\u2019s capital has a record of breaching EU air quality standards. Other winners included China\u2019s Shenzen, for urban transportation, and Seoul for green energy, Amsterdam for finance and economic development, and Barcelona for intelligent city infrastructure. Paes said the examples of cities performing well should inspire others. \u201cI am confident that their knowledge and experience will help drive other cities to implement on-the-ground solutions faster and more efficiently. Through cooperation and collaboration, cities continue to deliver the results that are having a global impact.\u201d More than half of the world\u2019s population live in cities, and they produce the majority of greenhouse gas emissions.  City residents are also among those likely to face the perils of climate change, including rising sea levels - many major cities, from London and New York to Shanghai, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro are built by the sea - and the threat of major rainfall and extreme weather. Often, city infrastructure - including power networks, sewage and drainage systems, telecommunications and transport - has been built to old specifications that may not reflect the stresses they could be put under if global warming proceeds rapidly. The vulnerability of even modern, rich and industrialised cities to extreme weather was illustrated when Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, overwhelming much of the infrastructure in the areas worst affected. \u2022 Fiona Harvey\u2019s travel to New York was paid for by Siemens, one of the sponsors of the C40 awards.", "tags": ["Climate change", "Cities", "Environment", "Energy", "Energy efficiency", "Brazil"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-24T16:15:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/24/andy-murray-atp-world-tour-finals", "sentences": ["The Shanghai Masters, a 1,000-pointer, starts on 5 October and, depending on his results over the next fortnight, Murray will be tempted to squeeze that on to his schedule."], "title": "Andy Murray must win the yes vote on the court after political dabbling | Kevin Mitchell", "article": "Andy Murray is in trouble \u2013 not with the English, nor with his mum, but in that ever-swirling shark tank that houses the player rankings. If Britain\u2019s finest tennis player for seven decades doesn\u2019t drag himself back into the world top 10 in the concluding stages of an arduous season, he could be spending the second week of November with his feet up at home in Surrey watching the best players of the calendar year competing for the last trophy of 2014 in the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. After Novak Djokovic put him out of the US Open, Murray said the prospect of missing his home finale \u2013 for which he has qualified seven years in a row, although he missed 2013 because of his back operation \u2013 does not unduly worry him. It should, and it surely does. For the first time in six years, he trails the game\u2019s leading pack waiting for a break. It has been a rough few days for Murray after his decision to share his thoughts on Scottish Independence last week, so distance will lend a little enchantment as he goes hunting for precious ranking points in the minor 250 event in Shenzhen, a teeming economic powerhouse of 15 million people just north of Hong Kong (twinned with Hull and Rotherham, as it happens). He will remind himself and others what he does best when he steps back on court on Thursday in the second round after a bye, against Somdev Devvarman, and, if he manages to avoid commenting on the merits or otherwise of Alibaba.com and its recent float on the New York Stock Exchange, he will consider he has returned to his proper environment. Devvarman is 130 players adrift of Murray in the rankings. Logic says the Indian Davis Cupper (who shared his country\u2019s sportsman of the year award with Sachin Tendulkar in 2011) should not detain the double slam winner long. But who can be sure? Murray has hit a couple of stunning peaks since returning to the Tour in January after his back operation a year ago, but he is still searching for consistency, and three times against quality opponents \u2013 Rafael Nadal in Rome, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Toronto and Roger Federer in Cincinnati \u2013 he has blown handy leads. He has not won a title since Wimbledon last year \u2013 and, whatever his sangfroid, that worries him. For the first time, China will host three of the non-major categories of ATP events: 250, 500 and Masters 1000 in three weeks, and Murray will be in two of them, moving on next week to Beijing, where 500 points are on offer in the China Open. And the field is commensurately stronger, featuring Djokovic, Nadal, the US Open champion Marin Cilic, Tomas Berdych, Grigor Dimitrov, Ernests Gulbis and Fabio Fognini. The Shanghai Masters, a 1,000-pointer, starts on 5 October and, depending on his results over the next fortnight, Murray will be tempted to squeeze that on to his schedule. A measure of his concern is reflected in his late acceptance of a wildcard in Shenzhen, having stated firmly in New York he would not add to his workload simply to make it to London in November. His 2014 record is reasonable \u2013 38-15 and 22-9 on hard courts. If he wins this week, he\u2019ll get a straight addition of 250 points and would move up to No 10, just 35 points behind Milos Raonic, but this is the tightest race. The defending champion Djokovic, Federer and Nadal have qualified, and, realistically, the contest for the remaining five places, in January-to-December ranking order, is between the Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka, Cilic, US Open finalist Kei Nishikori, David Ferrer, Berdych, Raonic, Dimitrov, Murray, Tsonga and Gulbis. Recent history is not on Murray\u2019s side. While it is impossible to judge a points cut-off for the World Tour Finals, the ATP\u2019s chief statistician, Greg Sharko, says: \u201cThe last players to qualify [from] outside the Top 10 after the US Open were Frenchmen Gilles Simon and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in 2008. They were No15 and No18, respectively.\u201d While Berdych, in eighth place, is the target for the others at the moment, he has more points already (3,510) than three of the previous five last-place qualifiers. That list reads Wawrinka (3,730), Tsonga (3,490), Fish (2,875), Andy Roddick (3,665) and Fernando Verdasco (3,300) in 2009, when the event moved to London. Those are just the numbers. The tough-to-read part of the equation is what each of the still-standing candidates has left in the tank at the end of another demanding season. Nishikori surprised everyone with his stamina at Flushing Meadows, while Wawrinka, normally so durable, looked underdone there. Ferrer is never far away from major points but still struggles to get over the line. Berdych has been steady, Raonic vastly improved and Dimitrov a little disappointing after a good start, while Tsonga and Gulbis have been as mercurial as ever. So Murray needs only to rediscover some of his old zest to make inroads in this field. The points on offer in Shenzhen are small, but a victory would carry greater significance. It would signal a revival of his spirits at the business end of a tournament, something we took for granted only a year ago.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "ATP World Tour Finals", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-24T17:09:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/canada-man-smuggle-turtles-groin-us-border", "sentences": ["Lin was bound for Shanghai."], "title": "Canadian man caught trying to smuggle 51 live turtles under his clothes", "article": "A Canadian man taped 51 live turtles to his legs and groin and tried to hide them under sweatpants in an attempt to smuggle the reptiles over the Detroit border crossing, according to federal prosecutors in Michigan.  The man was captured as part of a surveillance operation conducted by US Fish and Wildlife Service agents. An official with the service said there has been an increase in turtle smuggling in the last year, which they attribute to demand in Asian food and collector markets.  \u201cThese turtles, by the time they get to the end-collector, they can be worth anywhere from $1,300 to $1,500 a turtle,\u201d said Ed Grace, deputy chief law enforcement officer with the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  Prosecutors say Kai Xu and Lihua Lin attempted to smuggle several species of North American pond turtles out of the US and into Canada.  On 5 August, two fish and wildlife agents say they watched Xu disappear behind two semi-trailers in a Detroit parking lot for about 10 minutes before reappearing with, \u201cirregularly shaped bulges under Xu\u2019s sweatpants on both legs\u201d.  Xu was later stopped by Canadian border patrol after he drove through the Detroit to Windsor, Ontario crossing. Xu\u2019s attorney, Timothy Debolski of Garden City, Michigan, said it\u2019s too early to comment on Xu\u2019s case. Agents said they were tipped off by a Detroit UPS employee identified only as \u201cDave\u201d, who alerted agents to a seven pound box labeled \u201clive fish keep cool\u201d.  In an indictment of Lin, agents said they surveilled Xu as he drove Lin to the Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Tuesday. Lin was bound for Shanghai. He checked two bags, in which fish and wildlife agents say they found more than 200 live turtles, including the protected spotted turtle. Fish and wildlife service agents say turtles are far from the only North American animals targeted by poachers. A spokesman for the fish and wildlife office, Gavin Shire, said agents sometimes find hummingbirds smuggled in wigs, and that rattlesnakes and Gila Monsters are also popular prey for smugglers.  \u201cNot just with turtles, I see it with ginseng, I see it with how wildlife in the United States can be, you know, coveted by collectors or for food markets,\u201d said Grace.  Both men were indicted on illegal smuggling charges and violations of the endangered species act. The turtles were seized by fish and wildlife agents.

The owners had installed a glass cabinet in which mobile-phone handsets going back 20 years were arranged as ornaments \u2013 great bricks of black plastic with their antennas protruding, surrounded by artfully arranged fake flowers. It was surprisingly moving. Mr and Mrs Zhen were not trying to be fashionable with this display \u2013 or rather, they may well have been aiming for that effect, but they weren\u2019t doing it to subvert the idea of bourgeois display-case values. The fascination with old technology is a well-documented trope of hipster style, signaling authenticity, hilarity and, of course, bloody-minded perversity, but there are more genuine affections for bits of old tech that do not come with ironic window dressing or obvious research or typewriters in a newsroom. Part of this nostalgia is a straightforward yearning for the days when tech didn\u2019t get more complicated that the on/off button and maybe an alarm clock. We live in a world in which the Apple store runs classes on how to use your telephone, so simplicity can seem like a good thing: owning a device that is not, nor will forever remain, nine-tenths mysterious to you. Partly it\u2019s that old tech is a non-smell version of the Proustian trigger, that can bring in with it former versions of yourself: the car-phone, with its curly wire and satellite-phone bulk that your ancestors used to to call home; the video remote control attached by cable to the VHS mothership \u2013 we actually had one of those, which a snarky school friend with a real remote mocked and I defended as being even better than the cordless variety because you didn\u2019t have to point it at the device for it to work. The cable took care of that!            Texas Instruments, which is still selling millions of clunky calculators, was on to something with Speak &amp; Spell, so reassuring in its three colors and three settings that it was nothing if not an early version of the iPad. I bought an Etch A Sketch for a toddler the other day and nearly cried. You can, of course, buy replica Speak &amp; Spells now, as well as t-shirts with the image of one imprinted upon it. New technology has been harnessed to realize the desire for old tech, so that you can attach an old manual typewriter, via USB cable, to a modern computer screen \u2013 something that only exists, surely, to be commented on rather than used. Other gimmicks include Hanx Writer, Tom Hanks\u2019s typewriting app, which turns your iPad into something with the clacks and hammer strokes of an old manual typewriter. There\u2019s probably an equivalent in the App Store for vinyl records, and even the unloved cassette tape is far enough back in time now to be having its moment; a friend of mine has an oil painting \u2013 an oil painting! \u2013 of an old mix tape with handwritten songs on the jacket hanging framed above the bed on his wall. (Things one assumes won\u2019t ever have a comeback: fax machines; interim technologies like the MiniDisc; the video cassette tape; and the clam-shell phone, which used to be cool and now looks like a suppository.)     New technology takes over slowly, but doesn\u2019t last very long.

The region has been named Best Culinary Destination (large international) in the magazine\u2019s 2014 Culinary Travel Awards. \u201cThe hallmark cuisine of the city is emphatically Cantonese,\u201d writes the magazine, and of course any visitor should try the excellent Cantonese restaurants (my current favourites are The Boss and The Chairman, both in Central). But Hong Kong also offers a good number of cuisines from the mainland. Because of the large number of Chiu Chow, Shanghainese and Hakka people living here, it\u2019s always been fairly easy to find restaurants serving those cuisines. But as the Special Administrative Region receives more Chinese tourists from across the border, restaurants have opened serving authentic versions of the heartier and spicier dishes from places such as Beijing, Sichuan and Hunan that are not toned down (as they previously were) for local tastes. Here are 10 regional cuisines you\u2019ll find in Hong Kong, and the restaurants to try them in. Shanghainese The cuisine of Shanghai is commonly described as being rich and oily, with a lot of heavy brown sauces, although it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be that way. One of their most famous dishes is xiao long bao \u2013 also known as soup dumplings \u2013 which, if done right, are small, light and delicate. Also light (in texture, though not in flavour) are the famous drunken dishes, made by immersing cooked meat (chicken is the most popular) in rice wine mixed with other flavourings, and leaving it to infuse for at least a day. At Shanghai Lu Yang Cun Restaurant, start with several cold dishes, choosing them for their mix of flavours and textures, such as drunken chicken, pressed spice beef shin, fine shreds of bean curd skin with fresh soybeans, mashed soybeans flavoured with sesame oil and preserved vegetables, and jellied ham terrine. Proceed to main courses such as tiny river shrimps cooked with tea leaves, braised pork shoulder, lion\u2019s head meatballs (so called because the pork meatballs are cooked with Chinese cabbage leaves, which are said to resemble a lion\u2019s mane) and stir-fried rice cakes. If it\u2019s winter, be sure to try one of the hairy crab dishes. The crustaceans, eaten primarily for their rich roe, are either steamed and served whole with brown vinegar and slivers of ginger, or the meat and roe are taken from the shell and served with noodles, rice or beancurd. Be warned, though, Shanghai crab is expensive. \u2022 Shanghai Lu Yang Cun Restaurant, 11/F World Trade Centre, 280 Gloucester Road, Causeway Bay, +852 2881 6669. About HK$300 (around \u00a324) per person (much more expensive if you order hairy crab) Chiu Chow     Chao Hui Guan, Hong Kong. Photograph: http://chaohuiguan.com    A Chiu Chow (also Teochew) meal will begin and end with tiny cups of strong kung fu tea, which cleanse the palate and help to promote digestion. The cuisine, from the Chaoshan region in Guangdong province, is light but flavourful, and is known for its braised master sauce dishes, especially goose and bean curd, which are served tepid or warm, and eaten with a white vinegar dipping sauce. At Chao Hui Guan, the lu shui (master sauce), goose intestines and thick slices of fatty goose liver are especially good. I also like the fresh small oysters that are cooked with eggs and starch to make an omelette that is drizzled with fish sauce (a fairly common seasoning in the cuisine), or simmered with rice, preserved vegetables and broth for congee. The raw and cooked seafood dishes are also delicious \u2013 although in the case of steamed flower crab, can be very expensive. Chiu Chow people like taro dishes, such as clay pot duck with taro, or de-boned, flattened cooked duck that\u2019s coated with mashed taro before being deep-fried \u2013 though not everyone appreciates the heavy sweet-savoury taro desserts. Pan-fried noodle cake served with sugar and vinegar is another classic sweet-savoury Chiu Chow dish that this restaurant does well.\u2022 Federal Mansion, 544-554 Fuk Wing Street, Cheung Sha Wan, +852 2682 9118. About HK$200 (\u00a316) per person Hakka Historically the Hakkas were the nomads of China: their name means \u201cguest families\u201d, because they migrated from central China to other parts of the mainland (and later many other countries in the world). The cuisine is hearty and strong, and because of the need to preserve food for their travels, salted, cured and pickled vegetables and meats are commonly used. Tofu in its many incarnations (fresh, pressed, preserved and dried) is another popular ingredient. At Chuen Cheung Kui, try the salt-baked chicken, steamed bean curd stuffed with pork, and steamed pork belly with either preserved mustard greens or thick slices of taro. \u2022 7/F-8/F Phase 1, Causeway Bay Plaza 1, 489 Hennessy Road, Causeway Bay, +852 2577 3833.

About HK$150 (\u00a312) per person Sichuan The cuisine of Sichuan province, south-west China, is best known for its ma la flavours \u2013 the numbing (ma) sensation that comes from Sichuan peppercorns, and spicy (la) from the many types of chillies \u2013 fresh, dried, preserved \u2013 that are used and made into sauces. But a good Sichuan meal won\u2019t be one-dimensionally tongue burning; the judicious use of other seasonings such as soy sauce, salt, sugar, vinegar and sesame oil or paste help to balance the flavours. Sichuan House is one of the newer Sichuan restaurants to open and the delicious food and excellent service has made it one of my favourites. Try the \u201cmouth-watering chicken\u201d (that\u2019s the actual translation of the dish\u2019s name), so called because it\u2019s so good it will get your saliva glands going), poached fish or beef in hot chilli oil, and the mapo doufu (tofu in chili and bean sauce). End the meal with caramelised apple or banana fritters. \u2022 7/F M88, 2 Wellington Street, Central, +852 2521 6699, sichuanhouse.com.hk. About HK$250 (\u00a320) per person Hunan The most obvious difference between food from Hunan province and that of nearby Sichuan is the near-absence of Sichuan peppercorns in the former. Most people know only of the spicy Hunan dishes, but the food can also be surprisingly light and delicate, or have an assertive smokiness from preserved meats. At Caf\u00e9 Hunan, the innocuous-sounding stir-fried potatoes with hot and sour sauce proves to be the spiciest, while yin yang fish head \u2013 completely covered on one side with yellow chillies and on the other with red ones \u2013 looks incendiary but is actually relatively mild. Also try the stir-fried pork with Youxian dried bean curd, and stir-fried baby chicken. \u2022 CKoon Wah Building, 420-424 Queen\u2019s Road West, Sheung Wan, +852 2803 7177.

Photograph: facebook.com/PUTIEN.RESTAURANT    As you\u2019d expect from a coastal province, the cuisine of Fujian places an emphasis on seafood. The province, on the south-east coast, is quite fertile, and the temperature is mostly mild, which means many vegetables and fruits thrive there. Putien (a variation on the spelling of the Fujian city of Putian) in Causeway Bay is the first Hong Kong branch of a Singapore-based chain. The so-called oyster omelette is more like oyster fritters, with lots of the small, plump bivalves in a light coating. Baked bamboo clams have a hint of Sichuan peppercorn, and are fresh and sweet. If you like innards and extremities, be sure to try the braised pig intestine and the fried pig\u2019s trotters. \u2022 7/F Lee Theatre Plaza, 99 Percival Street, Causeway Bay, +852 2111 8080, putien.com About HK$200 (\u00a316) per person  Yunnan Yunnan province, in the far south-west of China, is famous for its air-dried ham, which is intense and salty, and its huge variety of mushrooms, including Chinese black truffles, porcini, morels and chanterelles. The province\u2019s most famous dish is almost certainly crossing the bridge noodles, which, legend has it, got its name because a devoted wife brought the noodles across the bridge to where her husband-scholar was studying for exams. While the ingredients vary, the soup noodles should always have a thin layer of oil or fat floating on the surface, which keeps the broth hot. At Yunnan Rainbow, the dish is prepared tableside, with the raw ingredients and fine rice noodles poached in the broth. Other dishes to try are the chicken with garlic and soy sauce, dumplings with chilli oil, and any of the mushroom preparations. \u2022 Yah Ying Building, 18 Shelter Street, Causeway Bay, +852 2881 8992. About HK$200 (\u00a316) per person Beijing There\u2019s more to Beijing cuisine than just Peking (the old name for the Chinese capital) duck. Beijing Home does serve that dish, but it also has much more humble offerings. My favourites are the snacks: Beijing-style pig skin (which is more like a cold jellied terrine), a salad with peppers, cucumber and bean curd skin, and \u2013 best of all \u2013 shredded tripe with mustard. Also good is the Beijing-style crisp lamb, and excellent dumplings with thick, chewy handmade wrappers and filled with scrambled egg and tomatoes. \u2022 7/F Island Beverley, 1 George Street, Causeway Bay, +852 2761 3300. About HK$125 (\u00a310) per person  Xinxiang Xinjiang is the most northwesterly province in China, bordered by Mongolia and several of the \u201cStans\u201d. Because it is predominantly Muslim, beef, mutton and lamb are used more than pork, the most popular meat in other regions of China. Islam Food in Kowloon City has been serving halal food in Hong Kong since the 1950s, and the walls of this tiny place are lined with photos of celebrities who have dined there. By far its most famous dish is the oddly-named veal goulash cakes, which are actually pan-fried buns stuffed with a juicy beef filling. I also like the curried lamb, beef or ox tongue, and the breads, which are good accompaniments to the saucier dishes. \u2022 1 Lung Kong Road, Kowloon City, +852 2382 2822, islamfood.com.hk. Also at 33-35 Tak Ku Ling Road, Kowloon City, +852 2382 1882. About HK$100 (\u00a38) per person  Manchu Many people think that rice is essential to all Chinese meals, but as you travel north, rice gives way to wheat and other grains. The flavours of Manchuria, in north-east China, are hearty and pungent. You probably won\u2019t want to eat at Manchu Chinese Restaurant (which used to be known as Bistro Manchu, at the same address) if you have an important meeting the next day, because you\u2019ll end up reeking of garlic.

Crowds blocked one of the city\u2019s main roads on Monday from the financial area of Central to the bar district of Wanchai in what appeared to be the largest demonstration yet. Tens of thousands were packed so tightly into Admiralty, around the government headquarters, that it was hard to move through the masses gathered beneath the skyscrapers. Some have dubbed it \u201cthe umbrella revolution\u201d in reference to the umbrellas carried by protesters to ward off teargas and pepper spray attacks, and which also served to shelter them from the fierce sun earlier in the day. With no sign of police force on Monday evening, the mood was festive rather than angry. Participants held up their smartphones to create a glittering sea of lights and joined in a mass rendition of Do You Hear The People Sing \u2013 the revolutionaries\u2019 song from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables. Many in the overwhelmingly young crowd wore black and sported yellow ribbons. Others had come straight from their offices in smart shirts; two teenage convent girls were still in their starched white uniforms.

Then we will announce new actions. It is not realistic for people to occupy Central forever,\u201d Chan Kinman, one of the founders of Occupy Central with Peace and Love, told the Guardian. \u201cWe have to be careful not to invite a backlash. Any civil disobedience has to be proportionate and at a certain time we have got to stop.\u201d But students have threatened to step up their protests if the government does not respond to their demands by Wednesday. Hong Kong enjoys considerable autonomy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework and has long been promised universal suffrage for the election of the next chief executive in 2017. Protesters are furious at Beijing\u2019s announcement of tight restrictions on candidates and see the decision as part of a broader attempt to erode the region\u2019s freedoms and culture. On Monday, both Britain and the US urged Hong Kong\u2019s leaders to show restraint and adhere to the promise of universal suffrage. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cIt is Britain\u2019s long-standing position, as a co-signatory of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, that Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and security are underpinned by its fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to demonstrate.\u201dPrecipitated by a student strike and expanding dramatically when police used teargas to try to clear the streets on Sunday, the protest movement has taken on a life of its own. Many of those present on Monday did not identify themselves as supporters of Occupy Central, or even as protesters at all, and said only the police tactics had spurred them into action. A cluster of young women in smart office clothes, clutching bulging plastic bags, appeared to be on a post-work shopping spree. But they stopped at a hardware store to buy goggles in case of a teargas attack. They were not the only ones. The hardware store sold dozens of pairs of goggles in just 15 minutes.

Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters    The marketing employees, who had bags full of crackers, plastic ponchos and water for protesters, had not planned to become involved, but said they felt they had to support them after seeing the scenes of billowing teargas on television. \u201cNot everyone goes to the frontline. They need people to support them with resources,\u201d said Helen Ng. But she voiced some concern about the potential implications of the campaign: \u201cWe want to maintain the good image of Hong Kong. It\u2019s a world city and we want to maintain the image and not, because of the protests, make people think the quality of the people is deteriorating.\u201d Chan said that while the movement was \u201cnot top-down, but bottom-up\u201d, he believed the months that Occupy spent educating people in non-violent protest had been crucial in shaping events. Protesters had shown restraint even in the face of an unreasonable crackdown. \u201cWe can\u2019t control it at the operational level, but the spiritual level, and I\u2019m quite confident Hong Kong people have changed in their views of struggle and resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe imagined there would be a great crowd of people as spectators, and only thousands would sit in. But look: they are not afraid to sit in, not afraid of teargas. It is beyond my imagination how tough people are in fighting for democracy.\u201d The government stepped back earlier in the day, announcing that riot police had been taken off the streets as citizens \u201chave mostly calmed down\u201d and urging people to unblock roads and disperse. Police said they had used what they believed to be a minimal level of force overnight.     Barricades block a crossroad controlled by activists in Mongkok in Kowloon. Photograph: Alex Hofford/EPA    But new protests broke out in Causeway Bay and Mongkok in Kowloon, which continued into Monday. Banks, shops and offices were closed in protest areas, bus lines were suspended and civil servants sent home early. Coca-Cola transport workers went on strike in support of the protests, as did some social workers. More schools have joined the class boycott that began last week and the government has ordered schools in three districts to close for a second day on Tuesday. It has also cancelled plans for the annual firework display to celebrate China\u2019s national holiday on Wednesday, when a surge in mainland visitors is expected. Officials say 41 people, including police, have been injured since the protests began and 78 arrested for offences including forcible entry into government premises, unlawful assembly and obstructing police. But in Central, business continued as usual during the day and in Causeway Bay, tourists and shoppers made their way around the protests. The demonstrators have been remarkably orderly; one sign apologised for any inconvenience caused. On Sunday, protesters held their hands in the air each time they confronted police. On Monday, they handed out fresh fruit and crackers, collected rubbish and even fanned passers-by to keep them cool. Even so, organisers and participants know that Hong Kong remains a politically conservative society where many are concerned that protests could upset the economic stability of the financial hub. The Hong Kong dollar and Hong Kong shares slipped on Monday. Retired civil servant Rose Ha, 58, said there was a clear generation gap. She had come to support the students, but few people of her age sympathised.     High-school students still in their uniforms hold signs during a protest outside the headquarters of the legislative council in Hong Kong.

[The others] enjoy what they have and don\u2019t want things to be chaotic,\u201d she said. \u201cOur friends, who are maybe rich or in power, just denounce the actions and think the students have been misled,\u201d added her friend Ben Ho, 60. \u201cPeople who are older lose touch with younger generations. They sit in restaurants and just criticise \u2026 They think in Hong Kong you can enjoy freedom and a peaceful life; why destroy it? What they ignore is that they are a privileged group and people are suffering from injustice and unfairness and the lack of opportunities.\u201d While the movement appears to be largely middle class to date, many of those involved say daily life is increasingly tough for ordinary people in the city, citing issues such as rising property prices. Such concerns have been developing over recent years, along with unhappiness about large-scale migration from the mainland.But the movement sparked by all these factors has been a shock to a city which sees itself as conservative and law-abiding. Even the keenest supporters of the protests are taken aback by their scale and self-confidence. \u201cThis is a watershed,\u201d said Hung Ho-fung, of Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThis time people are using civil disobedience and setting up barricades. There\u2019s also the disruptive aspect; in the past, they emphasised that demonstrations would not affect everyday life. This time they really don\u2019t care. I really haven\u2019t seen anything like this in Hong Kong history.\u201d But, he warned: \u201cBeijing has put itself in a corner and I don\u2019t think it can back down.\u201d     Protestors gather in Admiralty district alongside students during a protest outside the headquarters of the legislative council in Hong Kong. Photograph: Xaume Olleros/AFP/Getty Images    In previous cases where mass protests against Chinese government plans led to them being dropped the decisions had formally been made by the Hong Kong leadership. This time, the framework for reforms was announced by the standing committee for Beijing\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress; Beijing is explicitly tied to it and cannot portray a shift as a decision by the Hong Kong government. Occupy Central and others have prioritised the demand to oust Leung Chun-ying, the highly unpopular chief executive. \u201cIt will be quite difficult for Beijing to withdraw its decision,\u201d said Chan. \u201cBut if we ask the chief executive to step down, and a new government replaces him, it opens a window for us to start the constitutional reform process over again. That\u2019s a more realistic tactic.\u201d Beijing is concerned not just by its inability to rule Hong Kong with a firm hand but by the risk of contagion - with censors working hard on Monday to keep independent reports of the protests from the mainland. Several newly arrived mainland tourists had no idea why the protests were happening, although they seemed intrigued. Others disapproved. \u201cIt\u2019s very inconvenient. We are tourists; we came here to shop,\u201d said Emily Liu, visiting from Shanghai. \u201cPeople are angry because of the teargas,\u201d added her friend Kari Xu. \u201cBut if they didn\u2019t use teargas, there would be too many people \u2013 if they didn\u2019t use that, how could the government handle things?\u201d", "tags": ["Hong Kong", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-29T19:21:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/30/china-hong-kong-future-protesters-cry-democracy", "sentences": ["If you want to access the Chinese market nowadays, why move to Hong Kong when you can go straight to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and a host of other major cities?", "Where previously Hong Kong was China\u2019s unrivalled financial centre, now it is increasingly dwarfed by Shanghai.", "Until recently, Hong Kong was by far China\u2019s largest port: now it has been surpassed by Shanghai and Shenzhen, and Guangzhou will shortly overtake it."], "title": "China is Hong Kong\u2019s future \u2013 not its enemy | Martin Jacques", "article": "The upheaval sweeping Hong Kong is more complicated than on the surface it might appear. Protests have erupted over direct elections to be held in three years\u2019 time; democracy activists claim that China\u2019s plans will allow it to screen out the candidates it doesn\u2019t want. It should be remembered, however, that for 155 years until its handover to China in 1997, Hong Kong was a British colony, forcibly taken from China at the end of the first opium war. All its 28 subsequent governors were appointed by the British government. Although Hong Kong came, over time, to enjoy the rule of law and the right to protest, under the British it never enjoyed even a semblance of democracy. It was ruled from 6,000 miles away in London. The\u00a0idea of any kind of democracy was first introduced by the Chinese government. In 1990 the latter adopted the Basic Law, which included the commitment that in 2017 the territory\u2019s chief executive would be elected by universal suffrage; it also spelt out that the nomination of candidates would be a matter for a nominating committee. This proposal should be seen in the context of what was a highly innovative \u2013 and, to westerners, completely unfamiliar \u2013 constitutional approach by the Chinese. The idea of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d under which Hong Kong would maintain its distinctive legal and political system for 50 years. Hong Kong would, in these respects, remain singularly different from the rest of China, while at the same time being subject to Chinese sovereignty. In contrast, the western view has always embraced the principle of \u201cone country, one system\u201d \u2013 as, for example, in German unification. But China is more a civilisation-state than a nation-state: historically it would have been impossible to hold together such a vast country without allowing much greater flexibility. Its thinking \u2013 \u201cone civilisation, many systems\u201d \u2013 was shaped by its very different history. In the 17 years since the handover, China has, whatever the gainsayers might suggest, overwhelmingly honoured its commitment to the principle of one country, two systems. The legal system remains based on English law, the rule of law prevails, and the right to demonstrate, as we have seen so vividly in recent days, is still very much intact. The Chinese meant what they offered. Indeed, it can reasonably be argued that they went to extremes in their desire to be unobtrusive: sotto voce might be an apt way of describing China\u2019s approach to Hong Kong. At the time of the handover, and in the three years I lived in Hong Kong from 1998, it was difficult to identify any visible signs of Chinese rule: I recall seeing just one Chinese flag. Notwithstanding this, Hong Kong \u2013 and its relationship with China \u2013 was in fact changing rapidly. Herein lies a fundamental reason for the present unrest: the growing sense of dislocation among a section of Hong Kong\u2019s population. During the 20 years or so prior to the handover, the territory enjoyed its golden era \u2013 not because of the British but because of the Chinese. In 1978 Deng Xiaoping embarked on his reform programme, and China began to grow rapidly. It was still, however, a relatively closed society. Hong Kong was the beneficiary \u2013 it became the entry point to China, and as a result attracted scores of multinational companies and banks that wanted to gain access to the Chinese market. Hong Kong got rich because of China. It also fed an attitude of hubris and arrogance. The Hong Kong Chinese came to enjoy a much higher standard of living than the mainlanders. They looked down on the latter as poor, ignorant and uncouth peasants, as greatly their inferior. They preferred \u2013 up to a point \u2013 to identify with westerners rather than mainlanders, not because of democracy (the British had never allowed them any) but primarily because of money and the status that went with it. Much has changed since 1997. The Chinese economy has grown many times, the standard of living of the Chinese likewise. If you want to access the Chinese market nowadays, why move to Hong Kong when you can go straight to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and a host of other major cities? Hong Kong has lost its role as the gateway to China. Where previously Hong Kong was China\u2019s unrivalled financial centre, now it is increasingly dwarfed by Shanghai. Until recently, Hong Kong was by far China\u2019s largest port: now it has been surpassed by Shanghai and Shenzhen, and Guangzhou will shortly overtake it. Two decades ago westerners comprised the bulk of Hong Kong\u2019s tourists, today mainlanders account for the overwhelming majority, many of them rather more wealthy than most Hong Kong Chinese. Likewise, an increasing number of mainlanders have moved to the territory \u2013 which is a growing source of resentment. If China needed Hong Kong in an earlier period, this is no longer nearly as true as it was. On the contrary, without China, Hong Kong would be in deep trouble. Understandably, many Hong Kong Chinese are struggling to come to terms with these new realities. They\u00a0are experiencing a crisis of identity and a sense of displacement. They know their future is inextricably bound up with China but that is very different from embracing the fact. Yet there is no\u00a0alternative: China is the future of Hong Kong. All these issues, in a most complex way, are being played out in the present arguments over universal suffrage. Hong Kong is divided. About half the population support China\u2019s proposals on universal suffrage, either because they think they are a step forward or because they take the pragmatic view that they will happen anyway. The other half is opposed. A relatively small minority of these have never really accepted Chinese sovereignty. Anson Chan, the former head of the civil service under Chris Patten, and Jimmy Lai, a prominent businessman, fall into this category, and so do some of the Democrats. Then there is a much larger group, among them many students, who oppose Beijing\u2019s plans for more idealistic reasons. One scenario can be immediately discounted. China will not accept the election of a chief executive hostile to Chinese rule. If the present unrest continues, then a conceivable backstop might be to continue indefinitely with the status quo, which, from the point of view of democratic change, both in Hong Kong and China, would be a retrograde step. More likely is that the Chinese government will persist with its proposals, perhaps with minor concessions, and anticipate that the opposition will slowly abate. This remains the most likely scenario. An underlying weakness of Chinese rule has nevertheless been revealed by these events. One of the most striking features of Hong Kong remains the relative absence of a mainland political presence. The Chinese have persisted with what can best be described as a hands-off approach. Their relationship to the administration is either indirect or behind the scenes. Strange as it may seem, the Chinese are not involved in the cut and thrust of political argument. They will need to find more effective ways of making their views clear and arguing their case \u2013 not in Beijing but in\u00a0Hong Kong.", "tags": ["Hong Kong", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-09-30T18:45:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/oct/01/switzerland-university-rankings-invest-research-science", "sentences": ["Both these lists (and the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities) are dominated by UK and US universities."], "title": "Why does Switzerland do so well in university rankings?", "article": "When the Times Higher Education (THE) world university rankings were published yesterday, it was no surprise to see many of the usual suspects in its top 10, including the California Institute of Technology, Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge. The QS rankings published two weeks ago put MIT in top place, closely followed by Cambridge, Imperial, Harvard and Oxford. Both these lists (and the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities) are dominated by UK and US universities. But there\u2019s an interloper: Switzerland, with a population of only eight million, has two universities, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, in the top 20 in the QS rankings and seven in the top 200 in both the QS and THE rankings. It performs better than many bigger countries with successful economies. So what is the secret of the country\u2019s success? To answer that requires an understanding of how rankings work. Each of the three best-known ranking systems uses a set of indicators allocated a weighting: in the QS rankings, the biggest weighting, based on a survey of academics is given to academic reputation (40%), followed by faculty/student ratio (20%), citations per faculty (20%), employer reputation, based on a survey of employers (10%), international student ratio (5%) and international staff ratio (5%). Switzerland\u2019s success partly reflects the country\u2019s heavy investment in research: it spends 2.2% of its GDP on research and development, double the EU average of 1.1%. Ben Sowter, head of the QS intelligence unit, says that it has been given an added boost by the presence of the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, giving the country\u2019s institutions the opportunity to benefit from collaborations with leading universities worldwide. This, he says, has \u201cdramatically magnified their research impact and influence at a global scale\u201d. The strong research performance of the top Swiss institutions enables them to attract the best international staff, helping them do well on that particular indicator. But the country\u2019s location in the centre of western Europe also makes Switzerland attractive to international staff and students: it has borders with five countries, and three principal national languages (French, German and Italian). As a result, 21% of university students come from abroad. Ellen Hazelkorn, director of research and enterprise at the Dublin Institute of Technology, notes that Switzerland\u2019s size gives it an advantage on the international staff indicator: \u201cIf you\u2019re a small country, you probably have more people who got their doctorate in another country.\u201d Some international staff can even commute to work in a Swiss university from across one of the borders. Like a number of other institutions in the QS top 20, both ETH Zurich and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, specialise in technology and science. Scientists all over the world tend to publish in English, and because QS\u2019s citations indicator is based on Elsevier\u2019s Scopus database, which has a bias towards English-language publications, this gives an advantage to institutions focused on science \u2013 academics in the humanities often prefer to publish in their own language. Scientists also tend to publish in journals, while humanities academics often publish their work in book chapters or monographs, which are not included in Scopus \u2013 again giving an advantage to scientifically-based institutions. Frank Ziegele, director of Germany\u2019s Centre for Higher Education, says: \u201cIf you\u2019re a university focused on humanities you never have the chance to be on top in the QS rankings.\u201d Some academics are highly sceptical about the usefulness of the indicators used to compile rankings: Hazelkorn argues that a high proportion of international students could just as easily decrease a university\u2019s quality as increase it.  The usefulness of faculty-staff ratio as a proxy for teaching and learning is also contentious: Hazelkorn describes it as \u201ccompletely meaningless and a hugely disputed measure of anything having to do with quality,\u201d though Sowter argues that \u201cfaculty-student ratio is necessary, even in an increasingly digitised world, if you\u2019re going to be able to provide enough academic support for your students.\u201d The bigger difficulty with the rankings is that of the \u201chalo\u201d effect where, in the words of Simon Marginson, professor of international higher education at the Institute of Education, \u201cexisting reputation drives judgement\u201d.  He says: \u201cNew institutions can\u2019t crack the top group because reputations continue to recycle, and it protects their material position, because it keeps the research money flying in. Students and staff of quality keep wanting to go there and that sustains the quality.\u201d Is there another way? Marginson believes that the Leiden rankings, which use single (rather than aggregated) indicators, and draw on hard data rather than surveys, provide a more accurate methodology for assessing universities\u2019 research performance. The new U-Multirank site, developed by Ziegele and his colleagues, does away with rankings, instead showing profiles for individual universities, with a clear measure for each indicator: users can compare how two universities perform on different indicators. While ETH Zurich, for example, retains an impressive research score, only 61% of new entrants successfully complete their bachelor degree. Although U-Multirank is potentially a rich source of data, many of the top universities have so far refused to provide data, compromising its usefulness.     The graphic shows how well the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne performs on indicators in five broad categories. Each category contains between five and nine indicators. For more detail on how it works, click here. Photograph: U-Multirank    Rankings are undoubtedly seductive. But there is a danger that by aggregating different measures, we smooth over important differences in individual areas. We also run the risk that universities \u2013 and countries \u2013 become so fixated on rankings that they expend their efforts on activities designed to manipulate their place in them instead of concentrating on the quality of higher education as a whole, says Hazelkorn: \u201cThe percentage of students who attend these [top-ranking] institutions is a fraction, less than 1%. The real focus should be on whether our systems are world-class.\u201d More like this:  View the top 200 unis in the world as ranked by QS  Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

The new Gin Lane There has already been great excitement at the suggestion in a study by the Office for National Statistics that Britons spend more on illegal drugs and prostitution than on the legal thrills of wine and beer. A combined \u00a312.3bn is apparently spent on the hidden economy of narcotics and paid-for sex versus \u00a311bn on stuff you can get in the booze aisle at the local supermarket. The drug part, though, seems like a slightly unfair comparison. For a start, drugs are much more expensive. Nobody out there is driving down prices or offering the equivalent of bulk-buy 89p-a-can cider. Plus a yearning for intoxication, ideally as powerful as possible is hardly a new problem. The government passed five acts of parliament in the 18th century to control the consumption of gin, so all-pervading was the gin craze and so terrible the stories of a people brought to their knees by their thirst for the juniper-berry spirit.

African-born athletes \u201cemployed\u201d by rich Gulf states have dominated the Games for the third time in a row, drawing some protests that stray close to some very difficult notions of biological difference. Arguments about ingrained physical superiority have always tended to founder, based as they are in dubious science and even more dubious ideology (even though they may still be backed by some potent medal statistics). All that really seems certain is that\u00a0if\u00a0African sports people are talented and ambitious they are also,\u00a0more often\u00a0than not, raised in genuine poverty.

In part one, she visited Tokyo Indies, a get-together where lone developers and small studios can show off their latest projects. What is \u201cindie\u201d? What do we mean, when we talk about indie game development? It\u2019s something developers and writers in the west have pondered on a lot lately, as the nature and business of game development evolves.  In Japan, too, the demarcations between development types and identifying labels have become arbitrary and unclear. For example, The Touhou Project, a series of \u201cbullet hell\u201d scrolling shoot-\u2019em-ups by one-man outfit, Team Shanghai Alice, is considered a successful d\u014djin game series \u2013 in other words, a hobbyist development project. However, people refer to the Japanese-developed Cave Story \u2013 a clear homage to Nintendo\u2019s Metroid titles by lone developer Daisuke Amaya \u2013 as indie.         An interesting preview video of this year\u2019s Comiket, a hobbyist manga and game development event held annually in Tokyo. It\u2019s a key showcase for d\u014djin games.    \u201cNow why is that?\u201d asks Alvin Phu, game developer and organiser of the regular Tokyo Indies gatherings. \u201cI can\u2019t really answer these questions. I am not Japanese.\u201d Instead, I ask independent developers Makoto Goto and Mika Maruyama what they think. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to give an explanation because the perspective is different,\u201d Goto says. \u201cAlmost always, the d\u014djin creator has a daytime job and their hobby is making d\u014djin games. But with indie games, the importance is on making money.\u201d Maruyama expands a little on what she thinks the indie philosophy is: she tells me that d\u014djin creators take their inspiration from manga and anime that they admire, but indie games are more often a reflection of something more centred inside the creator.  Maruyama\u2019s website, for example, is a showcase of her original artwork and enchanting music, the sort that excites me about her forthcoming first game, as yet unnamed, which I hope will be the crossroads of all her many talents. \u201cIndie games are based on the self,\u201d Goto says. \u201cThey are different in that manner.\u201d Goto thinks that the Tokyo Game Show didn\u2019t really care about indie game makers until this year when the media became interested in them. There has also been a change of environment surrounding developers Goto says, with Valve\u2019s Steam platform and start ups making a big difference.     An illustration by artist and game designer, Mika Maruyama Photograph: public domain    In 2009, heavyweight Japanese developer Keiji Inafune, the \u201cfather\u201d of Capcom\u2019s legendary platform gaming series Megaman, made a famous remark. \u201cPersonally when I looked around [at] all the different games at the TGS floor I said \u2018Man, Japan is over. We\u2019re done. Our game industry is finished.\u2019\u201d Though he teaches game design and speaks regularly on games in Japan, Inafune has reinforced this opinion of the Japanese games industry since, saying there are too many sequels on the TGS floor. But I wonder if he might have been excited this year by the number of original Japanese indie games at TGS, including the intriguing Vane, developed by ex-members of Team Ico, the creators of Ico, Shadow of the Colossus and the long-awaited, Last Guardian. Onion Games\u2019 Million Onion Hotel, a brilliantly funny puzzle game studded with Yoshiro Kimura\u2019s poetry, was also a highlight of the indie booths. I think Inafune would love Downwell too. \u201cIt\u2019s such an exciting inspiration,\u201d Goto says on the rise of the Japanese indies. He thinks all kinds of game makers in Japan will take full advantage of the opportunities provided by the rise of the indie community, and that it\u2019s possible the d\u014djin community will also benefit from this new emphasis on small budget developers. Patel hopes that Japanese student game makers will take over running Kyoto Indies and invite new people into the fold. There\u2019s a sense here that Japanese developers are taking ownership of their future; they are becoming less afraid of the risks of going it alone. \u201cThe spirit of indie game makers and d\u014djin game makers is the same,\u201d Goto says. \u201cWe can make our own games.\u201d Six interesting Japanese indie games to try today     Cherry Tree High Comedy Club \u2013 a super cute school adventure from Nyu Media Photograph: public domain    1.

The company \u2013 which is also known in Britain for funding the Premier League football team Stoke City and for making large donations to the Labour party \u2013 has seen a boom in its online betting operations. They are almost three times the size of the internet division of William Hill and more than seven times larger than the online business run by Ladbrokes, as turnover has grown by 78% over the past two years. However, documents seen by the Guardian, interviews conducted with former and current bet365 employees, Freedom of Information requests made to the UK\u2019s Gambling Commission and an analysis of foreign-language media reports all appear to confirm industry suspicions that the company \u2013 which has no physical presence or assets in China \u2013 operates one of the most successful online gambling services that can be accessed from inside the country. China is one of the world\u2019s largest online gambling markets despite the government having outlawed betting in all but a few controlled scenarios. The gambling group says its legal advice is that it has broken no law by taking bets from the country. The Guardian\u2019s evidence suggests that: \u2022 Chinese citizens have been detained for interacting with online betting firms, including four bet365 customers in Jiangxi province arrested after gambling on the group\u2019s website, while two men in Zhejiang were jailed for promoting bet365 on their blogs, according to local media reports. \u2022 Bet365 frequently changes its website addresses in China, thereby side-stepping attempts by local regulators to close sites down. \u2022 The bookmaker has created a large call centre in Stoke staffed by Chinese-speaking workers. \u2022 The company has constructed a complex payments system that allows it to take bets placed using China\u2019s currency, the renminbi. The Guardian has established that only about half of the \u00a31.3bn the company won from gamblers in 2013 came from countries where bet365 possessed a licence to operate. While that statistic does not imply the remainder was won from markets with legal restrictions on online gambling, industry analysts say a sizeable portion of the winnings must come from Asia, and principally China. Bet365\u2019s publicly listed rivals \u2013 William Hill, Ladbrokes, Betfair and Paddy Power \u2013 all say they do not take online bets from the country. One former bet365 employee, who confirmed that the company was one of the larger online gambling operators accessible from China, said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing the Chinese government can do about it, other than block the sites, which they do. A lot Chinese[-facing] bookmakers change their domain names on a regular basis.\u201d Meanwhile, a current bet365 employee confirmed it was \u201c100% true\u201d that bet365 altered website addresses to allow Chinese punters to keep betting when authorities shut down sites. The bet365 sites in question use obscure domain names such as www.28365365.com in their often brief lifespan. He added: \u201cI would say there are 50 [bet365 call centre] advisers just to follow the Chinese customers. China is the biggest department apart from the English [speaking] one\u201d. The company declined to respond in detail to a series of questions posed to it by the Guardian. In a statement, it said: \u201cBet365 takes its legal and regulatory obligations very seriously and is licensed to undertake its activities by relevant regulatory authorities across a variety of jurisdictions and is compliant with all applicable legislation. \u201cThere is no legislation that expressly prohibits the supply of remote gambling services into China by operators who are based outside China. Bet365 has no people, assets or infrastructure in China and does not engage any agents, aggregators or intermediaries, for any purpose, in China. \u201cIn the view of bet365, and its lawyers, Chinese law does not extend to the provision of services into China by gambling operators and service providers who themselves have no nexus with the territory. Any allegation of illegality on the part of bet365 is therefore untrue.\u201d The company added that it does not receive \u201crenminbi from payment processors or otherwise\u201d, and said it was unaware of \u201canyone in China being prosecuted for using its services\u201d. It also said that in the Jiangxi case \u2013 where four bet365 customers were arrested in 2011 \u2013 it was \u201clikely\u201d that it had been the victim of a fraud, while in response to reports of two men being jailed in Zhejiang, it said it is the \u201cresponsibility of affiliates [who are paid by bet365 for introducing customers] to assess the legal implications\u201d. In 2005, China published judicial interpretations relating to the existing article 303 of its criminal law, which already stated: \u201cThat whoever, for the purpose of reaping profits, assembles a crowd to engage in gambling, opens a gambling house or makes an occupation of gambling is to be sentenced to not more than three years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal detention or control, in addition to a fine\u201d. The interpretation added that \u201cwhoever, for the purpose of reaping profits, sets up gambling websites on the internet or acts as an online gambling agent will be regarded as \u2018opening gambling houses\u2019 and will be punished according to article 303 of the criminal law\u201d. The interpretation of the law has led many within the gambling industry to take the view that this applies to websites located outside China as well as within, and to avoid China as a market. Michael Tan, senior counsel based in Shanghai at the international law firm Taylor Wessing, said: \u201cFrom the perspective of Chinese law, [gambling] is illegal and a criminal offence. However, it is hardly enforceable since the betting company might be beyond the jurisdiction of China. So far China does not have treaties with most western countries, and to extradite is difficult in practice\u201d. Regulus Partners, a gambling industry consultancy firm, said there was very little visibility as to the true size of the Chinese betting market. However, it estimates that the Chinese market generates annual winnings for bookmakers of about \u00a313.9bn \u2013 of which about \u00a33bn are placed directly with gambling websites and the rest via third parties who collect bets on the ground and then pass the bets on to bookmakers. On those figures, a 3% share of the Chinese market, for instance, would provide a gambling company with annual winnings of around \u00a3400m. The Guardian\u2019s analysis of bet365\u2019s revenue streams comes as the UK gambling industry began a new regulatory regime on 1 October, whereby operators pay a licence fee to the Gambling Commission in order to operate in the UK. Under the new UK licensing regime, operators deriving more than 3% of revenues from distinct international markets must disclose details of those businesses to the regulator, and provide a legal opinion justifying operations in those foreign markets. The bookmaker said: \u201cBet365 Group entities have applied for continuation rights as required by the [new UK] licensing regime and, when doing so, shared with the Gambling Commission the legal bases underpinning the business derived from all the group\u2019s material markets\u201d. Betting companies will also need a licence if they want to advertise on Premier League shirts and in football stadiums, an activity that has surged in recent seasons as English football games are broadcast around the world. Separately, the Stoke-based bookmaker announced on Monday that it would be relocating its international betting businesses from Britain to Gibraltar, operating under licences granted by the government of Gibraltar and making the company the last of the big UK betting companies to move offshore. The firm\u2019s gaming business has operated from Gibraltar since 2007. Apart from its online gambling business, bet365 Group also owns Stoke City, and has covered losses at the club to the tune of \u00a349m over the past four years. Its logo is seen all over the world each weekend as it is the sponsor of the team\u2019s jerseys. As well as supporting the local football team, the company and its subsidiaries also gave \u00a3330,000 to the Labour Party between 2007 and 2010, according to Electoral Commission records. Peter Coates, the Stoke City chairman, co-owner of bet365 and father of the business\u2019s founder, Denise, has personally donated \u00a3160,000 between 2004 and 2012.

His lightweight steel frame relieved a structure of its heavy masonry shackles, enabling it to soar to new heights. Perplexed by this trade-in of solid brick for a spindly steel skeleton, Chicago inspectors paused the construction of the Home Insurance Building until they were certain it was structurally sound.  Of course, Jenney\u2019s revolutionary edifice provided a blueprint for city skylines across the world. By 2011, China was reckoned to be topping off a new skyscraper (500ft or taller) every five days, reaching a total of 800 by 2016. Toronto, now North America\u2019s fourth largest city, currently has 130 high-rise construction projects under way.     Chicago\u2019s Home Insurance Building, widely considered to be the world\u2019s first modern skyscraper. Photograph: Chicago History Museum/Getty Images    As a result, buildings are slowly choking the atmosphere. In Britain, where the construction industry accounts for almost 7% of the economy (including 10% of total employment), 47% of greenhouse gas emissions are generated from buildings, while 10% of CO2 emissions come from construction materials. Furthermore, 20% of the materials used on the average building site end up in a skip. So just as Jenney\u2019s steel-frame solved the issue of the dense, stunted buildings in the 19th century, architects and engineers are now seeking new ways of building taller and faster without having such a drastic impact on the environment. And that has seen them revisit the most basic building material of them all: wood. Although wood in its raw form could not compete with Jenney\u2019s steel-frame wonder, a type of super-plywood has been developed to step up to the challenge. By gluing layers of low-grade softwood together to create timber panels, today\u2019s \u201cengineered timber\u201d is more akin to Ikea flat-packed furniture than traditional sawn lumber, and offers the prospect of a new era of eco-friendly \u201cplyscrapers\u201d. For Vancouver-based architect Michael Green, the sky is the limit for wooden buildings. While nearing completion of the University of Northern British Columbia\u2019s Wood Innovation and Design Centre in Prince George, Green\u2019s practice, MGA, has also drawn up plans for a 30-storey, sun-grown tower for downtown Vancouver. If built, Green\u2019s vision would be easily the world\u2019s tallest wooden building, soaring past the current contenders \u2013 London\u2019s Stadthaus at nine storeys, and the 10-storey Forte Building in Melbourne. But that\u2019s not the main motivation, according to MGA associate Carla Smith. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not like we really care about being the tallest,\u201d she says. \u201cWe really do see a wooden future for cities, and our aim is to get others to jump on board too.\u201d      The Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology arts and media building under construction in Nelson, New Zealand    Green is giving away his hefty, 200-page instruction manual, The Case for Tall Wood Buildings, free of charge. He hopes it will inspire architects and engineers to branch out beyond their concrete and steel confinements, and embrace a material that sequesters carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, holding it captive during its growth and lifetime in a structure \u2013 one tonne of CO2 per cubic metre of wood. To put that in context, while a 20-storey wooden building sequesters about 3,100 tonnes of carbon, the equivalent-sized concrete building pumps out 1,200 tonnes. That net difference of 4,300 tonnes is the equivalent of removing 900 cars from the city for a year. But while timber advocates such as Green hope to to sow the seeds of change in the minds of policymakers worldwide, building regulations still put a low-rise lid on the height of timber buildings. This is based on wood\u2019s historic reputation as kindling for a great city fire: in London, Chicago and San Francisco (to name just a few), roaring fires have ravaged city streets, wiping out great swathes of grand architecture and razing urban history to the ground. But while the classic timber-framed city of 1870s Chicago was gone in an instant, today\u2019s engineered timber develops a protective charring layer that maintains structural integrity and burns very predictably \u2013 unlike steel, which warps under the intense heat. The rigidity of mass timber panels has tended to restrict architects to a \u201chouse of cards\u201d design, whereby panels are slotted together and stacked on top of one another in repetitive patterns. But new innovations are coming thick and fast: the USDA recently announced a $2m investment for wood innovation, and in the previously scorched city of Chicago, mega-firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill published a study that re-imagines the 42-storey Dewitt Chestnut apartment block as a timber tower. In Europe, a 14-storey wooden building is currently under construction in Bergen, Norway, with another eight-storey structure on its way up in Dornbirn, Austria \u2013 the prototype for a 20-storey plyscraper designed by the global engineering firm Arup.     The finished NMIT arts and media building    One other important breakthrough came in British Columbia, a Canadian province half-covered in forest. Since 1996, more than 16m hectares have been destroyed by North America\u2019s native mountain pine beetle, which releases a blue-staining fungus into the wood, halting the flow of nutrients and water and the killing the tree.  The province faced the prospect of billions of these dead lodgepole pines triggering a huge release of carbon dioxide \u2013 until a means of using this undesirable blue-stained lumber for building was realised. British Columbia promotes its use through the Wood First Act, passed in 2009, which requires all new, publicly financed construction projects to first consider wood as the primary building material.  The most prominent example is Vancouver\u2019s 2010 Winter Olympic ice rink, the Richmond Oval, which features massive glued-laminated timber arches of beetle-ravaged wood. Building regulations are now loosening up in Canada, reflecting the recent successes of the country\u2019s wood use. Last month, Ontario raised the cap on timber structures from four storeys to six, just as British Columbia did in 2009. But perhaps the most promising realisation of wood\u2019s worth is in New Zealand, where the violent earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 left almost one third of the Christchurch\u2019s buildings \u2013 including 220 heritage sites \u2013 up for demolition. Almost four years on, the city\u2019s grand rebuild has begun, and wood has taken a step into the spotlight due to its durability in high-seismic activity zones. The \u201cnew\u201d Christchurch, as outlined in the Central Recovery Plan, is proposed to be a low-rise, \u201cgreener, more attractive\u201d city costing around NZ$40bn (\u00a319bn), almost 20% of the country\u2019s annual GDP.     A detail of the Merritt building in Christchurch\u2019s central business district Photograph: PR    Andrew Buchanan, professor of timber design at the University of Canterbury, sees a growing interest in the use of wood in Christchurch\u2019s rebuild. \u201cWhen it first happened, people were scared of concrete and masonry buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cWood was seen as a very desirable and very safe alternative.\u201d  Earlier this year, Christchurch welcomed its first post-earthquake, multistorey timber structure \u2013 the Merritt building in the city\u2019s central business district. The structure uses a \u201cpost-tension\u201d technology \u2013 the brainchild of Buchanan and his colleagues \u2013 where timber is lashed together with steel tendons that act like rubber bands, allowing the building to snap back into place following any seismic movement. And recently, the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s first engineered timber factory opened up in Nelson, producing timber panels for flat-pack cities across the globe. In China, Arup is currently working to educate engineers on the use of wood. With even a superfirm like SOM \u2013 the architects behind One World Trade Center and the Burj Khalifa \u2013 considering using of wood for high-rise construction, the industry finally appears ready to grasp its full potential.  Several of SOM\u2019s buildings are in Chinese cities (the 71-storey Pearl River Building in Guangzhou, and the 88-storey Jin Mao in Shanghai, for example), so perhaps their Timber Tower could take root there too? \u201cJudging from the speed that the Chinese usually adopt new technologies,\u201d says Arup director Tristram Carfrae, \u201cthis really won\u2019t take very long!\u201d This article was amended on Monday 6 October 2014.

Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images    Pacquiao once was not so righteous. He once was an all-night hound dog, taking his pleasure where he pleased, ignoring all advice to respect the sanctity of his marriage vows and determined to squeeze as much fun from life as was available to someone who was born into grinding poverty. Those were his hardcore inclinations until only a few years ago. Here is a snapshot of that life, from the opening of Gary Andrew Poole\u2019s excellent biography on him. \u201cAs Manny \u2018Pacman\u2019 Pacquiao saunters out of the locker room at the Wild Card Boxing Club in Hollywood, California, he holds out his hand, and a member of his entourage slaps a comb in it.

Someone slips on his watch \u2013 a gold Rolex Yacht Master \u2013 and then gives him his diamond stud earring, which he puts in his left ear.\u201d Dressed to kill the ladies \u2013 long before he had that conversation with God. The hair is still black. The goatee and the diamond stud are in place, too. The eyes are just as knowing, but he is profoundly a different man, more content, less restless. He is a congressman now, too, serving his people while dealing out pain in his other job. \u201cPeople are surprised by the way I have changed my life,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the running around. In that time and age, I knew I could do whatever I wanted. But I changed when I heard the voice of God, and I can testify that there is a God. I saw two angels, white, long, big wings. I saw Paradise. God showed me about the end of time. This all happened within the last three years. That\u2019s how I changed my life.\u201d I do not have the feeling I am in the presence of a man who could put me in hospital with a practised flick of his fist, who did exactly that inside two rounds in 2009 to Ricky Hatton, another fighter who did not stint on life\u2019s pleasures, and is again struggling with those temptations. Pacquiao\u2019s trainer of 13 years, Freddie Roach, is standing a few feet away. He\u00a0has heard Manny\u2019s story of redemption many times. \u201cIt\u2019s more vital to him now than ever before,\u201d Roach says. \u201cHe was born a Catholic, now he\u2019s a born-again Christian. His mother [Dionesia] hates it. She\u2019s always trying to force the Rosary on him. The only worry about it is that maybe it could hurt his political career, because 90% of the Philippines is Catholic and he\u2019s a born-again Christian.\u201d     Pacquiao trains at Pedro Antonio Acharon Sports Complex in the Philippines. Photograph: Jeoffrey Maitem/Getty Images    Roach continues: \u201cThere is this other side to him, though. He\u2019s very different to a lot of boxers. He always is keeping busy, like playing basketball in the village and so forth, but he discusses the Bible when we\u2019re flying somewhere, asking what does this really mean, what does that really mean. I listen. Sometimes it\u2019s quite funny. Sometimes it makes sense. But sometimes it can be a long trip. There\u2019s good and bad. Religion means a lot to him, but he has done stuff that\u2019s not so religious, so \u2026 \u201cSome fighters turn to religion, because it\u2019s a tough business. I\u2019m not a religious person so it\u2019s not a factor for me. I grew up a Catholic until the second grade. I got to my first Holy Communion, but I didn\u2019t make it to Confirmation. They\u2019d lost me by then. But it\u2019s a tough life, boxing. Fighters are often looking for something they can hold on to. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s done it \u2013 and more now than ever he needs it. \u201cHe and his wife [Jinkee] are happier than ever. He doesn\u2019t party any more, doesn\u2019t drink anymore. He\u2019s a clean liver, doesn\u2019t fuck around with girls no more. And his wife is very happy about that. He\u2019s a better family man. So there\u2019s a lot of good that goes with it. He was a pretty wild guy, had the world by the balls. Everything was available.\u201d Right now, there is serious business to take care of. In the CotaiArena in the Venetian casino in Macao on 22 November, Pacquiao gives Chris Algieri, an unbeaten light-welterweight from Huntington, Long Island, a shot at his 10st 7lb title. Algieri, a smart boxer and even smarter individual \u2013 he has a BSc in health care management and a Masters in clinic nutrition \u2013 has come from nowhere at 30, with not much of a punch but bags of confidence and energy. He will give it his best shot. Pacquiao flew 27,000 miles with Algieri promoting the fight, from Beijing to Shanghai to Hong Kong to San Francisco to Las Vegas to New York. They get along. \u201cAll my opponents they are friends outside the ring but, inside the ring, we have a job to do,\u201d Pacquiao says. \u201cI just learned about Algieri when the news broke that he wanted to fight me. I watched his fight with Ruslan Provodnikov [a split decision after 12 tough rounds in Brooklyn last June to win the WBO\u2019s 10st title]. He showed he deserved this fight.\u201d     Pacquiao during a training session. Photograph: Jeoffrey Maitem/Getty Images    On the road, they have had time to kill and have jousted over the pool table. \u201cI lost to him at pool,\u201d Pacquiao says, \u201cbut in the real game I am better than him. Being a Christian, I am giving him an advantage but, in a real fight, it\u2019s going to be much different. Ha, ha!\u201d Few people in boxing laugh as much as Pacquiao. Some fighters dread their public performances. Others, such as David Haye and Floyd Mayweather and Gennady Golovkin, cannot wait to get in the ring. Pacquiao is one of that breed. \u201cYou can see in my face, boxing is my passion. Every time I walk to the ring, I am smiling because I am excited to fight.\u201d Since Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez shocked him and the rest of boxing nearly two years ago with the most stunning one-punch knockout boxing had witnessed in years, Pacquiao has looked good \u2013 not quite back to his wrecking-ball best but way too good for Brandon Rios and vindicated in a rematch with Timothy Bradley. Algieri, in his disciplined, energetic way, produced a shock of his own by out-hustling Provodkinov, the Russian slugger who gave Bradley nightmares and bruises in one of the best fights of 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time I fight a guy like him \u2013 all action, from all angles,\u201d Pacquiao says of Algieri. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I fought a guy as tall as him [5ft 10in]. This is fun. My advantage is my experience. I have to use that. I believe he is the sort of opponent who will make a good fight.\u201d Algieri pays Pacquiao due respect, as would any grateful challenger pitched into the biggest payday of his career. \u201cManny, Floyd [Mayweather], the upper echelon, the elite of the sport is right there,\u201d the well-spoken New Yorker says. \u201cTo get to them? First you gotta win a fight you\u2019re not supposed to, and you\u2019ve gotta fight someone who nobody wants to fight, a really strong character, and you\u2019ve got to perform. That\u2019s what I love about boxing. When you go on that stage, when you show up and you do what you\u2019re supposed to do, you maybe do more than what\u2019s expected and you get rewarded. I\u2019m feeling great about this fight. When it came up, I thought it was a great opportunity, of course I did. I wanted to be champion; I did that, but I still want more \u2013 and there\u2019s not much more than Manny Pacquiao.\u201d So, did he think this was a good time to take him? \u201cYou know what? I guess we\u2019ll find out on 22 November. I\u2019m just preparing for the Manny Pacquiao I\u2019ve been watching for years. I\u2019m not preparing for half of that. I\u2019m ready for the full guy. I\u2019m here \u2013 another new face at the table. That\u2019s what the sport needs. We need more guys getting shots and taking them. A lot of the guys don\u2019t take the shots that they\u2019re offered. They\u2019re sitting on their record, sitting on their titles. I love this fight because you\u2019ve got two fighters, myself and Manny, taking risks. Anyway you look at it, both corners of the ring, this is a big gamble. I respect Manny\u00a0for\u00a0that.\u201d The respect, no doubt, will be there at the end, mutually. These are gentleman fighters. They are not loudmouths or showmen. They represent the dignity in boxing, and that is a rare commodity these days. You might say it is a good fight for a man of God to be involved in.     Boxing gloves featuring Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao are seen during the Box Fan Expo at the Las Vegas Convention Center last month.

Pacquiao hits back, challenging Mayweather to a fight for charity and taunts the American: \u201cFloyd, if you\u2019re a real man, fight me.

I don\u2019t really know him. I wish him all the best but I couldn\u2019t care less about Manny Pacquiao. I am only focused on Floyd Mayweather. If it happens, it happens.\u201d Leonard Ellerbe, chief executive at Mayweather Promotions, says: \u201cFloyd is ready to fight anybody. Of course there is hope [of a Pacquiao fight next May]. It\u2019s all about giving the fans what they want to see. Hopefully we can get it together and make it happen.\u201d \u25a0 26 September Mayweather tweets a montage of images showing Pacquiao on the canvas, accompanied by: \u201cMiss Pac Man is broke and desperate for a pay day. Your pay-per-view numbers are a joke.\u201d Pacquiao says: \u201cI\u2019m not affected by it. I pity him and I pray that some day he would change his ways. He should fear God.\u201d Then he quotes a passage from Matthew 16:26: \u201cFor what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?\u201d After five years of phoney war and trash talk, the fight seems no closer.", "tags": ["Manny Pacquiao", "Boxing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-04T18:43:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/05/supermarkets-discounters-europe-us-china-japan", "sentences": ["Many foreign chains are expanding into second, third and fourth-tier cities, far from the bright lights and saturated markets of Beijing and Shanghai.", "Convenience stores are proliferating in pedestrian-friendly cities such as Shanghai; hypermarkets remain the model of choice in traffic-choked Beijing."], "title": "Brutal competition batters supermarkets the world over", "article": "As they scramble to maintain market share, the big four British grocers can take comfort from the fact that at least they are not alone. The global supermarket industry has its share of epic competitive scraps, too. In Europe alone, the discounters that have wrought havoc for Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury&apos;s have an even more powerful grip on the industry. While Aldi and Lidl control around 8% of the UK market, according to figures from market research group Kantar the share controlled by discounters in France is 10% and in Germany \u2013 home of Aldi and Lidl \u2013 it is 37%. In the UK, two-thirds of the market is controlled by four players; this is the same as in Germany, while in France 56% of the market is controlled by the top four and in Spain just under 50%. A look at these markets, plus some of the biggest outside Europe, shows that every territory poses challenges for big grocers. Germany The British story of stellar growth for discounters and pain inflicted on established chains is well-known in Germany. &quot;German supermarkets fought that same battle two decades ago&quot;, said Matthias Queck, a Frankfurt-based analyst for Planet Retail. It was a skirmish the traditional chains fought with limited success: Aldi and Lidl nowadays have nearly 40% of the market. &quot;What we&apos;re seeing in Britain may just be the pangs of a market adjusting its prices and the power balance between supermarkets and discounters to what we are used to seeing in continental Europe,&quot; he added. But while &quot;quality&quot; supermarkets such as Edeka and Rewe may still be smarting, they are travelling in a very different direction from the one chosen by their British equivalents. &quot;If anything, they have for the past few years been trying to shake off the cheap, &apos;discount&apos; image and convince customers that paying a little bit extra is worth it,&quot; said Queck. As in the UK, discounters and supermarkets in Germany are faced with shoppers who are less and less willing to drive out of town for their weekly shop, and more likely to do small, frequent trips in urban areas. In recent years, the trend has led to a revival in big cities like Hamburg and Berlin of the traditional Tante Emma L\u00e4den or corner shops, which have been able to be much more flexible in reacting to trends or food scandals than their bigger rivals. Philip Oltermann France With two German discounters muscling into the market and a growing aversion to megastores, the French retail industry bears some similarity to the UK&apos;s. As here, the French grocery sector is dominated by a small number of large firms. The main groups are Carrefour, Leclerc, Intermarch\u00e9 and Systeme U, plus the familiar names of Aldi and Lidl. The French grocery retail market was worth around \u20ac221bn in 2012 according to researcher IGD \u2013 similar to the UK total. Hypermarkets \u2013 outlets with more than 2,500 square metres of floor space \u2013 accounted for 42% of grocery sales in 2013, but have been declining in popularity since 2008, in a trend that has been repeated in the UK. Supermarkets and local stores have fared better. There has been a greater demand for neighbourhood outlets and shops on a more &quot;human scale&quot;, according to a report from the French government. But while competition in France is fierce, it is not as openly cutthroat as in the UK and it is much more tightly regulated. Strict laws on the price of branded goods mean they should not be significantly cheaper in one store than in others as this would constitute &quot;unfair competition&quot;. Laws also regulate opening hours and ban selling at a loss. Shops are not allowed to open on Sundays, or very late at night, except in designated tourist areas. Small family-owned and run &quot;corner&quot; shops are exempt from the regulations. One area where food shopping in France differs greatly from in the UK is the general absence of marketing devices such as buy-one-get-one-free (bogof) offers. While some supermarkets have introduced the concept, Arnaud Joly, an expert on food retailing for the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said French shops preferred adjusting prices to promotions. Kim Willsher  Spain   In the UK, Tesco is still, despite its travails, the clear market leader, and the situation is similar in Spain, where Mercadona is the undisputed powerhouse. Since 2012, the family-owned chain has had more than a fifth of market share, more than twice that of its closest competitor, French group Carrefour. While rivals fought to survive the country&apos;s economic crisis, Mercadona has grown, hiring thousands of employees to staff new stores opening across the country. The chain&apos;s allure lies in its low prices. Mercadona, which now has more than 1,500 stores across Spain, has made a science of trimming costs across the board. Its rivals attempt to compete with aggressive promotions and innovation. Carrefour had introduced a loyalty card and led the way when it came to innovation, said Eric Batty of Kantar Worldpanel. For example, it started offering ready-made sauces and prepared meals that were not available in other supermarkets. Meanwhile, a push by Lidl in Spain to add fresh produce to its stores made it the fastest-growing chain in terms of market share last year, increasing from 2.7% to 3.1% in the first half of 2013 and 2014 respectively. As the financial crisis eased its grip on Spain, shoppers&apos; habits were shifting, said Batty. During the crisis, many stayed close to home, buying only what they needed week-to-week in an effort to save money. So far 2014 has been marked by a return to the out-of-town hypermarkets, where households shop less often but buy more on each trip. Those who stand to lose out as this trend grows are the specialists, such as bakeries, greengrocers and butchers, traditionally a big part of Spain&apos;s grocery offerings. Ashifa Kassam Italy   Grocery shopping in Italy may conjure up images of vigorous open-air markets, or perhaps quaint delicatessens selling mouthwatering produce from the hills of Umbria. And so it is \u2013 for the privileged few. But for 60% of Italian families food shopping regularly involves a trip to one of the increasing numbers of discount supermarkets, such as Lidl or Eurospin. But dependence on the big stores is not on the same scale as in the UK; most Italians have an attachment to local food shops. But habits were changing, and the growth of supermarkets and discount stores &quot;has made those shops&apos; lives tough&quot;, said Francesco Daveri, an economist at the University of Parma. That is not the only area of competition. Between the discount stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets there is a constant battle going on to woo the increasingly cash-strapped consumer. &quot;Supermarkets are really the only sector [in Italy] where competition has worked out,&quot; said Liliana Cantone of Italian consumer association Altroconsumo. &quot;The players are doing their best to offer lower prices, and consumers can really benefit from this.&quot; As in Britain, the big names \u2013 among them Coop and Esselunga \u2013 were jolted by the arrival of discount stores selling similar products for much lower prices. Before long, consumers saw ever more vigorous battles over the prices of Easter eggs and Christmas panettoni, with loyalty card schemes vying with extravagant cuts for the best results. Lizzy Davies United States  For the past 25 years America&apos;s grocery shopping habits have been dominated by the &quot;supercentre&quot;. Many thought the dominance of massive, out-of-town stores \u2013 mainly owned by Walmart \u2013 would kill local supermarkets. But something is changing. This year Kroger, the US&apos;s largest supermarket chain, will pass $100bn revenue mark, despite having no presence overseas. This local chain has now enjoyed 43 consecutive quarters of growth. Walmart has taken note and is trying to get back into smaller, urban supermarkets after spending years trying to kill them off. John Rand of Kantar Retail in Boston has spent 47 years watching the US grocery business. The landscape, he said, had seldom been so competitive. &quot;There was a generation of shoppers who were fairly comfortable with a long, weekly shopping trip,&quot; he said. &quot;It was like the early days of America, with people going to market day once a week.&quot; But he said today&apos;s harried consumer wanted more convenience and to spend less time in the aisles. The result has been an increase in the number of options available to consumers. Where once they had two or three local competitors, now they have four. &quot;But still, if you are number four in that group, you are in trouble,&quot; he said. Dominic Rushe  Australia The Australian grocery industry has for years been characterised by a battle between two giants. Together, supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths control roughly 70% of the A$82bn (\u00a344.5bn) sector. Aggressive price wars between the two are very visible, which is good for consumers but not so much for suppliers. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has carpeted both for their practices, and Jamie Oliver was dragged into the row when farmers complained of being charged a levy by Woolworths to pay for an ad campaign featuring his brand. Coles and Woolies&apos; vast influence doesn&apos;t end at the grocery checkout. Their operations extend into alcohol, convenience stores, fuel, hardware, general goods, hotels and gambling. What&apos;s left of the market is fought over by independents \u2013 especially Metcash, which runs IGA, Foodland and other franchise brands \u2013 and big discounters such as Aldi and Costco. Aldi has made huge gains in market share in Australia, from about 3% in 2005 to 10% this year, with sales projected to keep increasing. Naturally this raises alarm bells for the big two and their duopoly. Jim Poe Japan   Tesco is one of several foreign supermarkets to have tried and failed to succeed in Japan&apos;s notoriously challenging retail market. The firm pulled out of Japan in 2011 after spending eight years and \u00a3250m attempting to woo Japan&apos;s picky shoppers customers and navigate the country&apos;s labyrinthine distribution system. Japan&apos;s retail market, the second-biggest in the world, includes myriad supermarket chains, some of which operate only a handful of stores. Despite the fragmentation, a battle for control was emerging amid the arrival of new players and a flurry of mergers and acquisitions, said Roy Larke, an expert on Japanese consumer trends. Japan&apos;s biggest seller of food is now 7-Eleven, while the biggest supermarket chain, Aeon, has taken advantage of the regionally diverse food supply system by opening a string of local subsidiaries. The market is far from impenetrable, however. Walmart, the only &quot;everyday low pricing&quot; operator in Japan, has forced domestic rivals to keep their prices low where it operates stores. Costco, with 20 stores nationwide, has proved a success, offering prices comparable to those found in the US. Tesco&apos;s foray into Japan was frustrated, in part, by consumer idiosyncrasies. While bogof promotions are rare, individual supermarkets launch special deals every week, prompting shoppers to switch loyalties in search of a bargain. Justin McCurry  China To the UK&apos;s beleaguered supermarkets, China may look like a gold mine. The country&apos;s grocery industry became the world&apos;s largest in 2012, and, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution, reached US$1tn last summer, more than three times the size of the UK&apos;s. Yet the market is fractured and highly competitive. While western companies such as Walmart, Tesco, Metro and Carrefour have been operating in the country for years, if not decades, they&apos;re increasingly vying with a cohort of local chains, discount shops and convenience stores for customers who would often rather shop online. &quot;The top 10 or 12 companies represent less than half of the market,&quot; said Matthew Crabbe, of market research firm Mintel. Many foreign chains are expanding into second, third and fourth-tier cities, far from the bright lights and saturated markets of Beijing and Shanghai. Yet even there, supermarket chains are struggling. Local competition is fierce, the economy is slowing and e-commerce is on the rise. In 2013, Walmart, Carrefour and Tesco saw their mainland expansion slow by 27%. Walmart shut down five branches. &quot;All of these chains have realized they really need to localize and understand their market,&quot; Crabbe said. &quot;It&apos;s not about covering as much of the country as possible; it&apos;s about adapting to the regions you move into,&quot; said Crabbe. Some regions demand ample supplies of live fish, for example; others can&apos;t be without certain types of vegetables. Convenience stores are proliferating in pedestrian-friendly cities such as Shanghai; hypermarkets remain the model of choice in traffic-choked Beijing. Jonathan Kaiman  South Africa  For tourists to South Africa the big five means wild animals, but for supermarket shoppers it&apos;s a choice between Shoprite, Massmart, Pick n Pay, Spar and Woolworths. The competition is intense, with each regularly hyping loss-leading bargains, albeit not yet at cut-throat British levels. Many analysts believed the landscape would be transformed by the entrance in 2011 of Walmart, whose $2.4bn (\u00a31.5bn) takeover of Massmart was fiercely opposed by trade unions. The company declared a price war but its footprint remains relatively small compared to giants such as the Shoprite group, whose chief executive, Whitey Basson, is South African retail royalty. Meanwhile premium retailer Woolworths, the country&apos;s equivalent of Marks &amp; Spencer, is currently thriving despite being 24% more expensive than Pick n Pay on fresh food, according to a JP Morgan supermarket pricing survey published earlier this year. Woolworths&apos; profits were up 15% in the year ending 29 June. It seems South Africa&apos;s growing middle class are willing to pay.

But a new study from the Institute of Education (IoE) at the University of London concludes that the children of immigrants from these countries when educated elsewhere continue to score just as highly within no-better-than-average school systems. The study, by Dr John Jerrim, reader in education and social statistics at the IoE, found that children of immigrants from high-achieving east Asian countries are still two-and-a-half years ahead of their western peers by the time they are 15, even when they are educated alongside them in western-style schools. Jerrim studied the performance of more than 14,000 Australian schoolchildren who took the 2012 Pisa maths test, set by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and found that second-generation immigrants from east Asia, who were mostly of Chinese origin, scored on average 605 points \u2013 102 points more than Australian-born citizens. Their results were only beaten by the Shanghai region of China, which came out top in the Pisa rankings. By contrast, second-generation immigrants in Australia from the UK scored 512 in the Pisa maths test. In England, children of Chinese origin have the highest GCSE scores of any ethnic group \u2013 last year, 78% gained at least five A*-C GCSEs, compared with a national average of 60%. The UK, in common with other countries, has been keen to learn from the success of Asian education systems. In July, the Department for Education (DfE) announced an \u00a311m initiative to bring 50 Shanghai maths teachers to England this year to help raise standards. The Chinese teachers will provide masterclasses in 32 \u201cmaths hubs\u201d, which will form a network of centres of excellence across England. Yet Jerrim warns policymakers not to be guided by Pisa scores alone. \u201cHigh-ranking Pisa countries may well provide western policymakers with valuable insights into how their own education systems might be improved. But any subsequent policy action must be supported by a wider evidence base \u2013 policymakers should not rely upon Pisa alone. \u201cFor instance, one does not want to erroneously conclude that rote learning helps to improve children\u2019s maths skills, simply because this technique is often practised within east Asian schools. Indeed, the fact that children of east Asian heritage perform just as highly in the Australian education system (whose schools and teachers do not routinely use such techniques) would actually seem to contradict such views.\u201d Jerrim continued: \u201cThe attitudes and beliefs east Asian parents instil in their children make an important contribution to their high levels of academic achievement. Yet as such factors are heavily influenced by culture and home environment, they are likely to be beyond the control of schools. Greater recognition needs to be given to this point in public discourse. Indeed, policymakers should make it clear that there are many influences upon a country\u2019s Pisa performance, and that climbing significantly up these rankings is unlikely to be achieved by the efforts of schools alone.\u201d Children taking the Pisa test completed a background questionnaire asking about their parents\u2019 country of birth, attitudes to education, their own aspirations and out-of-school activities, which Jerrim used to explore other factors that may play a part in the immigrant children\u2019s school success. His study then used advanced statistical analysis to gauge their relative importance. Jerrim concludes that family background factors such as parental education accounted for almost 20% of the 102-point achievement gap between East Asians and native Australians \u2013 half of the 276 second-generation east Asian children had graduate fathers, compared with only a quarter of the 6,837 Australian-born children. A further 40% of the gap between east Asian and native Australian children (the equivalent of a year\u2019s school progress) was accounted for by a range of school factors. \u201cI found that, on average, east Asian families send their children to \u2018better\u2019 schools than native Australians do,\u201d Jerrim says. \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure why this occurs. Their school selection may, of course, reflect the high value east Asian parents place on education. What is clear, however, is that a range of school effects (including the positive influence of fellow pupils as well as the quality of the school) form a key part of the reason that east Asian children in Australia are doing so well.\u201d A combination of out-of-school factors and personal characteristics accounted for another 25% of the Pisa score gap. East Asian children spent substantially more time studying after school (15 hours a week) than native Australian teenagers (nine hours). They had a very strong work ethic and were more likely to believe that they could succeed if they tried hard enough \u2013 although there was no evidence that they had put more effort into the Pisa maths test. They also had higher aspirations; 94% of them expected to go on to university, compared with 58% of the native Australians.", "tags": ["Asia Pacific", "Teaching", "China", "South Korea", "Education", "World news", "Children", "University of London", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-08T23:01:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/09/andy-murray-david-ferrer-shanghai-masters", "sentences": ["The Scot was beaten 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 by David Ferrer in the last 16 of the Shanghai Masters on Thursday, a defeat which that lifts the Spaniard above him to ninth place in the qualifying race.", "While Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer have already qualified, many of his rivals have struggled to make an impression in Shanghai."], "title": "Andy Murray beaten by David Ferrer in third round of Shanghai Masters", "article": "Andy Murray has suffered a setback in his bid to qualify for the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London next month. The Scot was beaten 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 by David Ferrer in the last 16 of the Shanghai Masters on Thursday, a defeat which that lifts the Spaniard above him to ninth place in the qualifying race. Only the top eight players in the standings at the end of this month will reach the O2 Arena finals, Fresh from winning the tournament in Shenzhen and then last week reaching the semi-finals of the China Open in Beijing, Murray made a strong start against the world No5. The 27-year-old broke Ferrer in his first service game and dominated the opening set in which he dropped only four points on his own serve. But Ferrer hit back straight away in the second as he started to attack Murray more and immediately earned his first break, which he built on to take the set comfortably. As Murray\u2019s game began to unravel Ferrer pressed home his advantage, breaking twice more in the decider while Murray failed to fashion a single break point opportunity. However, it is not all bad news for Murray, who still has three weeks of tournaments including the Paris Masters in which to muscle into the top eight. While Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer have already qualified, many of his rivals have struggled to make an impression in Shanghai. Murray is now within touching distance of Milos Raonic, who withdrew in the first round due to illness, while Stan Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori, Marin Cilic and Grigor Dimitrov - who sits behind Murray in 11th place - all suffered earlier defeats. I needed to play my best tennis today,\u201d Ferrer told the ATP World Tour website. \u201cI think this match was very important for both players. Today was a good victory.\u201d Murray, who joined world number two Rafa Nadal, Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka and US Open finalist Kei Nishikori in exiting the tournament before the quarter-final stage, was generous in his praise for Ferrer. \u201cHe barely missed a ball for about a set and a half,\u201d said Murray. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a way around him. He played just great tennis, especially the last set and a half. \u201c(At) the beginning of the second set I still had a couple of opportunities there right at the beginning. But after that, I\u2019ve got to give it to him, he played fantastically well and deserved to win.\u201d Murray said he had not made up his mind yet about where he would compete next as he bids to qualify for the ATP Finals for the seventh successive year. \u201cWe\u2019ll see over the next few days where I decide to go. Hopefully I can play well the last couple of tournaments, try and make a push for London,\u201d he added. However there is a chance that even finishing inside the top eight will not be enough for Murray to make it to London. A loophole which reserves one place in London for a grand slam champion who does not qualify could yet be implemented should US Open champion Cilic fail to make it, much to Murray\u2019s annoyance. \u201cIf the ATP want their tournaments to be the most important tournaments, which I think they do \u2013 it\u2019s the ATP World Tour Finals \u2013 you would hope that the players who would get in would be those who accumulate the most points across the whole year on the ATP tour,\u201d Murray said before his match against Ferrer. \u201cBut by putting the grand slam champions in then they would be saying the grand slams are the most important events. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve put a lot of my time and effort and training into getting prepared for the grand slams and playing the best-of-five-set matches. They mean a lot to all the players. If Marin was to get in placed ninth, he would deserve to be there. Winning the US Open is a great achievement. \u201cBut if you want to protect your own tour, then you need to make sure that the tournaments that we are playing throughout the whole year are seen as being just as important as the other ones.\u201d", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Sport", "Tennis"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-09T08:58:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/10/china-water-dilemma-farming-growing-urban-population", "sentences": ["This, in turn, catalysed growth in the wider rural economy and, as China\u2019s rural inhabitants got richer, so they moved to growing towns and cities, building \u2013 literally \u2013 the skylines of Beijing, Shanghai and other megacities."], "title": "China's water dilemma between farming and growing population", "article": "In an increasingly volatile world, China\u2019s economic growth has proved remarkably resilient. While the economies of Europe and America have stalled or nose-dived since the 2008 financial crash, China\u2019s has continued to expand. The headlines are startling: since the early 1990s, GDP growth per capita has averaged 8.9%, and nearly 600 million people have been lifted out of poverty. Perhaps less well known is the fact that China\u2019s growth was kick-started by investment in agriculture. This, in turn, catalysed growth in the wider rural economy and, as China\u2019s rural inhabitants got richer, so they moved to growing towns and cities, building \u2013 literally \u2013 the skylines of Beijing, Shanghai and other megacities.  In the meantime, China\u2019s agricultural economy has motored on. Despite rapid urbanisation, and an economy now driven by industry rather than farming, the country is still able to feed over 20% of the world\u2019s population. Maintaining self-sufficiency in wheat and rice remains ideologically important, even if imports of feed grains for meat production have soared over recent years. But agriculture \u2013 and particularly the irrigated agriculture that supports food production in the drier north of the country \u2013 needs water. And as other parts of the economy have boomed, water scarcity is biting hard. This has created something of a dilemma for China\u2019s ruling Community Party (CCP): how can it safeguard food production, and the incomes of China\u2019s farmers, while releasing water to increasingly thirsty urban and industrial users? Globally, roughly 70% of freshwater withdrawals go to agriculture, followed by industrial and domestic sectors (roughly 20%) and power generation (10%, and increasing). Not all of these uses are \u2018consumptive\u2019, in the sense that water diverted is also used up. Hydropower, for example, is not a big consumptive user. But agriculture is, and in a growing economy, \u2018who gets what\u2019 in terms of water allocation is both economically significant, and hugely political. In strict economic terms, water should be allocated to its most valuable uses \u2013 outside agriculture. But the farming lobby in most countries has sharp political teeth, and in China\u2019s case, the political legitimacy of the CCP \u2013 already under strain \u2013 is still bound up with the welfare of its peasant forbearers. Faced with this dilemma, and realising that investments in \u2018new\u2019 water developments can\u2019t continue indefinitely with a fixed supply, China has turned its attention to managing demand. And China has made significant progress, as a new report from research think-tank ODI makes clear, despite well-rehearsed problems of environmental degradation.  Getting more \u2018crop per drop\u2019 has been key. China\u2019s agricultural productivity has more than doubled since 1990, its total irrigated area has increased by over 30%, and its per capita grain yield has risen by over 10%. Yet over the same period, agricultural water withdrawals per hectare of irrigated land have declined by over 20%.  Despite progress, however, agricultural water withdrawals still account for over 60% of the total, and the CCP has been reluctant to implement stricter regulatory or water pricing reforms that might hurt farmers and hit food production, particularly in a country wracked by famine as recently as the 1950s. As so often happens in China, policy makers have experimented with different reforms to see what works. In northern China\u2019s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, for example, officials have initiated a novel water transfer programme aimed at alleviating water shortages for downstream industrial users on the Yellow River.  The programme transfers water saved in agriculture to downstream users, with the costs of water saving in irrigation met directly by industrial beneficiaries. By the end of 2014, roughly 170m cubic metres per year of \u2018saved\u2019 water will be transferred from irrigation to industry, keeping both farmers and industries happy.  Meanwhile, officials are setting up a water bank that will buy under-used water rights and transfer them to thirstier areas and users. In the words of one official, \u201cWe can\u2019t change the price of water we charge to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s fixed [at roughly one cent per cubic metre]. But we can help farmers use less, and make sure the water is transferred to those who really need it\u201d. Elsewhere, different approaches are reaping rewards. On the North China Plain, a densely populated and strategically important grain-growing area of some 400,000 square kilometres, sophisticated remote sensing techniques are being used to help cap groundwater withdrawals.  The aim here is to measure and control the amount of water actually consumed in growing crops (through evaporation and transpiration), rather than simply withdrawn from underground aquifers. The situation is urgent: water levels in some areas are dropping by more than one metre per year, threatening food production. The challenges are enormous, and China is not about to solve its water problems in a few years. Left unchecked, water scarcity and pollution threaten not just food and economic security, but the political legitimacy of the CCP itself. But progress is being made. Reform is a delicate balancing act, particularly where farmers and food security are concerned. Getting the balance right will determine whether China can continue to feed itself, grow economically and protect its precious ecosystems.

Clarkson was consulted about the line-up, which, according to Tim Davie, the chief executive of BBC Worldwide, the corporation\u2019s commercial arm, could have featured a woman. However, in the end, Worldwide and its Chinese production partners plumped for three men: pop star turned professional motor-racer Richie Jen, former Olympic diver Tian Liang and Chinese Idol presenter Cheng Lei. China is the biggest market Top Gear has launched a local version in \u2013 with a potential audience of hundreds of millions. Chinese Top Gear is due to air on national broadcaster Shanghai Dragon TV in early November. The hit show already holds the Guinness Book of World Records title for most watched factual programme in the world \u2013 200 territories \u2013 and has local versions in the US and South Korea but, as Top Gear commercial director Duncan Gray said, China is a \u201chuge market and opportunity\u201d. Chinese Top Gear will feature a Chinese Stig, plus familiar features such as a star in a reasonably-priced car and a studio audience with banter linking the films. According to the BBC\u2019s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, the Chinese show \u201cwill mirror the UK show\u2019s irreverent humour, presenter camaraderie, epic races, outrageous stunts and challenges, unique celebrity guest participation, and its often eccentric methods of testing cars\u201d. However, as Gray said, it has been adapted to appeal to a Chinese audience: \u201cOften in foreign language markets creating it with local sensibilities and the local culture in mind is the much better proposition. \u201cThere are certain elements of the format where we need to let them make it the best way for their audiences. We want them to discuss matters that relate to cars in China.\u201d He refused to rule out having a female host in the \u201cnear future\u201d. \u201cWhen casting international versions of Top Gear we always try to bring together talent that have displayed a passion for the subject and a certain on-screen chemistry. \u201cThus far we\u2019ve had all-male presenter line-ups but that\u2019s not to say there couldn\u2019t be a female presenter in the near future.\u201d In addition to China, BBC Worldwide is planning more local versions of Top Gear, including a French one. But, with the current row in South America over a controversial \u201cFalklands\u201d registration plate on a Porsche due to be used in the UK Top Gear Christmas special, it is unlikely there are plans at the moment for an Argentinian one. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Changsha may be known as China\u2019s \u201centertainment city\u201d, but that\u2019s mainly because of its thriving TV industry \u2013 the Hunan capital is renowned for churning out popular, mass-market shows such as The Voice.  When it comes to music, though \u2013 in particular the less mainstream genres \u2013 it can be a struggle getting things off the ground. For instance, when I went to check out local hip-hop group C-Block on my second night here, my main contact in Changsha, Li Ren, explained some of the problems music promoters face: \u201cC-Block had originally had a show booked in another place, but they sold so many tickets that it was cancelled by the police department.  \u201cVenues are under really strict scrutiny from the culture department as well as the police. They don\u2019t see that what we are promoting is trying to enrich our people\u2019s lives. They just think about the crowds and how you\u2019re trying to sell them drinks to make money. So the owners of venues such as 46 Live House or Red Live House, they do it only for the love of music. They could just open a regular bar to make money, but instead they book bands and take the risk of the police coming along to close them down.\u201d Another problem is the struggle to introduce new and challenging forms of music to a public who are simply not used to it, which is very much the case with Changsha\u2019s emerging jazz scene. Jazz has been played in China since the 1930s but the country under Mao largely lost touch with the genre. Nowadays there are healthy jazz scenes in Beijing and Shanghai, but in a mid-sized city (for China) such as Changsha, live jazz music has been played only for the past few years.         Janne Schra &amp; Robin Nolan Trio in performance    The fact that live jazz is here at all is largely down to two men: jazz drummer Funky, who has played shows across the world, and his business partner Mr Chen. Together, they opened up the first jazz club in Changsha six years ago, called Foyou (\u201cFor you\u201d), before going on to set up the city\u2019s international jazz festival, which is now in its fifth year. But it hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cWith the public, there is a misunderstanding about the concept of jazz,\u201d explains Mr Chen when I meet him at the venue he runs, Red Live House. \u201cI think their understanding of jazz stays in the 1930s. But we live in a modern era, so I feel the people should listen to modern jazz.\u201d Financing events such as the festival is a huge struggle, given the government has so far proved unwilling to offer support. \u201cChangsha international jazz festival is the only festival supported by private enterprise alone, without any support from the government or other funds,\u201d Mr Chen says. \u201cAll the private sponsorship [we do get] is limited. Given the experience of the last five years, I would say my feeling for the next five years is a hopeless one \u2026 but I will continue doing this anyway.\u201d If his outlook seems somewhat pessimistic, Mr Chen should take heart from what his festival has achieved in such a short time. The second year, in 2011, saw it move from Foyou to the large grand theatre and attract some big names through Funky\u2019s contacts (\u201cWe were losing money, but it made fame for the organisation\u201d). The festival now attracts an audience of thousands and has won respect around the city. By last year\u2019s fourth event, Mr Chen had opened Red Live House, and the festival featured the first local jazz act, Easy Band. (Those following these blogs will remember that Easy Band were the backing group for Sam Genders\u2019s debut performance in Changsha.)         Janne Schra &amp; Robin Nolan Trio in performance    All of which brings us to another problem: maintaining local relationships. Easy Band have not been booked for this year\u2019s fifth festival and, aggrieved at their exclusion, have since refused to play at Red Live House. When I spoke to them, they talked about not receiving enough money for their performance the previous year (they claim to have received just \u00a5300, roughly \u00a330), and they felt strongly enough that when they stepped in as Genders\u2019s backing band, they insisted he move his show from Red Live House to 46 Live House across town. For his part, Mr Chen says it was \u201cspecial\u201d to have a local band playing the festival last year, and that he doesn\u2019t fully understand the disagreement. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal and we should not be stressful about it,\u201d he says. However, a bit of probing reveals that he\u2019s not entirely against sticking the knife in: \u201cI do think their quality has not improved since last year. They\u2019re not working hard to improve their artistic ability.\u201d  \u2022 The Musicians in China Residencies programme is a partnership project between the British Council, the UK\u2019s international organisation for educational opportunities and cultural relations, and the PRS for Music Foundation.", "tags": ["Jazz", "Music", "China", "Culture", "China holidays", "Asia"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-10T12:46:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/11/said-done-carlo-tavecchio-movie-news-and-the-north-jiangsu-dogs", "sentences": ["We too are the victims of this uncivilised behaviour.\u201d Denial of the week China: Shanghai TV anchor Zhou Liang sacked for calling visiting Jiangsu Sainty players \u201cdogs\u201d ahead of their game against Shanghai Shenhua."], "title": "Said & Done: Carlo Tavecchio; movie news; and the north Jiangsu dogs", "article": "Campaigner of the week Italy\u2019s FA head Carlo Tavecchio: asking Fifa to trial video replays in Serie A.

He remembers how the plague spread. It was subtle at first. One biennial led to another. There was a sudden rash of Expos. It was one of those things that friends thought would be a fad, he suggests, but after the millennium dotcom crash and the collapse of the art market, the pandemic spread as the art world panicked and desperately tried to resuscitate itself as an asset class. There are now 50 or more international shows, from Dubai to Shanghai to S\u00e3o Paulo, one for every week of the year, following the money, flogging product. Fischl steered clear of all of them for a long while, but finally went to the shiniest of the lot, Art Basel Miami Beach, a couple of years ago, at the request of New Yorker magazine, for an interview. He became grimly fascinated by the spectacle, took a camera with him there and subsequently to Frieze New York, and to the fair in Southampton up the road from his home in Sag Harbor, Great Gatsby country. Fischl then made Photoshop collages of his hundreds of photos, creating scenes that might have happened. He gestures to the fabulous painting behind me. \u201cThe big sneakers here are from a show of Claes Oldenburg\u2019s. The guy with his back to us was a guard at that show. She on the left was from an art fair at Southampton. That guy was from Miami. I mix and match. Same crowd, different clothes. But always the same experience.\u201d An exhibition of Fischl\u2019s art-show paintings (priced between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3400,000) will open at the Victoria Miro Gallery, in London, this week, to coincide with the Frieze art fair. He hopes that people can go to Frieze and then come to his show and see what they looked like at Frieze. If you have never been to Frieze, his paintings capture much of its dead-eyed atmosphere, its comic and dispiriting juxtapositions. In Fischl\u2019s Art Fair: Booth #4 The Price, a distracted crowd of buyers cluster around an amorphous Ken Price sculpture, not looking. Behind them, an enormous intimate self-portrait by Joan Semmel goes unremarked. \u201cThe big collectors do this kind of speed-dating thing,\u201d Fischl says. \u201cThey try to get in and out before anyone buys what they are after and certainly before the hoi polloi gets to look. And then you\u2019ve got people who are just there for the social scene. So you have people texting or not paying any attention at all. It is as if the art is not there, or that they think it has no effect on them. But when you stop the moment you can see this weird world that is taking place. They are being regarded and judged by the work itself in some ways.\u201d In my experience, I suggest, Frieze provides exactly the enervating experience of a Saturday afternoon at Brent Cross shopping mall, except some of the stuff on sale is priced in the millions. Wealth becomes the spectacle, not art. \u201cIf you start with the premise,\u201d Fischl says, \u201cand I know it is a romantic and naive premise, but I none the less think it is true, that artists are looking for love, and they are expressing love in their commitment to what they have made. An art fair is designed so they never get any in return.\u201d He speaks languidly and laughs broadly. \u201cLove is complicated, obviously. But the reason artists do what they do on some level is to say: \u2018Don\u2019t look at me, look at this thing I made and you will know the true me.\u2019\u201d Fischl himself developed that particular faith as a young painter in the 1970s when he started to try to express himself on canvas, first at CalArts, the Disney-funded art college outside Los Angeles, and later in Nova Scotia, where he took a teaching job and met his wife, the celebrated landscape artist April Gornik, and finally in New York. In a world of abstract expressionism and conceptualism he became part of that endangered species, a figurative painter, a storyteller. Despite this self-imposed handicap, by 1985 Andy Warhol was describing Fischl in his diary as \u201cthe hot new top artist\u201d; he was the subject of a long Vanity Fair profile entitled \u201cBad Boy of Brilliance\u201d which compared him favourably to celebrity artist peers such as Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat; and his paintings were suddenly selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. To understand how Fischl found himself at the centre of that world, a version of which he now satirises 30 years on, you have to understand where he came from. The paintings that made Fischl\u2019s name were drawn from an adolescence spent up the road from where he now lives, in a town called Port Washington. His father went into New York City every day selling promotional films to corporations in the days before video. His mother, spirited and beautiful, was also an out-of-control alcoholic, the \u201cunspeakable\u201d open secret that Fischl, his brother and two sisters did all they could to contain in their suburban idyll. Fischl\u2019s early paintings exhibited a disturbing kind of voyeurism, in scenes that might have been written by John Cheever or John Updike. The two defining paintings of that period \u2014 Bad Boy, which depicts a young boy standing before a woman, perhaps his mother, sprawled naked on a bed, while he feels for her handbag; and Sleepwalker, in which a teenager masturbates in a paddling pool, bathed in Edward Hopper light \u2013 were representative of the uncertain boundaries, the disquieting taboos, that became his constant theme. Fischl depicted the fallout of early 1960s America at war with inhibition, and deeply troubled by that fact. In his recent memoir, also entitled Bad Boy, he recalls a youth in which his parents talked openly about their sex life and \u201clounged around their bedroom \u2013 where we\u2019d visit after dinner to watch TV \u2013 completely naked\u201d. When his mother was drinking, which was often, \u201cher whole face seemed pinched and pulled back. Her artificial expression, a Kabuki-like mask, reminded me of a terrifying drag queen. It was impossible to predict what she might do\u2026 \u201d Impossible, that was, until the day, not long after he had started art school, when Fischl was called to say his mother was critically ill in hospital after driving her car into a tree, an act of suicide. Fischl got back home just before she died and was overwhelmed by the fact he had \u201cnot been strong enough, smart enough\u201d to save her from herself. He subsequently became a painter of what had been \u201cunspeakable\u201d because, he wrote, on \u201csome level I wanted to make her life good\u201d. What did he mean by that? \u201cIt was a thing my therapist spent many years trying to get me past,\u201d he says. \u201cThe tragedy of her life was that she was creative and intelligent and stimulating, and if she had channelled that in a different way she could have been amazing. She tried art but she lacked the stubbornness to do it. She couldn\u2019t get past the self-critical thing we all have and she would destroy it or fuck it up or not finish it. When she killed herself, I felt I was making art for her. I thought I could make her pain less by succeeding at this thing where she had failed. Which of course makes it pretty hard to own your own success\u2026 \u201d It took him many years of messing about with abstraction, and other strategies, to realise he had to confront those experiences head on. \u201cI actually found it harder to paint a specific chair in a scene than to paint the woman passed out on the floor. Somehow the woman passed out on the floor could have been any woman. The chair became something closer to my particular experience. The first brave step was doing that.\u201d     Eric Fischl with one of his art-fair paintings. Photograph: Ralph Gibson    Did it feel liberating? \u201cIt was empowering ultimately,\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose if I had gotten crushed by the critical reception the way I feared when I started to make these paintings I wouldn\u2019t have continued. When the pictures were embraced, however, I went further and further into it.\u201d The breakthrough was Sleepwalker. \u201cI started to try to paint in a representational manner,\u201d Fischl says, \u201cand it was a stretch because I had never been trained that way. My drawing skills were iffy. Trying to render flesh. I was learning in this painting and people tried to persuade me off it. I was being told: \u2018You have to find a way of making it look more contemporary.\u2019 I went through a thousand possible ways to do that but it was always everybody else\u2019s idea. In the end I was left with myself. That is something that all artists ultimately have to find: the thing that they can do that doesn\u2019t look like art.\u201d It seems strange to be talking to a contemporary artist about emotional authenticity, about representation, and about the influence of Degas and Manet rather than Warhol and Joseph Beuys. \u201cThere are two kinds of painter, if you like,\u201d Fischl says at one point. \u201cOne is somebody like Hopper who creates an image that burns on your retina and you never forget it. You can see it, walk away and still see it. [With] the other kind you are caught up in the authenticity of the energy. The believable moment. Jackson Pollock, you are right there with him. I am essentially the Hopper artist trying to create a frozen moment. The truth about how it actually was.\u201d Despite that commitment, or because of it, Fischl found himself co-opted into the wild and whirling art world of 1980s New York \u2013 his first experience of the milieu he has lately been documenting. Warhol visited his studio, and offered his blessing. \u201cHe sought out youth, he was always curious about what was going on,\u201d Fischl recalls. \u201cMost of the artists we admired wanted to be outside society looking in. Warhol wanted to be right at the centre of high society and still be radical. It was as if he wanted to infect it from the inside out.\u201d Looking back on what quickly became a frenzy of parties and gallery openings and cocaine and booze and money \u2013 which had little to do with his original change-the-world ambitions for his art \u2013 Fischl admits it was nevertheless \u201call incredibly exciting. It was like a spinning world, it had real centrifugal force. Traditional art magazines couldn\u2019t keep up so the dailies took their place. Artist\u2019s photographs were appearing in the arts and entertainment pages next to those of rock stars and film stars. It was like a wave had picked us up.\u201d Fischl was beached not long after just as surely. After one bender too many, after the opening of a solo New York show, and a near car crash, he knew he had to remove himself from the centrifugal world he found himself in. He has a sense that he inherited his mother\u2019s addictive gene, and that he had welcomed the self-destructive aspect of it in some way \u201cin order to survive it, to prove it could be done\u201d. With premonitions of an art world about to finally sell its soul he packed up his studio in New York, moved with April Gornik the two hours out here \u2013 following an artists\u2019 path trodden by Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and others \u2014 and swapped his previous narcotic highs for more life-affirming ones. Fischl counts Steve Martin and John McEnroe among his closest friends. After McEnroe opened a gallery in New York on his retirement, Fischl tutored him in art history in return for tennis lessons. He plays most days, sometimes with McEnroe himself, and likes to make connections between his game and his work (\u201cboth are performed in a rectangle, and are about gesture and reach and executing an intention, resistance\u201d). He and Gornik bought some land and built their beautiful, brutal 10,000 sq ft minimalist home on the edge of a salt marsh, complete with matching studios. They moved in on millennium eve and Fischl entered what he calls, with a laugh, \u201chis long mid-career period\u201d. From this vantage, Fischl believes himself to be an outsider to the kind of world he describes in his art-show paintings. His work has continued to sell \u2013 his record for a single picture was the $1.9m paid for his painting Daddy\u2019s Girl in 2006 \u2013 and he has moved on from adolescent angst to document and interpret the worlds he now inhabits. He has cast, for example, his unnerving eye over the plutocrats at play in St Tropez as well as the Hamptons. He is surprised at the way his career has gone. \u201cI had this idea that I was making work that would be shown in museums but that nobody would really want to live with,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean who the fuck wants to wake up and have breakfast with somebody jerking off in a pool? I overestimated museums, though. They were the ones that wanted to put up warning signs in front of the work, whereas the private sector bought it. I would have liked it to be more a public art.\u201d That particular frustration has crystallised recently around two projects, which were the real cause of his decision to turn his painter\u2019s eye to the art world itself. Both projects were made in response to what he saw as the fracture in US culture after 9/11, and the inability of the art world to address it.     Victoria Falls, 2013 by Eric Fischl. Photograph: Courtesy the artist/Victoria Miro, London and Mary Boone Gallery    In 2002 Fischl, who has been working more and more in sculpture since he moved to Long Island, made a public statue, Tumbling Woman, which was to be a permanent fixture at the Rockefeller centre in New York. The life-size bronze sculpture \u2013 he has a smaller version outside his studio \u2013 shows a human figure apparently in free fall, just above the ground, as if in suspended animation. \u201c9/11 was so profoundly shocking \u2013 that we could be that vulnerable, that powerless,\u201d Fischl says. \u201cAnd it was combined with something really freaky: 3,000 people died and there were no bodies. How do you process the mourning? It was like a surreal disappearance. The only way we knew how horrific it had been was in the images of the people who jumped out the windows, that they would choose to die that way. Right away though, the media self-censored and got rid of those images. I thought that was wrong.\u201d When Fischl\u2019s simple human sculpture was unveiled, there was an outcry. A New York Post columnist suggested it was a cruel and self-serving image and accused him of \u201criding on the backs of those who had suffered grief and loss in an effort to revive a moribund career\u201d. After that he became public enemy number one. Who fought his corner? \u201cNobody. My dealer tried to protect me a bit from the hysteria. Friends in the press said I should let it drop. The guy who owned Rockefeller Centre, a big art patron in the city, removed the sculpture. He told me he was getting bomb threats and he couldn\u2019t take the risk.\u201d Fischl laughs bleakly. \u201cI told him: \u2018No one is going to bomb you over a statue.\u2019 But that is the world we live in.\u201d Nearly a decade later, in another effort to use art to help communities come together around an idea of America, he laid plans for a touring art show, a basis for a national conversation called \u201cNow and Here\u201d. The idea was to have the nation\u2019s leading artists and poets and musicians make a travelling event that would offer an alternative to the tribal and polarised nature of political debate. \u201cWe have been screaming and yelling at each other for years. Still are. I believed art could provide images as a starting point for dialogue. I thought the hard part would be getting the artists with these huge international reputations to get together and think about the same thing at the same moment for once,\u201d Fischl says. \u201cBut of course it turned out to be the opposite. The artists were easily persuaded but the money \u2013 we tried for funding from corporations and billionaires \u2013 never was.\u201d Fischl was told again that his idea was just a careerist strategy, as if that was the only reason any artist might do anything. \u201cInstead of any grown-up conversation, what we have instead, what America apparently wants, is artists who are doing very expensive toys,\u201d he says. \u201cJeff Koons is a good example. What kind of culture expresses itself only in childlike behaviour? Shit jokes and childish humour \u2013 and is greeted with huge popularity.\u201d Fischl\u2019s art-show paintings, for all their cool comic appeal, were made to portray the emptiness of that compact. \u201cThat world has just become a celebration of money-making,\u201d Fischl says. \u201cI went to a fair a few weeks ago and in the middle of this thing was a De Kooning painting. I thought \u2018Wow!\u2019 It turned out it was in a booth for a real estate company. They had this De Kooning for sale as well as the $40m homes. You could buy the house and get the painting for an extra $5m or whatever. The barriers have collapsed between the commercial and the art world. It is not irony \u2013 it is just cynicism. The work is not intended to have you look and think twice, which is what irony does. It\u2019s cynical in that they couldn\u2019t give a shit whether you get it or you don\u2019t get it.\u201d Some of the people in his paintings are clearly recognisable, though he is not interested in putting names to faces. Has he had any response? \u201cI did have one experience where a girl in one of the paintings saw it at the New York Frieze show and called me the next day to say she believed she was in my painting. She was really thrilled of course. The thing is we don\u2019t see ourselves as characters \u2013 so I think people will look and not always see themselves. And anyway, 10 years from now no one will know any people in it.\u201d Does he believe that all those who recognise themselves as faces in the art crowd see it as a form of flattery? \u201cI don\u2019t really care, to be honest,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me it is more like an admission that this is my world and this is what it looks like.\u201d Eric Fischl: Art Fair Paintings is at Victoria Miro, London, from Tuesday until 19 December at the Victoria Miro gallery, 16 Wharf Road, London N1 ", "tags": ["Painting", "Art", "Art and design", "The art market", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-12T08:00:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/12/world-endurance-championship-anthony-davidson-fuji", "sentences": ["It suggests a tough close to the season is in store for the German marque given similar types of circuit at the final three races, Shanghai on 2 November, Bahrain and S\u00e3o Paulo, and a promising finish for the victorious Toyota squad."], "title": "World Endurance Championship: Anthony Davidson dominates in Fuji", "article": "Britain\u2019s Anthony Davidson, alongside his team-mate S\u00e9bastien Buemi, took a dominant victory at the six hours of Fuji on Sunday, taking the flag for Toyota after 236 laps with an advantage of almost 26 seconds from their sister car. Their win here, at the fifth round of the World Endurance Championship, also extends their lead at the top of the drivers\u2019 table, with three races to run. Their No8 Toyota had held the lead almost from pole, with the exception of an extraordinary opening lap and during pit stop sequences with the second Toyota, the No7 of Alex Wurz, Kazuki Nakajima and St\u00e9phane Sarrazin. The Porsche of Mark Webber, Timo Bernhard and Brendon Hartley was third, with its sister car, driven by Romain Dumas, Neel Jani and Mark Lieb in fourth. Audi, so long the dominant force in sportscar racing, suffered a difficult day at the office taking up the final LMP1 places in fifth and sixth. \u201cAs the track rubbered in it just suited the car more and more all the way through to the end of the race,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cThe balance of the car got better and we could lean on it more. It was a great job by everyone at the team.\u201d The great job was appreciated by the 51,000 fans who attended the race weekend. They had sat here for hours, with admirable determination, 12 months ago in pouring rain only to witness 16 laps, all behind the safety car, before the race was abandoned. But this year the home team thoroughly earned their comprehensive one-two victory on the track Toyota owns and which is only 20km away from the technical centre where their car\u2019s hybrid system is developed. After qualifying on pole on Saturday Davidson had said: \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky little track here. We have to be sharp, trust the reliability and be fast at the right time in the race. If we win here tomorrow I will be more confident for the rest of the year.\u201d The win will be a huge fillip for Davidson and Buemi, who had won the season\u2019s opening rounds at Silverstone and Spa but saw Audi close the gap in the drivers\u2019 championship with wins at Le Mans (a race for which double points are deservedly awarded) and the last round in Austin, where their German rivals also took the lead in the manufacturers\u2019 championship. Now, however, Davidson and Buemi (without their usual third driver Nicolas Lapierre, who was not driving for personal reasons) lead their nearest rivals, the Le Mans-winning Audi squad of Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler by 29 points and Toyota have retaken the team lead by eight points . Both Toyotas were a full second quicker than their competitors and finally showed their early-season form to full effect. An accident and reliability problems had cost them at Le Mans and they had led at the Circuit of the Americas until heavy rain stymied their assault. Here it all went right. Yet it had not begun as an endurance contest at all. Lotterer made a sharp opening from fifth on the grid and he, Buemi and Webber proceeded to duck and weave among themselves as if it were a kart race on the opening lap. They were three abreast at one point down to 300R and the lead changed hands four times over the lap before Buemi emerged victorious with five hours 58 and a half minutes left to run. However, the lap had longer-term import for both teams. Lotterer had pushed so hard he had exhausted his fuel capacity for the lap and the limiter dropped his power and he promptly dropped back. Both Audis would run cleanly but struggle for pace for the rest of the race while Buemi, alongside Davidson, was almost untouchable from then on. Nakajima tried to claw back the gap to the lead with a spirited middle stint but there was no catching the lead car. Davidson climbed in for the final run with 1hr 15min to go and was in no mood to relinquish any of the pressure, despite holding a 15-second lead on the No7 car. He maintained and then extended the gap and put in his car\u2019s fastest lap with 20 minutes to go. Porsche will be pleased with their second podium finish in their first year back at the top end of sportscar racing and more so with a performance improvement that shows the team is moving forward. Webber\u2019s third place in the No20 car was a particularly impressive run, coming back from a slow puncture in the opening laps and then from a gamble on double-stinting the tyres that did not pay off. It was different story for Audi, however. The team are not used to filling fifth and sixth positions but they have the least hybrid power and suffered on the long straights and with the low grip. It suggests a tough close to the season is in store for the German marque given similar types of circuit at the final three races, Shanghai on 2 November, Bahrain and S\u00e3o Paulo, and a promising finish for the victorious Toyota squad.", "tags": ["World Endurance Championship", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-12T17:40:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/13/tv-shows-overseas-great-british-bake-off-downton-abbey", "sentences": ["\u201cThis survey is a timely reminder that viewers in Shanghai or Seattle are just as likely to be talking about great British shows like Sherlock and Luther as commentators here are about the latest US TV blockbuster,\u201d said Paul Dempsey, BBC Worldwide\u2019s president, global markets."], "title": "Chinese demand for British TV shows rises 40%", "article": " Sales of British TV shows overseas grew 5% to almost \u00a31.28bn last year, with formats such as The X Factor and The Great British Bake Off and dramas including Downton Abbey and Sherlock proving global hits.

ITV has sold Mr Selfridge, Poirot, Marple and Lewis to more than 150 countries worldwide, and the Come Dine with Me and Hell\u2019s Kitchen formats have been sold and made locally in dozens of markets. \u201cThe report reflects the enormous appetite we are seeing for our UK content, from high-end and long-running drama franchises like Mr Selfridge and Lewis to multi-territory hit formats like I\u2019m a Celebrity. ..

It\u2019s first thing on Tuesday morning and the fair has just opened \u2013 only serious collectors, artists and press are allowed into the big marquees in Regent\u2019s Park for now, so most people here are absurdly rich. Peculiarly, drippingly rich. American rich, Arab rich, Swiss rich. Their clothes are expensive and their faces even more so. I wonder if it is terribly misogynistic to point out that most of the women I see have such taut faces, they appear to have enjoyed more facelifts than meals. So I look at Grayson and think, \u201cOh thank God, somebody normal,\u201d which might not be something he hears every day.  \u201cI\u2019m always slightly discombobulated when I come in,\u201d he says to an acquaintance. \u201cIt takes me a while to stop feeling overstimulated. They\u2019ve made the space a bit more open. People used to complain that Frieze was getting like a souk.\u201d But here we are, inside a temporary space that houses 162 of the world\u2019s leading contemporary galleries from 25 countries. The spaces have indeed been opened up, as have the nationalities. Latin American and African artists are on the up; while the YBAs are on the wane, and newcomers such as the Dan Gunn gallery from Berlin, which has only been going for two years, are now finding their way in. Plus, there\u2019s the Workplace Gallery from Gateshead, which might not sound like a big deal, but all the other exhibitors are from places like Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro and Johannesburg. And the Gateshead artwork, by Eric Bainbridge, is an enormous furry leopardskin thing with a fluffy animal on top, called The Embarrassment of Jimmy the Nail. I ask for an explanation, and what follows is a conversation involving the words \u201cAuf Wiedersehen Pet\u201d in the same breath as \u201chistory of art\u201d and \u201csingular narrative arc\u201d. Apparently, this guy has been banging out Jimmy Nail-related art for decades. The urge to shout \u201cSHE\u2019S LYING\u201d at the fluffy animal is strong, but I find it in myself to resist. \u201cI know,\u201d adds their director, cheerfully. \u201cGateshead \u2013 we\u2019re not even Newcastle.\u201d He then goes on to admit that, due to their own success, they have now opened a branch in Mayfair, too, which is only the poshest bit of London. \u201cBut the Frieze organisers insisted that we didn\u2019t come here as that.\u201d     Sophie Heawood in Venezuelan artist Sol Calero\u2019s Ciber Cafe at Frieze, London. Photograph: Andy Hall/Guardian    Another piece I love is by Sol Calero, who was born in 1983 in Venezuela. She lives in Europe now, but has put together a Venezuelan cyber cafe, with phone booths where you listen to a loop of calls that never quite get put through, where you can sit and check your Hotmail and imagine you are beside a tropical beach. It is, says the gallerist Laura Bartlett, a piece about identity politics; the masculine and the feminine; collectivism and the support of other artists from Calero\u2019s home country, whom she wishes to promote too. We look at one of the computers, which has work by these other artists on it. On the blue screen is KERNEL ERROR, WINDOWS IS SHUTTING DOWN. \u201cOh,\u201d she says. More controversial is the Japanese exhibit from the United Brothers, who have brought over radishes grown near Fukushima, and flown their ageing mother out with them, who has cooked them into soup. Controversy has raged, pre-festival, over whether these vegetables have been contaminated by the leak at the nuclear reactor or not \u2013 the artists claim they have all tested as safe, but one brother also runs a chain of tanning salons, so I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re the first people I\u2019d turn to for health and safety advice. Is it art? Will I die if I have some? Well, it turns out the free soup has all gone, as their mother gestures to me in broken English, so I now have to pay \u00a32 to find out if I will die of radishes. I agree to one sip to appease the photographer. But wait. This stuff is delicious. I neck the whole thing. At the time of going to print, I am not yet dead.

It\u2019s sad, really \u2013 they must be desperately nostalgic for the golden days of Brit Art to still be putting this stuff up. I ask an assistant why it is there, if it\u2019s so old. \u201cBecause we ask all our artists for something special and Damien gave us that, so we\u2019re over the moon. It\u2019s a real wow, such a rarity. It sold this morning, actually.\u201d How much for, I ask, feeling less sorry for the dead fish now. \u201cFour million pounds.\u201d Oh. There is a man with a French accent and a beautiful suit sitting at the desk in a Chinese gallery called Shangart, telling the woman he needs a discount. \u201c25% and I pay now,\u201d he barks at her. No. \u201cOK, 20% and I pay tonight,\u201d he says. She agrees. I didn\u2019t see that coming. \u201cTonight you av ze money,\u201d he says, sounding so much like a caricature of an art gangster that I feel a desperate urge to tell her not to believe a word. \u201cWhere is the art now?\u201d he asks her. It\u2019s in Shanghai. He\u2019s spending money that isn\u2019t here on art that isn\u2019t here. \u201cMONEY MONEY!\u201d he bellows, standing up and rubbing his hands. Is this part of the art, too?     Ten People One Hat, a roving pink-ribboned exhibit at Frieze, London. Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian    I can\u2019t decide what\u2019s art or what\u2019s not.

The environmentalist protester in the street outside, giving out leaflets that say they are lying to us about Fukushima and the soup really is toxic. \u201cJust take one,\u201d he says, when I dither. \u201cIt won\u2019t cost you seven thousand quid or anything.\u201d And then there\u2019s the chain of people tied to each other with a long pink ribbon that looks like it may have been stolen from the roller-towel dispenser in the toilets. My fear of missing out means I feel compelled to join them on their walk around the gallery. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve sussed that I am behind them, but they start going in smaller and smaller circles, around one particular exhibit, again and again, until it isn\u2019t a conga any more, but more like the quiet whirl of a maelstrom. I feel rather sick. Perhaps this is just how it feels to become part of a live art experience. Or perhaps it\u2019s the soup. \u2022 Frieze London is at Regent\u2019s Park, London, from 15-18 October.

As the most distinctive feature of ancient cities, this particular one is in fact spanking new and unfinished: a gap in its western stretch ranging hundreds of metres is waiting to be sealed up. Lying at the heart of contemporary Datong, the old city was almost unrecognisable until a few years ago, except for a handful of surviving monuments buried within shabby multi-storey buildings. But as China\u2019s capital for three separate dynasties, Datong was once home to royal palaces, gardens and temples. The spectacular Yungang Grottoes, a Unesco heritage site of ancient Buddhist art and carving, act as a reminder of its past. Today\u2019s Datong in Shanxi province is a third-tier city of 3.3 million people (Beijing and Shanghai are first-tier cities out of a five-tier ranking), with a vastly expanded urban area of almost 50 square kilometres. In recent decades, mass and indiscriminate rebuilding, alongside a booming coal mining industry that gained Datong the label \u201cChina\u2019s capital of coal\u201d, also made it one of the country\u2019s grittiest cities. Six years ago, Datong\u2019s newly appointed mayor, Geng Yanbo, set out to restore its glorious history: to resurrect the old city of Datong. At the height of China\u2019s property boom Datong was abuzz with construction. But in February 2013 Geng left to take up mayorship in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province, leaving behind a landscape pock-marked by construction. His departure prompted thousands of residents to plead for his return, many on their knees begging for him to finish what he began.     The imposing fortified city wall has been mostly rebuilt \u2013 although critics dismiss it as a \u2018fake relic\u2019.  Photograph: Yuan Ren    Starting with the Northern Wei dynasty 1,600 years ago, Datong was a beautiful capital. It continued to thrive in the Liao and Jin dynasties, and later regained prominence as a major strategic centre in the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644). Falling into decline thereafter, continual warfare and neglect had engendered a state of chaos by the early 1900s. Datong\u2019s fortification, heavily damaged but still intact until the mid-19th century, was slowly torn down. But with its epic revival, Datong would regain its Ming dynasty splendour, building on the geometric layout that had survived from then. Wide intersecting streets running along the central axis, split the city into quadrants, which further divide into a network of lanes and alleys. Within this, symbolic landmarks like the Drum and Bell towers (of which only the Drum Tower survives), multi-tiered and symmetrically positioned, loomed over a predominantly flat landscape. Wooden gates and archways framed major streets and denoted neighbourhoods in which locals traversed bustling lanes of commerce, visiting one of the countless temples that dotted the city. To the east stood the 180,000 square metre Prince\u2019s Palace, its jade-green rooftops a truly majestic sight. But from every angle, the city wall was the most recognisable view. Atop this, an array of 62 watchtowers, jutting out at regular intervals, formed a formidable line of defence. Using official government records, maps and sketches, as well as photographs from the early 1900s, Datong\u2019s appearance would be reconstructed, but the scurrying footsteps of local inhabitants lost. Tens of thousands of residents would be moved out beyond the city wall and permanently resettled, their homes demolished for Ming-style replicas. Datong would be transformed into a commercialised tourist site \u2013 where the only footfall to count is that of tourists.     A map of Ming-dynasty Datong    Professor Tao Ran, senior fellow at the Brookings-Tsinghua Centre for Public Policy, says that the move is in line with local governments relying heavily on land sale revenues to generate profit in recent years. \u201cBy moving locals out in the name of tourism, the land can be sold at a higher value to developers and to attract commerce; the local government can make a lot of money that way,\u201d he says. Such mass expulsion is possible in China because all land falls under public ownership, and because local areas have a lot of autonomy, says Professor Lou Jianbo of the Research Institute for Property Law at Peking University. Evictions \u2013 often by force \u2013 are therefore legal, and have become a common part of the country\u2019s development. As Datong\u2019s new mayor, Geng was well positioned for such a task, having previously evacuated large traditional estates for tourism \u2013 including the Wang Family Grand Courtyard in Shanxi province. An audacious figure whose legacy split public opinion, Geng is nevertheless widely regarded as \u201chighly capable\u201d. Ambitious by nature, he made deputy country chief 14 years ago at the young age of 37. Known for spending more time scrutinising construction sites than sitting in his office, Geng is seemingly applying the same standard to Taiyuan, where he is overseeing sweeping infrastructural developments. Yet he is also unafraid to break rules. While rebuilding the temple of the Yungang Grottoes, he authorised building work before gaining approval from Unesco, risking damage to the statues.     Visitors walk past the Yungang Grottoes near Datong. Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP    More than a year after the mayor\u2019s departure, the construction fever that gripped Datong has fallen to a hum, with progress ticking along at \u201ca drastically slower pace\u201d, locals say. The landscape is a rubbly mishmash of the old, new, the half-knocked down and partly rebuilt. At one of the biggest building sites, the Prince\u2019s Palace, roof tiles are glistening under the sun, but scaffolding still dominate the site.  Inside the east gate of the city wall, across an immaculately paved road, a rundown housing estate from the 1980s stands with rubbish strewn across the ground. Inside the building\u2019s shady stairwells, the character for \u201cexpropriation\u201d has been written and circled in red over stained walls.  Meng Jun, a man who lives next door and parks his van on the estate, says that notices for evacuation went up in March giving residents a month to move. \u201cBut even now, no date or location has been given for new housing,\u201d he says.  Of those refusing to budge, many are unhappy with the terms of resettlement, including 65-year-old Zhi Wenyi, who lives with his 95-year-old mother-in-law in a dilapidated courtyard house nearby.  \u201cMy home here is made of five large and separate living spaces, so I want more than the one apartment they\u2019re offering us\u201d, says Zhi. At the opposite end of the same lane, new courtyards have already sprung up where the old once stood. In anticipation of losing electricity, Zhi has connected his power cables to the electricity mast beside his house.     A year after Geng left, the pace of construction has fallen.  Photograph: Yuan Ren    While many cities have spruced up old streets into shopping lanes or rebuilt ancient watchtowers, like Beijing, none have attempted it on Datong\u2019s scale. Professor Wang Guixiang, a leading conservation expert at Tsinghua University\u2019s school of architecture, considers the current project the greatest damage to Datong in its modern history. \u201cTo rebuild historic monuments is against the principle of conservation,\u201d he says, calling the city wall \u201ca fake relic\u201d. Disputing the mayor\u2019s claims of authenticity, Wang points out that vital features of the wall\u2019s watchtowers, designed for functionality, have been altered for aesthetics.  Seemingly, traditional building methods are also sparingly applied. A glance at the cross-section of the city wall reveals that modern-day red bricks are being used to stuff the wall\u2019s core, instead of the rammed earth used in the original Ming-dynasty structure.  Even Huayansi, a Buddhist temple that Wang calls \u201ca national treasure\u201d, has undergone a modern face-lift. Dating back to the Liao dynasty (916-1125), the site has been a grotesquely expanded \u2013 huge new courtyards of conspicuously lacquered wood bury the smaller, faded original halls. During Geng\u2019s leadership, government spending in Datong soared, according to Caijing magazine, a leading financial paper in China. While much of it was deemed necessary given the city\u2019s disrepair, it also pushed the city into debts estimated at \u00a31.6bn, equivalent to Datong\u2019s total fiscal revenue for 2011. \u201cDatong\u2019s old town is a huge problem because it didn\u2019t follow a city\u2019s trajectory,\u201d says Professor Zhang Song of the school of architecture and urban planning at Tongji University. \u201cJust because you envisage building a tourist city, it doesn\u2019t mean the tourists will come.\u201d     One conservation expert says vital details of the wall\u2019s 62 watchtowers have been altered from the original designs.  Photograph: Yuan Ren     Across China, similar cases of over-speculation and out-of-pocket spending by local leadership \u2013 often to boost political achievement \u2013 have marred economic prospects, and created swaths of \u201cghost towns\u201d. Ordos in Inner Mongolia, where a community development was planned for one million people, stands incomplete and mostly empty a decade on.  Today, Datong faces a similar predicament.  \u201cNobody wants to live here now because it\u2019s all going to be knocked down and all the schools have already moved out\u201d, says Liu Wen, a local taxi driver who points out the former Datong No 1 Secondary School, standing eerily abandoned near the west gate. For some, like 35-year-old Li, improving Datong should have been from the very start about solving people\u2019s job problems and improving welfare, \u201cnot how beautiful the city looks\u201d.  Yet despite the city\u2019s turmoil, an overwhelming number still believe that Geng made Datong a better place. \u201cIt was a dump before him, there wasn\u2019t one proper road,\u201d says one elderly lady. For others, there\u2019s no doubt construction would have been completed if Geng had been allowed to stay. \u201cInstead, Taiyuan is on its way up now,\u201d says one man.  For Jin Shujun, a 50-year-old former soldier whose family is facing eviction from their single-storey home, the mayor may have given Datong respectable roads, but he has also emptied neighbourhoods of people. \u201cWith all those restored temples here, for what the old city loses in the living, it will certainly gain in ghosts.\u201d  China\u2019s \u2018eco-cities\u2019: empty of hospitals, shops and people Caofeidian, the Chinese eco-city that became a ghost town ", "tags": ["Cities", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Cities and development", "Global development"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-15T09:39:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/16/andy-murray-world-tour-finals-vienna", "sentences": ["Murray changed his schedule with the World Tour Finals in mind, opting to play in the Vienna tournament for the first time in an attempt to secure valuable rankings points after a disappointing defeat by David Ferrer in the third round of the Shanghai Masters last week."], "title": "Andy Murray boosts his World Tour Finals hopes with victory in Vienna", "article": "Andy Murray boosted his chances of qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals in London after beating Canada\u2019s Vasek Pospisil 6-4, 6-4 in the second round of the Erste Bank Open in Vienna.

In 1995, during the course of a BBC radio discussion on the \u201ccinema of empire\u201d, Frayling raised two questions about Orientalism, Said\u2019s seminal study that challenged the patronising attitude of western observers to Asian art. First, why did Said neglect the influence of popular culture in shaping prejudices and reinforcing stereotypes? Second, why had he said so little directly about China? With characteristic grace, Said accepted both charges and suggested Frayling undertake a job for which he had been informally preparing. His passion had begun in his public school library in the 1950s, relishing pulp novels about the ingeniously cruel, oriental super-criminal Fu Manchu, and had continued in 1970 when he met the widow of Fu\u2019s creator, Sax Rohmer, while planning a student send-up of Rohmer\u2019s work at Cambridge. Having filled his young head with these exotic images, he admits early on that \u201cat one level, this book is a kind of exorcism\u201d. Fortunately, Frayling can criticise and contextualise the world from which Fu Manchu emerged without either letting go of that youthful excitement that attracted him in the first place or denying the literary equivalent of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s famous tribute in Private Lives to the potency of cheap music. Coward wrote that line, incidentally, in 1930 while convalescing from influenza in Shanghai, one of Fu Manchu\u2019s stamping grounds, the same year the first sound movie featuring Fu opened at Grauman\u2019s Chinese theatre in Los Angeles. In the 18th century, the British view of China was generally admiring and benign. But as Frayling demonstrates, the change over the next hundred years was steady and dramatic. The British imperialists conducted a series of wars to impose the opium trade on China and suppressed the Boxer rebellion that was the natural response to this brutal commerce. Paradoxically, the oppressive foreigners managed to cast the oppressed victims as a threatening, expansionist foe. Meanwhile, starting with Coleridge and De Quincy, European writers created a cult around opium and the frighteningly exotic oriental dreams it unleashed, a movement that reached its literary peak in Dickens\u2019s The Mystery of Edwin Droodand Wilde\u2019s Dorian Gray. By the end of the century, Chinatown and its notorious opium dens had become the locus of dangerous romance, alluring evil and spine-tingling threat in Europe and North America, with London\u2019s Limehouse a top attraction for the intrepid tourist. The general drift was encouraged by bestselling books in which missionaries and old China hands shared their ignorance with western readers and apocalyptic novels of a sort still echoed in reputable books on the prospects for future role of China on the global scene. The new century opened with the first reference, in the Daily News of 21 July 1900, to \u201cthe yellow peril in its most serious form\u201d. Now something of a joke perhaps, the phrase stuck. It is at this point that the very incarnation of this threat in the form of Dr Fu Manchu begins to develop in the confused, fertile, florid and prolific mind of his creator, a working-class autodidact of Irish parentage called Arthur Sarsfield Ward, who was to adopt the pseudonym Sax Rohmer. The resonant name came from the Saxon and roughly translates as \u201cblade roamer\u201d and might well have inspired the unfilmed William Burroughs screenplay Blade Runner from which the Ridley Scott sci-fi picture took its name. While working early in the 20th century at the London branch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai bank(where PG Wodehouse was a fellow clerk), he began freelance writing for the popular press before composing songs and sketches for the music hall, most notably for the comedians George Robey and Little Tich. As a journalist, he became a bogus authority on Limehouse and the Chinese community and he claimed to have seen a strikingly tall and sinister Chinaman there one night, the way his contemporary Baroness Orczy had a vision of the Scarlet Pimpernel one day at an underground station. He had great respect for the Chinese, particularly their poise, though he never visited China. So Frayling argues that Fu Manchu was a product of the times, filtered through the music hall \u2013 a place charged with jingoism and xenophobic humour, employing Asian magicians and other entertainers and staging pantomimes and musicals featuring oriental villains. Moreover, the central characters of Rohmer\u2019s Fu Manchu stories, the first of which appeared in 1913, the last in the 1950s, found their models in the work of Conan Doyle: the suburban narrator Dr Petrie, the Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith and Dr Fu himself paralleling Watson, Holmes and Moriarty. The Fu Manchu books achieved immediate success, and the garish covers of the paperbacks and the movie posters (reproduced in The Yellow Peril in all their pulp glory) were a major contribution to the popular image of the exotic Orient. They sold in vast numbers, reaching readers ranging from the teenage SJ Perelman, who in middle age recalled them with wry humour, and President Calvin Coolidge, whose enthusiasm anticipated John Kennedy\u2019s supposed admiration for Ian Fleming, whose Dr No was clearly inspired by Rohmer\u2019s creation. Fu was the monstrous super-villain, a suave, intelligent, handsome megalomaniac, his web cast around the world. But an important part of his success was that while his organisation operated everywhere from Hong Kong to Limehouse, no one was sure for whom he actually worked. Was it the old Manchu dynasty or the Young China Movement, his own evil ends or a resurgent world-threatening Asia? Impersonated by a charismatic Boris Karloff in the MGM B-feature The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932), a camp classic widely regarded as the best movie in the series, his aim was to destroy the white race using the sword and mask of Genghis Khan. The Chinese consul in Los Angeles protested and the film has since existed uneasily in the realm of guilty pleasure. In the 1930s, however, the Chinese government was less concerned with Fu than with overseeing the positive images of Chinese projected in prestige Hollywood versions of novels by the Nobel prize-winner Pearl S Buck. The Mask comes across as funny, dated, curiously innocent \u2013 a ripping yarn. In the immediate postwar years in Britain there was for several years a serious version of Fu broadcast nightly by BBC radio for an audience of millions of impressionable young listeners \u2013 Li-Chang, the Chinese villain in Dick Barton \u2013 Special Agent. In the 1950s, however, the story of Fu ended up as camp, self-mocking, post-imperial nostalgia in the BBC radio comedy The Goon Show, written and performed by that Irish child of the empire Spike Milligan and his co-star Peter Sellers. Appropriately, in The Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu (1980), the abysmal comic pastiche that brought an end to the devil Doctor\u2019s screen career, Sellers played both Fu Manchu and his western nemesis, Nayland Smith, and died before the film opened.

But one difference dominates here: there\u2019s no actual dancefloor. Instead, located in front of the elevated DJ booths at bling venues such as LINX, Mook and MYST (the latter acronym stands for \u201cMoving You Stunning Trip\u201d), are the most expensive VIP tables. Whereas in the west the highest rollers get to hide away in private rooms, here they are proudly on view for everyone to envy. At LINX they are elevated into this position ... quite literally: the VIP section is periodically lifted up via hydraulic pumps. Venues such as these \u2013 and many others in cities China-wide \u2013 are packed every weekend. And they\u2019re filled with an overwhelmingly local, newly moneyed clientele that generally isn\u2019t there for the DJ talent. Shanghai\u2019s big club culture may be dominated by social status-graspers rather than dance connoisseurs, but it has nevertheless become a popular stop for globe-hopping superstar DJs. The likes of Steve Aoki and DJ Falcon regularly return, seduced by high performance fees and the chance to explore the madcap city. \u201cShanghai is starting to attract the international DJ crowd,\u201d says Tim Crouch, entertainment director and DJ at Shanghainese favourite Mook, which has played host to Paris Hilton\u2019s DJ skills and an LMFAO PA set. \u201cBut we have catching up to do compared to cities in Korea and Japan. They have clubs that are focused purely on dance music and the underground scene, whereas here it\u2019s more mainstream. The style of music is almost second to the celebrity factor.\u201d The dance scene in Shanghai is healthier than the band scene and it\u2019s easy to understand why. It\u2019s tough for foreign bands to get visas to play in China, and many gigs end up getting cancelled anyway, limiting the international influence on local acts. DJs however only need to turn up with a laptop carried in hand luggage in order to take home a decent pay cheque.             If this all sounds somewhat soulless then it\u2019s exciting to find that, beyond the pneumatic thump of the super-clubs, a strong, largely expat-run alternative dance scene has evolved, largely as a reaction to them. Clubs such as the Shelter (a converted bomb shelter), Arkham and DADA attract feted, cultish acts that often end up building strong connections with the city. \u201cThe DJs love it,\u201d says Reggie Ba-Pe, an Australian who set up the charmingly-named S.T.D. club promotion company in 2007 as well as Arkham last year. \u201cShanghai is so different to the usual places they play, especially in venues like Arkham or The Shelter. It feels like a club from New York or Berlin that got dropped in the middle of China.\u201d Lauded underground dance types such as Hyperdub Records chief Kode9 keep coming back \u2013 he even released a single, Xinfu Lu, named after a Shanghai street. Goldie, meanwhile, has played to hipster expats at the Shelter numerous times. \u201cShanghai\u2019s on the top of the list when it comes to futuristic cities,\u201d he said ahead of his last gig here. \u201cShanghai\u2019s underground scene has come a long way,\u201d agrees Ba-Pe. \u201cCertainly in comparison to cities like Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul, which have more settled and mature scenes.

China has also sent hundreds of aid workers to Africa to help. Dudley Thomas, Liberia\u2019s ambassador to China, told Reuters that his country had secured one donation of $100,000 from a large Chinese building firm that has projects in the country, but few other contributions. He added that Liberia\u2019s government was in talks with other large Chinese investors, including the state-owned China-Africa Development Fund, a private equity fund set up to facilitate investment between China and Africa. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, said last week that he and his wife, Dr Priscilla Chan, were donating $25m towards combating Ebola. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged $50m. China\u2019s donation to the WFP would be used to provide staple foods in the three hardest-hit countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, Rierson said. That puts China among the top donors to the organisation for combating Ebola. The US has contributed $12.67m and Japan $6m, Rierson added.

Earlier in the day Dublin\u2019s commercial court had heard how mediation \u2013 as ordered by a judge \u2013 between McIlroy and the Horizon management company had failed to resolve the multimillion-pound matter. Talks had taken place over Friday and Saturday without agreement. McIlroy said: \u201cI\u2019m going to need time away from tournament golf to prepare for the trial over my legal dispute with Horizon Sports Management.

The Modern Sky festival was a two-day showcase of Chinese talent, including arty synth-pop outfit Queen Sea Big Shark, traditional folk-rock crossovers Secondhand Rose and John Lydon\u2019s favourite post-punk band Re-Tros. The success of the festival is another landmark in the inexorable rise of Chinese alternative music, but it also indicates clearly who holds the power in the nascent, Beijing-focused scene.  \u201cEverything is centred around music festivals here,\u201d says Helen Feng, the charismatic frontwoman of electro-pop foursome Nova Heart, one of the leading lights of Beijing music. \u201cIn the west, labels were always the centre of the music industry, but in China it\u2019s festivals.\u201d  Indeed, despite the huge growth of a counterculture and a thirst for alternative music, there\u2019s a surprising lack of framework in place.  \u201cThere\u2019s not as much infrastructure as you would think considering how many bands there are and how much potential there is,\u201d says Liz Tung, a China-based music writer who covers the beat for Time Out Beijing. \u201cThere are more labels now than there used to be, but Modern Sky is the biggest game in town, and just behind them is Maybe Mars. Almost all of the more popular indie bands that pack out Beijing livehouses on a weekend \u2013 Hedgehog, Snapline, Carsick Cars, P.K. 14 and AV Okubo \u2013 are all on one of the two labels.\u201d The source of the problem \u2013 music streaming and illegal downloading \u2013 isn\u2019t unique to China, but the effect is considerably more acute. The country\u2019s alternative scene has only really taken off in the age of the internet, so the same problem that\u2019s hamstrung the majors worldwide has stopped small Chinese labels even getting off the ground. China\u2019s lax rules and policing surrounding IPR offences only compound this. \u201cThat\u2019s why you see Modern Sky turning to alternative ways of making money,\u201d says Tung. Modern Sky\u2019s annual Strawberry festival \u2013 which attracts hundreds of thousands of people in Beijing and Shanghai over one weekend in May \u2013 is a huge moneyspinner. Since the success of Modern Sky, dozens of similar festivals have cropped up, and the year-round festival circuit is now a cultural staple. This isn\u2019t always the most conducive environment to nurturing young talent, Feng says: \u201cBecause everything is dependent on the festival stage, there\u2019s not a long incubation period. Bands can\u2019t spend four or five years in the club scene working their way up to the festivals. I find with a lot of young artists, it\u2019s about getting them to the point where they understand the importance of a good album. They\u2019re more concerned with their festival slot before they get a good album or even define their sound.\u201d  Still, a system that emphasises the live music experience has its upsides \u2013 most notably, it enables this growing subculture to be exposed to as many people as possible. \u201cI\u2019ve played in front of 30-40,000 people and that was inconceivable 10 years ago,\u201d says Feng. \u201c[People] are starting to understand that there is a scene out there. They may be kind of raw, and they don\u2019t know the history of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but they see it for the first time. Either they get it or they don\u2019t, but they\u2019re there. And that\u2019s something new. There are a lot more kids and there\u2019s a lot more debate.\u201d Large corporations, looking to borrow some cool from this exciting new scene, are becoming key patrons. \u201cThe idea of selling out is completely non-applicable to China. There\u2019s no stigma attached to trying to make money,\u201d says Tung. \u201cEven experimental artists have done advertisements for the likes of Adidas, Converse and so on. I\u2019m pretty sure even [punk band] Demerit have done a computer ad.\u201d  Feng has a similar interpretation. \u201cThe concept of selling out has always been a bit of a mystery to me \u2026 I did an ad with [tech firm] Lenovo and it made me enough money to support all the stuff that I want to do and, frankly, [even enough to] start my own label.\u201d Indeed, Nova Heart are self-releasing their debut album this month, through Helen\u2019s Fake Love Music label. \u201cIn China there are always these two things that are said in the music scene, one is called gan huo which means \u2018going to work\u2019 and the other one is, you know, doing music. They\u2019re considered two different things. Gan huo means I make the money I need to make in order to support the stuff I want to do. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve compromised my artistic integrity one tiny little bit in order to get something.

With the photo notes, Eijkelboom effectively has to vanish. \u201cThe camera is hanging on my body, with a wire that goes into my pocket,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I make the photos. When you walk in the city and look through the viewfinder, people say, \u2018What are you doing? Why this photograph?\u2019 And so on. I don\u2019t have time to talk about what I\u2019m doing, I want to get it done in two hours. And when you make a photo in a normal way, you intervene in the situation: people will react to the camera, and will not be normal.\u201d Partly inspired by People of the Twentieth Century, August Sander\u2019s mammoth attempt to document German society from 1911 until his death in 1964, Eijkelboom wants to create a kind of visual diary. \u201cThe work I did before was always about my own identity and identity in society. I always have the feeling I am more or less the product of the society I\u2019m living in \u2013 and the photo notes are trying to visualise my surroundings.\u201d     Furry hoods in Amsterdam, from People of the Twenty-First Century. Photograph: Hans Eijkelboom/Phaidon    The results, collated in a 500-page book, are simultaneously mundane and compelling. Laid out in a grid, the shots of women wearing pink T-shirts or businessmen carrying briefcases have a hypnotic, repetitious quality, but the longer you look at them, the more nuances become apparent. Eijkelboom used a similar technique in an earlier project, Paris-New York-Shanghai, an exhibition and a trio of books documenting everyday life in those cities that was widely perceived as being a deadpan comment on globalisation\u2019s effect on national identity. The point seemed to be that people increasingly dressed the same all over the world. People of the Twenty-First Century offers a more positive message. Eijkelboom occasionally documents a fashion trend, or a tribal allegiance, where people are trying to look alike: bikers, Rolling Stones fans wearing the band\u2019s logo. But more often, the similarities between his subjects\u2019 appearances reveal themselves to be superficial. Eijkelboom might have chanced upon a dozen people all wearing yellow T-shirts, but they\u2019re not a uniform and their significance changes with each person: one shirt is pledging allegiance to a football team, another to a band, another to surfing. \u201cThat\u2019s a very strange development in society,\u201d says Eijkelboom. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the intention at the start of the project, but in the end you could say the book is about a fight, a war within society: more and more, big companies have their grip on people, in producing the clothes and so on. But in the book you see the possibilities to give it your own personal touch. When you now go to the Kalverstraat in Amsterdam, everybody has their own individual message on their T-shirt. But on the other hand, they all look the same, because they are all people with a message on their T-shirt. You can already see a little bit of change, making the power of the big companies weaker, I think. To own clothing by a brand is less important than five years ago.\u201d He thinks this might have something to do with the rise of the internet, which the book inadvertently documents: its earliest photographs come from 1994, an era that was \u201ca little bit more friendly, a little bit more na\u00efve\u201d, when the internet was more discussed than used, when a feature about it in Time magazine still had to open by explaining what the web was. \u201cMy project is related to the city and the crowd in the city. When I look at younger people now, I see more and more that the web is their city. It\u2019s more important now to have an identity on the web, which is very different from an identity shown through your clothes, and you can see that in the book. But I have so much trust in people that I think everybody will find a way to express themselves individually. But in what way? I really don\u2019t know.\u201d Whatever happens, Eijkelboom intends to document it. He no longer goes out five days a week, but his days of lurking around shopping centres are far from over. \u201cIt is very important that I do it for as long as possible \u2013 because the very first photo notes I made are now the most interesting. Time is an important part of the project. I\u2019m now 65. I hope I can do it for another 15 years.\u201d \u2022 People of the Twenty-First Century is published in the UK by Phaidon, \u00a324.95.

He says people often ask him if he\u2019s crazy. \u201c\u2018Hong Kong is supposed to be bright,\u2019 they say. \u2018Why are you even talking about light being some kind of pollution?\u2019\u201d  This is a city that is famous for its nightscape: neon signs advertising market stalls, pawn shops and steakhouses; illuminated skyscrapers; swanky malls that stay open \u2013 and stay lit \u2013 well into the night. \u201cWhen I walk at night around some of these commercial centres, it\u2019s so bright you almost want to wear your sunglasses,\u201d Pun says. Indeed, in our collective imaginations, cities are meant to be bright. But as studies begin to show that too much light can be detrimental to health, and fewer of us are able to see the stars when we look up, are cities getting too bright for our own good? Hong Kong isn\u2019t alone in celebrating light. Paris is still known as the City of Light; only slightly less glamorous Blackpool relies for tourism on its annual illuminations, when more than 1 million bulbs light a distance of 10km.           Video: This cloud-free nighttime view of our planet seen from space was assembled by Nasa from images captured by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Satellite    This celebration of artificial lighting is perhaps unsurprising, given how recently electric streetlights became the norm. It\u2019s easy to forget that being bathed in light is a relatively modern phenomenon. Although electric streetlights first began appearing in European capitals in the mid-1800s, widespread street lighting did not become common until well into the 20th century. It soon became a clear view of the night sky that was uncommon. Hong Kong is now often touted as the most light polluted city in the world \u2013 a view supported by a recent study from Pun and his department, Hong Kong Night Sky Brightness Monitoring Network (NSN), which measured so-called \u201cnight sky brightness\u201d.  \u201cWe set up about 18 stations around the city, in all sorts of living environments \u2013 from the commercial urban centre, to more residential neighbourhoods, to relatively rural areas,\u201d he explains. Then they compared the levels of light to the standard provided by the International Astronomical Union, which states how bright the sky would be without artificial light. In the most-lit areas, it was 1,000 times brighter. \u201cSimilar studies in major capitals like Berlin and Vienna,\u201d says Pun, \u201cwould find something more of the order of 100 to 200 times brighter.\u201d      Europe at night from Space. Photograph: SPL/Barcroft Media    But with light pollution studies still in their infancy, and without any strict international standards on how to quantify the extent of light pollution, it\u2019s hard to say for sure whether Hong Kong is the most light-polluted city. Other candidates that are often cited by those with the best view \u2013 astronauts \u2013 include Las Vegas, Tokyo, Seoul and New York. And Hong Kong, like in many cities around the world, is proud of its illuminated city. \u201cThe brighter the better,\u201d Pun explains, mimicking a chirpy toothpaste ad. \u201cBrighter means more prosperous. We have a nickname for Hong Kong: the Pearl of the Orient. So I suppose a lot of people take this actually as a badge of pride without rethinking what all this brightness means.\u201d That can include health problems. \u201cThere\u2019s a cascade of changes to our physiology that are associated with light exposure at night,\u201d says Steven Lockley, a neuroscientist and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. He has looked at the impact of light on human physiology, including on alertness, sleep, and melatonin levels.   Because humans evolved in a 24-hour light/dark cycle known as the circadian clock, any light after dusk is \u201cunnatural\u201d, Lockley says. When we are exposed to light after dusk, \u201cour daytime physiology is triggered and our brains become more alert, our heart rates go up, as does our temperature, and production of the hormone melatonin is suppressed\u201d.  Has the way city dwellers live, removed from natural light patterns, confused our bodies? \u201cNot so much confused as shifted: we\u2019ve been shifted later,\u201d Lockley says. \u201cWhat happens when people go camping? If you don\u2019t have sources of electric light, then you go to bed earlier, shortly after the sun\u2019s gone down, and you sleep for longer.\u201d Every day we don\u2019t go to bed at dusk, we experience what Lockley calls \u201cmini jetlag\u201d. His colleague, Ken Wright at the University of Colorado in Boulder, conducted an experiment on camping. Wright found that for campers, midnight was the middle of the night: living in brightly lit cities has artificially lengthened our days. \u201cWe go to bed later, we don\u2019t sleep as long, and we don\u2019t know of the long-term health impact of changing,\u201d he says.     Las Vegas at night. Photograph: Corbis    There have been studies about how changes in circadian rhythms \u2013 which may be explained by exposure to light at night \u2013 can have an impact on humans. Studies of shiftworkers found that circadian disruption is \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d; female nightworkers, for instance, were found to have a higher risk of breast cancer than women who do not work at night. \u201cAs a society we need to think, do we really need some of these amenities that are putting light pollution into the environment?\u201d Lockley says. \u201cDo we need 24/7 garages, do we need 24/7 supermarkets, do we need 24/7 TV? It was only in 1997 that the BBC turned off and there was the national anthem and we all went to bed.\u201d  The International Dark Sky Association is an organisation of astronomers that aims to teach how to preserve the night sky. Member Scott Kardel says he believes in balance: \u201cWhile we need certain amounts of light at night for safety, commerce and more, we also need to be more careful about how much light we use, where we use it and for how long.\u201d But at a more abstract level, Kardel also believes that \u201chaving bright skies takes something away from us. All of our ancestors had star-filled skies that inspired countless people in art, literature, religion, science and philosophy.\u201d It might not be plausible to put the metropolis to bed at dusk, but cities can mitigate some of the worst light pollution. \u201cProper outdoor lighting,\u201d says Kardel, \u201cconserves energy, reduces glare\u201d and cuts back on so-called light trespass, for example when your neighbour\u2019s bedroom light bleeds into your sitting room. Pun also suggests limiting the number of light installations and their hours of operation, and controlling the distance between lights and living environments. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly big problem in Hong Kong because it\u2019s a very densely populated city,\u201d he says. Any change, he also points out, would have to be a community effort that involves not just business but government.  \u201cWhile a great many cities do have laws about light pollution or light trespass, they are still in the minority,\u201d Kardel says. \u201cThe number of cities adopting light pollution regulations is growing, but they mostly seem to be appearing in smaller towns where the problem isn\u2019t as great as it is in the larger cities.\u201d     The Empire State Building is seen lit up before Earth Hour in New York, during which lights were turned off for one hour to show support for renewable energy. Photograph: Eric Thayer/Reuters    Los Angeles, however, is one megacity that has been trying to scrape back some of its nighttime darkness. Not long ago a sprawl of apricot-coloured street lights, LA has since undergone one of the largest LED streetlight replacement projects in the world. LEDs are proving a popular choice for cities wanting to save on lighting costs: they are being rolled out in New York, Copenhagen and Shanghai. They\u2019re not a panacea. \u201cLEDs offer promise and peril,\u201d Kardel says. \u201cThey tend to be very directional in nature, which makes it easier to direct light where it is needed. And they are much better suited than older lighting technologies for integrating with dimming or motion-sensing technologies.\u201d But most energy-efficient LEDs contain a significant amount of blue in their spectrum. \u201cAnd blue disproportionately brightens the night sky.\u201d Lockley thinks LEDS are the \u201cproblem, but also the solution: they allow much more sophisticated lighting systems.\u201d The blueness can be fixed, he says. \u201cIt is possible to create LED light with multiple colours \u2013 you can alter the colours for the right time of day and the right application.\u201d  \u201cWe might not quite be at the point where cities are putting in those types of tuneable street lamps,\u201d he adds. But many communities in the UK have either adopted or trialled \u201cpart night lighting\u201d, switching off the lights where they\u2019re not needed or lowering illumination levels for part of the night. Motion-sensing technologies are being tested in the Netherlands and Ireland. At the centre of this shift is a change in the attitudes of city residents and their governments. In Hong Kong, until only a few years ago the government avoided even using the term \u201clight pollution\u201d, says Pun. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even admit such a thing exists. If you call it something else, like \u2018light nuisance\u2019, then I guess it will make life a little easier. Even though it seems like a gloomy situation, no pun intended, I do see a change of mindset.\u201d  So what about Hong Kong\u2019s brand \u2013 built at least in part on its reputation as a metropolis literally buzzing with electricity? \u201cAbout 100 years ago in London, we\u2019d be talking about all this soot from the factories nearby, and the poor air quality of the city,\u201d Pun says. \u201cAnd we move on.\u201d Tips for reducing your light pollution \u2022 It\u2019s an obvious one, but switch off any lights you are not using. \u2022 Ensure indoor and outdoor lighting is directed at what you\u2019re trying to light and that it\u2019s shaded. Table and floor lamps are better for this than overhead lights. \u2022 Use low-watt lightbulbs \u2013 you\u2019ll save on bills and reduce glare. \u2022 Install dimmer switches so you can alter brightness to suit ambient light. \u2022 Use motion sensors or timers so outdoor lights are only on when they need to be. \u2022 Install thick curtains or blinds to minimise light escaping your home at night. \u2022 Ask your local councillor to get street lamps fitted with directional, low energy lights \u2013 after all, residential areas don\u2019t need to be lit up like football pitches 24 hours a day.

Pret is benefiting from the change in habits towards eating on the go, which is adding to pressure on supermarkets such as Tesco and Morrisons, which are already suffering from the rise of discount and convenience stores. Clive Schlee, chief executive, said: \u201cThe improved economy has helped us but the main driver is that people eat more throughout the day.

But these days the golden arches of McDonald\u2019s are looking a little tarnished. After a decade of relentless expansion, customers around the world don\u2019t seem to be lovin\u2019 it any more. Last week McDonald\u2019s revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% on last year in a set of results that went beyond Wall Street\u2019s worst nightmares and were swiftly characterised as atrocious. Problems are piling up almost everywhere. In China, sales plunged by 23% after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at a local supplier, Shanghai Husi Food, claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald\u2019s and KFC. In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of turmoil in Ukraine and the sour anti-western mood in Russia that has seen US companies caught in the political crossfire. Around 200 of McDonald\u2019s 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors in apparently politically motivated food-safety checks. Ten have been closed. But it is in the US, where McDonald\u2019s has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis runs deepest. Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.     The first McDonald\u2019s franchise, which opened on April 15, 1955, and is now a museum in Des Plaines, Illinois. Photograph: Nam Y Huh/AP    McDonald\u2019s has chalked up 12 straight months of declining sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter. Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill \u2013 which, just the day before McDonald\u2019s revealed its horrible sales figures, announced 20% growth in revenues. The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonald\u2019s once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year-olds visiting has not grown. To add to the company\u2019s woes, McDonald\u2019s hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers. Fast-growing US-only chain Chick-fil-A was deemed to be best for chicken. McDonald\u2019s is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, which trumpets its antibiotic-free meat and \u201clocally sourced, seasonal produce\u201d \u2013 although local for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away. The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonald\u2019s was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US earlier this month. \u201cHave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?\u201d was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website \u2013 referring to the controversial beef filler (gristle and fat) used for dog food that is sprayed down with ammonia to make it \u201cfit\u201d for human consumption. The meat product, banned in Europe since the BSE crisis, was dropped by McDonald\u2019s in 2012 after being exposed by chef Jamie Oliver. But pink slime has left doubts in US consumers\u2019 minds. \u201cDoes McDonald\u2019s beef contain worms?\u201d asked another person. (\u201cNo. Gross. End of story,\u201d replied the company). Others wanted to know whether it uses real eggs, or whether the McRib is made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats. McDonald\u2019s chief executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in \u201cadjusting misperceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of our ingredients\u201d. Yet, just as McDonald\u2019s has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast food essentials: speedy service at low prices. Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower. The \u201cexpensive\u201d tag was unjustified, said Mary Chapman at Technomic. \u201cPrices have indeed gone up, but they haven\u2019t gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US.\u201d Prices at McDonald\u2019s have increased by 4.8% since 2009, well below the \u201cquick service\u201d sector average (up 19.4%), while the cost of \u201cfast casual\u201d eating, a category that includes the much-hyped Chipotle, is up 16.9% according to Technomic\u2019s menu monitor. US consumer prices rose 11% over the same period. But critics have a point when it comes to longer queues. McDonald\u2019s has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated items \u2013 its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make. \u201cI think it is worth [waiting], but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,\u201d said Chapman. McDonald\u2019s has been here before. The company was in the doldrums in the late 1990s, beset by similar concerns about quality and service at a time when the golden arches were a lightning rod for anger about western capitalism. The mood was exemplified by demonstrators who trashed a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Seattle in 1999 to protest against the World Trade Organisation. \u201cThey have a historical record of being able to come back when times get tough,\u201d said Chapman. In the UK, McDonald\u2019s has turned around its business, making Britain a rare bright spot for the company. \u201cPeople are a bit sniffy about the brand, but it delivers,\u201d said Peter Martin of consultancy CGA Peach, whose figures show that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonald\u2019s restaurant at least once in the last six months. \u201cIt is easily the number one choice for couples with kids. It is still working, without a doubt.\u201d     The day before McDonald\u2019s unveiled its latest set of poor results, rival food chain Chipotle announced 20% growth in revenues. Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters    A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free Wi-fi had given McDonald\u2019s a broad appeal in the UK, said Martin. \u201cThere is a utilitarianism and functionality about it; it ticks a lot of boxes.\u201d He points out that the UK has been a testbed for the company\u2019s social media campaigns and a brand identity that emphasises quality. In the UK, McDonald\u2019s bases its advertising on provenance \u2013 playing up its 100% \u201cBritish beef\u201d burgers and fish that has a sustainability stamp of approval from the Marine Stewardship Council. Meanwhile in the US, its annual sales still outstrip Chipotle and all similar \u201cfast-casual\u201d dining restaurants put together, according to Technomic. \u201c[McDonald\u2019s] are head and shoulders the leader,\u201d said Chapman. Executives are vowing to tackle \u201cmisperceptions\u201d about its food in its home market. Thompson has promised more organic food and custom-made burgers, in an effort to lure back American millennials. But to cut down queues he also wants to introduce simpler menus. Analysts are scratching their heads about how the company can square the circle of pared-down menus and greater choice over fillings. \u201cThey want to simplify the menu, but enhance its ability to customise, and that sounds like a very tricky wire act to pull off,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski at Janney Capital Markets. Only four out of McDonald\u2019s 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested \u201cbuild your own burger\u201d, he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up. \u201cRight now we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.\u201d Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of the year it expects to have opened 1,400 new restaurants. Kalinowski expects McDonald\u2019s market share will continue to shrink, but he too warned against writing off the company. \u201cYou can never really count McDonald\u2019s out\u2026 We think it will be number one in terms of total sales for not just years, but decades to come.\u201d", "tags": ["McDonald's", "Fast food", "Burgers", "Food & drink industry", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-25T23:05:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/oct/27/sensory-marketing-brands-senses-technology", "sentences": ["Cutting-edge dining now also incorporates the projection of augmented reality imagery on to food \u2013 an experience offered to diners at some of the world\u2019s top restaurants, such as El Celler de Can Roca in Spain, which staged an immersive opera-dinner called El Somni, and Ultraviolet in Shanghai."], "title": "Sensory marketing: the brands appealing to all five senses", "article": "Hearing the sound of jelly babies screaming as you chew them is no longer the stuff of nightmares, thanks to advancements in sensory technology.

Marriott Hotels\u2019 new Teleporter is one such example. The hotel chain is using Oculus Rift technology to allow guests to virtually explore holiday destinations, such as Hawaii. Its \u201c4D technology\u201d enables teleported guests to physically feel aspects of the environment they are in, for example, installed heaters can simulate the sun on your face, while a water sprayer can make you feel the sea spray hitting your skin.         Marriott Hotels\u2019 4D technology-inspired Teleporter    Meanwhile, H\u00e4agen-Dazs is using augmented reality to entertain consumers while they wait for its ice cream to become soft enough to scoop. The brand\u2019s Concerto Timer iPhone app can project a virtual violin concerto on top of a tub. Food for thought Many brands are following the lead of proponents of \u201coff the plate\u201d dining experiences, such as Heston Blumenthal, whose restaurant The Fat Duck became famed for its Sound of the Sea dish with accompanying iPod playing the sound of waves. Cutting-edge dining now also incorporates the projection of augmented reality imagery on to food \u2013 an experience offered to diners at some of the world\u2019s top restaurants, such as El Celler de Can Roca in Spain, which staged an immersive opera-dinner called El Somni, and Ultraviolet in Shanghai.         H\u00e4agen-Dazs\u2019 augmented reality Concerto Timer iPhone app    Russell Jones, the co-founder of Condiment Junkie, the sensory and branding agency behind The Fat Duck\u2019s Sound of the Sea dish, sees brands beginning to take sensory marketing more seriously. \u201cSensory marketing is currently seen as an add-on,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can see in five years\u2019 time it [becoming] best practice.\u201d Drinks giant Diageo is a major investor in sensory marketing, launching multi-sensory spaces and apps for brands including Guinness, the Singleton and Johnnie Walker. This investment is driven by science rather than technology, however. As the company\u2019s global design director, Jeremy Lindley, says: \u201cAs humans, we\u2019re not logic-based beings; we make decisions primarily off emotions. Really, it\u2019s about marketers understanding more about what makes us human and what motivates us.\u201d Pairing sound with food and drink has been scientifically proven to enhance flavour. A recent study from Oxford University revealed that high-frequency sounds enhance sweetness in food, while low sounds bring out bitterness. British Airways is banking on this sensory science to help it stand out in the premium market. The airline is launching an in-flight playlist with 13 tracks chosen to enhance the taste of the dishes on its in-flight menu.      Selling experiences Charles Spence, the experimental psychology professor behind the Oxford University study, who also worked with British Airways on its synesthetic soundtrack, says that many brands are looking at ways in which they can bring the experience they provide consumers in the retail space into the home. \u201cEveryone now is selling experience,\u201d he says. \u201cIn five years\u2019 time, when you go into a wine store\u2026 you\u2019ll be able to scan the label on the bottle and get the matching music for your wine.\u201d The influence of the sensory approach upon new technology is also emerging. One piece of tech leading the charge is the Apple Watch, which will have a tactile GPS function to literally nudge you in the right direction if you get lost. \u201cAs it develops, digital is becoming more touchy-feely and more sensory,\u201d Jones notes. But for future advancements in sensory experiences, the world\u2019s most creative culinary experts are ones to watch, adds Spence: \u201cinnovation will happen in hands of the chefs turning technology into something memorable, more sensational and more shocking.\u201d Visually augmented food is certainly something of which we\u2019ll being seeing and eating more. Japanese researchers have shown that augmented reality can trick people into feeling full by making food on the plate appear larger than it is (a godsend to dieters). Spence predicts that in years to come, when certain foodstuffs are no longer in existence, we\u2019ll use Google Glass to project images on to our dishes to give us the impression of the food we used to enjoy. Technological wizardry aside, for sensory marketing to be successful it should continue to take its cues from human insights. Sam Bompas, the co-founder of Bompas &amp; Parr, the food artists and creators of a multi-sensorial firework display for Vodafone, says: \u201cWhat you\u2019re trying to do is buy time in people\u2019s brains. The more time you have to spend in someone\u2019s brain in a positive way, the more likely they are to buy your product.\u201d More like this \u2022 What virtual reality could mean for ads and brands\u2022 People, devices and the future of content marketing\u2022 The drinks brands using tech to foster deeper consumer relationships To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, sign up free for Media Network membership.

Victory at his home event in Basel on Sunday took Federer within 2,230 points of the Serb but with Djokovic defending 2,500 points over the next few weeks having won in both Paris and the season-ending ATP Tour Finals in London last year, his Swiss rival has every chance of turning back the clock. Federer reached the semi-finals of both tournaments last year and boasts a 66-10 win/loss ratio this season \u2013 the best on the tour. Already the record holder for the most consecutive weeks at No1 with 302, the 33-year-old has come through a serious back injury and the birth of second set of twins but would usurp Andre Agassi as the oldest world No1 in history if he manages it in Paris. Roger Federer: the fall and rise of a champion       October-December 2012 After 17 weeks as No1, Federer ceded top spot to Djokovic by dropping points from his 2011 title wins at the Swiss Indoors Basel, Paris Masters and the ATP World Tour Finals. January-March 2013 After a five-set defeat to Andy Murray in the semifinals of the Australian Open, Federer\u2019s power waned as he lost his titles at the Rotterdam Open and the Dubai Championships before succumbing to a back injury at the Indian Wells Masters, which enforced a two-month break from the sport. April-June 2013 Murray climbed to No2 on 1 April above Federer, who didn\u2019t play again until the Madrid Open in mid-May, where he suffered a third-round exit, his earliest since 2003. The Swiss held on to his No3 ranking due to his win at Halle Open \u2013 his only title of 2013 \u2013 but he lost to world No116 Sergiy Stakhovsky in the second-round at Wimbledon. July The form of Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer, and early exits from the French Open in June and Wimbledon, meant Federer slipped to No5. The 31-year-old was now in free-fall: losing in the second-round at Swiss Open, and re-injuring his back in the process. August Federer missed out on ATP points by withdrawing from the Canadian Open, and suffered defeat to Rafael Nadal in Cincinnati in the third-round. Federer fell to No7, his lowest ranking in over a decade, despite maintaining that he was \u201chappy with his progress\u201d. September After an encouraging start to the US Open, Tommy Robredo destroyed him in straight-sets in the fourth-round. Federer\u2019s return to the top five was due to rivals such as Tomas Berdych being unable to accrue ATP points due to Davis Cup commitments. October Federer\u2019s poor form continued: despite playing a game less due to a bye, Federer lost to Ga\u00ebl Monfils in the Shanghai Masters third round. Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro\u2019s win at the Japan Open meant the Swiss slipped to seventh once more. November-December  An encouraging showing at the Swiss Open finished with defeat in the final to Del Potro. Federer then beat the Argentinian at the Paris Masters \u2013 his first win over a top-10 player since January \u2013 qualifying for the ATP World Tour finals as No6 seed. January 2014 Despite a semi-final appearance at the Australian Open, Federer slipped to No8 \u2013 his lowest ranking since 2002 \u2013 due to Stanislas Wawrinka\u2019s victory in Melbourne, which also saw Federer displaced as Swiss No1. February-March The road to recovery begins. Federer fought from a set down to beat Berdych in the final of the Dubai Tennis Championship and narrowly lost to Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells Masters. With his back troubles behind him, Federer jumps to No5 in the rankings. April Federer begins the month with the best record on the Tour \u2013 22 wins, four defeats \u2013 and climbs to fourth after a quarter-final appearance at the Miami Open. May-July Davis Cup distraction and a withdrawal from the Madrid Open to look after his pregnant wife delayed his progress on the Tour, but returning to win at Halle and as a finalist at both Monte Carlo and Wimbledon, Federer moved back ahead of Wawrinka into the No3 ranking. August-October With Nadal sidelined with a wrist injury Federer was a beaten finalist at the Canadian Open, and won the Cincinnati Masters in August \u2013 his 80th ATP singles title. Reaching the US Open semi-final in September further closed the gap on Nadal in second, and he surpassed the Spaniard with his Shanghai Masters title win this month.

She\u2019s running towards a distant hill; yet no matter how quickly she runs, her surroundings move with her, effectively stranding her. She meets the enigmatic Red Queen. \u201cNow, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place,\u201d the Queen explains. \u201cIf you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\u201d China\u2019s healthcare system suffers from the same problem \u2013 despite running at full speed over the past few decades, it can\u2019t possibly move fast enough to keep up with the country\u2019s social and economic changes. China\u2019s per capita GDP grew more than 25-fold from 1980 to 2011; its life expectancy rose by nine years; its infant mortality rate quartered. Yet as Chinese citizens grow older and wealthier, they are also burdened by a rise in pollution, smoking, obesity and other public-health hazards, creating a soaring demand for quality medical care. During the Mao era, in the 1940s through to the mid-70s, the country\u2019s healthcare system was rudimentary but egalitarian, entirely supported by the state. Yet in the 80s, reformer Deng Xiaoping dismantled the system, leaving hospitals suddenly responsible for their own economic wellbeing. The result has been rampant profit-seeking: overprescription of medications, excessive testing and shocking efforts to cut corners. Many Chinese hospitals don\u2019t keep soap in their public bathrooms. Physicians are so underpaid that they often must supplement their salaries with kickbacks from drug companies and patient bribes. The system is also deeply stratified. A typical villager, upon falling ill, will first visit a local clinic \u2013 usually a concrete-floored, one- to two-room facility, equipped with little more than intravenous drips and a small pharmacy. If his malady requires further attention, he will be forced to ascend through a hierarchy of institutions \u2013 to a county hospital, then a provincial hospital, then a specialised clinic in a metropolis such as Beijing or Shanghai. Major institutions, inundated with patients from afar, suffer from chronic overcrowding. It is common to see families sleeping overnight on hospital lawns to avoid early-morning queues.     Mothers with children suffering from respiratory problems wait in a Chinese hospital. Photograph: China Daily/Reuters    With the stakes so high, tempers run hot when treatments fail. Patient-on-doctor violence has become startlingly common \u2013 stabbings and mob-style attacks have risen 23% a year on average since 2002, according to the China Hospital Management Association. A typical hospital suffers one such incident every two weeks. The Chinese government has poured billions of pounds into healthcare reform in recent years, and the system has improved accordingly. At present, 99% of the rural population gets some kind of insurance, up from 21% a decade ago; the country plans to roll out universal coverage by 2020. Yet the price of basic medical services has also risen, and many insured patients are paying as much as they once were. As of last year, the government gives each rural resident 280 yuan (\u00a328.34) in annual healthcare subsidies. Yet elaborate procedures can cost many times that, and patients must pay the difference out of pocket. China has one of the highest savings rates in the world \u2013 about 50% \u2013 largely because families fear catastrophic healthcare costs. Chinese authorities have been embracing other, more innovative ideas to improve the system: new technologies, private investment, new training regimens for doctors \u2013 in short, redoubling their speed just to keep up the pace.

Photograph: Denis Farrell/AP    South Africa: \u2018Labouring under a two-tier system\u2019  With the world\u2019s biggest HIV caseload, rampant tuberculosis (TB) and rising obesity, South African healthcare is under unique strain. The government spent more than 8.5% of GDP on healthcare in 2012, higher than the 5% recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for a country of its socioeconomic status, yet performed worse than comparable nations. The historical legacy of colonialism and apartheid is still manifest in one of the most unequal societies in the world. Healthcare is no exception and South Africa continues to labour under a two-tier system. The private sector consumes 60% of total health spending yet caters to only about 15% of the population. The facilities are world class and less expensive than in Britain, the US or Australia \u2013 fertility treatment, for example, attracts foreigners at a fraction of the cost \u2013 but are beyond the financial means of most South Africans. Public healthcare struggles to meet the needs of the other 85%, with often overcrowded facilities, poor equipment and shortages of drugs. Less than 30% of doctors, dentists, pharmacists, physiotherapists and psychologists, and just 40% of professional nurses, work in the public sector. Some essential services are provided free by the state. TB treatment, for example, is not available in private clinics. After diagnosing a patient with TB, private doctors refer the patient to the public sector, where everyone receives TB medicine free of charge. The most striking success in free provision is the antiretroviral treatment programme for people with HIV, initiated 10 years ago after the government, accused of \u201cAids denialism\u201d, lost a landmark court case. Today, South Africa has the world\u2019s biggest public-sector HIV programme, with 2.5 million people receiving treatment. The country\u2019s life expectancy has consequently increased from 53 in 2002 to 60 in 2013. But there are practical barriers. Patients\u2019 first point of contact are primary healthcare clinics where, in serious cases, nurses and community health workers can refer them to hospital. These clinics are concentrated in cities and towns, often inaccessible to people in rural areas who cannot afford transport. Some 47% of children live in rural areas where only 12% of doctors and 19% of nurses work, according to the People\u2019s Health Movement of South Africa. Some villagers rely on an informal network of traditional healers and medicines. Not everything in public hospitals is free, and only an estimated 17% of South Africans are part of a medical aid scheme to cover the costs. In addition, staff shortages translate into long waiting times. Critics say treatable conditions are not treated on time and preventable diseases are not prevented. The government has admitted the need for a \u201cradical improvement\u201d in the quality of services and \u201cmassive investment\u201d in buildings and equipment, as well as fundamental changes in management. The health minister, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, has been known to roll up his sleeves and work a night shift at the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto, the biggest hospital in the southern hemisphere. He and his family use public hospitals and in 2011 he told the Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper: \u201cIt\u2019s a self-defeating prophecy to keep on saying we don\u2019t have the means. There are good services in countries with fewer facilities and staff than us.\u201d Nevertheless, Motsoaledi has a big plan for healthcare reform: a national health insurance scheme. The aim is to provide essential healthcare for all, irrespective of employment status and ability to pay, as enshrined in the post-apartheid constitution. Anyone earning above a certain income will be required to contribute to the NHI Fund. The plan has met resistance from the private sector. But the government insists: \u201cIt will actually make the sector more sustainable by making it levy reasonable fees. The intention of NHI is rather to make sure that citizens are able to use both the public and private sectors in such a way that they complement each other rather than one undermining the other. At the moment, private healthcare is only for the rich. NHI is trying to blend the two in a more sustainable manner that benefits the population.\u201d David Smith      Patients in New Delhi\u2019s AIIMS hospital. Photograph: Gurinder Osan/AP    India: \u2018Public or private, India\u2019s health care system is largely unregulated\u2019 When Ria, 12, an illiterate maid\u2019s daughter, suddenly developed a giant lump in her abdomen, her mother knew better than to trust India\u2019s publicly run hospital system. Mazes of dingy corridors, outdated equipment and filthy wards where linens are absent and rats run freely greet the desperately poor and sick patients seeking care. India spends just 1.3% of GDP on healthcare, one of the lowest rates in the world. Every day, patients from around the country, some who have travelled for days, can be seen queueing outside India\u2019s biggest public teaching hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. Hundreds jostle to see erratically available specialists. Others push their way to the counters of crowded roadside medical shops to purchase not just bandages and surgical equipment, but even life-saving drugs and the pints of blood patients are often expected to provide. At night, dozens of patients and their relatives sleep under the bright lights of the closest bus shelter, unable to afford accommodation. The other option, equally inaccessible for poor Indians, lies a few miles away. In the lobby of one of New Delhi\u2019s swanky corporate hospitals, wealthy patients from around the world sip lattes as they wait for doctors in brightly lit waiting rooms, complete with cleaners, attendants and stacks of glossy magazines. Here, by global standards, the best diagnostic tests and procedures can be had for a fraction of western prices, a fact that fuels medical tourism to the tune of an estimated $78.6bn in India. But public or private, India\u2019s health care system is largely unregulated. In May, David Berger, a visiting Australian doctor writing in the British Medical Journal of his experiences in a small Indian hospital, blew the lid off the widespread practice of doctors receiving kickbacks for referring patients for medical tests, scans and even surgery. Subsequently, a group of doctors at AIIMS formed the Society for Less Investigative Medicine to counter corruption, which is deemed widespread by many. India\u2019s new health minister has also vowed to clean up corruption. And the new prime minister, Narendra Modi, has further spoken of his vision for universal healthcare. Partially inspired by Obamacare, it would potentially be the largest scheme in the world and tackle such daunting silent epidemics as tuberculosis, which claims 300,000 Indian lives annually. But critics argue that such a private sector-led scheme will further marginalise the state system and leave India\u2019s poorest citizens increasingly vulnerable to exploitation and substandard treatment, especially in rural areas. Ria successfully had a grapefruit-sized tumour removed from her ovary. Her mother\u2019s employer led the search for credible doctors, interpreting their advice and helping to cover the roughly \u00a3600 in diagnostic and surgical costs. Thankfully, her tumour was benign. According to a 2011 study in the Lancet medical journal, 39 million Indians are pushed into poverty every year due to medical costs, a fact that possibly explains why even Britain\u2019s imperfect and overburdened NHS seems like a dream to many here.

Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters/Corbis    Brazil \u2018A huge gap between standards of private and public care\u2019 When more than a million protesters took to the street of Brazil last year, the woeful condition of the public healthcare system was high among their list of grievances. Inequality and vast distances are the main problem. According to the World Bank, the country has 1.8 doctors for every 1,000 people \u2013 well below the 3.2 ratio in neighbouring Argentina, and significantly below those of Mexico, the US and the UK. On paper, however, Brazil has one of the most comprehensive and generous public health networks in the world. The Unified Health System, or SUS as it is widely known, is universal and free for everyone. It has notched up impressive achievements. Since the turn of the century, life expectancy is up from 68.8 to 74.5, infant mortality is estimated to have fallen to 14.4 per 1,000 live births from 17.6, and the government says 95% of children are now fully vaccinated. According to the World Bank, Brazil\u2019s healthcare spending was 9.3% of GDP in 2012. But, reflecting this very unequal society, there is a huge gap between standards of private and public care. In state capitals, the one in four of the population who can afford private services benefits from almost double the doctor-patient ratio. For those in the SUS, there are insufficient beds, and waiting times for basic diagnosis and treatment are long. Regional disparities are even more glaring. Residents of the poorest state, Maranh\u00e3o, have barely a quarter of the spend per head as the inhabitants of wealthy Rio de Janeiro. To address this problem, President Dilma Rousseff last year launched a crash programme to fill the gap with thousands of primarily foreign medics. The \u201cMais Medicos\u201d (More Doctors) programme offers incentives to those go to medical schools in remote and poor areas, such as the Amazon, so that in the long term they can train a new generation of professionals. So far, 4,199 doctors have been dispatched and the plan is to increase this to 11,500 doctors by the end of 2017. The vast majority have come from Cuba. This is politically controversial because the Cuban government pockets about a quarter of their salaries. When they arrived, Brazilian doctors booed and chanted \u201cslave\u201d at the newcomers and accused them of lacking the necessary qualification and language skills needed to do a good job. While it is true that the normal diploma requirement has been waived for the Cubans, the government says this is justified because they are only expected to provide primary care, not surgery. \u201cMais Medicos is a success because it is serving the public with quality and because it is greatly improving health indicators throughout Brazil,\u201d says health minister Arthur Chioro. \u201cFifty million people who did not previously have primary care now have exactly what they need most of all.\u201d Jon Watts Egypt \u2018A system that doesn\u2019t know how to manage itself\u2019 A few weeks ago, a woman gave birth in the street outside a public hospital in northern Egypt. Depending on who you believe, the hospital either didn\u2019t have enough medics to tend to her \u2013 or they demanded money that she couldn\u2019t pay. Hers was an extreme example of the problems with Egypt\u2019s public health service, particularly in provincial areas. Thanks to a decree issued earlier this year, all Egyptians should get free access to emergency hospital care for at least 48 hours. But in practice some state facilities, particularly in the countryside, either cannot provide instant healthcare \u2013 or have to charge for it. Due to a shortfall in government funding, they have no other way of paying their staff. And the problem goes beyond A&amp;E. A state-run insurance scheme nominally provides subsidised non-emergency healthcare to children, government workers and the families of those workers \u2013 a group that the government says totals 54% of the population. But by the government\u2019s own count, only 8% of those covered by the scheme actually use state facilities. \u201cThis in itself denounces the problem,\u201d says Ayman Sabae, a doctor and campaigner for healthcare reform at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a prominent watchdog. \u201cBoth the service quality and access to the services are so limited that only 8% use them.\u201d A government clinic that Sabae visited in rural Qena province last month exemplifies the problem. Like about half of Egypt\u2019s 4,000 state clinics, this one is well-equipped, and newly refurbished. But according to Sabae, there has not been a doctor here for the past four years. Clinicians assigned here might only earn around 1,200 Egyptian pounds a month \u2013 about \u00a3100, or little more than Egypt\u2019s average monthly wage \u2013 whereas they can earn around five times as much in the private sector. So they opt for the latter. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of finance employees, maybe a nurse,\u201d says Sabae of the clinic. \u201cBut no doctors. And that\u2019s very typical \u2013 you have a system that doesn\u2019t know how to manage itself. You have the money to renovate the clinic, but not the human resources to manage it.\u201d As a result, the half of the population who are eligible for free healthcare are often no better off than the half who aren\u2019t. Most end up paying for their care themselves \u2013 in fact, 71.8% of healthcare spending in Egypt comes from people\u2019s pockets. NGOs, charities and religious groups pick up some of the slack (the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood part-built their influence on their network of clinics). Those who aren\u2019t covered by the state healthcare plan can apply for another of state-paid treatment \u2013 the Program for Treatment at the Expense of the State. But this is only for those with life-threatening diseases who can show they are incapable of paying through other means. As a last resort, any patient can get free treatment at university training clinics and hospitals. On the plus side, the doctors here are often the best in the country. On the downside, students observe every operation, the facilities are often unhygienic, and the cost of basic supplies is frequently covered by the patients or the doctors themselves. \u201cWhen I worked there as a doctor, I was paid 200 Egyptian pounds [about \u00a320] a month, and I would spend more per month from my own pocket to buy blood from other hospitals,\u201d says Sally Toma, another doctor who campaigns for healthcare reform. \u201cOtherwise, I was told, I would have to choose who should get blood, and who should not.\u201d Patrick Kingsley  Italy \u2018A persistent complaint is unfairness\u2019  Italians by and large regard health as a priority. And it shows up in one of the highest life expectancies in the world. In 2012, according to the World Bank, the average newborn Italian could expect to live to the age of 83 \u2013 the same as in Switzerland or Japan. But, like many things in a country of contrasts and disparities, the provision of health services varies widely from one part of Italy to another. Last year, a report was published by the parliamentary committee that scrutinises what Italians call malasanita (literally \u201cbad health\u201d): cases of extreme negligence on the part of doctors or hospital staff. Out of 400 deaths attributable to malasanita between April 2009 and December 2012, more than 40% occurred in just two of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, Calabria and Sicily. Italy\u2019s Servizio Sanitario Nazionale was founded in 1978 and modelled in large part on the NHS. But right from the outset it was only to a limited extent national. The central government fixes the overall budget, determines minimum levels of care and, for example, negotiates drug prices with the big pharmaceutical companies. But it is the regional governments that administer the system, and there are huge discrepancies between them in levels of efficiency and integrity. In parts of northern Italy, patients receive attention as good as anywhere in Europe. \u201cCustomer satisfaction\u201d, however, falls off rapidly in the southern half of the country. And the drop goes hand in hand with a fall in measures of efficiency. In Sicily, for example, there are roughly 10 hospital doctors for every hospital bed. In the north-eastern region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the ratio is half that. Discernible in the statistics are variations in the degree of corruption and the use of public services to distribute jobs and patronage. Last year\u2019s parliamentary commission report noted that in Campania, the region around Naples, 383 health officials had been taken on to the payroll without having to go through the bother of a selection process. A persistent complaint among patients is of unfairness. In the southern half of Italy especially, they often move up waiting lists, not according to the date on which their names were first entered, nor by virtue of the seriousness of their condition, but according to whether they can secure a raccomandazione (reference) from someone with influence over the relevant surgeon. By and large, the state has been open-handed in allocating resources to health. In 2012, Italy spent 7.2% of its gross domestic product on the public health system. That was less than was spent by the UK, Germany or France. But then Italy\u2019s economy has scarcely grown since the turn of the century and is under growing pressure from European institutions to trim its spending. Cuts have been made in recent years. But the overall budget for this year, of almost \u20ac111bn (\u00a388bn), was still almost 4% higher than it had been in 2011.

Photograph:   Jonathan Bachman / Reuters/Reuters    The United States \u2018More than 13% of Americans still have no health insurance\u2019  When he announced the news that a doctor returning from Guinea to Harlem, in New York, had been diagnosed with Ebola in October, mayor Bill de Blasio said that New York\u2019s had the \u201cworld\u2019s strongest healthcare system\u201d. But the fact that he referred to the city\u2019s system, rather than the nation\u2019s, is telling. In fact, while the US can boast some of the best doctors and most advanced medical technology in the world, it doesn\u2019t really have a coherent healthcare system at all. Healthcare in the US is private insurance-based and decentralised, with most care providers owned locally by private companies, and local and state governments controlling access to federal programs. The private and public systems that overlap in some areas, and leave gaps in others, make the US the country that spends the most per capita and as a percentage of GDP of any country in the world, but paradoxically consistently last among comparable nations in measures of quality of coverage such as infant mortality. Because their cost is decided by private companies, individual procedures can be extraordinarily expensive. A single MRI scan in some parts of the country can cost as much as $2,871 (\u00a31,780); an appendectomy as much as $29,426 (\u00a318,000), and a caesarean-section delivery as much as $26,305 (\u00a316,000), according to a report by the International Federation of Health Plans. Some procedures can be as much as eight times the price of the equivalent operation in the UK, and a 2013 study by NerdWallet Health showed that medical bills are the biggest cause of bankruptcy in the US. Some of the gaps are filled by government operations. One of these is Medicare, which guarantees health insurance for the elderly. Another is Medicaid, a low-income program which the Obama administration has recently expanded \u2013 but state governments, especially those controlled by rightwing Republican governors, have consistently rejected the expansion, leaving many poor residents without healthcare. Yet another is the Veterans Health Administration, which was hit by scandal in April 2014 when it was revealed that at least 40 US military veterans had died while waiting for medical care. Perhaps the core struggle of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency has been to pass his Affordable Care Act, which would aim to use state online insurance exchanges to reduce the number of people without coverage. But the bill has become a political football for the far-right Tea Party, who see any attempt to close the gaping holes in coverage as unacceptable government overreach. The result has been that as of the beginning of 2014, more than 13% of Americans still have no health insurance coverage at all.

Photograph: Theo Heimann/Getty Images     Germany \u2018It gives patients a lot of choice\u2019  Germany\u2019s healthcare system is best understood as a middle option between the British state-run and the American market-led model. In principle, healthcare cover is universal, as in Britain: treatment of the unemployed is covered by the state, and ordinary patients rarely get presented with a bill after seeing a doctor. Unlike in Britain, however, this universal care is not funded by a centrally collected tax, but by so-called Krankenkassen or sickness funds \u2013 a system that goes back all the way to Otto von Bismarck\u2019s health insurance bill of 1883. Signing up with a sickness fund is compulsory for every German citizen. Once you have joined, you pay a premium calculated according to your income: half of it is paid by you, the other half by your employer. If you make less money, you pay less. If you are lucky enough to have a career that makes you a lot of money \u2013 and this is where Germany veers towards the US model \u2013 you can choose to ignore one of the 131 public, non-profit sickness funds, and go with a private insurer instead. One advantage in comparison with the British system is that you don\u2019t end up having to pay double \u2013 say, for Bupa and the NHS. In Germany, about 89% of the population is covered by public sickness funds, the remaining 11% are private. One of the big plus points of the German system is that it gives patients a lot of choice: you are not restricted to the nearest general practitioner in your postcode but can sign up with any GP you like. GPs also have less of a gatekeeper function: if you know you have a back problem, you can go straight to see an osteopath. Because the system is less centralised, doctors and nurses don\u2019t have to stick to behavioural guidelines: for foreigners, some German doctors can come across as shockingly informal. \u201cPractitioners enjoy a lot of freedom in Germany,\u201d says Stefan Etgeton, a senior expert of the Bertelsmann Foundation. \u201cBut therein can also lie a problem: forcing through new medical standards can be arduous, because some doctors are convinced that their way of doing things is still best.\u201d In Germany, the healthcare system does not attract the same unholy combination of vitriol and affection that the NHS does \u2013 it just about works so that both the left and the free-marketeers can see in the system what they want. But that\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t problems eating away at the system. For a start, the per-capita cost of healthcare has been much higher in Germany than in Britain for years. Most recent figures, from 2012, show the country spending 11.3% of its GDP on healthcare \u2013 2% above the OECD average. \u201cAs a whole, the German system encourages overspending,\u201d says Edzard Ernst, Exeter University\u2019s German-born professor of complementary medicine. Doctors, who get charged per item, are incentivised to oversubscribe, and patients are incentivised to use the system more than in other countries. There are also concerns about the long-term effects of the dual private-public system. One of the problems is that it provides an incentive for the best doctors to move to urban areas where there are more high earners who can afford private sickness funds. As a result, rural regions struggle. A public survey in 2012 showed 58% of the population supports scrapping private health insurance altogether.

Nowhere is the phenomenon more pronounced than in China, where a state-orchestrated urbanisation drive has prompted a megacity building bonanza characterised by skyscrapers and sprawl.  By the end of 2015, one in three of the world\u2019s buildings over 150-metres will be in China. Construction of the world\u2019s second-tallest building, the 632-metre tall Shanghai Tower, is due to be completed next year. Few people outside China have heard of Suzhou, a city in the eastern province of Jiangsu with a population of 1.3 million (China now has over 140 cities of more than one million people; America has nine).  Yet if all goes to plan, Suzhou will soon boast the world\u2019s third-tallest building, the 700m Zhongnan Centre. Other Chinese cities joining the upward rush include Shenzhen, Wuhan, Tianjin and Shenyang. By 2020, China is set to be home to six of the world\u2019s 10 tallest buildings, although none will top the globe\u2019s current highest, the 828m Burj Khalifa in Dubai.     The planned 700m Zhongnan Centre in Suzhou, which is set to be the world\u2019s third tallest building when completed    Zoning laws, listed buildings and other well-intentioned hallmarks of democratic society can impede the march of progress; the opposition to London\u2019s Shard would be unimaginable in contemporary China.  The dramatic experiments in skyscraper construction and urban planning in the one-party state will, increasingly, hold lessons for cities the world over. As a response to the dilemma of how to build densely while retaining liveability, the Shanghai Tower may be the closest architects have yet come to creating a \u201cvertical city\u201d.  Designed by the American firm Gensler (pdf), the building forms a spiralling trunk that takes the amenities of the horizontal city block \u2013 homes, shops, offices, galleries, multiplexes \u2013 and stacks them on a vertical plane.  Its \u201csky gardens\u201d \u2013 around one-third of the site is green space \u2013 will showcase flora from around China, countering the predilection of developers to commercialise every square inch. According to Wood: \u201cThe commitment to public space \u2026 that\u2019s what elevates the Shanghai Tower to be a potentially fantastic building.\u201d But this, he adds, is only the start; architects need to be more radical still. \u201cI hear a lot of developers talking about putting so many uses in the building you\u2019ll never have to leave it,\u201d Wood says. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, is it not? Who would ever not want to leave the building?\u201d      The 632m Shanghai Tower (tallest building, left) under construction. Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex    Instead, he calls for \u201csustainable vertical urbanism\u201d, or the linkage of clustered tall buildings with sky bridges and elevated plazas replicating the ground floor in the air. A building should be responsive to topology as in vernacular architecture \u2013 Calgary and Khartoum should look different \u2013 and be designed in consideration of the buildings around it. \u201cIt\u2019s no accident that every science-fiction film, from Metropolis to Blade Runner through to Star Wars, envisages the dense, multi-level city of the future,\u201d Wood adds. \u201cThe reason is because it completely makes sense.\u201d A proposed development that comes closer than most to this ideal is Cloud Citizen, which co-won a design competition in Shenzhen, a city in southern China.  If built, the 1.7 million square-metre complex would be \u201cas much a strategy for how to build future cities capable of giving back more to the environment than they cost, as it is a singular iconographic mega building complex with an identifiable and striking skyline,\u201d say the architects.  Sky bridges and plazas connect the towers, the tallest of which is 680m, in a cloud-like mass. Cloud Citizen would have offices, parks, cultural facilities and homes with an ability to harvest rainwater, produce food and create power from the sun, wind and algae \u2013 a mini-city within a city.     Shenzen\u2019s Cloud Citizen would be a mini-city within a city - containing offices, parks, cultural facilities and homes with an ability to harvest rainwater, produce food and create power from the sun, wind and algae    Super tall towers are as much about prestige as commercial gain. In China they are also symptomatic of a central government policy that has led to the frantic densification of cities.  Premier Li Keqiang has called urbanisation a \u201chuge engine\u201d for growth as the government attempts to restructure its economy away from a reliance on exports and investment to one based on domestic spending. While most people in China were farmers 30 years ago, 50% of people lived in cities by 2011 and by 2030 it\u2019s estimated one billion people, or 70% of the population, will be urbanites. Getting cities wrong could create slums, exacerbate climate change and encourage social instability. The United Nations Population Division projects that by 2050, 66% of the world\u2019s population will be urban, up from 54% today. Once population growth is factored in, this amounts to 2.5 billion more people living in cities. At the CTBUH conference in Shanghai, architects agreed that sprawl is not a sustainable solution to density. But building towers of dizzying height in a never-ending game of architectural one-upmanship is impractical too. \u201cWe have to find the solution of how to move towards more density but to keep the human scale\u201d, says Yosuke Hayano, principal partner of MAD Architects, a Beijing-based practice. \u201cPeople are very sensitive to space.\u201d MAD designs on a theory they call shan shui (\u201cmountain water\u201d), in reference to the way cities were strategically positioned in ancient China near rivers and mountains.  The Zendai Himalayas Centre, a 560,000 sq m development in the eastern city of Nanjing due for completion in 2017, is a ring of undulating hill-shaped \u201ctowers\u201d around a cluster of low buildings, with vertical louvres creating the impression of waterfalls. This mimicry of nature, MAD believes, imbues urban environments with humanity.     The Interlace residential apartments in Singapore resemble an orderly stack of Jenga blocks.  Photograph: OMA    Ole Scheeren, a German architect based in China and Hong Kong, thinks architects need to \u201cmove away from the isolation that is embedded in the typology of the tower\u201d.  Scheeren co-designed the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing, which houses the state-run broadcaster and is one of the capital\u2019s icons. It\u2019s a striking cuboid loop of tower of 473,000 sq m. Alarmed at the \u201caccumulation of singularities\u201d, or mono-functional towers accruing in Asian cities, Scheeren\u2019s buildings are prototypes for urban centres that need to be dense yet diverse, porous and livable. For Interlace, a residential compound of 1,000 apartments in Singapore, Scheeren was tasked with building 12 towers of 24 storeys organised on a grid. \u201cThe sense of living in a community is not explored well spatially in a configuration like this,\u201d Scheeren says. He toppled the towers, forming an interconnected mesh of buildings that resemble an orderly stack of Jenga blocks, creating space for parks, public courtyards and a running track. \u201cWhere towers used to be relatively monotonous and simple repetitive structures they\u2019re becoming more integrated and connected and also vertically diverse,\u201d Scheeren says. \u201cIn that sense they will, I believe, attain more aspects of the words everybody likes to use: \u2018vertical cities\u2019.\u201d ", "tags": ["Skyscrapers", "Cities", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Urbanisation", "Architecture"], "publicationDate": "2014-10-30T09:54:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/02/chinese-viewers-captivated-by-western-tv-hits", "sentences": ["Last month the BBC unveiled China\u2019s take on Top Gear on national broadcaster Shanghai Dragon TV, featuring a double Olympic gold diving champion, the presenter of Chinese Idol and a pop star turned actor in place of British hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond."], "title": "Chinese viewers in their millions are captivated by western television hits", "article": "The fact that subtitled episodes of Downton Abbey are watched by 160 million viewers shows just what a love affair the Chinese have developed with foreign television shows and formats remade for their market.

China is the fastest-growing market for the sale of British shows and formats, with growth of 40% last year. While it is still relatively small in revenue terms, the opportunity is immense. \u201cIn the UK a top-rated TV show may just get into double-digit millions [in audience size], but China has 1.4 billion people and gets easily double, triple or quadruple that,\u201d says Pierre Cheung, vice-president of greater China for BBC Worldwide. \u201cThe market is a massive opportunity.\u201d China\u2019s Got Talent, a local version of Simon Cowell\u2019s ITV hit, has seen viewers top 400 million an episode. Locally produced versions of western franchises combine the sheen of the exotic with the familiarity of local aesthetics. Singing competitions are especially popular: China\u2019s Got Talent, The Voice of China and a version of The X Factor (China\u2019s Strongest Voice) have all been major hits. Last month the BBC unveiled China\u2019s take on Top Gear on national broadcaster Shanghai Dragon TV, featuring a double Olympic gold diving champion, the presenter of Chinese Idol and a pop star turned actor in place of British hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond. These shows are strikingly different from their western counterparts. The Voice of China, the most popular show in 2013, began the nearly three-hour finale of its third season on 7 October with a soaring shot of the Great Wall; a voiceover praised China\u2019s thousands of years of history. The show then cut to testimonials from fans and former contestants: an elderly man, a middle-class family, a farmer, a foreign tourist in Tiananmen square. \u201cThe Voice of China lets all of us music lovers bravely pursue our dreams,\u201d said a man carrying a lute. Sentimental ballads are the order of the day. Judges are unwaveringly supportive. Next up are remakes of documentary Educating Yorkshire and the potentially tricky prospect of a Chinese Big Brother. The sometimes risqu\u00e9 content that comes with Big Brother territory frequently lands the show in hot water with UK watchdog Ofcom \u2013 which has nothing on China\u2019s all-powerful State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, a notoriously twitchy regulator that acts as a cultural guardian. It has pulled shows at the first hint of attitudes or depictions that show China or its people in a poor light. In 2011 it banned X Factor-style talent show Super Girl, which has attracted audiences of up to 400 million, and announced last autumn it would stop satellite TV stations from broadcasting more than one foreign-format show a year. Stations have replaced these programmes with others the government deems more acceptable, such as documentaries about Communist party history. The problem is that nobody wants to watch them.

Photograph: China Photos/Getty Images    There have been reports that the BBC\u2019s Sherlock, with Benedict Cumberbatch, was banned from major channels. However the BBC\u2019s Cheung denies this, saying it just took time for the show to move from airing on a Chinese video site to being broadcast on China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV. Martha Brass, chief operating officer at Big Brother producer Endemol, says careful collaboration with its partner Youku Tudou \u2013 China\u2019s answer to YouTube \u2013 will see a sanitised version make it past the censor. \u201cIn any country you obviously have to look at the cultural and regulatory environment, and we are well aware of that in relation to China,\u201d she says. \u201cBig Brother is actually a very flexible format. In the Philippines it is very much a family show, and in Australia we have run it in different time slots for different audiences. We feel confident about our ability to address the particular TV regulations in China.\u201d The rise of Chinese video services such as Sohu TV, Tencent and iQiyi has opened a huge new potential market for foreign programme rights ownersl. The third series of Sherlock has notched up more than 70 million views online, while US show The Big Bang Theory, the most popular foreign show in China, has been viewed more than 1.4bn times on video sites. \u201cNew media platforms are just starting to get into deals for more and more foreign shows,\u201d says Paul Sandler, managing director of Objective Productions. \u201cThat could have a massive impact on the market for content.\u201d However the rise in online viewing, and the popularity of foreign shows has been seen as a threat by the state regulator. In April, video streaming websites were told to \u201cclean up\u201d and stop showing The Big Bang Theory as well as US shows The Good Wife, NCIS and The Practice. Shows that might be thought much more likely to outrage the watchdog \u2013 The Walking Dead, House of Cards and Breaking Bad \u2013 were unaffected. As recently as three years ago China was considered something of a \u201cWild East\u201d for foreign production companies, replete with tales of the impossibility of doing deals and a culture of ripping off hit foreign formats without paying for rights. \u201cIf China wants to be taken seriously in the international market they have to treat intellectual property with proper respect,\u201d says Sandler, who has done deals for three series of a Chinese version of gameshow The Cube. \u201cThere is a will from the government to have a proper IP protection structure; it is nowhere near as bad as it was a few years ago.\u201d Sandler believes that for the Chinese TV industry the aim is to collaborate and learn about how to develop hit shows that they can export. China has some interesting homegrown hits, including a nationwide competition in the vein of Great British Bake Off but based on calligraphy; roughly translated, its title is Idiom Hero. But there is some way to go to make internationally appealing shows. \u201cThe truth is the real aim of all the broadcasters and government in China is to develop homegrown Chinese shows and export them,\u201d he says. \u201cThe same way as [they have] with cars, computers, white goods, you name it. We are trying to collaborate to come up with some genuinely good formats.\u201d Not everyone is impressed. For a market of 1.4 billion people, a total of \u00a317m in sales of British programmes and formats in 2013 seems like a \u201clong walk for a short drink\u201d, says one senior UK TV executive. But Cheung counters that. He says it is a slow-burn culture about building relationships, and the real cash will follow: \u201cYou have to get involved and engage the partners personally; proper trust takes time. It is challenging but at same time exciting.

The WGC-HSBC Champions event gets under way in Shanghai this week with the injured Woods not in the field. Rory McIlroy, who is in the midst of a messy legal battle with his former management company, and the fatigued Phil Mickelson, are also notable by their absences from an event that otherwise boasts 40 of the world\u2019s top 50 players. Giles Morgan, HSBC\u2019s global head of sponsorship and events, believes golf\u2019s growth in China has seen something of a sea change. He also hinted that the days of Woods routinely claiming US$3m or so (\u00a31.87m) in tournament appearance fees may be gone. There is currently no suggestion Woods will play at HSBC\u2019s flagship European Tour event, in Abu Dhabi in January. \u201cWhen golf in China was a much smaller sport Tiger was the firepower which moved the needle,\u201d Morgan explained. \u201cThat has grown and grown. That momentum has made the sport a much bigger force than just one individual, which is exactly right. We know that if we get 80% of the world\u2019s top players at this time of the season, we are in a good place. \u201cI\u2019m sad for Rory, I\u2019m disappointed, but we have that momentum behind us already; we had it two or three years ago. Every top player in the world is welcome to play this event if they qualify and we would be delighted to have them here. But we have moved beyond the point where we just need \u2018a player\u2019 to turn up to boost PR, gratification and media coverage. We are not interested in that, we are interested in genuine growth of the sport and I think we are sitting on a fantastic new chapter.\u201d Both the European and US PGA Tours understandably have their eyes fixed on the Asian market. Last year\u2019s WGC event at the Sheshan International club had a household TV reach in excess of 500 million. In Shanghai, almost 30 courses now exist in comparison to just one in the early 1990s. Another key statistic notes the expectation that 42% of the world\u2019s middle class, the sport\u2019s core market, will live in Asia by 2020. \u201cIn Asia, there is great appetite for golf and the sport therefore needs to think carefully about it. There is opportunity and the right people need to sit down together,\u201d Morgan added. He therefore shrugged off the impact of being without those who have chosen not to travel for this week. \u201cI don\u2019t have my head in my hands here because the field is strong,\u201d he said. \u201cI also don\u2019t believe any individual is bigger than the game. \u201cTiger hasn\u2019t been able to play here on a few occasions. He is now injured. I have no doubt at all that in the future the world No1, whoever that is, such is the growth of the game in China, they will be back. All of the great players will continue to be here.\u201d Morgan added: \u201cThe laws of geography and scheduling mean you are always going to lose one or two. We are quite sanguine about that. Phil has had a punishing season, I think he is quite tired. \u201cWe also respect Rory\u2019s decision. He feels at the moment he is not able to play because of what is going on from a personal point of view. There is nothing we can do about it. It is disappointing, of course it is, but it doesn\u2019t detract from the tournament.\u201d Henrik Stenson, who will return this week following the birth of his third child, concurred. \u201cIf you are playing professional sports you want to beat the best in the world and win the biggest tournaments. This is one of them,\u201d the Swede said. \u201cYou can always look at the couple of players who aren\u2019t here but that\u2019s a bit like shooting eight-under on a back nine and looking at the one hole you made par on instead of being happy with eight birdies.\u201d", "tags": ["Golf", "European Tour", "PGA Tour", "US sports", "Tiger Woods", "Rory McIlroy", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-03T13:16:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/04/adam-scott-steve-williams-tour-golf", "sentences": ["He has received \u201chundreds\u201d of applications for the role with Dave Clark, who normally caddies for Cameron Tringale, on duty for this week\u2019s WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai."], "title": "Adam Scott adjusts to life on tour without \u2018huge influence\u2019 Steve Williams", "article": "It is an indicator of Steve Williams\u2019 status that his absence as this golf season rumbles into 2015 will be as notable as that of any player.

I need to go out and find what is going to work for me at this stage in my career, to complement all the things I am doing now, just like I did when I hired Steve.\u201d Scott raises a smile when asked if the lure of competitive golf will prove too strong for Williams to overcome in the future. \u201cIt is really hard to know,\u201d said the Australian. \u201cProbably, yes, at some point. He truly loves the game and loves what he has done over the last 30-plus years [on tour]. \u201cI am sure at some point he will miss it. I absolutely understand what he has done; we are all at different points in our careers and I knew when Steve came in to work for me that we were on borrowed time a little bit. I am sure he would say that he thought after Tiger he would never caddie again. I was very fortunate to have three great years with him.\u201d Scott will take his time before deciding on Williams\u2019 replacement. He has received \u201chundreds\u201d of applications for the role with Dave Clark, who normally caddies for Cameron Tringale, on duty for this week\u2019s WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai. Not all of those approaching Scott have been entirely valid. \u201cI heard from some guy in Florida who lives at home and looks after his mum. He figured it would be a good job, I guess,\u201d Scott explained. More serious is the issue of what precisely happens next. \u201cI am in the process of using a few different guys and personalities, to see what fits best. Obviously I am also very sensitive to other people\u2019s situations. I am trying to ask guys to fill in who aren\u2019t working that week for other players. I have known Dave Clark for 12 years. \u201cI have a little time on my side. Although the nature of the job is trial and error, I want to make the right decision when I make a permanent choice. \u201cIt is good to know that people would want to work with me. If the phone didn\u2019t get a message, I would be a little worried about what they all think of me. The caddies are very aspirational as well. I think the way I have talked about what I want to achieve, some of the guys think they can help me do that and they want to do the same. That\u2019s an important part of it.\u201d", "tags": ["Adam Scott", "Golf", "PGA Tour", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-04T12:40:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/05/luke-donald-fresh-start-ryder-cup-shanghai", "sentences": ["I think Paul got things spot on.\u201d Donald\u2019s quest to return to something like the form which saw him ranked as the best player of the world for more than 50 weeks begins this week in Shanghai."], "title": "Luke Donald seeks fresh start as he bids to reclaim former glories | Ewan Murray", "article": "Luke Donald will take little satisfaction from the fact that his classiest acts of 2014 came away from the golf course. The pain of missing out on the Ryder Cup still lingers after all. It was Donald\u2019s reaction to being overlooked by Paul McGinley for a European wildcard pick which endeared him to the wider world. Rather than sulk, scream or moan about a failure to make it to Gleneagles, Donald offered his staunch backing \u2013 both in public and private \u2013 to the European cause. Others would not, and have not, done likewise. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any other way to react than how I did,\u201d says Donald. \u201cI preface anything I say by admitting I was very frustrated and angry at myself, really, for not playing well enough to deserve that pick. But what is the point of stewing? Of being bitter? I will use it as a motivation, that if I am in that situation again then the same thing will not happen. \u201cI had backed Paul. I am a planner myself and I know Paul was going to have everything planned out to the very last detail. He is a good speaker, he is motivational; I was excited about the prospect of being on his team. He proved to be fantastic in the role.\u201d A family holiday meant Donald caught only glimpses of another European success. Asked if watching on as his could-have-been team-mates triumphed was tough, the reply is a firm \u201cabsolutely\u201d. He adds: \u201cYou think of how important and how fun Ryder Cups are. I missed it. \u201cI had mixed emotions. It wasn\u2019t easy, of course I was jealous. If picked, I felt like I could have made a difference to the team. But you cannot fault anyone. The wildcards performed fine but that wasn\u2019t really a factor, anyway. I think Paul got things spot on.\u201d Donald\u2019s quest to return to something like the form which saw him ranked as the best player of the world for more than 50 weeks begins this week in Shanghai. He has not played competitively since early September, with the intervening period involving some \u201cbig decisions\u201d. Namely, Donald has returned to the full-time coaching of Pat Goss after what he insists was an amicable split with Chuck Cook. In essence, the 36-year-old has understood that his form and processes of 2011 were good enough to win major championships. Stars aligning are more pertinent than a technical overhaul. \u201cThings do need to fall into place,\u201d says Donald of his desire finally to win a major. \u201cI think I have to get away from putting those events on a pedestal. I have got to think of the little things that will all contribute to making me better. \u201cI won\u2019t go back to exactly how I swung the club before; there was some good stuff with Chuck that will stay in there. But I realised it is very difficult to break down 25-30 years of your golfing DNA. Not many do it. I have played through the Tiger Woods era where he has done it three or four times and made it look reasonably easy. There are a lot more examples of people trying such a change and it not working.\u201d He adds: \u201cI have no regrets. I felt at the time that it was something I had to try the change; either I just couldn\u2019t do it or it wasn\u2019t for me. At times it was encouraging but from the Players Championship onwards it was a struggle and that is a hard time to implement changes, there is a lot of golf being played. \u201cThe last couple of months of the season were a frustration, I didn\u2019t see much progress and it was a case of Chuck trying to just get me through tournaments, which isn\u2019t his way of coaching. It was all amicable. I talked with Chuck a bunch of times, it was just a case of not seeing enough change. It is very hard to implement big changes in your game.\u201d Donald has been enthused by a fresh start. Four events in the next five weeks will prove if he is entitled to be encouraged. If results once again start to mirror ability, Donald clearly still has time on his side. Stenson\u2019s Olympic goal Perhaps those behind golf\u2019s return to the Olympics should turn to Henrik Stenson to lead their public relations campaign? Fears have already been expressed that tight scheduling through the summer of 2016 may overshadow golf at Rio, or diminish the desire of leading players to participate. Not so Stenson, who has spoken passionately about his Olympic desires. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in me thinking about how other players will evaluate the situation,\u201d said the Swede. \u201cThis will be my one and only time, my only chance to play in the Olympics. I never expected an Olympic Games. It would provide the memories of a lifetime. \u201cThere is no question I will be going if I qualify. I\u2019ll be there for the opening ceremony, as well.\u201d Could Stenson carry his nation\u2019s flag at said parade? \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would be trusted to do that.

His decision to stand down after nine years in office, as revealed by the Guardian on Wednesday, has been confirmed by the Tour. The 65-year-old, who will assist with the search for his successor and subsequently take on an ambassadorial role, will speak publicly and at length about his tenure before the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai this month. \u201cIt is a shame that George is stepping down,\u201d said Justin Rose, on the eve of the HSBC-WGC Champions tournament in Shanghai. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s had a good reign, he\u2019s had a lengthy reign, obviously, at the top. There\u2019s no doubt there have been challenges. The economy and the markets in which the European Tour has been involved have been difficult, mainland Europe especially, so there\u2019s been some challenges. \u201cJust in recent times one of the things I\u2019ve been talking to George about is trying to get some of the historic events back on the European Tour; the British Masters, for example, stuff like that. As he rolls out of his position hopefully tournaments like that will come back on to the calendar and he can take some credit for that.\u201d Another challenge has been keeping peace among Tour members. The Final Series, which is now under way for a second year, earlier received criticism from leading players because of scheduling demands so late in the season. O\u2019Grady had to defend the Tour in person against players and their representatives. \u201cWe do our best to support the European Tour as best we can,\u201d added Rose, who is one of a number of high-profile European players who compete mainly in the United States. \u201cObviously, over the last couple of seasons, they have also made the tough calls of upping the number of required events from 11 to 12 to 13 as well as toying with other ways of making us commit to the Tour. \u201cAnd some of it has been needed and some of the other things maybe have gone a little too far. So the European Tour has done their best to make us play as much as we should play and I think it\u2019s at a fair level right now.\u201d He added: \u201cObviously, you\u2019ve got to accept that there\u2019s big tournaments all around the world and I think guys who are at the top end of the game have the good fortune of being able to pick and choose where they want to play. Obviously, for me, supporting the European Tour is very, very important and playing some of the key events on the European Tour is exactly where I want to play my golf.\u201d O\u2019Grady\u2019s replacement will be only the fourth chief executive in European Tour history. David Williams, who was appointed as chairman last December, will play a key role in the search. \u201cThe European Tour and its players are admired throughout the world of golf and George has played a key part in building global relationships and developing the Tour,\u201d said Williams. \u201cHe has always respected the traditions of the Tour and built on the strong foundations put in place by John Jacobs and Ken Schofield. \u201cThe Tour is now embarking on a new phase in its development and that is why George has considered that it is the right time to ask the nominations committee to find his successor.\u201d Sergio Garc\u00eda controversially skipped last week\u2019s BMW Masters in Shanghai, instead opting to play on the PGA Tour despite still having a chance to overhaul Rory McIlroy at the top of the European Tour\u2019s money list. McIlroy will not feature in China this week but Garc\u00eda will play both here and in the Turkish Airlines Open before the European Tour season\u2019s final event, in Dubai. \u201cI\u2019m not really thinking about that too much,\u201d said Garc\u00eda of the prospect of overhauling McIlroy. \u201cI just want to have three good tournaments to finish with.

The explanation lies in a tumble down to 44th towards the end of a year beset by injury and mediocre results. Poulter\u2019s lowly position looks decent only in comparison with Luke Donald, a former world No1 who is 36th in the rankings. When asked if this scenario offers motivation, Poulter said. \u201cNo kidding. I need to move that up. I need to be in the situation where I put myself back to where I was, if not higher. I have been up to five. I don\u2019t even want to look at where I\u2019m at right now; I know it\u2019s mid-high 40s, that\u2019s what I do know. \u201cI have had three injuries this year and I am angry. I\u2019m angry I put myself in a situation to injure myself, not once but twice, then I was unfortunate with a wrist jar at the Scottish Open. \u201cAll in all, I am annoyed it happened and annoyed I wasn\u2019t able to take time off through having two schedules. You can\u2019t just have two months off in March and April time, it is impossible. So I find myself in the situation I am now but I have had a good equipment change, the body is fit and healthy and I am fresh in the mind. I\u2019m happy and excited with some of the golf I have played in the last two weeks.\u201d Poulter\u2019s situation would become critical, and impact on his schedule, only should he slide outside the top 50. The indications are against that happening after starting the WGC-HSBC Champions event here with a two-under-par 70. Poulter looked firmly in control throughout. Poulter, 38, is in the midst of a busy spell. His book launch was overshadowed in part by the ill-advised comments towards him by the PGA of America president, Ted Bishop. Those remarks cost Bishop his job, with Poulter an innocent \u2013 if affected \u2013 part of the narrative. \u201cThat was very unexpected,\u201d Poulter said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate they didn\u2019t read the book before making a comment. Taking other people\u2019s words into account is dangerous. But I don\u2019t want to go down those roads, I don\u2019t need to. That was just an unfortunate circumstance last week, which was stressful.\u201d Poulter has a new putter for the WGC tournament, a late addition to an equipment change which has seen him recently switch to Titleist from Cobra. This marks his second tournament working with his different tools. \u201cI was eight years with one company,\u201d Poulter said. \u201cI was able to put myself in the position to use what I want to use. That\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t want to use what I had before but I was able to go out to the market and have a look at all the equipment, which is sometimes a nice thing to do.\u201d Poulter has already held discussions with David Williams, the chairman of the European Tour, about aspects of the business. George O\u2019Grady\u2019s imminent departure as the chief executive means Williams will lead the hunt for O\u2019Grady\u2019s replacement, with Poulter an advocate of new ideas. \u201cThe new chairman has been in and made some decisions,\u201d Poulter said. \u201cThings are going to change. I see all of those things as helping moving forward. I am not saying George did a bad job; he did a great job for a long period of time. It is good to have a shake-up every now and then, it is good to have fresh eyes into what is a big role. Sometimes change is good and I think this will be good for the European Tour, for all George has done a great job. \u201cI met the new chairman. He asked several questions along the way. I am sure he has taken time to speak to a lot of other players. Do I think players should be consulted on it [O\u2019Grady\u2019s successor]? Yes and no. If they speak to everybody, at least they will get the right opinions from the inside looking out rather than the other way around.\u201d On a seriously testing course, Graeme McDowell took the lead in Shanghai with a superb 67.

A Brooklyn company builds a better burger", "article": "Most of us embrace modern technology. We constantly upgrade our phones, connect with each other through Facebook, pay our bills online, demand the most advanced medical treatments available when we get sick and drive cars that havemore computing power than the system that guided Apollo astronauts to the moon. But, for many of us, food is another matter. We want our food to be pure, free of artificial additives, dangerous pesticides and natural \u2013 a term that, incidentally, is all but meaningless. Genetically-modified foods arouse anxiety. We want, in the words of influential journalist Michael Pollan, to avoid eating anything that our \u201cgreat-grandmother wouldn\u2019t recognize as food\u201d. And according to a Pew Research survey, only 20% of Americans would eat meat grown in a lab. That\u2019s a problem for Andras Forgacs. He\u2019s the co-founder and chief executive of Modern Meadow, a Brooklyn-based startup that intends to use tissue engineering \u2013 also known as cell culturing or biofabrication \u2013 to create livestock products that require fewer inputs of land, water, energy and chemicals than conventional animal agriculture. What\u2019s more, Forgacs says, his company\u2019s products will also require no animal slaughter. Quelling factory fears Other startup companies worry about consumer resistance to food that seems overly engineered. Beyond Meat,Hampton Creek and Impossible Foods, among others, are developing what they say are environmentally-preferable alternatives to resource-intensive animal products. And, in the process, they\u2019re facing the question of how to deal with customer resistance. Modern Meadow\u2019s plan is to start out by making cultured leather. As Forgacs explained to me when we met the other day at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, lab-made leather is technically easier to make than meat, faces fewer regulatory hurdles, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 is more acceptable to consumers. \u201cPeople have really strong opinions about food, especially when it comes to new technologies,\u201d Forgacs has said. \u201cThey have less strong opinions around new materials. They love things like Gore-Tex and carbon fiber.\u201d Like other producers of high-performance materials, Modern Meadow hopes to improve on nature. Cattle, after all, did not evolve to produce shoes, handbags or burgers. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up with all kinds of design and performance improvements,\u201d Forgacs says. From leather to lunch After it establishes itself in cultured leather, Forgacs says, the company\u2019s next step will be to produce factory-grown meat. It\u2019s already producing small bits, at a small scale, and not or commercial use. When I met Forgacs, I sampled a sliver of a \u201csteak chip,\u201d a lab-grown snack food developed by Modern Meadow as what he described as a \u201ckitchen hack.\u201d It tasted more like a tortilla chip than a T-bone, but so be it. \u201cWe\u2019ve had about 100 people try it so far, and they are all alive and well,\u201d Forgacs joked. Me, too. The thing is, most of what we eat is a product of technology. Seeds are bred in laboratories, whether through traditional methods or by genetic manipulation. Fields are tilled with GPS-guided tractors, water and fertilizer are applied and measured with precision applicators, and food is distributed through global supply chains. Some technology does little or no good, manufacturing food that has more salt, sugar, or fat than we need. Some technology will help feed the world\u2019s poor. But \u2013 good or bad \u2013 we can\u2019t eat without technology. \u201cA kitchen is technology,\u201d says Forgacs. \u201cA microwave is technology. A food processor is technology.\u201d That said, Forgacs recognizes that Modern Meadow wants to take eaters into new territory \u2013 and, with that in mind, he\u2019s proceeding carefully. The startup, which he founded in 2011, is his second partnership with his father, Gabor Forgacs, a physicist-turned-bioengineer who teaches at the University of Missouri. Their previous company, called Organovo, designed and produced human tissues, primarily for medical research. After Organovo, Andras Forgacs spent time in China, where he saw an emerging middle class with a ravenous appetite for meat. \u201cMeat consumption was going up dramatically. Meat prices were going up dramatically,\u201d he says. Unfortunately, Forgacs realized, current US-style meat production is a shockingly inefficient way to deliver protein to people \u2013 and China\u2019s efforts to imitate it were highly destructive. \u201cThe environmental livability of cities like Shanghai and Beijing was declining,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you feed the planet, and not wreck it in the process?\u201d Modern Meadow\u2019s solution has attracted investments from the Thiel Foundation, run by billionaire libertarian and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel; Sequoia Capital, which has backed some of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies; Artis Ventures; Iconiq Capital; and, most recently, Horizons Ventures, the venture fund of Li Ka-shing. Horizons has also invested in Hampton Creek and Impossible Foods. \u201cHe understands from the perspective of Asia that there is a real supply-demand imbalance,\u201d Forgacs said. Modern Meadow remains small, with about 15 employees, all in Brooklyn. Eventually, Forgacs hopes to invite customers in \u201cso that people can come and see how the sausage gets made,\u201d he said. \u201cSlaughterhouses don\u2019t invite consumers to come and see what they do.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re asking for a lot of trust from the consumer,\u201d he says. To obtain it, the company will be as transparent as possible: \u201cThe more consumers understand how we do what we do \u2026 the more transparency, the more labeling, the better, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Read more stories like this:  Why banning dangerous chemicals is not enough Will green chemistry save us from toxification?

Dellal went to the London College of Fashion to become a clothing designer. \u201cThen my tutor pointed out I was designing accessories for every outfit. So I went to Cordwainers College [it specialises in leatherwork], and once I physically made my first shoe, I realised that was what I wanted to do. I also test the shoes myself. What kind of female shoe designer would I be if I made uncomfortable shoes you couldn\u2019t walk in?\u201d     High society: (from left) Eternally Dolly, Unleash the Dragon and Debbie. Photograph: Alex Lake/Observer    It\u2019s a promise you\u2019re glad she\u2019s made when you see her designs. Dellal happily acknowledges the influence of Ferragamo and Elsa Schiaparelli on her fanciful and elaborate footwear. The autumn/winter collection Shanghai Express has an oriental inspiration. So there\u2019s the Imperial, held up on an improbable tower of Chinese beads. The Jasmine appears to be balanced on a platform made from a lacquered box. The heel of her Cheeky shoe is made from a woman\u2019s legs and bottom. \u201cI like to accessorise my accessories,\u201d she admits. \u201cMore is more for me. It\u2019s easier to tone things down than dress them up. There is subtlety, though. My fan bag might have a novelty aspect, but it\u2019s taken from a beautiful feminine object. I want to make beautiful objects wearable.\u201d While her love of heels is apparent, Dellal\u2019s biggest hit to date has been the Kitty slipper \u2013 a smoking slipper decorated with a cat\u2019s face \u2013 which has been worn by Alexa Chung, Beyonc\u00e9 and Sarah Jessica Parker. That Dellal\u2019s flamboyant designs have celebrity fans is no surprise, but she has always had strong connections with the fashionable and the famous. If that Dellal name rings some bells, it\u2019s because her mother is Andrea Dellal, a Brazilian model who was one of the biggest names of the 70s fashion scene working for Yves Saint Laurent and Valentino. Her sister is Alice Dellal, who has modelled for Chanel and Agent Provocateur and is drummer in the all-girl rock band Thrush Metal. When Charlotte holds a dinner to celebrate the launch of her handbags, Mario Testino (who, along with Mick Jagger, is godfather to Alice) and Naomi Campbell are on the guest list. But Charlotte talks more of her father\u2019s influence. Guy Dellal followed his father, the property tycoon and avid gambler \u201cBlack\u201d Jack Dellal, into property development and has done very well. \u201cWhen I told my dad I wanted to make shoes he asked if it was going to be a business or a hobby. I said: a business. So he taught me the importance of the business plan. From an early age, my dream has been to build a brand. I\u2019ve grown the business slowly, adding products when it was appropriate. I\u2019d love to open more shops, but that won\u2019t happen until it works for the business.\u201d     \u2018I can\u2019t be super-serious\u2019: at a Halloween ball last month. Photograph: Richard Young/Rex    Charlotte Olympia\u2019s branding is impressive, from the spider\u2019s web logo (a reference to children\u2019s book Charlotte\u2019s Web) stamped on all products to the extra touches that build customer loyalty. One shoe collection came with matching-coloured stockings in the box. Her transparent lucite clutches come with three coloured pouches for women who don\u2019t want to display the contents of their handbag. (\u201cI don\u2019t have many secrets, so I\u2019m fine without them,\u201d shrugs Charlotte as she shows me.) Nowhere is this attention to detail more apparent than in the new leather handbag range. The Leading Lady collection has four styles \u2013 Astaire, Gable, Bogart and a big old fat tote bag called Brando. Each comes with elbow-length matching-coloured leather gloves, a gloves holder, an internal pouch bag and a beautiful comb that doubles as a make-up mirror. Thoughtful extras. Why call the Leading Lady handbag collection after men, though? \u201cBecause I\u2019d rather have a man on my arm,\u201d says Dellal with a chuckle. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want Astaire on their arm? It\u2019s fun. I like names \u2013 they enhance the design: the Great Wedge of China, or Tiger Tiger. The transparent clutches were the bags that \u2018clearly\u2019 go with everything. Then there\u2019s the 9 Till 5 collection which are work shoes \u2013 and the heel heights are between 9cm and 5cm.\u201d I wonder if the wordplay comes from her being bilingual. \u201cActually I\u2019m trilingual,\u201d says Dellal. \u201cI speak Portuguese as my mother is Brazilian, but I lived in France as a child. There should be an exclamation mark at the end of most of my designs.\u201d She waves her arms around to take in the walls of shoes. \u201cLook \u2013 I can\u2019t be super-serious.\u201d She starts to gather up the shoes and bags she\u2019s pulled off the shelves to show me the details. \u201cI feel like I should end on a pun now,\u201d she says.

The exploration group, which currently has no producing assets, has jumped nearly 9% or 13.7p to 171.6p after it announced a second oil discovery off the coast of Senegal. It said it had found oil at its SNE-1 well, close to the FAN-1 well where it made a discovery last month, and suggested it could hold 150m to to 670m barrels of recoverable reserves. Some traders suggestes that the success could allow the company to sell part of its 40% share of three blocks in Senegal to fund exploration work in Europe and Morocco.  Analysts were positie about the discovery, with Liberum saying:  This looks like a significant oil find for Cairn and, based on preliminary estimates, management believes it is a commercial discovery and opens a new basin on the Atlantic Margin. With further wells planned in Morocco, the North Sea and Ireland, Cairn offers some attraction to investors looking for offshore exploration risk.  Mark Wilson at Jefferies said:  The SNE-1 exploration well, offshore Senegal, West Africa has discovered 36m of net oil pay in its first target zone and is described as having commercial discovery potential. This success follows up from the FAN-1 discovery and we raise our target price by 6% to 282p a share. It may be considered unfashionable, given all that we have seen in the sector lately, to consider raising an E&amp;P company target price, but here is a company doing the principal thing the independent E&amp;P sector is there to do...find commercial hydrocarbon discoveries.   Oriel analyst Dragan Trajkov said:  This discovery certainly looks to merit appraisal and at this early stage appears to be very significant. Alongside the FAN-1 well, where commerciality is uncertain, it suggests a highly active petroleum province. On completion the partners will decide upon an appraisal campaign for 2015. Assuming a nominal $5 a barrel value, the resource announced today would be worth a significant proportion of Cairn\u2019s market capitalisation (on an unrisked basis \u2013 it is likely the market will not ascribe full value at this early stage). It\u2019s worth noting that Cairn\u2019s 15% partner in the well, Australian- listed FAR Ltd increased its market cap by $100m in overnight trading.

It is a city that has always been in flux, so complicated by its histories and counter-histories that its urban fabric seems to resist all attempts to reorder it. Despite this, or probably because of it, Berlin seems to have become a great city again, and no one is more surprised than the Berliners themselves. To them it isn\u2019t clear whether they live in a great political European capital, or a charming hippy town of pop-ups and clubs. They don\u2019t know whether to be happy that old Tegel lives on or furious they don\u2019t have an international airport. They don\u2019t know whether they really want the Stadtschloss rebuilt, and they don\u2019t know whether the arrival of Frank Gehry and his twisted tower on Alexanderplatz will be the beginning of a bright new future or the end of an innocent era. They know they don\u2019t have a beautiful city, but they feel strongly about how it should be and how it should look. Berliners have maintained a sense of participation and even ownership that seems to have been lost in so many other cities. This is why Berlin fascinates. It is not only poor and sexy but engaged and vital, a reminder of the more messy, contradictory and organic qualities that all cities should have but are elsewhere being replaced by homogeneous commercialism and a more extreme segregation of rich and poor. London, Doha and Shanghai have become investment centres welcoming development that brings wealth and image but little civic substance. Against this Berlin seems charmingly reflective and suspicious, its citizens rather unimpressed by the apparent imperatives of private investment and global image. Why is Berlin different? The division of the city had left West Berlin the task of reorganising its infrastructure. From every point of view this was a complicated process. Having lost, as it were, so many important cultural and symbolic institutions to the eastern side of the city, Berlin had to once again try to reassemble its civic order, to make\u00a0a whole city out of half of one. This opportunity wasn\u2019t lost on the architects, planners and politicians of the time. New social, cultural and administrative structures needed to be built. Counter-institutions were needed to replace those lost to the east, while a new urban orientation had to be given to this disjointed and now isolated part of the city. Reconstruction prolonged by the division of the city and then its reunification means that while other European cities have been rebuilt, Berlin still has gaps, physical, social and economic, maintaining strange physical proximities and rich social overlaps that have elsewhere been smoothed out by urban gentrification. So this Berlin apparently manages to\u00a0maintain a sense of itself, or rather is\u00a0engaged in a continuous process of self-description. This confused, less than beautiful, apparently dysfunctional city \u2013 the physical result of so much trauma and division \u2013 becomes charming, full of life and the envy of other cities, not for its beauty or its wealth but because of its vitality. Cities record our fragile attempts to make ideas of society in physical form.They are physical records of our visions and our mistakes. We have always been clumsy in this undertaking. It tends to be a clumsy process, partly because of the decision machinery and partly because of the mismatch between the tendencies of investment and the poorly articulated expectations of the citizen. Unfortunately, when we travel the world we see that we are becoming clumsier in this respect. The form of our cities seems to have little to do with our ideas of society, rather investment seems to look over our heads in order to pursue its own needs and to enjoy the momentum of global economics. We are now at a time when image dominates, when we are more susceptible than ever to judge by appearance. Architecture has increasingly moved into this world of consumerism. New buildings seem more concerned with what they look like and less concerned with what they are and what they do. In Berlin, where appearance isn\u2019t everything, where so much seems arbitrary, where the great waves of recent history have done so much damage, we should admire what has been achieved since 1989. In this time, Berlin has found something it didn\u2019t expect: that it is not defined like other cities by its wealth or its industry or its commerce, but rather surprisingly by its own fascinating complexity and contradictions. \u2022 This is an extract of a speech given at the\u00a0Neue Nationalgalerie to celebrate the\u00a0contribution of architects Mies van der Rohe and Hans Scharoun to the rebuilding of Berlin", "tags": ["Berlin Wall", "Cities", "Germany", "Architecture", "Art and design", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-11T19:28:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/chinas-choice/2014/nov/13/chinese-media-welcomes-climate-deal-with-us", "sentences": ["Peggy Liu Chairperson of the Joint US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, based in Shanghai, was not as enthusiastic about the \u2018newness\u2019 of what was being agreed."], "title": "Chinese media welcomes climate deal with US", "article": "The US-China deal on carbon emissions received a broadly positive response in China in the media and from experts. While the Chinese press mostly carried news stories about the deal and not much analysis in comparison to the western press, it was was welcoming of a deal some described as \u201chistoric\u201d. The Chinese state-run newspaper China Daily carried an editorial describing the goals announced by the US and China as exemplary. It said the China-US joint announcement on climate change was the real highlight of the meeting between Xi Jinping and Barack Obama and the unexpected outcome was \u201ca pleasant surprise.\u201d The newspaper described the Chinese pledges as a huge commitment in a country where \u201cdevelopment carries the only hope of freeing hundreds of millions from their daily struggle for subsistence.\u201d The newspaper also praised the US part of the deal calling it \u201can ambitious goal that entails a shared political will across party lines back home.\u201d The paper added that the China-US deal will help in \u201cpersuading reluctant others\u201d at the UN climate negotiations. The news website news.21cn carried a story saying that if China and the US achieve the aims of the deal, it will not only contribute to improve the environment, but also encourage other countries to reduce emissions. Popular news magazine website, Paper.cn, said in an editorial that it is only with the consensus between the US and China that a global climate change deal can be reached. It said that in China the solutions to cope with climate change \u201cclosely relate to the systems, policies and market motivations\u201d relating to dealing with pollution and that the speeding up of action on one \u201cwill bring motivation to the other.\u201d  While experts were mostly optimistic that China could reach its stated target of capping emissions and increasing its use of energy from zero-emission sources to 20% by 2030, they also outlined the challenges in achieving the target. On the whole experts working in the area of environment and climate change in China welcomed the announcement but some were more enthusiastic of its significance than others. \u201cIt is positive for China for the first time to make a commitment on the peaking of carbon emissions. It is very important because the previous commitment was only on carbon intensity,\u201d said Ma Jun, one of China\u2019s most well-known environmentalists and director of the NGO the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. He said that to achieve the target will be challenging because \u201cChina\u2019s energy is very much focused on coal and the economy is very focused on heavy industry which is carbon intensive so restructuring won\u2019t be easy.\u201d \u201cBut I think that the momentum generated to solve the local air pollution problem is a push for such a commitment. To deal with local pollution, China has put on the agenda the capping of coal, which has long been a sensitive issue,\u201d he added.  Peggy Liu Chairperson of the Joint US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, based in Shanghai, was not as enthusiastic about the \u2018newness\u2019 of what was being agreed.  \u201cLike many bilateral agreements between the US and China, much of this was repackaged current thinking for a good timely news story,\u201d she said. But Liu said that it is very positive in it\u2019s significance for the UN climate change negotiations and is a \u201cwelcome injection of positive energy\u201d. Of China\u2019s part of the agreement she said China didn\u2019t say anything new. \u201cThe internal estimates for peaking carbon were always 2030, mainly based on when urbanisation would peak. China has talked about 20% renewables by 2030 for years already.\u201d But she said that internally, the Chinese government is looking at how to increase the renewable figure even higher. Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer with Greenpeace East Asia, said the Chinese commitment is \u201creally significant\u201d and that the task in hand should not be underestimated because it requires China \u201cto build another US energy system based on renewable energy\u201d. He said China \u201cwill really need reform of the electricity market and how the grid operates.

Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a contagious viral disease in animals, caused by a virus loosely related to human influenza. Some strains of the disease have been passed to humans but this is very rare, and usually only occurs after very close contact with infected birds or animals. While all bird species and, less commonly, pigs are thought to be susceptible, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks can rapidly result in epidemics among bird populations. Public health authorities are concerned about the potential of the virus to mutate into subtypes capable of causing human disease. As a result they warn there is always a threat of a new influenza pandemic emerging. Why is it in the news again? There were two confirmed outbreaks in western Europe on Sunday, first at a poultry farm in the Netherlands, then at duck breeders in northern England. The Dutch authorities have started slaughtering 150,000 chickens at the farm in central Netherlands where the disease was detected. Later, in the UK, the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) confirmed at least one case of the virus at the farm in the Driffield area of East Yorkshire. It insisted the risk to public health was \u201cvery low\u201d, and said it was culling all poultry at the farm. What are the most dangerous strains? The H5N1 form has been the cause of most concern in recent years. The strain detected in the Netherlands was identified as H5N8. This strain has never been detected in humans. Defra confirmed that the outbreak in Yorkshire was H5, but not H5N1. Three versions of the milder H7 form have also spread to humans. Both H5N1 and H7 are referred to as \u201chighly pathogenic\u201d, which means they are extremely contagious among birds. The disease spreads both by air and contact with bird droppings. Where has it appeared?     South Korean quarantine officials at a poultry farm where a suspected bird flu case was reported in April. Photograph: Kim Jae-Myoung/AFP/Getty Images    An outbreak of the H5N8 strain in South Korea earlier this year meant millions of farm birds had to be slaughtered to contain the outbreak. Cases have also been reported in China and Japan. The strain was first reported in Europe on a German farm in early November. In September, Russia reported the first cases of H5N1 in nearly two years. If it just affects birds, why the panic? World Health Organisation (WHO) figures show that from 2003 to October 2014, there were 668 confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus in humans. Of these cases, 393 people died. So far, most of the human deaths have been in Asia, in communities in which people live in close proximity to poultry. Although it does not easily infect humans, every time it does it increases the chance that the virus could mutate into a form that could be passed from one infected human to another. The WHO says that would probably be how a flu pandemic would start. Pandemics have occurred every 20 to 30 years, but it has been almost 40 years since the last one happened. The most severe occurred in 1918-1919, and is estimated to have killed around 50 million people worldwide. How does it spread? WHO scientists believe it is likely that the virus is carried by migrating birds. Others, such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Birdlife International, argue that there is strong evidence to suggest the poultry trade plays a large role in the spread of bird flu. What measures is the UK taking?     Commuters in Shanghai wear face masks to protect themselves against bird flu in 2013. Photograph: MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images    In common with other countries, the British government\u2019s plan to tackle bird flu is characterised by surveillance and containment. Under new rules it is a criminal offence to fail to report suspected cases of bird flu to the nearest Animal and Plant Health Agency office. The agency surveys birds for strains of avian influenza once a year. When an outbreak is confirmed, authorities slaughter poultry in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus. All the people involved in responding to any incident are tested if they become unwell and are given a course of antivirals. If the disease did mutate into a form contagious among humans, officials would begin a programme of mass treatment using antiviral drugs and flu vaccines. How do you spot the virus in birds? Symptoms in infected birds include a swollen head and blue discolouration around the neck and throat. They will also show signs of breathing problems including gaping beaks, coughing, sneezing and rattling wheezing. Poultry farmers will also notice a loss of appetite in the infected birds and a decrease in egg laying. Public Health England stresses that there is no need to report finding a single dead bird. But if you find five or more dead birds in the same place at the same time this should be reported as a \u201cmass mortality event\u201d to authorities. What are the symptoms in humans? They vary depending on the strain. Most infections have flu-like symptoms including fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and aches and pains. Symptoms of the H5N1 subtype are more severe and frequently results in death (the mortality rate is more than 60%). Other symptoms can include conjunctivitis \u2013 red, sore and discharging eyes. How do you catch bird flu? It is very unlikely to catch the virus unless you have been in close contact with infected birds or someone with confirmed or suspected bird flu. The virus is found in secretions from the eyes and respiratory tract, and droppings of infected birds. Humans can catch the virus by inhaling droplets sneezed by infected birds or the dust from their bedding or droppings. What drug treatments are available to humans?     Tamiflu can be taken as a preventive treatment, but there is no evidence it will stop people being infected. Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA    Tamiflu, made by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, is the antiviral drug favoured by most governments. It can be taken as a preventive treatment, but there is no evidence it will stop people being infected. Public Health England warns that the seasonal flu jab does not protect against avian flu. Doctors believe Tamiflu could relieve flu symptoms and help the body to fight the virus. However, there have been concerns that H5N1 is developing resistance to Tamiflu. In December 2005, research published by the New England Journal of Medicine showed that two out of eight patients being treated for bird flu in Vietnam had died despite receiving Tamiflu. The drug is only available on prescription in the UK and, with governments around the world ordering it, has become very scarce.

We were on holiday, and watched the game in a tiny Scottish fishing village\u2019s tiny, but packed pub. Clearly the entire village had turned out in expectation of an England thrashing \u2013 Germany\u2019s opener brought raucous cheers, but England\u2019s subsequent dominance steadily brought the regulars to complete and deafening silence. The barman responded to Mickey Owen\u2019s hat-trick goal by refusing to serve us, and by the time Mr Em wrapped it up, a wall had been punched and we were hightailing it down the road. Not since the emancipation of the slaves can ABE have enjoyed such devotional support\u201d \u2013 Ollie Forrest. \u201cThe 1,057 pedants must have gone absolutely ballistic reading that for the \u2018prizeless letter o\u2019the day\u2019, Alan Cormack (Friday\u2019s Fiver letters) bagged himself a copy of Football Manager [move along, still nothing to see here \u2013 Fiver Ethics Committee Ed]. I imagine the rage was on a par with when Ian Holloway found out he was being fined for fielding a weakened Blackpool team against Aston Villa. Or when Ian Holloway complained that he was getting \u2018bo-diddly-squat\u2019 every week from the officials after Carlos Tevez scored an offside goal against Blackpool in 2010. Or when Ian Holloway raged at football authorities for the Bosman ruling when he thought Rooney was going to leave Manchester United for free after his contract expired.

It\u2019s one that\u2019s now possible thanks to China\u2019s new Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program.  The program opened up China\u2019s domestic stock markets to international investors for the first time ever this week. Investors will have to go through brokers in Hong Kong, who often charge high fees, but previously, only approved institutional investors, who control millions or billions of dollars, had been able to buy China\u2019s domestic shares.  The move is a major milestone in China\u2019s slow embrace of Western-style capitalism \u2013 \u201ctrying to open their financial system to the world\u201d, as Paul Christopher, chief international strategist at Wells Fargo, puts it.  \u201cIt is a major breakthrough for them. The government is committed to making major reforms, including speeding up currency reform and improving access to the Chinese stock market,\u201d said John Krey, international investment analyst at S&amp;P Investment Advisory Services LLC. Still, there are plenty of signs to suggest US investors should slow down and do their research before jumping into Chinese investments, particularly now.      A trader at the Hong Kong stock exchange. Photograph: Samantha Sin/AFP/Getty Images    One barrier: China\u2019s companies are characterized by a lack of transparency to the West and an absence of legal protections. Analysts warn that accounting and disclosure standards in China don\u2019t match up to more rigorous western standards.  \u201cIn the US you\u2019ve got access to SEC filings when you want to learn about a company. It is not as easy to find compliance and disclosure statements for Chinese companies,\u201d said Patrick O\u2019Hare, chief market analyst at Briefing.com. Nor are US investors likely to get much of a voice in Chinese companies. A good recent example is e-commerce giant Alibaba, which solicited the investments of American stock-pickers in its initial public offering \u2013 but declined to give them any voice in running the company. Instead, Alibaba concentrated all decisions in the hands of a 28-person partnership.  Those companies less recognizable or established than Alibaba may prove problematic to US investors. \u201cWhat\u2019s the first thing a struggling business will do? Look to get more investors,\u201d noted James Pressler, vice president at The Northern Trust Company. All of this telegraphs risk, at least until the kinks are worked out.  \u201cStock Connect opens up new opportunities and it is forward thinking, but it is still untested. There are obviously safer and more conservative ways to invest in China than going in and trying to pick out winners on the Shanghai exchange \u2013 that is hard enough to do here in the US,\u201d O\u2019Hare said.  Case in point: billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson reportedly lost $468m in Chinese forestry company Sino-Forest Corp (TRE) in 2011. The losses triggered questions regarding the accuracy of the accounting of the forest and timber land holdings.  \u201cJohn Paulson is generally considered to be one of the most successful hedge fund managers, yet he lost a fortune in Sino Forest. If even he can get hosed in China, what hope does the individual investor have?\u201d said Charles Sizemore, principal of Sizemore Capital Management.  Basic research could be a challenge.  \u201cThe US has a well laid out GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). In China, things are less transparent. They don\u2019t have the same accounting standards,\u201d said Briefing.com\u2019s O\u2019Hare.  \u201cYou are at the mercy of the company giving you the numbers,\u201d said Sizemore.  The China real-estate bubble The Chinese government is also trying to gently deflate a real-estate bubble that inflated after the government pumped out a stimulus package worth $583bn, noted Northern Trust\u2019s Pressler. \u201cIt did the job of triggering growth, but it also fueled real-estate speculation, similar to what was going on in the mid-2000s here.\u201d  Slowing economic growth may be another concern. In the early 2000s, China boasted a rapidly growing economy, which peaked in 2007 with above 14% growth.  Now, most economists agree China\u2019s double-digit growth is in the rearview, with 2015 forecasts in the range of 7% or even lower. While that still outpaces the growth of the US economy, China\u2019s trend line is dipping downward, not upward. Pressler suggested the new program may mean the Chinese think \u201cwe are safe enough and we don\u2019t have to worry about significant amounts\u201d of money leaving the country.      Renminbi notes lie in a pile at a branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images    China\u2019s politics \u201cChina is still a communist country. They have adopted some free-market principles, but some of the companies are state-owned enterprises. Investors run the risk of seeing their interests being subordinated to the government\u2019s interests,\u201d O\u2019Hare explained. \u201cThe government has the ability to changes the rules of the game arbitrarily as an individual shareholder is on the outside looking in.\u201d  Bill Smead, CEO and CIO of Smead Capital Management, weighed in. \u201cIt is a totalitarian communist government that practices capitalism. You have to be skeptical about investing in a country where the legal structure could render your ownership as moot at any time,\u201d Smead said.  Investors looking for recourse won\u2019t have the same options as in western countries.  \u201cThe Chinese courts are not courts in the way we understand them. Chinese law is a guideline for the judges,\u201d Northern Trust\u2019s Pressler said.  \u201cThey don\u2019t have a court system where you could go sue if something goes wrong,\u201d said S&amp;P Investment Advisory Service\u2019s Krey.  Currency risk is another factor. Not only are investors purchasing shares in a Chinese company, they are also placing a currency bet. The US dollar has been on a tear in 2014, climbing broadly versus major world currencies. The US dollar index is up over 9% year-to-date, while the dollar has gained 1.2% versus the managed Chinese yuan rate.  Intent on diving in anyway? Set your alarm: there is a 13-hour time difference between New York and Hong Kong.  \u201cIf you have a position you want to do something with, you might not get a lot of sleep that night,\u201d noted O\u2019Hare.

However, as I soldiered on to this cool, minimalist neighbourhood Thai (a 30-minute walk from central Oxford), I did wonder if it was going to be worth the shoe leather. Could those who rate Oli\u2019s Thai as Oxford\u2019s best restaurant be overegging it? Is Laddawan Thurston really turning out, as her fans insist, pin-sharp dishes for under \u00a310, lunch and dinner? The short answer is: get down here, even if you have to crawl over broken glass. Oli\u2019s Thai lives up to the hype, and then some. From a short daily menu, which included sweet chilli prawns, aubergine curry, and chicken with garlic, pepper and coriander, I opted for a sensational plate of belly pork with rice. The compressed belly had been very slowly roasted to something approaching perfection. Despite the delicious crust at its edges, the meat was meltingly tender within, while its crackling was like lacquer. That crackling had been further smothered in a freshly-blitzed paste which \u2013 as is the Thai way - seemed to contain a 101 ingredients from across the chilli/ lemongrass spectrum. Two rectangles of this magnificent meat had been stacked in pool of \u201cOli\u2019s sauce\u201d, an electrifying soy-based broth, and each mouthful was a rollercoaster of hot, zingy, sweet and savoury flavours \u2013 but all in perfect harmony. The belly was \u00a39.50, so I had to drink tap water to bring it in under budget, but it is well worth that sacrifice to eat such food.     Aubergine Curry at Oli\u2019s Thai    A few seats around the bar are kept free for walk-ins, but book well ahead if you can (particularly at weekends). I squeezed in at midday on a Wednesday, but otherwise it was fully booked, as is the case most days judging from the phone calls. Despite this, the staff maintain an unruffled, chatty demeanour. \u2022 Mains \u00a36.50-\u00a311. 38 Magdalen Road, 01865 790223, olisthai.com St Giles Cafe There has been a cafe on this site since 1937. Generations of students and dons have taken refuge here, to think or nurse a hangover behind its steamed-up windows (WH Auden was a fan). More recently, this tiny space was taken over by Mark Butcher, given a neat, retro makeover and a new foodie direction. The kitchen, for instance, makes its own breads and cures its own fish and is generally working hard to produce honest, affordable food.          The menu is populist (kedgeree, butternut squash salad, steak sandwich), while the daily specials include a few eclectic flourishes, such as Jamaican chicken stew with dumplings. St Giles\u2019 own meaty Oxford sausages, made to an historic recipe using sage, lemon zest and winter savoury, are a seriously fragrant, peppery banger. They are fantastic on a breakfast sandwich or served with mash and gravy. As further entertainment, the paper placemats contain food-related philosophical quotes, with space to add your own. Only in Oxford. \u2022 Breakfast \u00a34-\u00a39, sandwiches and light lunches \u00a34.50-\u00a35.50, lunch mains, \u00a37-\u00a38.50. 52 St Giles, 01865 554200, stgilescafe.com The Covered Market       Photograph: Alamy    In the 2010 Oxford budget eats guide, I flagged up Pieminister and Fasta Pasta in the indoor market. Somehow I completely overlooked the brilliant, takeaway-only Alpha Bar (dishes \u00a33.95-\u00a34.90). It sells a selection of fresh, scratch-cooked stews (Kashmiri dhal, veggie chilli and more) and headline salad components (falafel, smoked mackerel, grilled halloumi), which you can pair with a bewildering selection of vegetables, further salads, sauces and toppings. A sample pot of venison and root vegetable stew was unusually accomplished, its quietly fruity flavour indicative of skilful deployment of juniper berries and red wine. It would easily have passed muster in a pub or restaurant. Here, it cost just \u00a34.90. I wasn\u2019t quite as impressed with the popular cafe and takeaway, Sasi Thai (hot dishes \u00a34.50-\u00a35.95). The pad thai could have done with a sprinkling of crispy fried onions, coriander or toasted peanuts and its sauce needed a bit more fish paste complexity. Nonetheless, it was tasty and filling (the vegetables were al dente and its sweet tamarind dressing packed an authentic heat) and, crucially, only \u00a34.50 to take away. On reflection I might have done better with the red beef curry, an intriguing dish of egg and pork in cinnamon, or the spicy chicken with basil. Ask the friendly staff for a recommendation.\u2022 Market Street, oxford-coveredmarket.co.uk  The Natural Bread Company      On the (concrete-clad) face of it, Little Clarendon Street, a rather ugly 1960s cut-through from town into Jericho, is of little interest to the passing tourist. However, it is home to this cafe, a spin-off from one of Oxford\u2019s best artisan bakeries. Displays of pain au levain and wild yeast sourdoughs, outsized buns and slices of far Breton prune cake, provide plenty of eye candy in this otherwise plain space. Breakfast and lunch dishes tend to pair great local ingredients (Willowbrook organic eggs, bacon from Sandy &amp; Black rare-breed pigs) with those knockout breads.  From a short lunch menu of stews, salads and sandwiches, a sample tub of tomatoey, mixed vegetable soup was fantastic. Rigorously seasoned and thick with herbs, it had the depth of flavour that suggested someone had patiently sweated down a mountain of onions and celery in its preparation. On a wet freezing day it was just the ticket, the only downer being that the hunks of rustic Pugliese bread that came with it arrived toasted but unbuttered. \u2022 Breakfast \u00a32.75-\u00a37.95, lunch \u00a34.95-\u00a35.95. 29 Little Clarendon Street, 01865 310022, naturalbreadcompany.co.uk Door 74      This simple bistro is a good place to recover over weekend brunch (eggs Benedict, corned beef hash, French toast) and also serves a great-value midweek lunch (two courses \u00a37.95). The short menu might feature an onion and pea tortilla or a spicy vegetable broth, followed by warm chicken salad, 74\u2019s organic burger or bubble \u2019n\u2019 squeak with a poached egg. I was confused as to why my wild mushroom risotto arrived topped with a mound of leaves which were themselves sprinkled with parmesan, but the risotto itself was a creditable bit of cooking. A creamy plateful with a pleasantly peppery edge, the rice had retained the correct residual bite and, even if the mushrooms did not quite deliver a significantly autumnal, woodland flavour, a generous glug of white wine and decent stock had given the dish good depth. A sound track of sweet-natured US indie tunes completed the laid-back vibe.\u2022 Two-course lunch \u00a37.95, three \u00a39.95. Brunch \u00a35.95-\u00a39.95. 74 Cowley Road, 01865 203374, door74.co.uk Atomic Burger          Do you come over all misty-eyed at The A-Team theme tune? Or collect Star Wars action figures? No, me neither. Those who do, however, will love Atomic Burger, two nostalgic, Cowley-Road burger joints where every surface is covered in jigsaws, stuffed toys, posters and bric-a-brac on a sci-fi, 1980s pop, TV and superhero theme. Luckily, the burgers (the menu is huge) are far more up to date, without quite rivalling the quality found at Britain\u2019s best new-wave burger specialists. There was a lot to like in my Dead Elvis: the juicy patty had a good beef flavour and was nicely char-grilled (these things are not a given), the Swiss and plasticky US cheese worked well together, the bacon was stridently tasty and the super-sweet, gently fried onions were ace. In essence, it was a very enjoyable burger that would have hit the heights had it come on a brioche or sourdough bun, rather than on a somewhat dry, floury old-school number. Likewise, rather than gleaming and glossy, the chilli-dusted fries were a little tired. It was a sound burger but, to put it in Atomic Burger\u2019s terms, it was more The Fall Guy than a classic like Knightrider. \u2022 Burger meals \u00a36.75-\u00a310.95. 96 and 247 Cowley Road, 01865 790855, atomicburger.co.uk Taste Tibet and other street food      Pizza Artisan pitches up every evening opposite Christchurch College    Street food is still in its infancy in Oxford but a semi-regular programme of pop-ups, markets and weekly pitches is coalescing, which is boon for the budget traveller. Taste Tibet (\u00a32-\u00a35.50) has a pitch on Gloucester Green market, selling, on Wednesdays, homemade curries, soups and flatbreads, and on Thursdays steamed meat or vegetable momos (dumplings). A sample vegan cauliflower and carrot curry was light-stepping in its spicing and came with a thick lentil dhal that was earthy and warming, almost like Himalayan refried beans. Taste Tibet is one of a number of traders \u2013 including the wood-fired Secret Pizza Society, fish and chip mobiler Goujon Monkey, and local baking legend Barefoot Kitchen \u2013 appearing at #BittenStreet, a series of street food markets organised by blogger-cum-events outfit Bitten Oxford. Bitten has two events coming up (Nov 27, North Parade Night Market, 27 November, and Oxford Castle Quarter on 20 December). Next year it plans to hold a street food market on the first Saturday of every month from March to October in the Oxford Castle Quarter. Pizza connoisseurs will also be interested in Fundi. This star of London\u2019s Kerb street food markets fires up its wood-fired pizza oven in the garden at the Library pub every Tuesday night (\u00a35-\u00a37). Meanwhile, well-regarded Pizza Artisan, which I did not get round to trying out \u2013 pitches up every evening opposite Christchurch College, to serve handmade, wood-fired pizzas from a converted Citreon H van (\u00a36.50-\u00a39). Big Society          With its table tennis tables, pop-up markets and late-nights DJs, this sprawling, quirkily decorated hangout is bringing a bit of east London cool to Cowley Road. At this point, it feels rather generic, but what Big Society lacks in originality it more than makes up for with its food. A menu of predictable \u201cdude food\u201d staples \u2013 wings, dogs, burgers \u2013 is lifted above the mundane by being, on this evidence, very, very good. A pulled pork sandwich was exemplary. Smoky but not overbearing, the pork was sopping with juices which were ably soaked up by a velvety soft, ultra-fresh brioche bun. Vinegar slaw and a few pickles provided the necessary sharp counterpoint, while the (often unbearably sweet) BBQ mayo was well-balanced. Big Society has a decent selection of craft beers, but, if you are watching the pennies, try its house pale ale (half \u00a31.50), a bristly, dry-hopped beer from local brewery Shotover. The people behind Big Society also own the Victoria in Jericho, a pub (\u201cdefinitely not a gastropub\u201d) whose homemade pies (\u00a35.95-\u00a37.95) have a good reputation. And while we\u2019re on dude food, it is worth mentioning Joe Perks, a bar not far from Big Society, which serves hotdogs by London street food pioneer Big Apple (from \u00a34.50). The dogs are sensational, but mine was served, bizarrely, like an open sandwich, on a pared-back piece of hotdog bun which meant you needed a knife and fork to eat it. Not a lot of use as a takeaway \u2013 and contrary to the whole spirit of the hotdog, you might say. I presumed they had run out of buns, but no, I was told, that is how Joe Perks serves its dogs. Weird. \u2022 Meals \u00a34.95-\u00a39.95. 95 Cowley Road, 01865 792755, bigsocietyoxford.com Sojo     Belly pork at Sojo    All flickering tea lights and calm order, this dark, wood-panelled Chinese restaurant is a soothing sanctuary from the outside world. Sojo prides itself on the authenticity of its Szechuan, Cantonese and Shanghai dishes which, on its sub-\u00a310 afternoon menu (noon-5pm), include various rice or noodle bowls and dim sum. Even if you swerve such exotica as black bean tripe, chicken claws or the numbingly hot Szechuan shredded pork (\u201cmind blowing spicy,\u201d warns the menu), be prepared for food that makes little concession to prissy Western palates. Braised brisket, almost plummy with its five spice seasoning, arrives thick with wobbly nuggets of flavour-packed fat and less-digestible strips of connective sinew. It tastes great but requires plenty of chewing and picking through. \u2022 Afternoon menu \u00a37-\u00a311. 6-9 Hythe Bridge Street, 01865 202888, sojooxford.co.uk Dosa Park          \u201cNever mind the d\u00e9cor,\u201d reads the headline on a local newspaper cutting tacked up by the till, \u201cthe food\u2019s great.\u201d On an unlovely strip opposite Oxford station, Dosa Park is so basic you could easily mistake it for a fried chicken shop. Lucky, then, that it delivers such colour on the plate. The broadly South Indian menu takes in dhals, curries, idlis, vada and, of course, the eponymous, cr\u00e8pe-like dosas. Griddled to order, the dosa itself was soft and pliable, as delicate as lace at its edge. The first thing I bit into, in the lamb masala filling, was a whole cardamom pod \u2013 a sign of the elegantly seasoned things to come. Both the potato and lamb had been cooked precisely and had great flavour - as did the accompanying sambar. It looked off-puttingly pale, but some alchemy in the kitchen with mustard seeds, curry leaves and chillies had turned this lentil broth into a transcendent winter warmer. Likewise, the accompanying coconut chutneys looked a shade oily, but were ineffably light. One was a cooling balm, but the darker orange chutney packed a heat that grew and grew into a sinus-clearing endorphin high. South Indian food may be renowned for its sensitive spicing, but this was a reminder that chillies first spread from Portugal through Indian, via Goa. \u2022 Meals around \u00a35-\u00a37. 25 Park End Street, 01865 791197, dosapark.com Travel between Manchester and Oxford was provided by Cross Country Trains (crosscountrytrains.co.uk).

In September during London Fashion Week, anti-poverty charity War on Want dropped a 30 metre wide banner reading \u201cDon\u2019t mention the garment workers\u201d over London\u2019s Waterloo Bridge.

While Primark conducted an investigation that suggested the labels were a hoax, all four events have managed to put the fashion supply chain in the spotlight. Phil Bloomer, executive director at the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre squares the cause of low wages with three causes: companies pushing risk down to the weakest in the supply chain in the pursuit of short term profit; an absence of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining for workers; and the failure of the state to protect human rights. We asked experts from business, trade unions and campaign groups what needs to happen to ensure that those making the clothes that wind up in wardrobes in the west are paid enough to afford decent food, housing and healthcare. Opinions varied, with some experts putting more emphasis on the responsibility of brands than on government and vice versa, but all were bound in agreement that achieving a fair wage demands a co-ordinated approach from players across the global apparel industry. Join the experts for a live chat Experts will join us in the comments section on Wednesday 26 November from 1.30pm GMT to take your questions on points including:   Consumers have become accustomed to low-cost fashion. Who should take responsibility for paying more for fairer wages: factories, brands or consumers? The fashion industry provides jobs for millions, and often a job at a garment factory is preferable to the alternatives. Will brands move production away from countries in which a fair wage has been introduced? What are the pros and cons of setting a wage benchmark? What are the pros and cons of negotiations between workers and unions?  On the panel Daniel Vaughan-Whitehead, senior economist at the International Labour Office and founder of the Fair Wage Network Gustav Lov\u00e9n, social sustainability manager at the H&amp;M Group. Prior to joining the sustainability department Gustav worked in H&amp;M\u2019s supply chain organisation in east Asia based in Shanghai  Danielle McMullan, researcher, Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre Monika Kemperle, assistant general secretary of IndustriALL Global Union Sabita Banerji, Knowledge and Learning Advisor, Ethical Trading Initiative.

If you don\u2019t, check your pulse: you might be dead. For the rest of us, there\u2019s something akin to alchemy with the way these tiny nuggets of dough-draped goodness induce so much pleasure. Deftly raised from their plate or basket then dunked into sauce and eaten in one fluid move, it\u2019s no wonder we love them.  But what makes a good dumpling? Everyone has their favourite. Purists say the Shanghainese xiao long bao or soup bun dumpling is the only way to go. With up to 18 pleats a piece, gossamer skin and filling fortified with a pork skin soup so good it should need a prescription, they\u2019re usually the reason for massive queues and hour-long waits at better dumpling joints like Taiwan\u2019s Din Tai Fung (the first Taiwanese Michelin starred restaurant) and upstarts like Sydney\u2019s Chef\u2019s Gallery.  But how to eat a dumpling? Don\u2019t just stuff them into your mouth. Lift them gently from their basket and onto a spoon, where you should poke a hole to slurp their rich soup before garnishing with slivers of ginger and soy (or chilli) before savouring dumpling nirvana. Don\u2019t forget to slurp first or face third-degree burns later.  If xiao long bao are the Rolls Royce of the dumpling world, the Toyota must be northern Chinese pan fried dumplings. Sporting a thicker, chewier wheat dough and a variety of fillings, often including lamb, these little bullets of pain and pleasure come with a healthy slick of grease from their crispy, irresistible bottoms. Best appreciated with chilli and black vinegar, you\u2019ll remember these for their flavour bursts if not for their greasiness, which is why tea is mandatory as a palette cleanser. Which brings us to perhaps the most famous way to celebrate dumplings: dim sum (or yum cha). Dim sum translates into \u201clittle snacks that tug at the heart\u201d or something like that, how classic siu mai or pork dumpling are shaped like moneybags, and how translucent har gaw prawn dumplings are good luck to eat at Lunar New Year.  But here\u2019s the clincher: while yum cha - so popular in Australia - might be about a lot more than dumplings, it\u2019s just not yum cha without them. And they\u2019ll probably still be the cheapest thing on your chilli sauce-stained menu card. Which is exactly why we love them. The original cucina povera, dumplings transform scraps into luxury. And while the Chinese might lay claim to the most exotic dumplings and rituals around them, just about every culture has their own version \u2013 from Korean mantu to Jewish matza and even our own golden syrup ones for dessert. They\u2019re cheap and by default, cheerful. But pass the chilli with mine, won\u2019t you? Where are the best dumplings found in your city?", "tags": ["Chinese food and drink", "Food & drink", "Australia news"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-20T02:21:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/nov/21/-sp-entrepreneurship-global-perspective", "sentences": ["Following experience in the finance industry, he founded DealGlobe in London and recently set up a second office in Shanghai."], "title": "Entrepreneurship: A global perspective", "article": "To mark Global Entrepreneurship Week, hosted in the UK by Youth Business International, we spoke to four entrepreneurs about how they started up, the challenges of running companies in different countries and the must-have traits in business.  Alistair Gosling, Extreme Sports Gosling, who is from the UK, is an extreme sports fan who turned his passion into an international television channel and brand, Extreme Sports. The channel was first launched in Holland and is now broadcast in 68 countries. What\u2019s your experience and how did you start out in business? When I was seven I was skiing and surfing. I loved the outdoors, the lifestyle and anti-establishment attitude. In 1995, aged 24, I started in the TV distribution business. I began selling television programmes around world. I built the business up and thought we could launch a TV channel [Extreme Sports]. We approached 27 bankers, investors, lawyers and eventually found an amazing guy that backed us. What characterises entrepreneurship and what\u2019s great about it? When it gets tough and it\u2019s just a job, most people give up. As an entrepreneur, when it gets tough, I have to just keep going. You have to have the tenacity to push on through. That has a huge impact on being successful. Can you be creative and make money in business?  I\u2019m a quarter intellectual, 50% intuitive and 25% creative - all muddled up together. That mix of intellect, intuition and creativity makes entrepreneurs. Can turning what you love into a business help with your success?  It never was, and never has, been work for me. Working on something I really love makes it a lot easier when the going gets tough. Ilana Ben-Ari, Twenty One Toys Ben-Ari is founder and lead designer of Twenty One Toys, a social enterprise that began in Toronto. Ben-Ari has also worked for startups in London and Helsinki. She presented a Tedx talk on her designs in 2011. What\u2019s your experience and how did you start out in business? I studied product design at Carleton University in Ottowa. In the fourth year of my course, I came up with the idea that we could use toys as tools in education. I started the business because I wanted the toy [the company\u2019s first toy was \u2018The Empathy Toy\u201d] to exist. I worked in the UK for about four months, then Helsinki and then I came back to Canada, and opened up the company from Toronto. What characterises entrepreneurship and what\u2019s great about it? If you\u2019re passionate about a certain issue, as an entrepreneur, you think \u2018how can I make this work?\u2019 If you have an ability to tell a great story then that can be really inspirational and help to sell your business. What are the challenges and benefits of doing business in your country? I imagine starting a business in the UK is a bit more difficult than it is in Canada. There\u2019s a barrier in the UK of proving yourself in entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, in Helsinki, I found they want everyone to start a business. And Toronto is really encouraging to startups. Can you be creative and make money in business? You need to be creative to make money; it\u2019s a myth that creativity and business can\u2019t work together. The most common critique I hear is the difficulty of balancing the admin side of a company with research and development. Can turning what you love into a business help your success? You need to be passionate to start a business; your company wouldn\u2019t exist if weren\u2019t passionate. If you\u2019re going to go without pay and without sleep, you need to believe in [your business]. Cory Cook Originally from Las Vegas, Cook\u2019s career brought her to London where she set up her organisation business Cory Cook Ltd  What\u2019s your experience and how did you start out in business? My career started in the hotel industry. I gained experience in a variety of roles from running a recreation department to database marketing, as well as concierge and VIP services. My career evolved to sales and marketing when I accepted an opportunity as senior account manager for USA Today newspaper, a role that brought me to London. Gradually I developed an interest in becoming more organised and efficient at home and at work so I began studying various organising methods. What characterises entrepreneurship and what\u2019s great about it? Knowing what isn\u2019t right for your business is important, but it often takes experimenting to find out. As an entrepreneur, I love the ability to both steer and shape my business, as well as evolve with it. What are the challenges and benefits of doing business in your country? The biggest challenge of doing business in any country is understanding the culture and whether a need exists for the business. Americans tend to be open about enlisting help from professionals to get organised. Plus, if they\u2019re happy with the service, they\u2019ll shout it from the rooftops. Culturally [in the UK] the notion to enlist outside help isn\u2019t as strong as it is in the US. Can you be creative and make money in business? Yes, it\u2019s important to be creative and try new ideas and new angles. It\u2019s part of the spirit and fun of entrepreneurship. Creativity doesn\u2019t have to be all about reinventing the wheel either, it could be a creative new way to offer customer service or implement a small change that makes a noticeable impact. Can turning what you love into a business help with your success? Running a business takes up so much of your time, it\u2019s a large chunk of life you won\u2019t get back, so loving what you\u2019re doing will keep you forging ahead to success. You\u2019ll have more tenacity to keep going when things get slow and quiet. Lin Feng, DealGlobe Feng is founder and CEO of DealGlobe, an online platform for investment and partnership opportunities. Following experience in the finance industry, he founded DealGlobe in London and recently set up a second office in Shanghai. What\u2019s your experience and how did you start out in business? I was a former investment professional at Summit Partners, a global growth equity fund. I was mainly responsible for sourcing deals on the internet. The reason I started DealGlobe is that [through my previous roles] I saw that the ways of doing business in this industry hadn\u2019t changed over the past few decades. We set up the business here in the UK under the support of UKTI Sirius programme.  What characterises an entrepreneur and what\u2019s great about it? I feel like I have more control over what I do. Also, I have the freedom to be creative and innovative while retaining the ability to pivot when necessary if things aren\u2019t as we predicted. What are the challenges and benefits of doing business in your country? In the UK, the government has a lot of schemes in favour of startups - the R&amp;D tax relief scheme, for example. The challenges are penetrating the local market, and dealing with cultural differences. A benefit of setting up in China is that, as a Chinese native, I already have personal contacts and networks. However, the challenges lie in the policies and regulations, which aren\u2019t well-established to protect private companies. Can you be creative and make money in business? It is possible to make money while being creative; they don\u2019t really conflict with each other. One creative idea can be turned into a million dollar business. Can turning what you love into a business help with your success? You have to love what you do day-to-day to build a strong business and survive the tough times (as an entrepreneur, there are a lot of them). By surrounding myself with colleagues who all believe in this principle and who are passionate about this business, it will be hard to fail.

Then each of them had to complete every one of the 18 tests; and after that they had to spend the rest of the term existing as someone completely the opposite from their assessed character. As you can imagine, there wasn\u2019t really a branding\u00a0or marketing element to art degrees in those days. Such places seem, today, to have somehow never existed. They\u2019ve become mythical, like unicorns. Saint Martins isn\u2019t even the same as it was in the 80s and 90s: it\u2019s now housed in a swanky warehouse conversion in King\u2019s Cross, a \u201ccultural destination\u201d that attracts 50,000 visitors to its degree shows but has little relationship to the area it exists in. It\u2019s like a crashed spaceship, a self-sufficient world unable to connect with its surrounding environment. \u201cAn uncreative place,\u201d said Grayson Perry of such spaces.     Things ain\u2019t what they used to be\u2026 the new Central Saint Martins in King\u2019s Cross. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris    Perhaps we should be cross with such programmes: all that wistful sentimentality, that nostalgia for the good old days of student grants and grotty bohemia. But I think, fair enough. Those were the good old days for student artists. Now, as was pointed out at the end of this layered, fascinating hour, certain kids just can\u2019t get to art school any more: either they can\u2019t afford the \u00a39,000 annual loan or they are \u201cacademically unstarred\u201d, so they won\u2019t even be interviewed. It\u2019s a proper shame. Today, everyone has to succeed on society\u2019s terms: if you want to get ahead you have to work at your skills. Even when you\u2019ve only reached single figures. In Who\u2019s Left Holding the Baby?, Australian journalist Madeleine Morris continued to explore differing childcare options across the world. Two weeks ago she went to Fiji, where kids are brought up by their extended family. Last week she was in Shanghai, in a childcare centre for young children. It seemed perfectly normal except that some of the kids stay there overnight, every night, from Monday to Friday, from the age of three. Morris spoke to one child\u2019s dad whose voice broke as he described how much he misses his little daughter. But he genuinely thought that boarding was the best thing to help his socially outgoing child reach her potential. I\u2019m not sure I agree, especially after hearing a group of littl\u2019uns wailing for their mummies as they went to bed. As ever with World Service documentaries, I wished that this had delved just a little deeper \u2013 given us a few more stats, a few more experts \u2013 but, still, this was an interesting and timely programme.

I\u2019ve mentioned it before (it hosts 99% Invisible and Love + Radio, both properly great shows) but I\u2019ve investigated it again for you and there are some other shows to enjoy. Strangers, hosted by the deep-voiced Lea Thau, ex-executive director of the Moth, is a programme that I can find both irritating and amazing; Benjamen Walker\u2019s Theory of Everything grated on me until I discovered his Recent, Relevant, Random episode.

Harrow was established as a grammar school \u201cby instinct of charity\u201d to educate the neediest. Dulwich College was set up by the impresario Edward Alleyn for \u201cpoor scholars\u201d from London\u2019s toughest boroughs. But now, according to Andrew Halls, head of King\u2019s College School Wimbledon, these centres of learning are little more than \u201cfinishing schools for the children of oligarchs\u201d. Created in a culture of philanthropy and Christian duty, too many independent schools have become barriers to British educational success. The division between state and private\u00a0education damages our society, stifles opportunity and, by wasting talent, inflicts damage upon our economy. If we\u00a0are to prosper as a country, we need\u00a0to be more equal. Some private schools want to overcome this corrosive divide of privilege, but most do not. It is time\u00a0to stop asking politely. There is unfinished business in this. \u201cThe public schools are saved,\u201d reflected\u00a0Rab Butler, 70 years ago, of his\u00a01944 Education Act, \u201cand must now\u00a0be made to do their bit.\u201d Ever since then we have been wrestling with just what \u201ctheir bit\u201d entails. It defeated even Anthony Crosland as education minister. \u201cNow what are we going to do about those damned public schools?\u201d he asked a group of heads in 1965. Before opting for the depressingly obvious. \u201cI suppose we must have a royal commission, something like that.\u201d Labour has acted most effectively in bridging the public-private divide. When\u00a0last in government, we scrapped the assisted place scheme to fund smaller infant class sizes, nationalised a number of private schools and urged the Charity Commission to take a much closer look at the public benefit activities of private schools. Thanks to opposition from the Independent Schools Council (ISC), that strategy collapsed in the law courts and since then the Tories have done nothing to breach this Berlin Wall\u00a0in our education system. In the wise words of the upper tribunal, adjudicating between the ISC and the Charity Commission, \u201cthese are issues which require political resolution\u201d. Although private schools, including the one that I went to, educate only 7% of children, their students take up almost 50% of Oxbridge places. Analysis by the Sutton Trust reveals an interesting spectrum: an independent day school student is 22 times more likely to attend a Russell Group university than a state school student from a disadvantaged background. I believe we deserve an education system where the majority of young people enjoy the same access to excellence as the privileged 7%. With ever growing concentrations of prosperity and power, we need a system that challenges all institutions to work together to spread social mobility. And at the moment that is not the case: only 3% of private schools sponsor an academy; only 5% lend teaching staff to state schools. According to the chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, this model of partnership between independent and state schools is meagre stuff \u2013 \u201ccrumbs off your table\u201d. And so, rather than expending energy on educating global elites in Shanghai and Abu Dhabi, England\u2019s public schools should start to rediscover their original, charitable ethos. However, it needs to work both ways. Those working in the state sector could do more to acknowledge that for all the advantages of selection and wealth that private schools enjoy, they also contain world-beating educational attributes. In subject knowledge, pupil confidence, co-curricular activity, and staff development, independent schools have lessons for the state sector. In turn, private schools have a great deal to learn from mainstream schooling on whole-class teaching, modern British values, student engagement and, indeed, value for money. This has to be a relationship of respectful, advantageous interaction. So Labour\u2019s plan is this: we\u00a0will introduce a School Partnership Standard requiring all private schools to form genuine and accountable partnerships with state schools if they want to keep\u00a0their business rates relief. We will encourage each institution to reflect on the skills, traditions and educational needs of their locality, and then develop an action plan to deliver tangible reform. We want to see more private schools running summer schools, sponsoring academies, assisting state boarding schools and assisting professional exchange. In fact, just the kind of public-private partnership already taking place at the United Learning Trust, with its mix of 38 academies and 13 independent schools successfully sharing cultural and sporting experiences, developing clusters to improve university access and supporting teacher development. But we will also bring to an end the charade of those schools who think a spurious bursary scheme, hanging up some artwork or allowing access to gardens fulfils their social responsibility. It doesn\u2019t. With a Labour government, private schools will only be exempt from business rates if they can show a meaningful impact on state education. England\u2019s independent schools need to raise their game. Britain will only thrive in the 21st century on the back of\u00a0an education system where pupils enjoy equality of opportunity.

In a sign of Beijing\u2019s sensitivity to international criticism of its response to the protests in Britain\u2019s former colony, the Chinese embassy in London demanded that Richard Graham, MP for Gloucester, make a statement clarifying his thinking after he held the debate in Westminster Hall last month. The MPs, who had been due to leave on Tuesday morning for the three-day visit to Shanghai, issued an ultimatum to the embassy: grant Graham, the chair of parliament\u2019s all-party China group, a visa or the whole trip would be cancelled. The embassy failed to agree to their demands by 5pm on Monday, which meant the trip was cancelled. Hugo Swire, the Foreign Office minister with responsibility for the Asia-Pacific region, was understood to have been involved in talks to try to save the trip and avoid a diplomatic row. But members of the delegation, who included the former Labour cabinet minister and China expert Liam Byrne, shadow cabinet member Emma Reynolds, Conservative MPs Conor Burns and Alok Sharma, were understood to feel that the Chinese embassy was interfering in a wholly unacceptable way in the internal affairs of the UK. The trip was part of the UK-China Leadership Forum. Their attitude was described as regretful rather than angry. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cThe UK-China Leadership Forum has an important role in UK/China relations. We have raised this with the Chinese government and sought an explanation of their decision to deny a visa.\u201d Sources made clear that the Great British China Centre, which organised the trip, is independent of the government. The centre makes its own decisions about travel arrangements. Graham, a former diplomat who served at the British embassy in Beijing and as the British consul in the former Portuguese colony of Macao in the late 1980s, used the debate in Westminster Hall on 22 October to voice support for some of the protesters\u2019 demands. The protests were sparked by the decision of Beijing to impose restrictions on the election of Hong Kong\u2019s next chief executive. In a highly nuanced speech, designed to show his deep understanding of Chinese sensitivities while voicing support for the pro-democracy activists, Graham told MPs that Britain had a duty to uphold the principles of the 1984 joint declaration by Britain and China, which led to the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. In the declaration China agreed to maintain \u201cfreedom under the law, an independent judiciary, a free press, free speech and the freedom to demonstrate\u201d. He added: \u201cIf we allow any of those freedoms to be curtailed and if we say nothing about any dilution of Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy, whether deliberate or inadvertent, we risk colluding in Hong Kong\u2019s gradual \u2013 not immediate \u2013 decline, helping others in Asia who would swiftly take any opportunity at Hong Kong\u2019s expense, and we would not be fulfilling the commitments that John Major, Robin Cook and, most recently, our prime minister have re-emphasised in the clearest terms.\u201d Graham, who was living in Hong Kong at the time of the 1984 declaration and the 1997 handover, tried to reassure Beijing on one of its main concerns: that outside powers were orchestrating the protests. He said: \u201cIt is my belief that most of those in Hong Kong who feel most strongly about the issues around the election of the next chief executive represent a new generation of Hong Kongers. They were mostly born after the joint declaration. They are not, as has sometimes been claimed, ancient colonial sentimentalists or those left by dark foreign forces to create disturbance after the colonialists had gone, but a new generation with a different take on life from their predecessors. They are more sure of their Hong Kong identity, less sure of their future prospects and less trustful of government or leaders in whose appointment they still feel they do not have enough say.\u201d Graham concluded his speech by addressing two of Beijing\u2019s long-held concerns: the need for stability and an assurance that Britain was not seeking to extend its influence back into its former colony. He said: \u201cStability for nations is not, in our eyes, about maintaining the status quo regardless, but about reaching out for greater involvement with the people \u2013 in this case, of Hong Kong \u2013 allowing them a greater say in choosing their leaders and, above all, trusting in the people. \u201cWe have no interest, no advantage or no conceivable selfish purpose in any form of car crash with Hong Kong\u2019s sovereign master, China. Rather, it is in all our interests, but particularly those of Britain and China in fulfilling the joint declaration, that Hong Kong continues to thrive and prosper, in a different world from that of 1984 or even 1997.\u201d", "tags": ["China", "Hong Kong", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Protest", "Peter Mandelson", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-24T22:22:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-murder-no-extension-internet-snooping", "sentences": ["Why shouldn\u2019t border guards in China demand access to your hard drive as you get off the plane in Shanghai?"], "title": "The Lee Rigby murder doesn\u2019t justify an extension of internet snooping powers | Charles Arthur", "article": "The killing of Lee Rigby in May 2013 was the result of a catalogue of missed opportunities by the intelligence services. As the just published report by the intelligence and security committee explains, one of the killers, Michael Adebolajo, had been known to MI5 since 2008. There were repeated chances to investigate him and Michael Adebowale; the very day of the murder, the home secretary was presented with \u2013 and signed \u2013 an application to tap Adebowale\u2019s communications, a procedure given \u201croutine\u201d urgency, and one that had taken a month. Yet the ISC\u2019s report instead lays the blame on a single (unnamed) internet company for failing to tell MI5 that Adebowale had had a number of accounts automatically closed for \u201cterrorism-related\u201d reasons. If that company had done so back in December 2012, the ISC suggests, then MI5 would have put the would be murderer at \u201cPriority 1\u201d in its investigation. \u201cThis is the single issue which \u2013 had it been known at the time \u2013 might have enabled MI5 to prevent the attack,\u201d the ISC says. Certainly, the ISC has a point here. As the report highlights, when internet companies discover accounts associated with child exploitation, they are quick to pass on details to the authorities. But if someone suggests \u201clet\u2019s kill a soldier\u201d in a message, the account is marked for closure. Adebowale had four out of seven internet accounts at one provider automatically closed over suspected terror-related activity; yet none was reviewed by a human. That\u2019s a clear failure to link the action \u2013 closing an account \u2013 and the reason; communications companies can\u2019t seek public approval for trying to prevent child exploitation, yet wash their hands of terrorism discussions. But the ISC also bemoans the fact that the UK\u2019s laws, specifically Ripa \u2013 the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act \u2013 do not allow the intelligence services to demand content from overseas internet companies. Though it isn\u2019t spelt out, the clear assumption is that companies such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, BlackBerry, and myriad smaller ones providing interpersonal communications are meant here. Why, complains the ISC, can\u2019t Ripa be extended to cover those pesky overseas companies, and compel them to hand over data \u2013 even if it isn\u2019t held in the UK \u2013 if it\u2019s about UK residents? On this the ISC is wandering into dangerous territory where it has failed to reflect on the inevitable result. If the UK can demand access to the contents of internet accounts \u2013 even where the data is stored overseas \u2013 of people in the UK, why shouldn\u2019t Russia demand exactly the same of Britons who happen to be in Russia? Why shouldn\u2019t border guards in China demand access to your hard drive as you get off the plane in Shanghai? What\u2019s to stop Iran insisting on the decryption keys to any internet service that wants to connect its citizens? The current system is a mess \u2013 but making it easier for MI5 to get hold our emails won\u2019t actually make us any safer. Better work by the intelligence agencies will. As the report shows, they had plenty of opportunity to focus on the murderers. The ISC report makes depressing reading, because it shows that internet companies still haven\u2019t decided quite what their priorities should be \u2013 and, equally, that our legislators are still apt to forget that the internet is global, and that the laws we try to make here could be used against us elsewhere. And in the end, it wasn\u2019t emails that killed Lee Rigby. It was a pair of extremists known to the intelligence services, who had been in regular contact via monitored phones, who used kitchen knives. The clues were all there.

With its severe and growing problems with traffic jams, Mumbai certainly sets an international benchmark for what the Economist has labelled \u201ctraffic bedlam\u201d. Yet are these sorts of descriptions guilty of relegating Mumbai to a dystopian world of congestion, informality and lack of development?   Mumbai is in some respects well placed to pioneer new forms of what have been called \u2018post-car\u2019 approaches to urban transport planning. In comparison to western cities such as London, as well as cities in Brazil and South Africa, Mumbai has very low levels of car ownership. Most people walk or use public transport \u2013 an estimated 91% of trips in the city. Mumbai also would seem well placed to adopt the latest global thinking in transport planning: an influential document produced by the international consultancy firm McKinseys in 2003 had transportation as one of the six \u201ccore areas\u201d identified for Mumbai to attain \u201cworld class\u201d status.   But Mumbai seems to be off the map in terms of implementing current innovations in urban transport policy-making. Despite widespread aspirations of emulating other Asian cities such as Singapore and Shanghai, a number of transport interventions are surprisingly absent. This includes urban road pricing or congestion charging, first pioneered by Singapore in the 1970s. This absence is all the more surprising given that 500 staff are responsible for maintaining the software systems for London\u2019s congestion charge in offices located in a busy suburban neighbourhood of Mumbai ...  Mumbai also lacks public bike-share schemes despite their rapid recent spread across the globe, and unlike an estimated 166 cities internationally, does not contain any Bus Rapid Transport Systems (BRTS). Indeed, there are not even any dedicated bus lanes, despite the city\u2019s efficient bus system. Transport planning and policy in contemporary Mumbai has been geared around the motor car. More than 60 flyovers have been built since the late 1990s, despite similar schemes being deemed failures in many other cities.  There has also been an emphasis since 2008 for elevated pedestrian walkways, or \u201cskywalks\u201d. Ostensibly a pedestrian-orientated intervention, helping facilitate Mumbai\u2019s high levels of walking and tapping into a new trend for raised urban walkways such as New York\u2019s High Line, what they really seek to achieve is to clear the crowded streets below of slow-moving people, thus freeing up space for more cars.  Again the comparison with London is intriguing; England\u2019s capital is currently tearing down its highwalks, which have become at best a nostalgic feature of the post-war urban landscape.     City traffic in Mumbai. Photograph: Auscape/UIG via Getty Images    So why this emphasis on cars when the vast majority of Mumbai\u2019s population do not have access to this form of travel? One reason is that there is not necessarily the institutional capacity in Mumbai to instigate innovative approaches to transport planning. There is no comparable agency to Brazil\u2019s Institute of Research and Urban Planning in Curitiba, which for more than 40 years has helped to acquire knowledge, undertake analysis and nurture transport schemes such as BRTS.  Instead, there is a continued reliance on transport planning in Mumbai that has not been significantly updated or superseded. In particular, a 1963 report by US firm Wilbur Smith still forms the backbone for many of the city\u2019s transport schemes, such as the Bandra-Worli Sealink, which opened in 2009. This institutional \u201canalytical vacuum\u201d has been easily filled by civic-society pressure groups \u2013 small groups of \u201cconcerned\u201d middle-class citizens with interests in improving their journey to work by car. It has also been manipulated by corporate interests, who have a financial stake in steering transport planning towards large lucrative projects such as flyovers. Another important reason for the city\u2019s continued car-centric focus is the limited enthusiasm from politicians for alternative thinking around transport. There are no urban leaders \u2013 such as Jaime Lerner in Curitiba or Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa in Bogot\u00e1 \u2013 willing to act tough on cars. Instead, a large part of most politicians\u2019 time in Mumbai is spent being chauffeur-driven from the airport to the state government buildings further south, via the new Sealink. Unlike in London, Barcelona or New York, public transport and cycling is not an election winner. An image of a politician cycling like London mayor Boris Johnson, or on the Tube like his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, would be a clear sign of low status. Rather, it is instructive how a connection with highly visible, car-focused transport schemes can seemingly facilitate a political career. Nitin Gadkari, now transport minister in the BJP national administration, was the public works minister responsible for Mumbai during the late 1990s, when he became known as \u201cMr Flyover\u201d. Mumbai\u2019s love of the car is no esoteric concern. It has significant impacts on issues of air quality and on human-induced climate change, especially given Mumbai\u2019s influential role across urban India. But this is not to say that sustainable transport solutions from elsewhere are necessarily the panacea for Mumbai\u2019s transport difficulties. Not only is there no guarantee they will transfer to Mumbai successfully, but they may not be the most appropriate to the city\u2019s specific needs and existing infrastructure.  In truth, Mumbai contains many of its own key pointers for urban transport futures. Not only in terms of its impressive statistics for non-motorised modes of commuting, but in its management of large numbers of people via public transport. This is a city where one suburban station might deal with the population of Copenhagen on a daily basis.  So perhaps it is not surprising that features of Mumbai seem to be appearing in London. The implementation of shared spaces or \u201cnaked streets\u201d, such as Exhibition Road in Kensington, resemble ordinary, suburban streets in Mumbai, where different road users jostle for position but somehow manage to negotiate their routes. Maybe Sir Peter Hendy might also be pleased that London is moving in the direction of Mumbai.  Professor Andrew Harris is a geography and urban studies lecturer at University College London.

My heart sinks when I get emails from music students saying they are writing a \u2018minimalist piece\u2019. Once you become an ism, what you\u2019re doing is dead.\u201d Riley\u2019s problem is that he is the composer of perhaps the defining work of what has become known as minimalist music. In C, the groundbreaking piece he first performed on 4 November 1964, may have become an \u201cism\u201d but it is no artefact: for its 50th anniversary, tributes and reinterpretations keep coming. A new version \u2013 recorded by Damon Albarn and his Africa Express team, with help from Brian Eno and Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs \u2013 is out this week. Today, the Californian is in Berlin to meet with the German conductor Andr\u00e9 de Ridder, who instigated and led this new version, recorded last year in Bamako, the capital of Mali. For his 80th birthday next year, there will be Riley retrospectives at music festivals around the world. The beard will be doing a lot of rippling.     Interactive video of Africa Express playing an exclusive performance of In C Mali at Tate Modern, London   In C was born in the blue fog of Parisian jazz. In February 1962, Riley and his wife arrived in the French capital from the US. He made a living playing boogie-woogie piano at military bases and at Fred Payne\u2019s Artists Bar in Pigalle. In the pool room of the bar one day, he bumped into jazz legend Chet Baker, who had just returned from Italy where he had been imprisoned for drug possession. The two hit it off and, in June 1963, were asked by the playwright Ken Dewey to come up with a soundtrack for an experimental theatre piece called The Gift. Riley recorded Baker and his band playing a number of works, including Miles Davis\u2019s So What, and then starting messing about with the tapes in the studio. \u201cI added a spoken-word part, created loops with Chet\u2019s trumpet, and let them run out of sync. It was a kind of precursor to In C.\u201d The piece itself came to Riley about 11 months later, when he was back in the US. \u201cI was on a coach in San Francisco,\u201d he says, \u201cand it just revealed itself to me, like in a dream.\u201d By the end of the next day, he had written In C down on paper, and a few months later the piece premiered at the San Francisco Tape Music Center. Another Riley work performed at that 4 November concert was Coule, its title riffing on the French verb \u201cto flow\u201d and its English homophone. But In C didn\u2019t flow in the way cool jazz did: it had an incessant, throbbing forward drive. To modern ears, it sounds a bit like the string section from the Psycho shower scene played by a bunch of stoned beatniks, or the London Philharmonic doing krautrock.     Terry Riley: \u2018I am still interested in music as ecstasy, as something that transports you away from the everyday to another place.\u2019 Photograph: Chris Felver/Getty Images    With In C, Riley wanted to achieve the same effect with a live orchestra that he had previously created electronically: the score has 53 different musical phrases, lasting from half a beat to 32. Performers can play these phrases over and over, starting them at different times, so the music falls in and out of sync. A performance can be over in 15 minutes, or last several hours, with a steady pulse of the note C \u2013 played in the original performance by Steve Reich on a Wurlitzer organ \u2013 keeping chaos at bay. The first gig featured 15 musicians, though Riley now thinks 25 to 30 are needed \u201cto build up the right wall of sound\u201d. Last October, Portishead\u2019s Adrian Utley recorded it with 19 other guitarists. Riley isn\u2019t too fond of talking about the work these days, though. \u201cI wanted to keep on doing something new,\u201d he says. A few weeks after that first performance, he recalls, Steve Reich started publishing his own sound collages and people started saying to Riley: \u201cOh, what you\u2019re doing sounds a lot like Steve\u2019s work.\u201d As Riley says: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t easy for me to take. I felt it had taken me years to find a style that gave me an identity, and now it was suddenly being taken away from me.\u201d With 1969\u2019s A Rainbow in Curved Air, he returned to electronic overdubs, and his current compositions are more traditionally classical, albeit with gospel and jazz elements. \u201cI am still interested in music as ecstasy, as something that transports you away from the everyday to another place.\u201d But he was excited when De Ridder sent him a Soundcloud link to the Africa Express version. He immediately emailed him back, saying it sounded as if his piece was \u201ctaking flight with the soul of Africa\u201d. While the term minimalism evokes disciplinarians in black rollneck jumpers, the enduring spirit of In C is anything but: it snatches the baton from the composer and hands it to the musicians. Riley recalls recording a version with the Shanghai Film Orchestra in the 1980s. \u201cThey wanted to use all these western instruments because they couldn\u2019t reach the fourth degree of the scale on their instruments. But that\u2019s precisely what I loved about it.\u201d The Africa Express version is, likewise, faithful to the spirit rather than the letter of In C. De Ridder had brought a copy of Riley\u2019s score to Bamako because he had been performing the piece with his own ensemble, Stargaze. He soon found out that straight repetition was alien to the philosophy of Malian musicians. Instead, they ended up jamming over him playing the phrases on the violin. Riley\u2019s favourite part of their version, he says, is when the C pulse suddenly stops and one of the musicians starts speaking over the music, about the first time he learnt to play his instrument, the kora. \u201cThat blew my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI always welcome it when pieces change.

Yet for some users, Instagram is generating more than appreciative likes and comments as they document their lives, travels and eating habits on their smartphones. From Nike to the Namibian tourist board, brands and organisations are turning to the most followed users in the pursuit of a broader and younger audience \u2013 and are paying handsomely for their services. Cue the rise of the Instagram professionals, users who began using the app for fun but are now earning six-figure salaries and being flown around the world to take photos to share with their thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands, of followers. One of the most sought after is New Yorker Liz Eswein, 25, who joined Instagram just after it launched in 2010 and began posting pictures of her home city under the account @NewYorkCity as a hobby. She now has more than 1.2 million followers and has been dubbed the \u201cden mother of Instagram\u201d. For each job with a brand, Eswein demands $1 (64p) per like under each sponsored picture on Instagram, on top of a separate fee based on the number of images she takes. Recent sponsored photos have attracted more than 23,000 likes each. Two scenic pictures taken of the Andes during an all-expenses paid trip generated 19,386 and 20,462 likes.

Photograph: Liz Eswein    \u201cInstagram has taken me around the world\u201d said Eswein. \u201cI recently came back from Chile for a project we are working on. I worked with the tourism board for Namibia. I recently went to Shanghai and before that Dubai and Turkey, all for clients. There aren\u2019t words to describe how amazing an experience it\u2019s been, to travel the world and be paid to go to all of these places to take pictures, which is something I love.\u201d Eswein joined forces with Laundry Service, a New York social media agency, to set up an arm of the business to connect her and her network of 1,000 influential Instagram users with some of the world\u2019s top brands. Jason Stein, the agency\u2019s founder, said commercial demand for these photographers in the past year had been \u201ccrazy \u2013 it\u2019s completely out of control\u201d. He added: \u201cContent on Instagram has higher engagement than any other platform in the history of the internet and its free. Companies have realised that one photo on the Instagram account of someone with over 100,000 followers is reaching more people directly than any traditional ad campaign.\u201d The stats may explain why Amazon, fashion brand Michael Kors and others have been recruiting Instagram photographers through Stein\u2019s agency: 90% of users of the app are under 35; more than half of them use it daily; 1,000 comments are posted every second; and 1.6bn likes given every day.     Beacon Falls trail by Brian DiFio. \u2018On average an Instagrammer that\u2019s got 100,000 followers is consistently putting up great photos ... can be making between $5,000 and $10,000 a month.\u2019 Photograph: Brian DiFio    Stein said Instagram photography had become a day job from which \u201csome people are making over six figures\u201d a year. \u201cIt\u2019s become a career. It\u2019s taking what a traditional brand or ad photographer used to be and kind of pumping it with steroids because you own and control all distribution now too.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019d say that these days social media celebrities carry more influence than normal celebrities because people can relate to them. You are following the story of their lives through their photos, it becomes almost a traditional storytelling narrative, and that\u2019s what people gravitate towards \u2013 it\u2019s very similar to the YouTube vloggers and their massive followings.\u201d One of the first people to use the app for commercial means was Brian DiFeo. Like Eswein, he joined Instagram as a 33-year-old with no professional photography experience. But after gaining popularity on the platform, in March 2011 he speculatively emailed the organisers of a New York music festival asking for a free ticket in exchange for taking photos of the event and putting them on to his feed. It proved so successful that sports brand Puma then invited him and fellow Instagrammer Anthony Danielle to document the Volvo Ocean Race in Abu Dhabi, all expenses paid. It was, said DiFeo \u201ccompletely surreal\u201d. In March 2012, after being approached by several other firms for their services, he and Danielle set up The Mobile Media Lab, the first company designed solely to connect the growing Instagram community with companies and brands. It proved to be savvy timing: Facebook bought Instagram the following month in a $1bn deal that made the headlines. Last year The Mobile Media Lab generated more than $1m in revenue.

Photograph: Anthony Danielle    While DiFeo now mainly takes a managerial role, in 2012 he travelled round the US and abroad taking sponsored pictures on Instagram. \u201cFor me the peak was being taken to France [by the champagne house] Veuve Clicquot on a three-day whirlwind tour to pick grapes\u201d he said. \u201cIt was amazing. We stayed in the Veuve Clicquot mansion and drank wine that was bottled before the world war two \u2013 it was a completely mind-boggling experience. And I was just there taking photos on my phone.\u201d To be part of DiFeo\u2019s network, Instagram photographers need a minimum of 10,000 followers each \u2013 with their value directly linked to how many likes and comments they average on their account. Demand over the past year has driven up that value radically. \u201cI remember the first job I took was something like eight photos for $300, as we had no idea of our value back then,\u201d DiFeo said. \u201cNow we pay everybody per photo \u2013 so it could be $250 to $3,000, depending on how many likes and engagements they have. The most we\u2019ve paid for a single photo is $4,000 \u201cOn average an Instagrammer that\u2019s got a good 100,000 followers is consistently putting up great photos and their audience really likes what they\u2019re doing can be making between $5,000 and $10,000 a month. What we see emerging here is a whole other crop of Instagrammers who are now taking this on as a career, are chasing down the jobs and commanding really high price for their work. These are the people making upwards of $70,000 or even $100,000 a year just on Instagram.\u201d Authenticity is important, with Instagrammers keen not to lose followers and therefore value. Full disclosure of all sponsored photos is vital, according to DiFeo.     A photo from Aiala Hernando\u2019s instagram. She sees her commercial Instagram photography as a \u2018fun complement\u2019 to her day job. Photograph: Aiala Hernando    \u201cThe key is finding jobs for Instagrammers that are a really good fit for their feed and that way it doesn\u2019t become to overly commercial and turn off audiences. \u201cIt can occasionally cause some backlash in the comments or the photographers being accused as sellouts but with all of these jobs the photographers have creative control and they know what photos are going to sit well with their audience. As a company we tell all our Instagrammers to have full disclosure of sponsored pictures, either by overtly saying they are very excited with working with a certain brand or by hashtagging the picture with \u2018sponsored by\u2019.\u201d Professional photographers have realised its earning potential. Aiala Hernando, from San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain, sees her commercial Instagram photography as a \u201cfun complement\u201d to her day job. It earns her an extra $3,000 a month. \u201cRecently I went to Rome to do some work for a hotel, to document these rituals they have,\u201d she said. \u201cI went there for 24 hours three weeks in a row, which was great fun. For a travel job like that I will earn between $2,000 and $5,000 a day. One of my main worries when signing with an agency was making my Instagram feed too commercial, so what I try to do is only accept jobs that match with my content and not post anything too harsh for my audience. I always take photos in my specific style.\u201d DiFeo dismisses the idea that Instagram \u2013 and the commercial photography on it \u2013 is a passing fad. \u201cOver the past year, Instagram has really infiltrated everyday society \u2013 it\u2019s mentioned on TV, it\u2019s mentioned in the news daily \u2013 so it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in terms of commercial influence, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s reached its apex.\u201d", "tags": ["Instagram", "Technology", "Advertising", "Media", "Photography", "Marketing & PR", "World news", "Social media"], "publicationDate": "2014-11-27T19:10:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/30/hardline-australia-confused-scandinavia-and-tense-russia-the-global-immigration-picture", "sentences": ["\u201cMost people in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou understand that without migrant workers, the daily operation of the cities will come to a halt,\u201d he said."], "title": "Hardline Australia, confused Scandinavia and tense Russia: the global immigration picture", "article": "Few issues excite politicians\u2019 and voters\u2019 passions as much as immigration. For decades now, the world has been on the move: last year, according to the United Nations Population Fund, the number of people living outside their country of origin reached 232 million \u2013 50% more than in 1990. That may feel like a lot of people; in fact, it represents just 3.2% of the world\u2019s population. They are, however, unevenly spread: 60% live in the developed world, including 72 million in Europe, 71 million in Asia and 53 million in North America. Nearly two-thirds of migrants currently living in the developed world came from a developing country. Logically, the developed world is also where international immigrants represent a larger proportion of the total population: 10.8%, against just 1.6% in developing regions. Migrants, for example, now make up 9.8% of the total population in Europe, 14.9% in North America, and more than 20% in Oceania. But it seems migration patterns are shifting. While more people still settle in developed countries than in developing, the growth rate is now higher in the latter: 1.8% against 1.5%. Also, overall migration is slowing. From 2000 to 2010, 4.6 million people left their home country each year; that number is now 3.6 million. But migration and its effects, real or perceived, remain one of the defining political and social issues of the day. In Britain and the US, the subject \u2013 anti-immigration; Ukip\u2019s onward march; Barack Obama\u2019s decision to give up to 5 million immigrants work permits \u2013 dominates national debate. But what about elsewhere in the world? Is everyone as obsessed by immigration?  Jon Henley     A temporary tent for illegal migrant workers at the site of the former Cherkizovsky market in Moscow. Photograph: Geodakyan Artyom    Russia Population: 144 million Net migration 2010-14: 1.1 million.  Hop on a metro train in Moscow or visit a market in any of Russia\u2019s major cities and faces from Central Asia and the Caucasus will be everywhere. According to United Nations figures, Russia has more immigrants than any other country in the world, save the United States, with about 11 million foreigners living in the country at any one time and a large grey labour market. Immigrants have been responsible for the lion\u2019s share of the construction and other work that has taken place during Vladimir Putin\u2019s presidency, when, at least until recently, high oil prices fuelled a building boom. Much of the immigration to Russia is from countries that were once part of the Soviet Union and have suffered economic decline since its collapse. Whole villages in mountainous Tajikistan empty of their menfolk each summer as hundreds of thousands travel to Russia to work on construction sites and do other menial jobs. Partly because many of the immigrant communities are transient and temporary, and partly because of active government policies to prevent it, Moscow\u2019s enormous migrant population has never translated into ethnic districts. There is no Southall or Chinatown here; no part of the city to go to for Central Asian plov or Caucasian khinkali dumplings. Instead, the migrant populations are spread around the city; a small intellectual class that is more or less integrated into Russian life, and an underclass of labourers who live in makeshift housing on construction sites or in cheap hostels. The low living standards and the bureaucratic hurdles that make it impossible for many migrants to work without paying bribes has led to tension and mistrust among Russians. A survey over the summer for the Levada polling agency found that 76% of Russians felt the number of immigrants should be restricted, and just 12% said they had a positive opinion of migrants from the south Caucasus. Occasionally these latent tensions bubble over into violence, most notably last year in the Moscow suburb of Birulyovo, where riots broke out after a Russian football fan was killed by a migrant from Azerbaijan. Even Alexei Navalny, the great hope of Moscow\u2019s liberal classes, has disturbingly nationalist views. Navalny says he merely wants to see visas introduced for the former Soviet republics, but in his earlier years he appeared in videos comparing migrant workers to cockroaches. The government has tried to tread a careful line between exploiting and reining in nationalist sentiment, but there are few conscious efforts to improve the lot of unskilled migrants. In 2005, nationalist politician Dmitry Rogozin released a campaign video with the slogan: \u201cLet\u2019s clean the rubbish away from Moscow.\u201d It was clear that migrant workers were the rubbish, pictured speaking bad Russian and leering at a blonde Russian woman. Even in Russia, the video was controversial, but what might have been career-ending for a politician in another country, only boosted Rogozin\u2019s ratings. He is now the deputy prime minister.

Photograph: Bjorn Lindgren    Sweden, Denmark and Norway Sweden Population: 9.728 million Net migration 2010-14:200,000 Of the record 26,000 asylum applications granted so far this year, 14,500 were to Syrians. The largest immigrant group in Sweden is, however, the Finns, followed by the Iraqis. Denmark Population: 5.614 million Net migration 2010-14:75,000Last quarter, Germans made up the largest group (accounted for by students arriving in September), with Syrians third, but Romanians followed by Poles have been the largest two groups for several years. Norway Population: 5.08 million Net migration 2010-14:150,000. In 2013, Polish people accounted for the largest number: 10,502. We tend to think of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, collectively, as liberal, progressive social democracies, but they have traditionally had quite different approaches to immigration. The region has more immediate and significant challenges to face \u2013 productivity stagnation and increased inequality (Denmark), a slumping oil price (Norway) and an ageing population (Sweden) \u2013 but anti-immigration parties across the region have skilfully exploited the concerns of predominantly lower-income groups to reap huge dividends in the polls. Thus immigration has been the most significant political issue in Scandinavia for more than a decade. Norway is one of the world\u2019s most generous donators of foreign aid, but is generally considered the least welcoming in the region towards immigrants. Actually, in 2013 Norway was second only to Sweden in the per capita number of refugees it welcomed (the largest number from Eritrea, followed by Somalia and Syria), but things have changed dramatically since the election that year, after which the rightwing Progress party \u2013 of which Anders Behring Breivik was a former member \u2013 was admitted into the ruling coalition for the first time. Its leader, Siv Jensen, a vocal Islamophobe, was appointed finance minister. Today, Norway is deporting people at a record rate: more than 7,000 this year. In Denmark, next year\u2019s election is expected to bring a record vote for the far right Danish People\u2019s party (it won the highest number of votes in the recent European elections). This is not the first time the party has tasted success: it was the powerbroker in the right-leaning government for the first decade of the 21st century, and forced through numerous controversial immigration laws, largely to prevent family repatriation. In Denmark, \u201cimmigrant\u201d is often conflated with \u201cMuslim\u201d, while \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d is commonly interpreted as \u201cfreedom to insult Islam and other visible minorities\u201d. This we saw with the Muhammad cartoon crisis of 2005/6, and again just last month in the exhibition in Copenhagen of Swedish artist Dan Parks\u2019s works depicting lynchings of local black leaders, which had been banned in his homeland. Sweden has long accepted more immigrants than any other Scandinavian country, and continues to do so: last year it admitted roughly 20% of all EU asylum seekers. This year it is predicting a record number of refugees will apply for asylum, the majority from Syria. The Swedish ruling class has long been a curious mix of fiercely progressive social democrats and rather murky industrialists (usually the bad guys in Swedish crime fiction). The former approve the open-door policy on grounds of compassion, but both public and private sectors feast on the cheap labour: Sweden\u2019s economy has consistently outperformed Denmark\u2019s over the past decade. Meanwhile, a compliant media has sidelined anti-immigration voices, leading to accusations of self-censorship (mostly from the Danes who have grown tired of Swedish sanctimony regarding the prominence of the Danish People\u2019s party). This kept the far-right out of the political mainstream for many years, but at the last general election in September, the Sweden Democrats \u2013 which has its origins in neo-nazism \u2013 won 13% of the vote, doubling its previous tally. The party\u2019s support is predominantly among working-class voters in the south. One final curiosity: all the Scandinavian rightwing parties offer what is to British eyes an improbable blend of xenophobia and an almost nostalgic social democratic affection for the welfare state.

Photograph: Reuters    Australia Population: 23.7 million Net migration 2010-14: 750,000 People turning up on boats. Nothing has played a greater role in defining Australia, in shaping the country\u2019s character, in directing its development. Nothing, now, is more controversial. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said earlier this year that the arrival of the First Fleet in Australia was the defining moment in the country\u2019s history. Yet he won election on a platform of promising to \u201cstop the boats\u201d of all asylum seekers. Australia has a curiously contradictory attitude towards migrants: at once welcoming and hostile, depending almost exclusively on mode of arrival. Fundamentally, Australia prides itself on being multicultural. It is a nation of immigrants. One in four Australians was born overseas, and in nearly 20% of households, a language other than English is the dominant tongue. Net migration is forecast by the government to increase each year to 2017, the last year of projections. India and the UK provided nearly a third of new Australian citizens last year. The statistics are reflective of Australia\u2019s human history, essentially one of successive waves of migration. The arrival of Indigenous Australians, from Africa via Asia, between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago; the First Fleet convicts in 1788; postwar generations of \u201cpopulate or perish\u201d sponsored migrants; the dismantling of the White Australia Policy; the first \u201cunauthorised\u201d boat arrivals in the 1970s: Australia has been shaped, and irrevocably altered, by its migrants. But in 21st-century Australia, the vast bulk of the country\u2019s migration programme is barely discussed. Periodically, there are debates about whether the driest inhabited continent on earth can support a \u201cBig Australia\u201d of 35 million, or discussions of guest worker programmes for Pacific Islanders. But essentially Australia talks only of asylum seekers and refugees. Australia displays a divided attitude towards those seeking asylum. Those resettled in Australia through the government\u2019s humanitarian programme are seen as \u201cdeserving\u201d refugees, welcomed and supported. Those who arrive unannounced by boat are condemned as \u201cillegals\u201d and \u201cqueue jumpers\u201d. This is despite most boat arrivals coming from Burma, Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka, countries where there are no refugee queues. And it is despite the fact that there are now fewer places in the queue: at the same time as stopping the boats, Australia has cut its refugee resettlement intake by almost a third, from 20,000 to 13,750 people a year. The government says its self-proclaimed \u201chardline\u201d policies against boat arrivals are based on a humanitarian rationale, designed to stop drownings at sea, to \u201cbreak the people smugglers\u2019 business model\u201d, and to protect Australia from \u201cthreats to its national security\u201d. But more than 90% of those arriving by boat are found to be genuine refugees, requiring Australia\u2019s protection. And their numbers \u2013 save for a significant spike in 2012 and 2013 \u2013 have generally been fewer than 1% of Australia\u2019s total migrant intake. However, the policy on its most fundamental level is successful. Boats are no longer coming. Australia is one of only five jurisdictions in the world known to forcibly push asylum-seekers\u2019 boats back to sea. Those that reach Australia are taken out of the country, held in prison-like camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, where instances of self-harm, disease and violent physical and sexual assault are common. The average length of detention is 426 days. Australia also incarcerates asylum-seeker children without charge. Currently, more than 600 are in detention.

Photograph: Reuters    India Population: 1.2 billion Net migration 2010-14: -2.294 million It was dusk in early November when the suicide bomber struck Wagah, the only land crossing between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan, killing at least 55 people. India\u2019s orange-turbaned border guards and their black-clad Pakistani counterparts had already lowered both country\u2019s flags in a display of goose-stepping nationalism attended daily by spectators. Due to tight security, the bomber blew himself up a few hundred metres from the actual gate separating the two countries. But for India, it was close enough to serve as a potent reminder of how vulnerable it is to terrorist infiltration. Six years ago, Pakistani nationals carried out the Mumbai attacks in which more than 150 people were killed. Terror and security issues have largely driven India\u2019s immigration policy. India\u2019s 2,300km border with Pakistan is fenced and so brightly floodlit it is visible from space. But increasingly, illegal migration and population pressures too are in play. In the east, along India\u2019s 3,360km border with Bangladesh, shoot on sight orders allow border guards to kill with impunity. Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 1,000 people, including many children, have been killed by Indian border guards since 2000. Most victims are poor, landless farmers seeking a marginally better life in India. Migration is overwhelmingly undocumented. While the World Bank\u2019s official figures suggest a net outflow, estimates for the number of illegal immigrants run from 3 million to 20 million. And migration to the country is increasingly a potent religious and political issue. During the election campaign earlier this year, India\u2019s new Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, told a rally that \u201cthese Bangladeshis better be prepared with their bags packed\u201d when he came to power. Meanwhile, he said, India should make space for Hindu migrants left behind when the British carved up the subcontinent in 1947. Hindus fled to India and Muslims to East and West Pakistan, with up to a million slaughtered. East Pakistan \u2013 now Bangladesh \u2013 gained its independence in 1971 in another bloody conflict. Ever since those partitions, migration within the region has remained a thorny emotional issue. But even garden-variety visitors to India hardly find a red carpet welcome. Despite Modi\u2019s economic charm offensive and encouragement for businesses to \u201cMake in India\u201d, the regime for both business and tourist visas remains Kafkaesque. In the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business rating, India has actually fallen eight places to 139 out of 189 economies surveyed in 2014. Perhaps the most bizarre legacy of India\u2019s failure to forge a humane, coherent immigration policy, free from the hangovers of colonialism, lies in a tiny parcel of land called Dahala Khagrabari #51. It\u2019s a Bangladeshi jute field, completely encircled by an Indian village, which is itself entirely surrounded by Bangladeshi territory. Its inhabitants and those of a staggering 161 other such \u201cenclaves\u201d, created in the chaotic aftermath of independence, are stateless and confined to their islands of terrain. India has ignored the problem for six decades, possibly on the assumption that the problem may eventually go away. Its immigration policy suffers from the same wilful blindness. Fencing people out might solve some problems. But the twin regional factors of poverty and climate change could see millions of people, particularly from Bangladesh, seeking sanctuary in India. At that point, New Delhi may have to look beyond barbed wire and bullets. Anu Anand     Afghan refugees living in Islamabad. Photograph: Anadolu Agency    Pakistan Population: 182.1 million Net migration 2010-14: 1.63 million Pakistan is home to one of the largest refugee populations in the world. The majority are Afghan refugees who began arriving after the Soviet invasion in 1979 and have continued in waves through the following decades of war. The UN says there are currently about 1.6 million refugees living in Pakistan, and in total they have helped repatriate 3.8 million Afghan refugees. The government, meanwhile, says there are another million Afghan refugees who are undocumented, while some experts place the total number of Afghan refugees closer to 4 million. In the sixth most populous country in the world, accurate figures are hard to come by. Junaid Arshad Khan from the International Organisation of Migration says the government only publishes daily figures for border crossings between the two countries \u2013 around 40,000 to 50,000 each day \u2013 but points out that many are daily migrants. Yet despite the high number of refugees, there is currently little national debate about immigration, according to Haris Gazdar from the Collective for Social Science Research: \u201cThere have been similar debates to those in the west \u2013 with migrants linked to crime, and a draw-down on resources. But at the moment that has died down and there is not a serious debate about repatriation or immigration policy in general.\u201d The lack of debate is partly because many Afghan refugees live in areas where they have strong ethnic and cultural links to the local population. But Sanaa Alimia, an academic who researches Afghan refugees, says there has been a growing hostility in recent years \u2013 and this normally comes from people at government level. She says she has come across mass arrests and harassment of refugees as a way to \u201cencourage\u201d them to be repatriated. And she points out that only Afghan refugees who are registered can access services \u2013 from education and housing to healthcare \u2013 and have protection against repatriation or arrest. Although many refugees arrived decades ago, few become citizens unless they marry into the local population. The more than a million people who are internally displaced by military operations against militants and natural disasters are part of the debate about immigration, says Alimia. But other smaller populations of migrants from elsewhere in south Asia \u2013 or skilled workers from China \u2013 are seldom mentioned. Meanwhile more than 4 million Pakistanis are migrants to countries including India, Saudi Arabia and the UK \u2013 and remittances from abroad make up 5.7% of the country\u2019s GDP.

In fact, he said, the urgent issue facing China is not an excess of arrivals \u2013 but of departures. China\u2019s immigration deficit, as measured from the early 80s, has reached nearly 8.5m. The leadership is now seeking to address that, Wang added: \u201cChina now sees recruiting talents as more important than attracting investments.\u201d Set against the size of the population, the number of foreigners is very low. The 2010 census found there were just less than 600,000 living on the mainland for more than three months (by 2012, that total had risen to 633,000, say Chinese media); three-fifths male, two-fifths female. Most of those were engaged in business, work or study. By far the largest number \u2013 around a fifth \u2013 came from South Korea, with the US and Japan also sending significant numbers and smaller groups coming from Burma, Vietnam, Canada, France, India, Germany and Australia. Settling here long term is difficult. In 2010, just 1,448 foreigners gained Chinese citizenship. And fewer than 5,000 people had gained permanent residence by 2012, according to Chinese media; 1,300 of those gained their green cards through a drive to recruit foreign scientists. State news agency Xinhua reported this summer that the government was considering developing \u201cmore flexible and pragmatic\u201d criteria for green cards. \u201cCompared with the UK or the US, Chinese society is very open-minded on immigration,\u201d said Wang, suggesting it has welcomed new arrivals in part because most have been well-educated and highly skilled. But in places that have seen significant numbers of illegal migrants, the attitude can be less positive, he said. There have been immigration crackdowns in some areas; notably in parts of Guangzhou with large numbers of African residents. Traders and business people there have complained of police targeting them in random raids and of general social prejudice. By far the most significant aspect of Chinese migration is internal: more than 160 million rural workers now live in cities, but their rights to basic services are restricted by the hukou or household registration system, which divides people into urban and rural dwellers and classifies rights accordingly. While the government has announced hukou reforms, experts say there is a long way to go. That reflects in part anxiety about how urban residents will react. Some are extremely hostile to the idea of extending more rights to rural workers and their rhetoric can echo comments about immigrants in the UK: complaining that schools will be overwhelmed and that migrants are changing the culture of neighbourhoods. But Wang Zhenyao, president of the China Philanthropy Research Institute, said such views were in a minority. \u201cMost people in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou understand that without migrant workers, the daily operation of the cities will come to a halt,\u201d he said.

Photograph: Reuters     Spain Population: 46.5 million Net migration 2010-14: 600,000  In Spain, the discussion regarding migrants arriving in the country has been overshadowed by worries about the number of people leaving. Fifteen years ago, immigrants from Ecuador, Bolivia, Romania and Morocco drove the immigrant population in the country from less than 2% in 1999 to 12% in 2009, but today many of these same migrants are leaving. In the face of an unemployment rate that hovers around 24%, many of Spain\u2019s migrants are heading home, joining the exodus of Spaniards hoping to find better job opportunities abroad. Spain became a net exporter of people in 2010; last year some 550,000 people left while 250,680 migrated to the country, primarily from Morocco, Romania and the UK. The figures, from the National Statistics Institute, are not exact, only reflecting the number of people who have registered with local authorities in their municipality; many foreigners have taken their name off municipal rolls to avoid a new requirement to declare assets located abroad. The economic crisis has led the number of Latin American migrants to drop off considerably in recent years, says Joaqu\u00edn Arango, a professor of sociology at Madrid\u2019s Complutense University. Increasingly taking their place are migrants from China, who see business opportunities in the crisis. Compared with many other European countries, there has been less rejection of migration in Spain, says Arango. \u201cEven after seven years of economic crisis, we haven\u2019t seen any kind of generalised backlash.\u201d The explanation, he says, lies in the country\u2019s transition to democracy after more than three decades of dictatorship. \u201cThe values associated with democracy \u2013 anti-racism, equality \u2013 became entrenched.\u201d He points to remarks by David Cameron in 2011 urging the British public to report illegal immigrants. \u201cIn Spain this would be unthinkable.\u201d Those who work with immigrants worry that this attitude is slowing eroding, says Mikel Aragu\u00e1s, of Andaluc\u00eda Acoge (Welcome Andalusia), a non-profit group dedicated to helping immigrants integrate. As Spain suffers harsh austerity measures, migrants are increasingly being seen as competitors for the scarce social resources, says Aragu\u00e1s. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a discourse that seeks to criminalise immigration, with some media asking whether these groups pay taxes or whether they\u2019re scamming social services.\u201d Food banks run by far-right groups and who serve only needy Spanish nationals have sprouted across the country, while in the Basque country, the mayor of Vitoria has railed against Algerians and Moroccans, accusing them of taking advantage of social benefits. In September, Aragu\u00e1s\u2019s group formalised its efforts to fight back, launching a project called Stop Rumours. Tackling the most commonly heard stereotypes, such as migrants being a burden on the country\u2019s healthcare system or that they are taking all the jobs, the project\u2019s website offers videos and statistics to dispel the myths. More than 300 people have signed up for the group\u2019s workshops, intended to give people the tools to counter this discourse. The stereotypes have rapidly gained strength in the absence of little public debate over immigration, says Aragu\u00e1s. Instead, he says, the conversation focuses on the borders at the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, where migrants spend months living rough in the hope of rushing the border fence that separates Morocco from Spain. \u201cIt\u2019s an element that\u2019s very visual but a perversion of migration in the country.\u201d Some 14,000 people rushed the fence last year, with 2,000 making it in; a minuscule drop in the bucket compared with Spain\u2019s 4.6 million immigrants. Still, the border fences have become the flashpoint of the debate over migrants in Spain, with human rights groups, the European Union and United Nations expressing concerns about Spain\u2019s actions, while the Spanish government pushes forward, fortifying the triple fence and covering it with anti-climbing mesh. It\u2019s a futile debate in a country that has become a net exporter of people, says Aragu\u00e1s.

Photograph: AP    South Africa Population: 51,770,560 Net migration 2010-14: -100,000 South Africa is among the biggest recipients of refugees in the world. Yet the issue remains surprisingly marginal in political discourse. When President Jacob Zuma delivered his state-of-the-nation address to parliament in June, its more than 29,000 words did not mention immigration once. This is despite an official unemployment rate of 25.4%, alleged mistreatment of asylum seekers in detention and frequent explosions of xenophobic violence, notably in 2008 when 62 people, including 21 South Africans, were killed and more than 150,000 displaced. Immigration figures are notoriously imprecise. South Africa\u2019s 2011 census says 3.3% \u2013 or about 1.7 million \u2013 of the country\u2019s 51.8 million population are \u201cnon-South African\u201d citizens. Data collated by the World Bank and the UN suggest a migrant population of about 1.86 million. But the number of undocumented or illegal migrants is unknown. A total of 108,711 applications for temporary and permanent residence were approved by the government in 2013. Two-thirds of these were from Zimbabwe, Nigeria, China, India, Pakistan, the UK, Lesotho and Angola. \u201cMost of these people bring skills into the country,\u201d statistician-general Pali Lehohla said earlier this year. There are also asylum seekers: media reports often describe South Africa as the world\u2019s largest recipient. But an investigation by the Africa Check website found the evidence to be \u201cflawed, inaccurate and sharply contradictory\u201d, while Amnesty International has said it understands that nine out of 10 applications are rejected. Newspaper proprietor Trevor Ncube, harassed at an airport after a business trip in 2012, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s time South African immigration stopped assuming every black African coming into the country is a desperate criminal.\u201d Neighbouring Zimbabwe is easily the biggest source after more than a decade of political and economic turmoil under President Robert Mugabe. Estimates of the number of Zimbabweans in South Africa vary wildly from 1.5 million to 3 million. Coming from a country with the highest literacy rate in Africa, they are often sought after by employers as nannies, security guards or waiters on low pay, prompting some South Africans to accuse them of \u201cstealing jobs\u201d. Meanwhile, Somalis, fleeing 20 years of civil war, have carved a reputation as traders. A 2012 report by the City Press newspaper quoted residents of a township near Cape Town as saying Somali traders are cheaper, friendlier, trade from 5am to 10pm and extend small amounts of credit to regular customers. This has provoked a deadly backlash from local shop owners who feel their territory under threat. But far from exploiting this anger for political gain, Zuma recently chided South Africans for failing to match immigrants\u2019 entrepreneurial spirit. \u201cOur people are waiting for government,\u201d he told a media gathering in Pretoria last month. \u201cOur people are not used to standing up and doing things. These ones [foreigners] are not expecting any government to do anything so they get here, see opportunities and exploit them. They have taken over your small businesses.\u201d If he were a journalist, Zuma added, he would write to South Africans to say \u201cwake up\u201d.

A report commissioned by the Cambridge-based entrepreneurs, which includes the UK semiconductor industry founder Hermann Hauser, angel investor Sherry Coutu, biotechnology head Andy Richards and telecoms businessman David Cleevely, claims that poor infrastructure connecting the south-east region is holding Boris Johnson\u2019s golden triangle vision back. \u201cDrawing lines between places on a map does not make them connected,\u201d said Cleevely. \u201cWe need to connect people and ideas and back this with infrastructure to match.\u201d  \u2018Exist in relative isolation\u2019 Having twice as many technology startups per head than any other city in the EU makes Cambridge Europe\u2019s leading technology cluster, according to the report. However, current connectivity inhibits Britain from competing with Silicon Valley or Shanghai. \u201cUnlike their counterparts in Silicon Valley, Cambridge, Oxford, London, and their neighbours exist in relative isolation,\u201d wrote the authors, who said that it was easier to work with people in Manchester, Amsterdam or Paris than between cities in the south east.  \u201cAs well as connecting people and ideas within a single city, we need to be thinking about connecting nearby cities with a modern and effective infrastructure,\u201d they said. \u201cWe do not have the concentration of humming, continuous, multidirectional, and mutually reinforcing corridors of innovation, spilling-over with people, ideas, investors and promise. That is what it would look like if the fabled \u2018golden triangle\u2019 were a reality,\u201d The report points to King\u2019s Cross as a suitable rail \u201cmega-hub\u201d connecting London, Oxford, Cambridge and the surrounding areas including Stevenage, Stansted, Milton Keynes, the Thames Valley and Martlesham. \u2018Integrated scale of Silicon Valley\u2019 More people, 744,000, according to recent research by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, are employed in the technology industry in the golden triangle than work in Silicon Valley. Foreign investors see London, Oxford and Cambridge as broadly the same area. \u201cGreater integration across the south east to achieve the integrated scale of Silicon Valley would spur the economy and accelerate inward investment into the UK,\u201d the authors state. But to do that the authors insist that transport links must be enhanced to ensure travel time between the south east, Oxford and Cambridge is reduced to less than 40 minutes within 10 years. Current travel times can be between two and three hours, which prevents the chance encounters that foster innovation within clusters. In the short term, the authors suggest that more hubs, like Google\u2019s Campus in London, which provides space and expertise for startups to get a foothold, are needed to provide a safe place for companies to take risks on projects and innovation. They also provide space for developing ideas through informal meetings, the kind of innovation that isn\u2019t found in the boardroom, according to the authors. \u201cHubs don\u2019t need to be in fixed places; let\u2019s have special carriages on trains designated as informal meeting places, and start with Oxford-London and Cambridge-London,\u201d the authors said. Technology in the form of giant interactive screens could also aid informal mingling. \u201cWalking past such a screen, you might see someone you know (and had been meaning to have a chat with).

The answer might seem obvious: from impressionist Paris to contemporary photographs of China\u2019s boom cities, we know that images depict and interpret urban change. But pictures of the city are hardly just decorative or documentary; they also have profound impacts on the ground.  Maps, plans, photographs, renders, computer generated images, street art and signage drive physical changes and are central to perceptions of place and claims to territory.  When we make things visible, we make them public and subject to debate. Urban images not only offer insights to help analyse and understand cities, but also point to ways of radically altering their futures.     Dr John Snow\u2019s cholera map of Soho    In response to an outbreak of the disease in London\u2019s Soho in 1854, Dr John Snow famously plotted the incidences of cholera on a map. By locating and marking each case in space, Snow made visible the relationship between disease outbreak and one particular water pump, at the corner of Broad and Cambridge Streets.  Snow\u2019s cholera map not only contributed to understanding the transmission of disease, his findings were also the impetus for installing sanitation systems in London and many other cities. His map was a catalyst for the development of infrastructure. Visual images investigate and generate knowledge about the city, producing evidence for physical change. Three decades later in New York City, Jacob Riis took a camera and a flashbulb into the city\u2019s most notorious slums, bringing back pictures to show New Yorkers \u201chow the other half lives\u201d (photograph at top of article). Riis\u2019s work was not an act of photojournalism so much as one of urban reform, meant to shock the middle class with the squalid living conditions so close by, in a campaign to reinvent low-income housing and rebuild neighbourhoods such as the Five Points.  Circulating widely, Riis\u2019s photographs appeared in exhibitions arguing for housing reform. They were instrumental in changing the laws for fire regulation and the construction of tenement housing in the city. Riis campaigned for small parks to alleviate crowding in the slum areas he depicted, eventually succeeding in tearing down the Five Points itself and replacing its buildings with a small park, bringing light, air, and recreational facilities into one of the densest parts of the city.     Le Corbusier\u2019s vision of Paris. Photograph: Roger-Viollet/Rex    Other images serve to regulate existing cities or imagine and realise new ones. The work product upon which architects, planners and other built environment professionals trade; plans, technical drawings, diagrams and renderings embody their expertise. Lines and pixels provide the stuff whereby ideas become space and form. Imagining a modern city, where new towers, fast roads and open spaces would combine to create an efficient and salubrious metropolis, Swiss architect Le Corbusier drew the \u201cville contemporaine\u201d and shared it via exhibitions, lectures and publications. The rest is history.      A poster on a Docklands community billboard protests against the Canary Wharf development. Photograph: Adam Woolfitt/Corbis    Drawings by Le Corbusier and like-minded architects circulated to designers and governments around the world, who translated their visions into settlements and cities that today house millions, but not always happily. What looks good on paper does not necessarily account for human needs and emotions.  Who would sit in Le Corbusier\u2019s empty chairs? City dwellers also use images as a tool to imprint and inscribe the city, to make themselves visible. A nuisance or blight to some, graffiti is interpreted by others as a way of laying claim to space. Ephemeral tags, bespoke street art and elaborate mural campaigns play contradictory roles.  They can be read simultaneously as signs of blight and disinvestment and as evidence of culture and creativity, sometimes contesting development, at others adorning it. In the 1980s, the London Docklands community photo-mural campaign voiced loud opposition to powerful government-backed developers, using a combination of satire and scale to make visible a community in the process of gentrification and displacement. In spite of their radical origins, street art and graffiti are increasingly given official sanction as spaces of expression, but also as a way of creating identity or branding neighborhoods. Recognising the inconsistent roles graffiti has played within processes of degradation and regeneration, the artist Moose uses powerful pressure washers to create inscriptions on city surfaces, highlighting the boundary between legality and illegality. Can, or should you, be arrested for cleaning up?  Moose also operates in the commercial branding world for clients who eagerly capitalise on his skill in decorating the urban fabric with subtle, if not subliminal, advertising. Visual images are critical to the idea of spectacle, as the city itself becomes an image to be consumed. This is evident as cities are branded or even built to conform to a particular shape of skyline. In Vancouver or Shangai, city authorities and private companies have capitalised on the potential of skylines to represent modernity, power and economic growth, offering a visual buttress against the fluctuations of financial markets, and an optimism for future vertical and horizontal expansion that works to boost them.      The writing on the wall - or rather the cleaning on the street. Photograph: William Anthony/AP    Housed in a building that itself reads as an emblem, the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Centre (SUPEC) was designed to narrate a story of development and modernisation. It establishes Shanghai\u2019s world city image through an array of interacting models, relief sculptures, photographs, plans, renders and more, while framing views of a new and still metamorphosing cityscape beyond.  In such spaces, of which this is a recent and exaggerated example of a long tradition, the lines between image and \u201creality\u201d are blurred, and we start to see how representations act back on the worlds we inhabit.  SUPEC also makes us aware of the increasingly complex \u2013 and ironically opaque \u2013 industry of urban image-making, requiring diverse kinds of visual and technical expertise beyond that of the built environment professions, and often characterised by commercial or institutional confidentiality.     Brazilian cyclists gather to draw routes they would like to take through the city    Whether produced by institutions or community members, images are sites for debate and repositories of power. Two years ago in Rio de Janeiro, cycling activists and others joined together to imagine better conditions on the street in downtown Rio.  Working together to draw the routes they already took through the city, and those they wished they could take, participants in Ciclo Rotas Centro created a collective picture of a bike-friendly city, and through this, a proposal to exhibit and take to local government. Today, more than 3km of new bike lanes are on the ground, with 30 more to come. Images can be the key to the city, a way of laying claim to space and imagining a better world, as well as a tool for understanding the political and economic structures in which we live.  As such, they demand a closer look than the passing glance we might usually impart. What is their rhetoric? What do they say and how? How do they circulate? Where do they go and who sees them? What is their impact? And which people and places are affected by the images and what they do? Over the next 10 days, drawing on our research project, Picturing Place we will survey how images influence urban change and perceptions of place. Looking across different types of image, in different places and points in time, we will highlight unexpected relationships and observe the influential role that visual languages play in struggles over urban space. We will also be opening a space for you to debate, share and discuss images that have impacted on cities or are currently shaping them. You will be invited to contribute pictures that relate to the examples we feature in our survey, along with captions that put them into context.

With narrow lanes patrolled by chickens, and open doorways revealing heated games of mahjong, the village of Bishan in China\u2019s rural Anhui province might seem an unlikely place to glimpse an experiment in the future of the countryside. This week Chinese president Xi Jinping declared that artists, film-makers, and TV personalities will be sent to live among the masses in rural areas to \u201cform a correct view of art,\u201d in an edict that echoes Mao Zedong\u2019s policy of \u201csending down\u201d intellectuals to labour among the peasants.

Or an espresso machine.\u201d Nor is it a place you would expect to find Ou. An anarchist music promoter from Shenzhen, turned underground publisher in Beijing, turned architectural curator and now country hermit, he moved to Bishan two years ago, driven by an urge to connect with rural life. The bookstore \u2013 which he convinced the owner of the trendy Librairie Avant-Garde, housed in a converted car park in Nanjing, to open here \u2013 is the latest chapter in his Bishan Project, an ambitious plan to create a prototype for China\u2019s rural revival. \u201cChinese cities have become insufferable,\u201d he says, sitting in the courtyard of his grand old merchant\u2019s house, which he has spent the last two years restoring from a derelict state. \u201cThey are growing at an unstoppable pace, being built at an inhuman scale and becoming ever more polluted. And they are killing off the villages in the process.\u201d     Inside the Bishan bookstore, a wooden temple where cows slept until last year.  Photograph: Matja\u017e Tan\u010di\u010d/pr    Over the last decade, China\u2019s mass exodus of the working population from the countryside to the cities has seen rural areas drained of their lifeblood, leaving impoverished communities of elderly farmers looking after their grandchildren. The rural decline has been exacerbated by the government\u2019s frequent and arbitrary acquisition of farmland for development, an alarming trend that has already made China the world\u2019s largest importer of agricultural produce. Where once there rolled rice fields, now identikit armies of tower blocks and strange suburban new towns march, leaving the villages as ghostly cadavers of their former selves. But many places have already made an asset of what\u2019s left behind. With an increasingly mobile urban middle class, a great number of the country\u2019s idyllic rural spots have capitalised on their picture-postcard charm and embraced the roaring industry of domestic tourism. The Huizhou villages of southern Anhui, of which Bishan is one, are blessed with an unusual bounty of fine architecture. They grew as merchant strongholds during the Ming and Qing dynasties, with lavish clan halls built on the profits of trading timber, tea and salt. After decades of neglect, some are now experiencing a boom of a different kind: they have become must-see stop-offs on the itinerary of anyone visiting the sacred yellow mountain of Huangshan, which receives a staggering 15 million domestic tourists a year.     Huangshan, China: tourists visit an ancient house at Hongcun Village. Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty Images    Brimming with Crouching Tiger quaintness, the nearby villages of Xidi and Hongcun were bestowed with Unesco World Heritage status in 2000, heralding a gold rush of restoration projects, souvenir shops and cafes to feed the tourists and film crews that have descended on their streets ever since. In 2009, Huangshan city launched the \u201chundred villages and thousand buildings\u201d project, pumping 550m yuan (\u00a350m) into the preservation (which often translates as demolition and wholesale reconstruction) of its architectural assets, adorning the official historic villages with ticket booths and uniformed inspectors. Most now charge around \u00a310 just to enter the village \u2013 an astronomical price in a region where the average monthly income is less than \u00a380 \u2013 after which you must follow an approved route, lined with rustic locals dutifully enacting their rural ways. Many residents see this as a compromise they\u2019re willing to make. \u201cOur village has become an attraction, so we have to open up our home,\u201d says one elderly woman in Hongcun, through an interpreter. \u201cBut we all reap the benefits: the profits from ticket sales are distributed among us, and we can sell things to the tourists.\u201d Her husband grins from his tea stall, erected in what was once their living room, now full of cap-wearing tour groups jostling to see the fine wooden friezes carved into the walls.     Huangshan, China: photographers line up to take photos of sunrise in Hongcun Village. Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty Images    Ou Ning believes there is a different way. He sees the droves of Chinese tourists as \u201cdragonflies skimming across a pond, just checking places off on a list,\u201d and he is frustrated that they \u201cnever see the harsh reality of rural life, and hardly ever lay eyes on anything worth getting angry over.\u201d He feels there is no engagement between tour groups and villagers, who have lost touch with their own traditions and are merely serving up a sanitised version of the countryside for camera-wielding visitors. Together with his artist and curator friend, Zuo Jing, he began a two-year research project focusing on handicraft traditions in Bishan, inviting artists and designers to work with local craftsmen to create new products using their old techniques. In 2011, they organised the Bishan Harvestival, three days of musical performances, discussions and poetry workshops, held in the local cinema, which attracted the whole village and beyond. It was a dynamic event for a venue whose busiest fixture had always been the annual evening of patriotic songs on the Communist party\u2019s birthday, sung beneath the slogan \u201cThought Liberation, Conceptual Innovation\u201d painted on the wall. The following year, Ou was charged with curating the Yi County international photography festival which, after months of co-ordinating a stellar cast of international participants and shipping their work over, was mysteriously cancelled by government officials with 12 hours\u2019 notice. \u201cI felt paralysed for more than a year after that,\u201d says Ou, who was used to having his underground concerts cancelled and radical publications banned in the 90s. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t make anything, because I didn\u2019t know if they would allow it. That\u2019s why censorship is so powerful here: the boundary is never clear, so it forces you to self-censor everything you do.\u201d     Ou Ning\u2019s Bishan project: villagers help set upan installation at Yixian International photo festival, 2012. Photograph: Sun Yunfan/pr    There are reasons why his work might be viewed with caution: like the activities of his anarchist past, the Bishan Project has a politicised twist. He sees the project as part of a wider national trend of groups looking to revive ideas from the rural reconstruction movement of the 1920s and 30s, which saw intellectuals flock to the countryside to improve education, healthcare and agricultural techniques, in opposition to Mao\u2019s revolutionary approach to rabble-rousing in the villages. His eyes light up as he talks of social activist Wen Tiejun, whose new rural reconstruction movement has been trying to address the crisis in the countryside, building up a network of over 200 grassroots initiatives in different villages, engaging in everything from primary education to micro-finance. It is a movement driven by a very different agenda to the one behind Xi Jinping\u2019s latest diktat, conceived as \u201ca boost in helping artists form a correct view of art and create more masterpieces\u201d. According to the official Xinhua news agency, China\u2019s media watchdog \u201cwill organise film and TV series production staff on a quarterly basis to go to grassroots communities, villages and mining sites to do field study and experience life\u201d. Scriptwriters, directors, broadcasters and anchors will also be sent to live for at least 30 days \u201cin ethnic minority and border areas, and areas that made major contributions to the country\u2019s victory in the revolutionary war\u201d. Ou is undertaking his own immersive survey of a very different kind. He has spent the last few years visiting a number of \u201cpractical utopias\u201d to get inspiration for his Bishan vision: he has just returned from Copenhagen\u2019s hippy freetown of Christiania, and has visited other intentional communities in New Zealand and Australia. He sprinkles the conversation with a heady mix of precedents \u2013 from the benevolent society described in Peter Kropotkin\u2019s Mutual Aid to the utopian artist collective Neue Slowenische Kunst \u2013 and is critical of a recent visit to an \u201cart village\u201d near Chiang Mai in Thailand, which he thinks doesn\u2019t engage the local people properly.

Or is he just making a playground for him and his urbanite artist friends? \u201cI fear it\u2019s just another form of gentrification,\u201d says Yang Yunzhen, a researcher at University College London who has been studying the impact of the Bishan project over the last year. \u201cThey have introduced a romantic conception of the countryside from their middle-class perspective, in the name of rediscovering the lost traditions of rural life. But they are inadvertently making the \u2018real rural\u2019, which they are striving to preserve, disappear even faster.\u201d She notes that house prices in Bishan have increased dramatically since the inception of the project, from as little as \u00a32,500 to up to \u00a3100,000, and says prices in the bookshop and new cafe are out of reach for most locals. A high-end boutique hotel chain is also on the way, attracted by the success of the Pig\u2019s Inn \u2013 a pair of guesthouses set up in the village by a couple from Shanghai, which already feature in the Lonely Planet guide. Again, the market is clear: room rates range from \u00a380 to \u00a3300 per night. (A room in a basic hotel nearby can be \u00a310-20). The next phase of the Bishan project will see another ancestral hall converted into a museum and events space for the village, while a second cafe is also under construction, using traditional rammed-earth techniques. It is a level of activity that can\u2019t be sustained by Ou and Zuo alone, who have managed to leverage funds from their world of biennales and big-scale exhibitions for the work so far, but hope others will add to the momentum. \u201cIf everything comes from the outside, it feels like an occupation,\u201d says Ou. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to mobilise the villagers to be able to develop a level of economic activity themselves, creating the conditions for guesthouses and restaurants to emerge, without resorting to the ticket model of all the other villages.\u201d     Ou Ning\u2019s Bishan project: reading event with villagers at Bishan bookstore, 2014. Photograph: \u00a0Sun Tao/pr    Most Bishan residents seem cautiously optimistic. \u201cI think only time will tell,\u201d says Wang Shouchang, a 67-year-old farmer who\u2019s spent the last decade compiling a history of the village and now works in the new bookshop. \u201cI support any project that brings our historic buildings back into use and attracts people to the village \u2013 the place has been neglected for far too long.\u201d How Xi\u2019s initiative develops remains to be seen, but many see it as a reactionary move, the latest step in consolidating his iron grip on the country, as the strongest leader since Mao. \u201cHe is under considerable pressure,\u201d Joseph Cheng, professor of political science at the City University of Hong Kong, told AFP. \u201cHis anti-corruption campaign certainly has hurt a lot of vested interests. This is again a time of pressure tactics on the intelligentsia and on the critics.\u201d He says the new edict harks back to the era when popular art was little more than propaganda; but whereas Mao\u2019s cultural revolution was aimed at the entire intelligentsia, the current move is more targeted. \u201cThis campaign is a bit different,\u201d he says, \u201cin the sense that as long as you don\u2019t challenge the authorities, you are safe to keep making money \u2013 as long as you keep quiet.\u201d", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "China", "World news", "Xi Jinping", "Culture", "Architecture"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-02T14:11:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network-outbrain-partner-zone/2014/dec/03/fire-your-copywriter-and-hire-a-journalist", "sentences": ["Because if I need to commission a story on the best dumpling houses in Shanghai I need to find the person who has been to every back alley joint in search of the most perfect dumpling."], "title": "Fire your copywriter and hire a journalist", "article": "One of the things I am sometimes told by marketing managers is that they have a copywriter who writes the company\u2019s content. In the past that person might just have been putting out press releases or doing direct mail, but now they also write blog posts or stories for their website as well. Fair enough. But here\u2019s the thing about copywriters: they\u2019re great at writing copy but they\u2019re not great at writing stories. Journalists and copywriters have a lot in common (I should know \u2013 I am a journalist married to a creative who is technically a copywriter) but they are actually an entirely different species. Journalists ask annoying questions When I was a journalist and editor one of the most effective insults you could deliver was to suggest that a colleague had \u201cinterviewed their typewriter\u201d. Which is to say that they hadn\u2019t interviewed anyone at all. Journalists use reporting to inform their writing \u2013 it\u2019s what gives their stories the telling details that make them authentic \u2013 while copywriters rarely need to leave their desk. Journalists are subject matter experts One of the most important jobs a magazine or newspaper editor does is assigning the right writer to the right story. At Storyation we rarely use writers who don\u2019t have a specialisation. If you\u2019re a writer, it\u2019s not enough to say that you specialise in \u201ctravel\u201d. I want to know if your deep and abiding passion is family travel, luxury travel, wine travel, solo travel or something else besides. Because if I need to commission a story on the best dumpling houses in Shanghai I need to find the person who has been to every back alley joint in search of the most perfect dumpling. Journalists know how to sniff out a story A magazine editor of my acquaintance used to say: \u201cThere are no new ideas in the world.\u201d Think about just about any topic and it\u2019s been done by someone, somewhere. But journalists and editors know how to mine a topic for a new story or angle. An example: career women in their late 30s face a \u201cticking biological clock\u201d. There\u2019s a topic that\u2019s been covered a lot. Yawn. But get a man in his late 30s to write about how he is clucky and struggling to persuade his partner to have children and you have an original angle on well-traversed topic. Journalists are born skeptics This might seem like the last thing you want when you have a product to sell, but putting the needs of your audience first is an inviolate principle of content marketing. If you want to reach an audience that is skipping TV ads, ignoring banner ads and binning direct mail then you need to create content that audiences will find compelling and credible. Journalists have an innate sense of what that is (and won\u2019t be afraid to tell you). A healthy dose of skepticism coupled with an ability to see story ideas through an audience lens can be invaluable. Copywriters, on the other hand, are hired guns schooled in the art of selling and their copy is more like shiny, polished marketing-speak. Which is not to say that every marketing manager should rush out and hire a journalist. Left to their own devices journalists will not necessarily write content that is in keeping with brand values or business objectives. But guided by a good content strategist, a journalist is much more likely to find stories that audiences actually want to hear.

The Thanksgiving effect contributed to a firmer hold in the US. This dollop of The Hunger Games has been frontloaded more than previous ones \u2013 opening simultaneously in close to 90 territories rather than 40-something \u2013 so no surprise either that it is ahead of the last two at the second-weekend mark: $254.6m overseas against $146.1m. What is concerning is that many individual countries are tracking lower than Catching Fire at the same point. Most rich countries grossed lower this weekend, and their overall second-week take also dropped; that\u2019s even happening in some emerging markets, like Russia (Catching Fire, second weekend: $5.4m; Mockingjay: $2.5m).               It\u2019s in less mature markets, like Mexico (Catching Fire: $4.3m; Mockingjay: $4.4m) and Brazil ($2.7m; $3.8m), where affection seems to be building. It\u2019s probably too early \u2013 especially with $480.3m already banked, and given the law of cleft final chapters described last week \u2013 to declare a general cooling-off. But it\u2019s interesting for anyone given to thinking about blockbusters in geopolitical terms that, to adopt Hunger Games parlance, heat for the franchise is now burning strongest outside the Capitol. Laddie marmalade There\u2019s no doubt that StudioCanal\u2019s fondly received Paddington adaptation has got off to a very fine start. Michael Bond\u2019s diminutive bear has nipped between the legs of The Hunger Games for an $8m No 1 in his UK home market, the second best family-film debut in 2014 after The Lego Movie. Paddington\u2019s homeland, Peru, also got the film in its first week, where it did a tidy $405,000 \u2013 less than other kids\u2019 fare there this year, like Mr Peabody and Sherman ($491,000), but higher than Interstellar ($369,000).               Lacking a local tie-in, Paddington didn\u2019t make as much of a splash in the much larger Mexican market, its other inaugural territory, taking little more than $1m. Translated into 30 languages and having sold 30m books, there\u2019s no doubt that the dude in the duffle coat has worldwide appeal \u2013 which is why StudioCanal are releasing their film in 40 countries through to next February. Judging by the UK result and the superior quality, Paddington shouldn\u2019t flinch from believing he can match the mighty worldwide grosses chalked by his predecessors in the mixed live-action/CGI kids\u2019 bracket: The Smurfs (2011, $563.7m), Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007, $361.3m), Stuart Little (1999, $300.1m) and Yogi Bear (2010, $201m). Flightless birds     Rudderless Skipper \u2026 Penguins of Madagascar\u2019s disappointing returns could herald the end for the franchise. Photograph: DreamWorks Animation/AP    Picking up a penguin was not top priority for American audiences this weekend, with Dreamworks\u2019 Madagascar spin-off debuting at a chilly $25.4m ($36m with Thanksgiving takings included) \u2013 despite sheltering under the franchise umbrella and being based on a popular Nickelodeon cartoon. That\u2019s a low for the series, well below the first film\u2019s $47.2m in 2005. Possibly it found itself squeezed between sharper-looking animation Big Hero 6, and the Hunger Games juggernaut, which swept off many of the adults who might otherwise have been attracted by the in-jokey overtures now standard for CGI cartoons (how many kids are going to get a Werner Herzog shoutout?). As emphasised in the trailers, Penguins of Madagascar also follows the global-location itinerary (Venice, Shanghai, New York) demanded of big studio films these days. But it looks unlikely that its real-world passage will leave flames behind it. The early Chinese release ($30m+ and counting) bulks out a sparse-looking initial whip-round ($36.5m overseas this week in 45 territories, compared to Madagascar 3\u2019s $77.2m from 25 in 2012). With plenty left on its rollout \u2013 including the UK this week, where Cumberbatch fever (he voices a covert-ops wolf) should win it fans \u2013 it should make good on a $132m outlay. But the Madagascar series could be running low on juice. Loss leaders              The Horrible Bosses franchise looks an even more conspicuous candidate for collecting its belongings and leaving the building after a shaky start for the sequel. A haul of $15.5m Stateside for director Sean Anders (also co-writer on other current top 10 denizen Dumb and Dumber To) is underwhelming, to put it mildly - nearly half of the first\u2019s $28.3m in 2011. Taking $11.3m from 44 international locales is even more disappointing, with even the best results scraping into the medal places (Russia, $1.8m, No 3; UK, $2m, No 4; Germany, $1.1m, No 4; Mexico, $1.1m, No 3). The strange thing is that the second film is an improvement in some ways \u2013 more coherently plotted, and featuring snappy editing that shows off the souped-up budget (up $8m to $43m). So what\u2019s gone wrong? I\u2019d lay it at the door of Warners\u2019 garbled marketing, which has failed to freshen up the hashtag immediacy of the original film\u2019s premise: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell playing \u201cpsycho\u201d, \u201cmaneater\u201d and \u201ctool\u201d respectively. New bosses Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine \u2013 the venture-capitalist father-and-son duo in charge of the torment this time \u2013 don\u2019t register as succinctly in the sequel. That has trickled down into ineffectual posters and ads that fail to pull the same trick twice: convincing the perpetually online, zero-hours generation currently in their 20s that a comedy starring three men in their late 30s and early 40s is about them. The rest of the world After Johnnie To\u2019s recent Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart 2, yet another metropolitan love triangle landed high in the Chinese charts (and 7th worldwide) in the shape of Women Who Flirt, directed by Pang Ho-cheung, the Hong Kong veteran responsible for 2010\u2019s lauded Love in a Puff. As well as the $11.5m or so it took around Asia, it also enjoyed an $80,000 snifter in the US, despite reviews taking varying degrees of umbrage with its throwback frivolity. Three places below it in the global rankings, with $8m, is The Best, the Lost \u2013 another Chinese film mining another contemporary trope, the halcyon-days 1990s college drama made big business by So Young, which took $114m in 2012.             In top place in France and 14th globally, the ninth Asterix animation, Land of the Gods, opened at $5m, an upwards move for the pigtailed Gallic insurrectionist, here making his first CGI outing, after a $3.4m bow for Asterix and the Vikings in 2006. That still lacks the crucial magic-potion ingredient compared to $20m-ish French debuts for the live-action (and big-budget) Asterix films of recent years. A return of $3.4m for the Korean action comedy Big Match was good for second spot there and 15th in the worldwide list. Lee Jung-jae stars as a mixed martial-arts star forced into a series of real-time hi-tech games in order to save his brother\u2019s life. Who said Hollywood had a monopoly on daft high concepts?  The future Penguins of Madagascar, Horrible Bosses 2 and Paddington all continue their rollouts next week \u2013 the last hoping to prove its mettle on a global stage in the key markets of France, Brazil, Germany and Japan. Ahead of its US opening on 12 December, Ridley Scott\u2019s Moses epic Exodus: Gods and Kings stakes out safe theological ground with early engagements in Catholic countries including Mexico, Spain, Argentina and the Philippines, and also South Korea, whose Christian population is larger than its Buddhist one; Noah followed a similar pattern. Singham star Ajay Devgan leads the line on the $15.3m Indian action comedy Action Jackson, one of Bollywood\u2019s most expensive for 2014 (Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s Happy New Year, at $21m, is reportedly the priciest). Adapted from the Telugu film Dookudu, having seemingly acquired some Kill Bill stylings on the way, Action Jackson is also getting the typical diaspora-oriented overseas release through Eros International. And December blockbuster season began in earnest in China on Tuesday, when the first part of John Woo\u2019s The Crossing pushed off the jetty. Based on the sinking of a Taiwan-bound steamer in 1949, the $49m film has been dubbed the Chinese Titanic. No pressure, then. Top 10 global box office, 28-30 November 1.

The term has come to describe digital visualisations that have the authority of digital photographs, and are often viewed and interpreted as such, but which are actually hybrid images comprised of layers of data from different sources.  This render of Pudong, Shanghai, was produced for the Chinese government, the client of the commercial architectural practice Gensler\u2019s Shanghai Tower. The spiralling building is seen in a state of perfect completion on the right-hand of the skyline, the tallest of a planned trio, but the image was made in 2008, before construction had started. In an age of intense competition between the world\u2019s cities, governments and city authorities have become increasingly focused on presenting an image for global consumption, and this dramatic skyline is the exemplar par excellence, capturing the heady power of capital and the spirit of the city and the nation\u2019s modernisation.  The render plays an important role within this, produced to communicate what the towers would look and feel like in context. In this case, the government did not provide a brief for the production of this specific image, but Gensler \u2013 who market themselves as globally networked facilitators, \u201cleveraging the power of design to create a better world\u201d \u2013 were attuned to their client\u2019s desire to produce a \u201chero shot\u201d, not only aiding visualisation of the tower as a powerful icon within an urban landscape, but also projecting the future success of China.  The image is not entirely futuristic, however. It shows tourists consuming the spectacle of the nascent skyline of Lujiazui, the city\u2019s new financial district, but from a viewing platform on the Bund, the old city, on the point of a bend in the Huangpu river. The authorship of such renders is as ambiguous as their status as visual artefacts. In this case, Gensler outsourced its production to a specialist and well-known international visualisation firm, Crystal CG, which works across sectors such as entertainment, the car industry and real estate, as well as architecture.  Gensler provided them with drawings made in Vectorworks architectural software and a digital photograph to show the viewpoint, the former being superimposed onto the latter. Those working in visualisation companies and their less high profile equivalents \u2013 rendering shops and factories \u2013 might be trained or part-trained as architects, or in computer game design. Renders such as this blur the lines between planned and existing built environments. They circulate widely within development processes, taking the place of photographs and drawings as the main means for architects and their clients to disseminate projected (and completed) buildings via the web, corporate brochures, architectural publications and exhibitions. They reassure clients about what it is they are investing in, and are used to garner allies to help sell and realise large and small-scale projects.

A carpenter by trade, Thompson, then 70, had spent much of his life building infrastructure for the petrochemical industry in his native Texas \u2014 synthetic rubber plants in Port Neches, chemical facilities in Orange. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, he often encountered benzene, stored on job sites in 55-gallon drums, which he used as a cleaning solvent. He dipped hammers and cutters into buckets full of the sweet-smelling liquid; to expunge tar, he soaked gloves and boots in it. Thompson never figured the chemical could do him harm. Not when it stung his hands or turned his skin chalky white. Not even when it made him faint. But after being diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia in 2006, relatives say, he came to believe his exposure to benzene had amounted to a death sentence. Oil and chemical companies knew about the hazard, Thompson felt, but said nothing to him and countless other workers.  \u201cThey put poison on his skin and in the air he breathed,\u201d said Chase Bowers, Thompson\u2019s nephew. \u201cHe died because of it.\u201d     John and Carol Sue Thompson Photograph: Courtesy of Chase Bowers    Thompson died before a lawsuit filed by his family against benzene suppliers could play out in court, where science linking the chemical to cancer could be put on display. Over the past 10 years, however, scores of other lawsuits, most filed by sick and dying workers like Thompson, have uncovered tens of thousands of pages of previously secret documents detailing the petrochemical industry\u2019s campaign to undercut that science. Internal memorandums, emails, letters and meeting minutes obtained by the Center for Public Integrity over the past year suggest that America\u2019s oil and chemical titans, coordinated by their trade association, the American Petroleum Institute, spent at least $36 million on research \u201cdesigned to protect member company interests,\u201d as one 2000 API summary put it. Many of the documents chronicle an unparalleled effort by five major petrochemical companies to finance benzene research in Shanghai, China, where the pollutant persists in workplaces. Others attest to the industry\u2019s longstanding interest in such \u201cconcerns\u201d as childhood leukemia.  The Center for Public Integrity, Columbia University and the City University of New York are making public some 20,000 pages of benzene documents \u2014 the inaugural collection in Exposed: Decades of denial on poisons, an archive of previously secret oil and chemical industry memoranda, emails, letters, presentations and meeting minutes. Hundreds of thousands of additional documents on different chemicals will be added in 2015 and beyond.      Taken together, the documents \u2014 put in context by interviews with dozens of lawyers, scientists, academics, regulators and industry representatives \u2014 depict a \u201cresearch strategy\u201d built on dubious motives, close corporate oversight and painstaking public relations. They comprise an industry playbook to counteract growing evidence of benzene\u2019s toxic effects, which continue to command the attention of federal and state regulators and be fiercely debated in court. \u201cThe conspiracy exists, and the conspiracy involves hiding the true hazards of benzene at low doses,\u201d said Robert Black, a Houston lawyer who represents plaintiffs in toxic tort cases. Since 2004, while handling dozens of lawsuits filed on behalf of workers sickened by leukemia, lymphoma and other diseases associated with benzene, Black has obtained 16,000 pages of internal records detailing the industry\u2019s research tactics, which he shared with the Center. Other lawyers provided an additional 5,000 pages.  The documents may represent the tip of the iceberg. For decades, the petrochemical industry has employed what one litigation guide calls a \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d for defending against workers\u2019 legal claims. Penned by a senior attorney at Shell Oil, the undated document lays out a coordinated \u201cindustry response\u201d aimed at shielding internal company records on benzene. It warns defense attorneys to \u201cavoid unnecessary or inadvertent disclosure of sensitive documents or information,\u201d for instance, and to \u201cdisclose sensitive benzene documents only on court order.\u201d  \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the health effects are because they\u2019re not going to let us know,\u201d Black said. \u201cIt\u2019s an American tragedy.\u201d  Five million Americans at risk Benzene emissions in the United States have declined sharply since 1987, when federal regulators set the occupational exposure limit at 1 part per million. Over roughly the same period, there has been a 66-percent drop in releases of the chemical into the environment. Yet experts say it remains a formidable threat. \u201cYou\u2019re still seeing elevated risks of leukemias and lymphomas among occupational groups exposed to benzene,\u201d said Peter Infante, a former director of the office that reviews health standards at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, who has studied the pollutant for 40 years, \u201cas well as populations being polluted from these benzene sources.\u201d    Benzene facts   In May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that 5 million Americans \u2014 not counting those with workplace exposures \u2014 face heightened cancer risks from benzene and 68 other carcinogens spewed into the air by one such source: the nation\u2019s 149 oil refineries. \u201cWe are concerned about benzene,\u201d said Kelly Rimer of the EPA\u2019s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, which has proposed a rule that would require refinery operators to monitor for the chemical along their fence lines. \u201cIt\u2019s a known human carcinogen,\u201d Rimer said, \u201cand it\u2019s emitted from lots of sectors.\u201d One month later, California officials lowered the long-term exposure level for benzene from 20 parts per billion to 1 ppb \u2014 among the lowest in the country \u2014 setting the stage for further emissions cuts at refineries and bulk-oil terminals in that state. Melanie Marty, of the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, said regulatory limits are now \u201cgetting lower and lower for [benzene\u2019s] non-cancer risks\u201d \u2014 dizziness, rapid heart rate, neurological problems, anemia \u2014 and not just its carcinogenic effects. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re not exposing people to things we can do something about,\u201d she said. A naturally occurring component of crude oil, benzene is used to make household products such as plastics, pesticides and dyes. It remains a key ingredient in gasoline, a source of exposure for workers as well as the public: In 2006, the EPA found benzene to be such a \u201csignificant contributor to cancer risk from all outdoor air toxics\u201d that it limited levels in fuel. Even oil executives acknowledge its ubiquity; in documents, they call it \u201cuniversal\u201d and \u201ca basic petrochemical building block.\u201d Benzene ranks 17th among the top 20 chemicals produced in the United States, according to the federal government. The petrochemical industry\u2019s decade-long research effort on benzene echoes those launched by other industries \u2014 asbestos, tobacco, plastics \u2014 that used science to create doubt. These industries have employed a host of tactics to try to convince courts and regulators that a chemical or product causes no harm. At times, they funded their own studies in an attempt to show the lack of adverse effects. Experts say the petrochemical industry has bankrolled more research \u2014 at greater cost \u2014 than anyone but Big Tobacco, which coined the phrase \u201cmanufacturing doubt.\u201d \u201cThe more they feel threatened by the outcome of independent research, the more they will quote-unquote invest in their own,\u201d said Celeste Monforton, a public health researcher and lecturer at George Washington University, who has written about corporate corruption of science. Monforton considers the petrochemical companies\u2019 study of workers exposed to benzene in Shanghai to be the most expensive and elaborate effort by any industry to try to refute damning scientific evidence. The reason, in her mind, is clear: \u201cLitigation is continuing and potential for environmental exposures is still significant,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to protect their economic interests.\u201d Underwritten by the biggest names in petrochemicals \u2014 British Petroleum, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell Chemical \u2014 and administered by the powerful API lobby, the Shanghai Health Study purported to examine how benzene exposure affects workers\u2019 health. It consisted of three inquiries: The first investigated the link between benzene and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma as well as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML; the second, progression of diseases caused by the chemical; and the third, the exposure level at which such biological markers as lower blood cell counts indicate benzene\u2019s toxicity. But the study\u2019s outcome seemed to some like a foregone conclusion. Documents suggest oil companies set out to counter U.S. government research tying benzene to more types of cancer and at lower exposure levels than previously known. They show how company executives and scientists plotted objectives and \u201cexpected\u201d results before the study began, banking on conclusions that would play down health hazards. \u201cThis is just appalling,\u201d said Carl Cranor, a philosophy professor at University of California, Riverside, who has read some of the Shanghai documents. \u201cThis does not sound like a scientific inquiry where you\u2019re not sure what the outcome will be.\u201d Infante, the former OSHA official, who now testifies for plaintiffs in benzene litigation, put it more bluntly: \u201cIt\u2019s called potential bias.\u201d Study\u2019s authors: No bias Industry representatives and the scientists they paid to do the Shanghai work say such criticism is unwarranted. Some oil executives, they say, may have been seeking an alternative to government research; others may have wanted to better understand benzene\u2019s connection to disease. Whatever the impetus, they argue, scientific integrity was not compromised. \u201cThere could have been the best intentions or the worst intentions,\u201d said Harvey Checkoway, an epidemiology professor at University of California, San Diego, who served on a scientific review panel created by the petrochemical companies to review the study. \u201cWe set that aside for the research.\u201d Richard Irons, one of the study\u2019s two principal investigators and now head of a consulting firm that does research for the petrochemical industry, said that \u201cif you\u2019re ignorant, it\u2019s a logical conclusion\u201d to view the work as biased. \u201cBut it\u2019s an accusation not founded in fact.\u201d Irons acknowledged that he has never testified for a plaintiff in a benzene exposure case. The API has financed his work on benzene since the early 1990s, documents show. Irons said he\u2019s no longer receiving money from the institute but has gotten $100,000 for a small benzene project from the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry\u2019s main lobby group. Defenders of the Shanghai study stress the independence of its design. Scientists, they say, have operated under the guidance of not just the scientific review panel, but of two Chinese government ministries and two university boards, all ensuring a proper inquiry. Many of the results \u2014 positive and negative, they say \u2014 have been published in peer-reviewed journals. \u201cThe results don\u2019t support the presumption of bias,\u201d Irons said, explaining that, so far, the research has confirmed benzene\u2019s association with AML as well as myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, a cancer of the bone marrow. The study\u2019s co-principal investigator, Otto Wong, who directed the work on AML and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, said, \u201cI was interested in doing a cutting-edge study and I was confident I had control over our [portion]. The rest is really not a concern.\u201d Wong acknowledged that he has never testified for a plaintiff in a benzene exposure case. His ties to the oil industry date to the 1970s. Now retired, Wong said he has \u201cno contact with the API people at all.\u201d  Representatives of BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips all declined to comment for this article, referring questions to the API, which did not respond to repeated interview requests. In a one-paragraph statement, Shell said the company\u2019s financial \u201csupport for the study reflects our ongoing commitment to health, safety, and product stewardship,\u201d stressing that \u201cthe study was wholly independent of Shell.\u201d ExxonMobil, whose scientists participated in the Shanghai study, said in a written statement that it \u201csupports scientific research through funding and technical support,\u201d painting its involvement in this project \u2014 as well as a 2012 ExxonMobil-sponsored study of benzene-exposed workers showing adverse health effects at levels below legal occupational limits \u2014 as part of a longstanding corporate commitment to better understanding the chemical. The 2012 results in particular prompted ExxonMobil to \u201cvoluntarily reduce allowable benzene exposure limits to one-half of OSHA legal limits\u201d at its workplaces, it said \u2014 or 0.5 ppm for an eight-hour shift.  By contrast, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends that workers limit their benzene exposure to an average of 0.1 ppm during a shift. \u201cOur conservative approach to setting workplace benzene exposure limits is influenced by the most up-to-date scientific evidence, which includes the 2012 study,\u201d ExxonMobil said, noting that its short-term limit is five times lower than OSHA\u2019s. As the Shanghai findings seep into the scientific literature and, ultimately, the courts, the petrochemical industry generally admits that benzene causes AML and MDS at higher doses. But other blood and bone marrow cancers continue to kill \u2014 at lower and lower exposures to the chemical. On February 27, 2012, Michael Boley, 68, died of a disease Shanghai researchers say can\u2019t be tied to benzene: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, a form of MDS, combined with another bone-marrow condition known as \u201cmyeloproliferative disease.\u201d Strong and industrious, with a knack for avoiding even the flu, Boley spent 23 years at a Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber plant in St. Marys, Ohio, site of a seminal benzene study by NIOSH in the 1970s. The research quantified for the first time the leukemia risk for workers exposed to the chemical in the plant\u2019s Pliofilm unit, prompting OSHA to work on the benzene standard that took effect in 1987.  Boley didn\u2019t make the benzene-soaked rubber film for which the unit was named; rather, he was a plant electrician, supervisor and engineer who worked there for an hour or two daily. Still, he knew benzene was in the air: While in the unit, he noticed \u201cAuthorized Personnel Only\u201d signs for Pliofilm workers who, he testified in a deposition, \u201cwere monitored on a regular basis.\u201d At times, he complained about the unit\u2019s \u201csweeter-than-gasoline\u201d smell. Once, Boley asked a supervisor if he could have the same blood test the company administered to Pliofilm workers. \u201cHis comment was, no, we wouldn\u2019t require monitoring,\u201d Boley testified. \u201cOur levels would be safe.\u201d Four decades later, after enduring the fatigue, feebleness and shortness of breath accompanying a diagnosis of chronic monomyelocytic leukemia, or CMML, Boley sued Goodyear and its benzene suppliers, including ExxonMobil. \u201cHe wanted them to know what had happened to him,\u201d said his widow, Cheryl. But the suit went nowhere: In 2011, Boley settled the litigation in a confidential mediation. His still-pending workers\u2019 compensation claim has seen little traction.     Michael Boley in April, 1994 Photograph: Courtesy of the Boley family    \u201cHe couldn\u2019t prove it,\u201d Cheryl said, alluding to the companies\u2019 claims that benzene couldn\u2019t have caused her husband\u2019s illness. Those claims were supported by Irons and other scientists affiliated with the Shanghai study, who reported in a journal article last year that \u201cbenzene exposure does not appear to be a significant predictor of CMML.\u201d Only safe level \u2018is zero\u2019 The petrochemical industry has known about benzene\u2019s dangers since the turn of the last century. As far back as 1948, the API\u2019s toxicological profile of the chemical discussed \u201creasonably well documented instances of the development of leukemia as a result of chronic benzene exposure,\u201d cautioning that \u201cthe only absolutely safe concentration \u2026 is zero.\u201d Later, as scientific evidence of benzene\u2019s hazards accumulated and regulatory limits on workplace and environmental levels tightened, the industry took a different stance. By 1990, the API and member companies such as BP, Chevron, Mobil and Shell had launched a research program meant to keep further restrictions at bay \u2014 or, minutes from an API meeting in 1992 state, research \u201cthat will be most useful in improving risk assessment and influencing regulation.\u201d    Benzene timeline   Within years, the catalyst for the Shanghai Health Study appeared. In 1995, company representatives turned their attention to work by the National Cancer Institute, which was repeating the Pliofilm study in China to examine the effects on workers exposed to benzene at levels below the OSHA limit. Exxon, which had yet to merge with Mobil, even sent company scientists on a fact-finding visit to interview government researchers. \u201cWe are monitoring the NCI studies,\u201d an Exxon memo explained, \u201cbecause of their potential impact concerning the health risks at low benzene exposures.\u201d In 1997, the NCI published a landmark study on benzene-exposed workers in Shanghai. The results reinforced past research showing the chemical causes leukemia, said Richard Hayes, a former NCI epidemiologist and the study\u2019s lead author, but \u201cwhat moved the science forward\u201d were two findings: That workers with chronic benzene exposures had an increased risk of developing MDS and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \u2014 i.e., diseases other than leukemia \u2014 and that such effects could be triggered by doses of the chemical as low as the OSHA limit. In 2004, the NCI released the results of a second study. It found that Chinese shoe makers inhaling benzene in amounts below the OSHA limit had fewer white blood cells than unexposed workers, suggesting the chemical has no safe threshold.  \u201cIn general,\u201d Hayes said, \u201cwe found benzene was a larger problem than we originally thought.\u201d The industry quickly attacked the NCI\u2019s work. Documents show that the API commissioned a $25,000 \u201ccritical review\u201d of the government research from California epidemiologist Wong. In a 10-page paper, Wong challenged the NCI study from every conceivable angle. \u201cThe findings,\u201d he wrote, \u201care unreliable.\u201d Wong insists today that his corporate funding had no influence on this conclusion. \u201cMy critique of the NCI study was comprehensive and specific,\u201d he said. \u201cI was responsible for every comment.\u201d For the industry, the review had the desired effect: It cast enough doubt on the NCI\u2019s first study to convince the EPA, in 2000, not to rely on the research for estimating benzene\u2019s carcinogenic effects. \u201cWe thought there were methodological issues that might be questionable,\u201d said Bob Sonawane, of the EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development, who has overseen agency assessments of benzene\u2019s health risks. The agency did use the NCI work to assess non-cancer effects in 2002, Sonawane said. By then, industry representatives were already thinking beyond conventional critiques. Wong remembers reaching out to Chinese scientists about a possible benzene study before broaching it to industry contacts. \u201cI knew quite a few people at API and member companies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just started a conversation.\u201d The campaign to finance an alternative study in China was kicked off in earnest in the late 1990s, when the API approached Irons, then a pathology professor at University of Colorado, Boulder. Irons said API officials asked him to visit Shanghai in 1999 and consider doing a study similar to the NCI\u2019s, which examined workers\u2019 diseases and estimated their benzene exposures after the fact and \u201chad some provocative findings.\u201d Irons went to China. Upon his return, he urged the API to instead conduct what he calls \u201ca real-time clinical study,\u201d in which researchers examine workers\u2019 diseases as they occur. Within a year, he, Wong and ExxonMobil scientists had drafted proposals for the Shanghai study, which the API circulated among its members to drum up financing. API representatives went from company to company, giving what amounted to a sales pitch for the Shanghai study. They laid out just what executives might anticipate in return.  A 2001 document listed the following \u201cexpected\u201d results:   Provide strong scientific support for a lack of a risk of leukemia \u2026 at current ambient benzene concentrations to the general population. Establish \u2026 current occupational exposure limits do not create a significant risk. Refute the allegation that Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma can be induced by benzene exposure.   Other documents show that the industry was counting on such findings to combat stringent regulation and stave off \u201ctremendous\u201d costs that would come from having to cut benzene emissions. \u201cSignificant issues of concern\u201d identified in a 2001 PowerPoint include potential requirements to reformulate gasoline and \u201ccontrol emissions from stationary sources.\u201d  Liability also was a worry. Documents warned of \u201clitigation costs due to perceptions about the risks of even very low exposures to benzene\u201d and lawsuits \u201calleging induction of various forms of leukemia and other hematopoietic diseases,\u201d including more commonly diagnosed lymphomas. For some in the industry, the bait proved enticing. \u201cGiven the magnitude of [health, safety and environment] issues surrounding benzene as well as the litigation claims we continue to see, I believe it would be worthwhile to participate,\u201d a Shell executive wrote in an email in 2000, a year before the company and its four counterparts formed the Shanghai study\u2019s official sponsor: the Benzene Health Research Consortium. Later, as consortium members tried to plug an ever-increasing budget gap \u2014 boosting the research\u2019s price tag from $19 million in 2001 to more than $35 million in 2008 \u2014 their argument turned repeatedly to economics. One 2003 script for a CEO-level phone call states, \u201cThis study will positively impact our global business concerns.\u201d Critics say such documents expose the Shanghai study for what it is: An industry attempt to buy scientific evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s all about influencing science to get what industry wants,\u201d said Myron Mehlman, formerly chief toxicologist at Mobil, who became a whistleblower in 1989 after the company fired him for complaining about benzene levels in its gasoline. He sued Mobil, winning a $7 million judgment. Mehlman remembers hearing about the Shanghai study in 2005 and immediately firing off letters to 45 executives at sponsoring companies. \u201cI knew the scientists would do whatever it takes and whatever the industry needs done,\u201d he said. In response, he said, he got a consortium form letter that \u201cjust re-confirmed how the study is being done for a single purpose \u2014 to get desirable outcomes.\u201d Industry-funded researchers bristle at the science-for-sale accusations. \u201cI didn\u2019t see refuting anything as my charge,\u201d said Irons, the study\u2019s co-principal investigator, \u201cand I wouldn\u2019t have responded favorably to that.\u201d In depositions, however, Irons conceded that oil companies had a vested interest in the project. \u201cThe oil companies \u2026 expected \u2026 it would be used for regulation, litigation, and for understanding the health effects of benzene,\u201d he testified in 2010, adding that he didn\u2019t believe a \u201cfunding source or the amount of money necessarily impacts on the [study\u2019s] objectivity.\u201d Wong sounds a similar note. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what the results were before the study began,\u201d he said, claiming he wasn\u2019t privy to \u201cany discussion\u201d among the sponsoring companies. He considers it \u201cjust unthinkable\u201d that critics would suggest \u201call those outside scientists, together with us, tried to create some results.\u201d Noting that the study relied on actual cases from 29 Shanghai hospitals, Wong explained, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to argue that we have influenced our data one way or another.\u201d Members of the Shanghai study\u2019s scientific review panel echo this sentiment. They saw no signs of overt bias in the design, they say, no way to yield preconceived results. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my experience,\u201d said John Cherrie, a former panelist now heading occupational health research at a British nonprofit that has worked for the petrochemical industry. \u201cThe studies were designed to investigate the true situation without any obvious bias.\u201d  Some would-be funders weren\u2019t so sure, documents show. In 2002, consortium members landed a meeting with seven scientists from Dow Chemical Company to pitch the Shanghai study. The meeting came after the scientists had voiced what one described as \u201cspecific technical concerns\u201d about its design. Dow eventually opted not to contribute. In a deposition two years later, Dow\u2019s head of epidemiology, James Collins, testified that the company feared the study could generate inaccurate risk estimates and thus \u201cbe biased.\u201d \u2018Independent\u2019 review panels Documents suggest the Shanghai study\u2019s sponsors were keenly aware of such perceptions. To deflect criticism, they set up \u201cindependent\u201d review panels consisting of 10 ethicists and scientists, reputable leaders in fields like epidemiology, clinical medicine and bio-statistics. By 2001, panelists were meeting investigators and reviewing protocols \u2014 \u201cessentially quality control,\u201d said Jerry Rice, who chaired the scientific panel. Advisory in nature, the boards have remained involved in nearly every aspect of research. Industry representatives viewed the boards as essential for lending credibility to the study. \u201cThere are going to be people out there who will want to misinterpret and criticize the study,\u201d one argued in a 2003 email. \u201cIt is important that \u2018the integrity\u2019 \u2026 be maintained\u201d with the panels. Panelists insist the boards weren\u2019t simply for show. They say industry representatives routinely encouraged them to offer criticisms and recommendations, and they obliged. Documents show investigators incorporated so many panel suggestions that research costs soared $3 million in one year alone. \u201cI never felt there was any desire to muzzle or tone down criticism,\u201d said Rice, formerly with the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer, who oversaw the agency\u2019s evaluations of chemicals for carcinogenic risks from 1996 to 2002. At IARC, Rice had come to know oil industry executives, who recruited him for the panel. . \u201cIf there had been any of that, we\u2019d have all quit.\u201d Still, company executives maintained tight control over the study. Documents indicate the consortium operated like a corporation, replete with committees governing research, finances and communications. Once a year, it hosted a meeting of 50 or so participants, flying American and Chinese scientists as well as review panelists to a two-day retreat to discuss the work as executives observed. Twice a year, consortium members combed through detailed progress reports filed by investigators. The consortium also required industry review of draft manuscripts until 2005, when Irons penned his first. In it, Irons announced preliminary results linking a previously unrecognized form of myelodysplastic syndrome -- MDS -- to benzene exposure. The draft set off debate within ExxonMobil and Shell, both of which alerted the EPA \u2014 as the law required \u2014 to what was vaguely described in a consortium email as \u201chealth findings reported in a draft publication.\u201d  At the time, Irons expressed reservations over the manuscript-review requirement. Consortium members dropped it but kept the review boards. For years, panelists kept circulating \u201cready-for-submission manuscripts\u201d for \u201cfeedback,\u201d documents show. Consortium members have worked especially hard on controlling their message. Before the Shanghai study began, the communications committee was crafting its marketing strategy. Documents reveal reams of \u201cif asked\u201d statements and media-relations plans, listing objectives such as \u201ccounter activists\u2019 negativity.\u201d Among the committee\u2019s tasks, according to a 2001 email:  perception needs to be that this is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; being done to protect against litigation use a consulting attorney to address these issues of perceived motivation  Consortium sales pitches to prospective contributors, expressed in recruitment briefs, \u201ccall sheets\u201d and \u201cadaptable\u201d slideshows, epitomize this corporate spin. Publicly, members have claimed altruistic motives for backing the Shanghai study. During a presentation in 2002 at PetroChina, a Chinese oil firm targeted for sponsorship, one Shell scientist proclaimed, according to a company email, \u201cWe believe it is important to understand the hazards of the products we make and sell, and we believe it is the right thing to do!\u201d Privately, consortium members betrayed less charitable motives. A draft of a 2002 recruitment brief reminded potential sponsors that \u201cthere is continued concern with the potential health effects of benzene as it relates to worker exposure \u2026 and personal injury claims.\u201d In response, a Shell executive urged colleagues to \u201cdelet[e] the reference to legal liabilities\u201d and emphasized that \u201cthe only reason we are doing this is in support of protecting workers.\u201d Widows like Carolyn Wright have trouble processing such statements. Her husband, Eric, was a consummate company man whose closets brimmed with Shell awards, buckles, hats and magnets. Wright spent 34 years, from 1976 to 2010, working on offshore vessels for five oil companies \u2014 18 at Shell. A trained \u201cgun shooter,\u201d he repaired sonar equipment, breaking down air guns. He soaked parts in benzene-laced solvents in a diesel-engine room, breathing in the chemical at exposures estimated to be two to five times greater than the legal limit.     Eric Wright guiding a seismic streamer cable in 1976, his first of 34 years working on offshore rigs Photograph: Courtesy of the Wright family    Wright died, at 63, of leukemia in 2010, exactly five months after receiving an MDS diagnosis. Most of that time he remained hospitalized, beset by body sores, eye infections and a failing gall bladder. Within weeks, he couldn\u2019t feed or bathe himself; eventually, he couldn\u2019t hold up his head. Carolyn remembers leaving her husband\u2019s bedside twice \u2014 first, to get clothes and then to visit a funeral home. \u201cThey took away my best friend,\u201d she said, referring to Shell and eight other petrochemical companies she and her husband sued 14 days before his death. \u201cThey were responsible because they made the benzene.\u201d She settled the case for an undisclosed amount, most of which went toward her husband\u2019s outstanding medical bills and legal fees. Shell admitted no liability. \u201cI\u2019d rather have my husband,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cThere is not another one like him.\u201d Seeding the literature The petrochemical industry\u2019s research strategy had another key component: publication. Oil and chemical companies have long seeded the scientific literature, paying consultants to publish in peer-reviewed journals. They often use the published articles to advance their positions in regulatory and legal arenas. Infante, the former OSHA official, considers benzene \u201ca good example of how the general scientific literature is being polluted by people working for industry.\u201d A 2002 Shell summary of the Shanghai project defined a \u201cKey Measure/Indicator of Success\u201d as a \u201cCost effective study reported in public literature \u2026 [that would] support \u2026 advocacy.\u201d By the time the research consortium disbanded in 2009, Irons and his colleagues had released results in 20 journal articles as well as at an \u201cinternational benzene symposium,\u201d in Germany. Industry-funded scientists have added to the literature since; according to Irons, the consortium\u2019s dollars have yielded a total of 30 papers. Such publications can play a critical role in benzene litigation. The Shanghai study has helped companies deny liability by casting doubt on causation, the central issue in a toxic-tort lawsuit. One tactic the industry has employed \u2014 with aid from the study \u2014 is to separate cancers into subsets, making it harder to prove a specific link between benzene and the disease. David Eastmond, a toxicology professor at University of California, Riverside, said that the petrochemical industry \u201cgets sued on a fairly regular basis\u201d over \u201ca wide range of diseases.\u201d  \u201cIf [it] could narrow down which subtypes are caused by benzene,\u201d he explained, \u201cthe industry could eliminate a number of lawsuits.\u201d  Industry-funded Shanghai researchers found that only certain subtypes of MDS and AML are significantly linked to benzene. Now, in claims involving auto mechanics, gas station attendants and printers, plaintiff\u2019s lawyers are seeing this claim play out in court. There is the case, for example, of a contract worker for southeast Texas refineries and chemical plants who washed his tools in benzene and later developed MDS. Citing a 2009 article by Irons, defense lawyers argued that the worker didn\u2019t have the subtype of MDS associated with benzene exposure. The worker\u2019s family resolved the case under terms that remain confidential. In another case, a refinery technician who used benzene in laboratory experiments developed the very MDS subtype the 2009 article tied to the chemical. In testimony, however, defense experts used the Shanghai research not to affirm this link, but rather to debate whether his MDS was, in fact, properly diagnosed. The case settled in 2010 as part of a confidential agreement. Some find such defenses scientifically disingenuous. Hayes, the former NCI scientist, who is now head of epidemiology at New York University\u2019s medical school, explained that scientists cannot eliminate a disease subtype simply because a study doesn\u2019t show an association with benzene exposure. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t any effect,\u201d he said. \u201cThe end result is to sow the seeds of doubt.\u201d Wong said that all he and his fellow researchers can do is report their findings \u2014 positive and negative. \u201cI\u2019m sure some people use the results in their own way,\u201d he said, referring to defense lawyers. \u201cI can\u2019t really speak to that.\u201d Acknowledging that \u201cno study can prove a negative,\u201d Irons defends the Shanghai research as \u201cthe best available evidence\u201d benzene causes only certain disease subtypes. That \u201cdoesn\u2019t reduce the fact that benzene is associated with MDS,\u201d he said \u2014 or, for that matter, AML. And ultimately, some say, these findings aren\u2019t as conclusive as oil executives may have wanted. \u201cIn terms of something that would once and forever cause the petroleum industry\u2019s legal liability problems to go away,\u201d said review panelist Rice, \u201cit didn\u2019t do that.\u201d  In fact, some outcomes have hurt defendants in court. In 2004, after 30 years fixing refrigerators at ice-skating rinks and meat-packing plants \u2014 receiving a daily dose of petroleum-based products \u2014 Brian Milward developed a rare condition known as acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL. At the time, he was 47 years old. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out you have cancer at that age because of somebody else\u2019s wrongdoing,\u201d Milward said, explaining he had no idea the solvents and paints he used to clean and seal pipes contained benzene until after he was diagnosed.     Brian Milward with his granddaughter while Milward was receiving chemotheropy treatment Photograph: Courtesy of Brian Milward    In 2007, he filed suit against Rustoleum Paints and 20 other manufacturers, whose experts argued no epidemiological studies show a link between benzene and APL. Experts hired by Milward countered that evidence linking benzene to AML essentially links it to all subtypes, including APL. The judge disagreed, ruling for the defendants. But the debate has stymied the case, fueling appeals on both sides, and sparking a brief signed by 27 preeminent scientists affirming benzene can cause any leukemia. Meanwhile, the Shanghai study affirmed the very link Milward\u2019s lawyers tried to draw. In a 2010 article confirming benzene\u2019s tie to \u201can increased risk of AML,\u201d Wong discussed the relationship by disease subtype. APL was the \u201cmost strongly related\u201d to benzene exposure, he wrote. While the ruling against Milward eventually was struck down, he has yet to appear before a jury. After settling with every defendant but Rustoleum, he has watched the company challenge the science again. This time, defense experts question whether his workplace exposures could have caused his cancer. A second appeal is pending. Now in remission, Milward must grapple with cancer\u2019s lasting effects. Nearly a decade of chemotherapy, along with diabetes and a rare bowel disorder, have left him battling what he calls \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d fatigue. Retired and on disability, he remembers returning to work twice. First, he resorted to napping to endure an eight-hour shift. When his boss assigned him to office duty, pushing paper and making calls, he still fell asleep at his desk.  \u201cI can\u2019t really do anything,\u201d said Milward, 57 \u2014 at least, not what he loves: repairing race cars, working in his yard, playing with his grandchildren. \u201cIt just sucks when you get a cancer like this.\u201d \u2018He never complained\u2019 To family and friends in Deweyville, Texas, a pine-shaded town along the Louisiana border, John Thompson was \u201cJohn\u201d \u2014 a life-long resident, church deacon and carpentry teacher who reinforced souls as much as structures. To Irons, the Shanghai study investigator who charged $600 per hour as an expert witness, he was \u201cJohn H. Thompson\u201d \u2014 deceased, one of three case referrals from a corporate-defense firm, all in lawsuits alleging cancers caused by benzene. Thompson had built scaffolding for refineries and chemical plants in the 1960s and early \u201870s. At the end of most workdays, he\u2019d be covered in a thick adhesive known as mastic and would use pure benzene to get it off his hands, clothes and tools. In 2010, three months after Thompson\u2019s death, Irons flew to Houston from China to testify in the benzene litigation, armed with what he has called \u201cthe largest single study of AML in history\u201d \u2014the Shanghai study. In a deposition, the scientist touted the research, saying it \u201cinform[ed] with respect to disease specificity to a much greater degree than other previous epidemiological studies.\u201d \u201cAssumptions and presumptions,\u201d Irons testified, \u201chave to be modified and re-assessed.\u201d The comment proved prescient in Thompson\u2019s case. In 2006, the former contract worker was mowing his lawn when he mentioned feeling fatigued. A pillar of a man, Thompson, then 66, had gotten two heart stents without uttering a gripe. \u201cHe never complained,\u201d said Chase Bowers, his nephew. Not when he broke both arms on an oil rig, or lost his left eye in a shop accident. Bowers, who, as a teenager, was raised by Thompson and his wife, Carol, remembers watching a tree branch rip open his uncle\u2019s ear. One emergency-room visit and Thompson returned to work. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of guy he was,\u201d Bowers said. Within days of the lawn-mowing episode, Thompson learned he had acquired AML \u2014 specifically, a subtype of AML known as \u201cinversion 16.\u201d In the contentious world of toxic-tort litigation, Thompson\u2019s case seems like a classic: The only leukemia the petrochemical industry has admitted benzene can cause is AML \u2014 especially at higher doses. According to the Shell benzene-litigation defense guide, the industry might have classified Thompson\u2019s case as \u201chigh risk\u201d: He not only suffered from AML, but, as the guide states, \u201cpure benzene is involved,\u201d and his \u201cexposure took place prior to OSHA involvement.\u201d Experts hired by the family estimated Thompson\u2019s cumulative benzene exposures were five times greater than the legal limit. At trial, however, the case turned out to be anything but a slam dunk. Citing the Shanghai study, Irons worked to debunk a link between benzene and the type of AML afflicting Thompson. The Shanghai research has shown approximately two of the 20 AML subtypes are significantly associated with the chemical, he testified \u2014 neither of them \u201cinversion 16.\u201d \u201cWe found many cases of inversion 16,\u201d Irons said in court. \u201cWe did not find an association between benzene exposure and inversion 16.\u201d Other scientists disagree, arguing that if benzene causes one subtype of AML, it likely causes all of them. Keith Hyde, a Beaumont, Texas, lawyer who represents plaintiffs in toxic-tort cases, including the Thompsons, remembers Irons highlighting one Shanghai article after another at trial, raising doubt. \u201cYou have doubt here and there through all these industry studies,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say they do their job.\u201d After two weeks of testimony, the Thompson case ended in mistrial. The suit ultimately was resolved under terms that remain confidential. In April, Carol, Thompson\u2019s widow, died of liver cancer. In the years after the benzene trial, she rarely mentioned the ordeal \u2014 too many painful memories. She had to relive her husband\u2019s death daily in court, watching videos and hearing testimony on his decline. \u201cIt was devastating for my aunt,\u201d Bowers said. In his view, she never understood the extent to which oil and chemical companies hid benzene\u2019s hazards and tried to spin the science.  \u201cThere\u2019s obvious vested interest here,\u201d Bowers said of the Shanghai study. \u201cIf oil companies are willing to spend $36 million to fund research, how much are they afraid of losing?\u201d Ashley Schwartz contributed to this story", "tags": ["Energy", "Texas", "Oil", "Fossil fuels", "Oil and gas companies", "Energy industry"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-04T12:00:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/07/penguins-of-madagascar-review-john-malkovich-werner-herzog", "sentences": ["Zipping randomly from Antarctica to Venice, Shanghai and America, the familiar crew (Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, Private) forge an uneasy alliance with the animal forces of the \u201cNorth Wind\u201d to defeat the villainous \u201cDave\u201d (aka Dr Octavius Brine \u2013John Malkovich clearly enjoying himself)."], "title": "Penguins of Madagascar review \u2013 an oddly entertaining animated romp", "article": "This spin-off from the blockbusting Madagascar franchise opens with a brilliantly mischievous voice cameo by Werner Herzog, spoofing his own \u201cinto the abyss\u201d narrations from documentaries such as Encounters at the End of the World.

Jill was escorting her son Jarrett, then 4, to the doctor again. He had spent the day slumped in a stroller, looking so pale and fatigued that a stranger stopped her to ask if he was all right. It was an encounter Jill couldn\u2019t shake. For the previous three months, she had noticed her once-energetic preschooler deteriorating. He complained of pain in his knee, which grew excruciating. It migrated to his shoulder and then his leg. His shins swelled, as did his temples. At night, Jarrett awoke drenched in sweat, screaming from spasms. Jill took him to a pediatrician and an infectious-disease specialist. A rheumatologist diagnosed him with anemia. Now, as Jarrett lay listless, Jill found herself back at the pediatrician\u2019s office. Tests confirmed a blood count so low that she was instructed to get him to an emergency room immediately. Within hours she was at a hospital in Atlanta, some 65 miles from her home in Athens, watching nurses rush in and out of Jarrett\u2019s room. Doctors identified a common form of childhood leukemia. \u201cI heard the words,\u201d Jill recalled, \u201cand I only knew the bald heads and the sadness.\u201d In the waiting room, family members heard more unsettling news: A neighbor\u2019s child also had developed leukemia. Days later, Jarrett\u2019s doctor penned a letter to federal environmental regulators about the two cancer patients, highlighting their \u201cclose proximity\u201d to Southeast Terminals, a group of 10,000-gallon tanks containing gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. \u201cCould you please investigate,\u201d the doctor wrote, \u201cwhether high levels of chemicals could have contaminated the water, possibly contributing \u2026 to the development of leukemia?\u201d Only then did the McElheneys consider the possibility that living beside one of the nation\u2019s 1,500 bulk-oil terminals \u2013 known sources of cancer-causing benzene \u2013 had triggered their son\u2019s leukemia. \u201cIt was one of those light-bulb moments for us,\u201d said Jeff McElheney, Jarrett\u2019s father. \u201cYou never get over it.\u201d New battlefront for industry Jarrett McElheney does not represent the standard benzene plaintiff. He\u2019s not among the hundreds of thousands of people who toil in American oil refineries or other workplaces contaminated with the chemical and run the risk of developing leukemia. In the rancorous world of toxic-tort litigation, he stands virtually alone. A lawsuit filed by his parents in 2011 against Southeast Terminals owners BP and TransMontaigne is among a relatively few alleging leukemia caused by environmental benzene exposure. Among these, the McElheney case is rarer still: most have hinged on adult leukemia. Yet the case may signal an emerging quandary for the petrochemical industry, according to tens of thousands of pages of previously secret documents that have come to light in lawsuits filed against benzene manufacturers and suppliers on behalf of those who suffered from leukemia and other blood diseases, including Jarrett McElheney. Internal memorandums, emails, letters and meeting minutes obtained by the Center for Public Integrity over the past year suggest that BP and four other major petrochemical companies, coordinated by their trade association, the American Petroleum Institute, spent at least $36m on research \u201cdesigned to protect member company interests\u201d, as one 2000 API summary put it. Many of the documents chronicle a systematic attempt by the petrochemical industry to influence the science linking benzene to cancer. Others attest to the industry\u2019s longstanding interest in topics such as childhood leukemia. \u201cA number of publications in the last few years have attempted to link increased risks of childhood leukemia with proximity to both petroleum facilities and local traffic density,\u201d another 2000 API memo warns. \u201cAlthough these publications have had little impact to date, the emphasis on \u2018Children\u2019s Health\u2019 may cause these concerns to resurface.\u201d \u201cThis is indeed a battlefront for the oil industry,\u201d said Peter Infante, a former director of the office that reviews health standards at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, who has studied benzene for 40 years and now testifies for plaintiffs in benzene litigation. He has worked on a handful of cases involving children sickened by leukemia. \u201cIt\u2019s in the industry\u2019s economic interests to refuse to acknowledge the relationship between benzene and childhood leukemia,\u201d Infante said. In May, in a sign of the chemical\u2019s continuing threat, the US Environmental Protection Agency estimated that 5 million Americans \u2013 not counting those with workplace exposures \u2013 face heightened cancer risks from benzene and 68 other carcinogens spewed into the air by the nation\u2019s 149 oil refineries. The EPA has proposed a rule that would require refinery operators to monitor for benzene, in particular, along their fence lines. Aimed at curbing \u201cfugitive\u201d emissions from equipment leaks and similar releases, the proposal would set a fence line limit for benzene of three parts per billion \u2013 a fraction of the 10ppb the agency recommends as the maximum chronic exposure level for the chemical.     It\u2019s in the industry\u2019s interests to refuse to acknowledge the relationship between benzene and childhood leukemia  Peter Infante     Industry groups are pushing back. In written comments, the API\u2019s Matthew Todd called the proposal \u201ca major and significant Agency action [that] will dramatically increase the paperwork and recordkeeping burden on refineries. It includes several precedent-setting proposals, will cost our industry hundreds of millions of dollars per year, increase safety risk [and] may impact fuels production and cost \u2026 Production outages will likely occur.\u201d The EPA also heard from the people the rule is designed to protect. \u201cWe live near a refinery, and as a result my son can\u2019t breathe,\u201d a woman from Fontana, California, wrote in Spanish. \u201cMy cousin had respiratory problems while living near a refinery for more than 10 years,\u201d a woman from Houston wrote, also in Spanish. \u201cUnfortunately, he died two years ago from bone cancer. We believe this was a result of the ambient air where he lived.\u201d In June, California officials lowered the long-term exposure level for benzene from 20ppb to 1ppb \u2013 among the lowest in the country \u2013 setting the stage for further emissions cuts at refineries and bulk-oil terminals in that state. Officials say such regulatory actions aim to protect children, who are more susceptible to benzene\u2019s toxic effects than adults because their cells aren\u2019t as developed. California is considering classifying benzene not just as a human carcinogen, but as a \u201ctoxic air contaminant which may disproportionately impact children\u201d. \u201cThe fact that benzene impacts the blood-forming organs when you\u2019re a developing child is a big deal,\u201d said Melanie Marty of the state\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.  Hidden menace Jill McElheney agrees. A warm, garrulous mother of five who has schooled herself in the health effects of pollution, she has spent the past 16 years seeking the cause of her son\u2019s leukemia. She has filed open-records requests and contacted state and federal agencies, piecing together a history of gasoline spills and diesel-fuel leaks at Southeast Terminals. She can cite endless details about lingering benzene contamination on terminal property \u2013 extensively catalogued in state enforcement files \u2013 located \u201ca stone\u2019s throw away\u201d from the trailer park where her family lived for seven years. Now vacant and overgrown with brush, the former site of the Oakwood Mobile Home Park lies across a residential street from Southeast Terminals, its tanks rising above a thicket of pines and oaks. All day, every day, trucks drive in and out of the facility\u2019s gates, filling tankers with gasoline and other products. What can\u2019t be seen is the plume of benzene that has worked its way into the groundwater beneath the tanks. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Cancer Alley, with smokestacks belching crap in your face,\u201d Jill said. \u201cIt\u2019s hidden \u2013 literally.\u201d     Jeff, Jarrett and Jill McElheney stand in the former site of the Oakwood Mobile Home Park, where the family was living when Jarrett was diagnosed with a form of childhood leukemia. Photograph: Phil Skinner /Center for Public Integrity    When she and Jeff moved to Oakwood in 1992, they saw the 14-trailer community as something of an oasis \u2013 quiet, tight-knit. Nestled under shady trees, near churches and schools, it seemed like the perfect location. Even the park\u2019s water supply, drawn from an unpermitted well dating back decades, appeared idyllic: its pump house served as a beacon on park property, visible for all to see \u2013 including, court depositions later confirmed, terminal employees. \u201cWe saw Oakwood as an opportunity,\u201d recalled Jeff, a mustachioed, genial man who operates a roofing company and managed the park for his father, its previous owner. Jarrett arrived two years later and, by his fourth birthday, had grown into an adventurous boy with an abiding love of water. His parents remember him splashing in the tub for hours. Often, he swam in an inflatable pool in their yard, dressed in what he called his \u201clittle blue [wet] suit\u201d. He slurped on Kool Aid and popsicles made from well water whose purity his parents never questioned \u2013 until his 1998 diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, a form of the blood cancer found overwhelmingly in children. Within days of hearing the news, Jarrett\u2019s parents tested their water. Samples from the Oakwood well revealed a brew of such chemicals as carbon tetrachloride and 1,2-dichloroethane, sparking a state investigation. The Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) found benzene in the water of Oakwood\u2019s well at levels up to 13ppb \u2013 26 times higher than the federal safety standard. In response, the agency shuttered the well and connected residents to public water. Over the next year, state geologists worked to identify the contamination\u2019s source. They dug monitoring wells and collected soil samples. Their initial investigation linked at least one pollutant in the park well \u2013 not benzene \u2013 to nearby abandoned grain silos. Geologists eventually eyed Southeast Terminals as a likely source of the benzene contamination, records show. \u201cThe terminals are certainly suspects for the benzene detected in the [Oakwood] well,\u201d one posited in a 2000 email. \u201cThe probable path is deep ground water.\u201d Another noted the presence of \u201ca possible plume (with benzene) moving by Oakwood \u2026 and within a few hundred feet of the [park]\u2019s former well, [thus] too close for comfort for a public-water supply well.\u201d    It just seems to me that when you\u2019ve got benzene in a well and a major source of it next door, you\u2019d make the connection  Jill McElheney     Two years later, EPD investigators were still documenting high levels of benzene, ranging from 8,000 to 12,000 ppb, on terminal property \u2013 as well as the likelihood that, one 2002 EPD memorandum states, \u201cthe benzene contamination found in the trailer park well came from the Southeast Terminals\u201d. Ultimately, though, the state\u2019s two-year, nearly $200,000 investigation yielded few answers. By 2008, groundwater monitoring results revealed only trace amounts of benzene at Oakwood. Today, EPD officials say they lack definitive proof tying the well\u2019s benzene pollution to any source. For Jill McElheney, the outcome of the inquiry was anything but satisfying. \u201cIt just seems to me that when you\u2019ve got benzene in a well and a major source of it next door, you\u2019d make the connection,\u201d she said.  In fact, Jill already had been seeking answers elsewhere. In 2000, she turned to the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, or ATSDR, petitioning it for a public health assessment. Instead, the agency launched a less-thorough public health consultation, meant to ascertain the risk to human health posed by the contaminated well water at Oakwood. The results brought little clarity. In a 2001 report, the ATSDR determined that \u201cthe groundwater contaminant plume\u201d initially sampled in the Oakwood well \u201cis a public health hazard\u201d. At the same time, it singled out a pollutant other than benzene as the threat. For benzene, the agency found that \u201cthe likelihood someone would get cancer as a result of their exposure is very low\u201d. In a 2000 draft filed with the state, however, the ATSDR concluded that the highest concentrations of benzene in the water were of concern. \u201cThis risk DOES exceed an acceptable risk level,\u201d the draft states, \u201cand may result in an elevated risk of cancer for exposed individuals.\u201d An ASTDR spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. Mounting evidence on benzene and leukemia The science linking benzene to cancer \u2013 particularly leukemia, in all its forms \u2013 has preoccupied the petrochemical industry for more than half a century. As far back as 1948, the API\u2019s toxicological profile of the chemical discussed \u201creasonably well documented instances of the development of leukemia as a result of chronic benzene exposure\u201d, cautioning that \u201cthe only absolutely safe concentration \u2026 is zero\u201d. Later, as scientific evidence of benzene\u2019s hazards accumulated and regulatory limits on workplace and environmental levels tightened, the industry took a different stance. By 1990, the API and member companies such as BP, Chevron, Mobil and Shell had launched a research program meant to keep further restrictions at bay \u2013 or, minutes from an API meeting in 1992 state, research \u201cthat will be most useful in improving risk assessment and influencing regulation\u201d. Within months, the API task force overseeing the program was enumerating \u201cdeveloping issues\u201d. Topping its list, according to minutes from a meeting in 1993, was this notation: \u201clink to childhood leukemia?\u201d That possible link appeared on the industry\u2019s radar again in 2000, documents show. At the time, API representatives were drumming up financial support for an unparalleled study of workers exposed to benzene in Shanghai, China, delivering what amounted to a sales pitch for the project. They touted what one 2000 API overview described as its \u201ctremendous economic benefit to the petroleum industry\u201d \u2013 helping to combat \u201conerous regulations\u201d and \u201clitigation costs due to perceptions about the risks of even very low exposures to benzene\u201d. Childhood leukemia was mentioned explicitly. Five years later, industry representatives grew concerned enough to bankroll their own research. Documents show the API task force approved funding for what minutes of one meeting in 2005 dubbed a \u201cbenzene regulatory response\u201d, comprising a \u201cchildhood leukemia review\u201d and \u201cchild-to-adult sensitivity to benzene\u201d analysis, for a total of $30,000. By then, the scientific evidence on benzene and leukemia in adults was well-established. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, studies of Italian shoe and leather workers indicated a relationship between the chemical and the cancer. Then, in 1977, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a seminal study of two Goodyear plants in Ohio that made Pliofilm, a thin rubber wrap. The research quantified for the first time the leukemia risk for workers exposed to benzene, prompting OSHA to work on a stricter standard that took effect in 1987. In years since, the science has solidified. Recent research has shown lower and lower levels of the chemical \u2013 less than the OSHA limit of one part per million \u2013 can cause leukemia as well as other blood and bone marrow disorders.     Jarrett McElheney, center, with three of his four siblings. Photograph: Courtesy of the McElheney family    By contrast, experts say, the research on benzene and childhood leukemia isn\u2019t as conclusive. Multiple studies have indicated that children whose mothers were exposed to benzene-containing solvents during pregnancy experience elevated risks of developing the disease. Others have shown that children living near gas stations or highways \u2013 breathing in benzene in the air \u2013 face heightened risks. One 2008 study reported a significant spike in the rate of the disease in Houston neighborhoods with the highest benzene emissions. Taken together, the nearly four-dozen publications on the topic strongly suggest the carcinogen can cause leukemia as much in children as adults, experts say. \u201cChildren aren\u2019t another species,\u201d said Infante, the former OSHA official who has reviewed the scientific literature for medical associations and governmental agencies. \u201cIf benzene causes leukemia in adults, why wouldn\u2019t it cause leukemia in children?\u201d The scientist behind the API-commissioned analysis would likely disagree. In 2009, David Pyatt, a Colorado toxicologist with long-standing ties to the petrochemical industry, published a journal article about his review, in which he reported examining 236 studies on the relationship between benzene and childhood leukemia. Many of the studies suggesting a link \u201csuffer from the same limitations\u201d, he concluded, such as poorly quantified exposure estimates.    Children aren\u2019t another species. If benzene causes leukemia in adults, why wouldn\u2019t it cause leukemia in children?  Peter Infante     \u201cAt this point,\u201d Pyatt wrote, \u201cthere is insufficient epidemiologic support for an association or causal connection between environmental benzene exposure \u2026 and the development of childhood [leukemia].\u201d Some say the review reflects a common industry tactic: compile studies on a subject, and then shed doubt on each one by claiming the data aren\u2019t good enough. Pyatt did not respond to repeated emails and phone calls from the Center seeking comment; nor did the API. In depositions, Pyatt acknowledged that he has never testified for a plaintiff in a benzene exposure case. He has worked as a consultant and defense expert for such petrochemical giants as BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell, he has said; the API has financed additional work of his on benzene, as has the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry\u2019s main lobby. In a deposition taken last year, Pyatt said he wouldn\u2019t discount benzene\u2019s link to childhood leukemia \u2013 at least, not to acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, a type rarely found in children. \u201cThere is no reason to think that [children] are going to be protected,\u201d he testified. \u201cSo I would certainly think that a child can develop AML if they are exposed to enough benzene.\u201d In other depositions, Pyatt has conceded no link between benzene and ALL, the type that attacked Jarrett McElheney. \u2018They have to stop this practice\u2019 For the McElheneys, the extent of the benzene contamination from Southeast Terminals only came to light years after Jarrett\u2019s chemotherapy regimen had beaten back his leukemia. Yet state and federal enforcement records pinpoint on-site releases of the chemical in 1991, a year before the family moved to the area. At the time, managers of the terminal \u2013 jointly owned and operated by BP and Unocal \u2013 discovered a leak of diesel fuel seeping through soil where an underground pipeline was buried. Terminal employees removed 40 cubic yards of \u201cpetroleum contaminated soils\u201d, according to a report filed by BP with the state, and recorded benzene on site at levels as high as 81ppb. Groundwater samples showed even higher concentrations: 12,000ppb. State regulators found such pollution \u201cexceeds our \u2018trigger\u2019 levels\u201d, a 1991 letter to the company states, and requested further action. Under Georgia law, the company was required to develop what the EPD calls a \u201ccorrective action plan\u201d, which, among other things, would have delineated the terminal\u2019s benzene plume, as well as identified nearby public water wells. In a 1991 reply, BP promised the EPD it would file its plan in four months. Nine years later \u2013 after the McElheneys had tested their well water and the EPD had issued a 2000 citation against BP for failing to submit a \u201ctimely\u201d corrective action plan \u2013 the company finally carried out that requirement, records show. BP, in charge of the terminal\u2019s daily operations, declined to comment for this article. At different times, Unocal, Louis Dreyfus Energy and TransMontaigne have been BP\u2019s partners at the site. TransMontaigne, its current partner, did not respond to repeated emails and phone calls. TransMontaigne purchased Louis Dreyfus Energy in 1998. Chevron, which merged with Unocal in 2005, declined to comment. Today, state regulators attribute their own delay in cracking down on the diesel leak to an internal debate over which EPD division had authority over the terminal\u2019s benzene contamination \u2013 its underground storage tank program, which has purview over the pipeline; or, its hazardous waste branch. For years, compliance officers in that branch, along with their counterparts at the EPA, had been monitoring the facility\u2019s practice of dumping benzene-laced wastewater on site \u2013 a practice later confirmed by terminal employees in court depositions. In 1990, the EPA issued new rules classifying benzene as hazardous waste and requiring bulk-oil terminals to have permits for discharging the \u201cbottoms water\u201d in petroleum tanks. This wastewater can become tainted by the chemical when mixed with gasoline. Rather than treat the water, Southeast Terminals funneled it through an \u201coil/water separator\u201d to skim off fuel, and then dumped it into a ditch on the ground. Company records at the time show that terminal supervisors admitted they drained the wastewater \u201cdirect into streams\u201d or \u201ca dike area which eventually drains offsite into a stream\u201d. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018They have to stop this practice,\u2019\u201d said John Williams, an EPD environmental specialist who inspected the terminal in 1993 and documented the dumping. Three months later, the EPD issued a notice of violation against Southeast Terminals, forcing supervisors to test the bottoms water. Regulators found benzene at levels four times greater than the legal limit of 0.5ppb, prompting the EPA to take action.  \u201cWe saw an issue there,\u201d said Darryl Hines, of the EPA\u2019s regional office in Atlanta, explaining why officials initiated a 1997 civil enforcement action against the facility. In its complaint, the EPA accused BP and then-partner Louis Dreyfus Energy of violating federal hazardous-waste law \u2013 disposing waste without a permit, and failing to categorize it as hazardous. The agency ordered the companies to shut down the oil/water separator, and implement a plan addressing \u201cany groundwater contamination\u201d. By the time Jarrett developed leukemia a year later, the EPA had negotiated a settlement with the companies and laid out a series of requirements for cleaning up the benzene. Without admitting fault, BP and Louis Dreyfus agreed to spend at least $100,000 to remove leaking underground pipelines and install above-ground infrastructure. They also paid a penalty of $15,000.    There was actually gasoline floating on the water. You can't get higher concentrations of benzene \u2026 than free product  Calvin Jones     When BP finally filed its long-delayed action plan, it revealed the presence of what EPD project officer Calvin Jones described as a \u201cdissolved hydrocarbon\u201d plume containing benzene \u2013 \u201ca bigger problem than we had thought\u201d. The chemical, concentrated at 500ppb and counting, had spread beyond the immediate spill areas. Of greater concern to regulators, the plan identified \u201cfree product\u201d in groundwater. \u201cThere was actually gasoline floating on the water,\u201d explained Jones, of the EPD\u2019s underground storage tank program, who oversaw the facility\u2019s protracted cleanup. Referring to gasoline\u2019s ability to dissolve in water, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t get higher concentrations of benzene \u2026 than free product.\u201d Despite a decade-long cleanup \u2013 35.2 million gallons of contaminated groundwater and 1,009 pounds of benzene were collected \u2013 the chemical still saturates much of the nearly 19-acre Southeast Terminals site, records show. Last year, the EPD issued a letter declaring \u201cno further action required\u201d, which released the companies from remediation. At the time, the state-sanctioned benzene count remained at 1,440ppb.  Over the years, enforcement records show, company consultants and regulators alike have tried to trace the path of the wastewater at the terminal. One company analysis details a trail beginning at the property line and then spilling into adjacent woods before hitting a tributary. Another document, produced by the EPA, depicts the discharge as moving offsite through woods and into a resident\u2019s backyard.  \u201cIt\u2019s where the drainage flows,\u201d said Jeffrey Pallas, deputy director of the agency\u2019s hazardous waste division in Atlanta, who oversaw the case against BP and Louis Dreyfus, explaining that the document, complete with photographs, was only intended to verify the hazardous-waste law violations. \u201cWe cannot substantiate from the documentation we have that the benzene left the site,\u201d he said. Seeking accountability     Southeast Terminals, near Athens, Georgia. Regulators have suspected the terminals as a likely source for benzene contamination in groundwater wells. Photograph: Phil Skinner /Center for Public Integrity    The McElheneys have seen the evidence they need to connect Southeast Terminals to the benzene in the Oakwood well \u2013 and Jarrett\u2019s suffering. They believe all the state and federal enforcement actions have yielded few consequences for the facility\u2019s owners. If Jarrett hadn\u2019t gotten sick, they say, they might never have known about the benzene hazard. \u201cThe companies would have paid off their small fines,\u201d Jill said, \u201cand nobody would have been the wiser.\u201d Seeking some accountability, the family filed a lawsuit three years ago against BP, TransMontaigne and seven other previous owners, alleging that the \u201cillegal discharge and release of toxic chemicals\u201d at Southeast Terminals contaminated the surrounding environment and caused Jarrett to develop leukemia. In court filings, the companies denied the allegations and dismissed any link between benzene and childhood leukemia. Last year, defense lawyers invoked a familiar tactic: they cited the Pyatt review to support their claims that the chemical couldn\u2019t have caused Jarrett\u2019s illness. The family recently has agreed on a settlement in principle and is working toward resolving the litigation.  \u201cI thought, \u2018This is par for the course,\u2019\u201d said Jill, who has read some of the industry documents uncovered by the lawsuit. \u201cThe oil industry has fought regulations and lawsuits for workers and adults. Now they\u2019re going to do it with children.\u201d  Jarrett is now a slight, reserved 20-year-old in remission. He remembers his bout with leukemia through a child\u2019s eyes \u2013 the \u201creally cool\u201d ambulance rides, the nurses with coloring books, swinging golf clubs in hospital hallways. \u201cI remember being stuck over and over again by needles\u201d while getting a bone-marrow aspiration or a chest catheter or countless blood draws, he said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until much later I realized what happened to me didn\u2019t happen to other kids.\u201d  Today, he has had to grapple with cancer\u2019s lasting effects \u2013 the feebleness, and the fatigue \u2013 as well as its lingering fears. As a leukemia survivor, he is at risk for developing osteoporosis, cataracts, or even another cancer. Sitting in an Olive Garden in Athens, sandwiched between his parents, Jarrett came across as exceedingly shy, uncomfortable in the limelight. Often, his parents did the speaking for him.  Moments earlier, Jill had explained how leukemia had changed her son, taken an emotional toll. \u201cHe had a really loud voice as a toddler but that voice has mellowed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take that voice over anything.\u201d Maryam Jameel contributed to this story.", "tags": ["Pollution", "Oil", "Cancer", "Society", "Health", "Environment", "Business", "Oil and gas companies", "Energy industry", "Georgia", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-08T12:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/08/dublin-property-boom-back-rest-ireland", "sentences": ["Ireland now has the world\u2019s frothiest property market, according to global estate agents Knight Frank, with prices rising faster in Dublin than London, New York, or even Shanghai."], "title": "Dublin\u2019s property boom bounces back \u2013 but what about the rest of Ireland?", "article": "It was the price tag on an entirely mundane two-up, two-down Victorian house in Dalkey, south Dublin, that in 2006 confirmed to me that the Irish had lost all grip of reality when it came to property. Yes, Dalkey is nice, home to U2\u2019s Bono, and maybe (at a stretch) on a par with Richmond upon Thames if it were in Britain. But at \u00a31.2m, it was double the price a similar house would struggle to fetch in Richmond. Bonkers, I thought, as I joined everyone else in saying \u201cthis can\u2019t be sustainable\u201d. Homes in Dublin, on a per-square-foot basis, were selling at a considerable premium to London and New York, with only land in Tokyo priced higher. This, in a country with a population density a fraction of England\u2019s, and which was also engaged in a frenetic construction boom. It was, of course, unsustainable, as we now know, even if the harshest critics had no idea how violent the death of the Celtic Tiger would be. By 2010 almost every bank and building society in the country had collapsed, with the most swaggering property lender, Anglo Irish, leaving quite colossal debts on to the state\u2019s shoulders. But the tiger is roaring again. Ireland now has the world\u2019s frothiest property market, according to global estate agents Knight Frank, with prices rising faster in Dublin than London, New York, or even Shanghai. And as someone who has spent the last 18 months trying to buy a home in Dublin, the figures come as no surprise. Londoners will be wearily familiar with \u201copen days\u201d where estate agents try to create a buzz about a property, hoping that sealed bids will see the home sell for above asking price. In Dublin, it felt like Black Friday every time I turned up at an open day. At one home in Rathgar by the time I arrived there was a long queue of viewers stretching down the garden path, spilling into the road and grabbing at the agent as she went up and down the line handing out the property particulars. I think there were tears when she ran out half way through. I made the schoolboy error of offering the asking price. Sherry Fitzgerald, Dublin\u2019s dominant upmarket estate agency (it could teach Foxtons in London a thing or two about whipping up buyer sentiment) smiled at me benignly. I clearly did not understand the rules of the game. The asking price in the better postcodes of Dublin (ie D4 and D6) is just the starting gun. To have any chance of bagging a decent property, it was made clear that I would have to pay at least 10%, but probably 20% above the asking price. The next few months were spent in fruitless bidding wars for homes across the capital, where each time I dropped out as the bids went to 25% above asking, and then some more. Where the hell was the money coming from, my colleagues in London would ask. Like most Brits, they continue to see Ireland as an economic basket case, dependent on a mix of tax-dodging multinationals and EU bailouts to survive. Their condescension became annoying. While George Osborne brags that Britain has the fastest growing economy among the G7 countries, it\u2019s pygmy-like compared to the other side of the Irish Sea. The most recent economic growth figure for Ireland was an extraordinary 7.7%, the fastest of any country in Europe this year. Yes, some of it is multinationals running their profits through the country to avail themselves of its notorious 12.5% corporation tax rate. The Irish Revenue is plainly guilty of tax theft from other countries in Europe, and if the EU fines it billions for effectively giving illegal state aid to the likes of Apple, then it will be entirely deserved. But the multinationals in Ireland are not just nameplate operations without any substance that you see in some tax havens. Intel, for example, has invested a staggering $12.5bn (\u00a38bn) into its operations in Leixlip on the fringes of Dublin, creating the most technologically advanced industrial location in Europe. In November, more than 20,000 delegates turned up for Dublin\u2019s Web Summit, an annual event that has become the Cannes film festival of the technology world. Is this the start of another Irish economic bubble? While Dublin is buzzing, in parts, the reality is that few people outside the Irish capital will recognise the white-hot economic and property price figures. Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate, though falling, stands at 11.4%, or nearly double that of the UK. The bank bailout has saddled a generation of young Irish \u2013 and the next \u2013 with an unbearable debt burden. Emigration (the UK is the number one destination) remains much higher than immigration. Taxes have risen considerably, with the introduction of water charges the final straw for many, coming after so many other impositions. The rebellion against the political elite, voiced in Britain through Ukip, in Ireland takes the form of an extraordinary surge in the polls for Sinn F\u00e9in. Talk of a property boom will cause wry smiles in the \u201cghost villages\u201d far from the capital, where whole estates were abandoned half-built the day the banks went bust. Next week, the auction house Allsop is aiming to sell one fully built, and 10 other \u201csubstantially completed\u201d three to five-bed houses in Mullingar, 85km west of Dublin. The price? \u00a3630,000, for the lot. Maybe the Dublin boom will seep through to the moribund counties in the midlands, but there are few signs of it yet. Politicans seize upon any hint of news about rising property prices, hoping it will rescue the huge numbers still trapped in negative equity. Their hopes may, though, be dashed by the Central Bank of Ireland. From the new year it is imposing strict new lending multiples, limiting buyers to loans of no more than three and a half times their income \u2013 far more onerous than anything the Bank of England has tried here. Many in Ireland\u2019s property industry fear the lending rules will bring the country\u2019s nascent property boom to an abrupt end. But in Dalkey, the boom times have returned (if they ever really went away). Sherry Fitzgerald is now marketing a lovely six-bed end of terrace Georgian with waterfront views. The price?

Matching wine with Asian food shouldn\u2019t be a guessing game. Photograph: Alamy     The Flower Drum, Melbourne The Flower Drum, known for its elegant Cantonese dishes and sharp waiters, takes its wine service as seriously as it does the consistency of its famous Peking duck. While co-owner Jason Lui says there aren\u2019t too many rules in the world of food and wine matching, he does encourage his staff to suggest wines that will complement the meal.  \u201cBeing a Cantonese restaurant the food is generally more delicate and produce-driven,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to match buttery and rich chardonnays such as the Giaconda Estate from Beechworth with our baked crab shell.\u201d  And of course, there\u2019s duck with pinot noir. \u201cOur Peking duck with any pinot noir is great \u2013 but one particular favourite at the moment is the William Downie Mornington Peninsula pinot.\u201d Still, customers will sometimes stretch the friendship with extreme requests. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve seen customers match the most delicate of seafoods with reds such as malbecs, and recently some Chinese customers put dried sour plums in their Grange. At the end of it all, as long as the customer is happy having the wines with their food however they like it, then I am just as happy.\u201d     The dining room at Melbourne\u2019s Flower Drum.    Mr Wong, Sydney Franck Moreau, head sommelier of the Merivale Group in Sydney, is working with many and varied restaurants. At Mr Wong he matches wines with strong, aromatic and subtle flavours, sometimes all at once. \u201cRiesling, pinot noir and grenache are a few grapes that work very well with Asian-inspired dishes,\u201d he says. His favourite matches from the restaurant include yellowfin tuna, kohlrabi, sweet wasabi, soy and ginger dressing with KT \u2018Peglidis\u2019 riesling from the Clare Valley in South Australia; Chinese roasted duck with Principia pinot noir from Victoria\u2019s Mornington Peninsula and steamed fish fillet with ginger and shallots matched with Yeringberg viognier from the Yarra Valley, Victoria.  Still, he also gets some left-of-centre requests that are more than OK with him. \u201cI have had so many interesting requests but the most important thing is to make our customers happy. One of the strangest requests was to add cr\u00e8me de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) into a very expensive bottle of cabernet to match with fish.\u201d  The customer was happy, which means so was Moreau. David\u2019s Restaurant, Melbourne  David Zhou has owned David\u2019s in Melbourne\u2019s South Yarra for the last 16 years. With a menu inspired by his native Shanghai, there are dumplings, pork dishes and seafood often made punchy with vinegars and chilli. Zhou\u2019s base rule starts with bubbles and dumplings.  \u201cThe lightness of a sparkling wine is well-suited to our dumplings,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of our dishes have sweet tastes, so light fruity reds such as pinot noir, refreshing ros\u00e9s or fruit-filled whites like pinot gris make a great match with sticky pork belly and chat potato and our chicken ribs with chilli.\u201d Zhou says it\u2019s up to the customer if they wish to complement or contrast their wines with the dishes they order. \u201cWe choose wines to suit our dishes when we write the wine list, but ultimately it\u2019s up to the customer.\u201d  Zhou recently held a wine dinner with leading winemaker Rick Kinzbrunner and his son Nathan from Giaconda winery in Beechworth.

In handling complexities of red wine and spice, Armstrong is clear: \u201cRed wine can also handle spice heat very well but tannin and spice clash, so what works is plush, velvety fruit.\u201d This includes softer reds like grenache and pinot noir. The second flavour to manage is soy. \u201cThe savoury and umami elements that underlie much if not most Asian dishes need a wine with a slightly oxidative element that brings harmony to a pairing,\u201d he says.  Two matches he recommends are prawn toast with Spice Temple sweet and sour sauce with a glass of 2014 Adelina \u2018Off Dry\u2019 riesling from the Clare Valley; and lobster siu mai dumplings with a 2013 CRFT \u2018K1 Vineyard\u2019 gew\u00fcrztraminer from the Adelaide Hills.", "tags": ["Chinese food and drink", "Wine"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-10T00:45:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/dec/10/kolkata-walking-tour-india-city-of-joy", "sentences": ["We could be in Shanghai or Soho."], "title": "Kolkata: a walking and culture tour of India\u2019s city of joy", "article": "The streets are a riot of tinsel and fairy lights.

Immigrants \u2013 Chinese, Jews, Buddhists, Portuguese and more \u2013 settled in the \u201cgrey area\u201d in between, now called Bowbazar. I take a tour of the area with Manjit Singh Hoonjan, a typical Bowbazar resident: he was born and bred here, but to a family of outsiders \u2013 his grandfather, a carpenter originally from Punjab, settled here in the 1940s. Now offering walking tours of this and other parts of Kolkata, Manjit is a mine of information on the city and how best to capture it in photographs.     Morning light hits a street in Bowbazar. Photograph: Manjit Singh Hoonjan/Calcutta Photo Tours    We begin by turning off Chittaranjan Avenue into a labyrinth of narrow lanes. First up is Buddhist temple Street, with a guesthouse for travelling Buddhists from all over the world. Round the corner on Weston Street, children in smart brown uniforms are clattering in to Sacred Heart School. Christian areas have the best bakeries, says Manjit, pointing out Ajmeri bakery, piled with fruitcake and sweet-salty bakarkhani naan. It\u2019s early morning and milk is being delivered \u2013 still inside the goats. We follow the \u201cmilkman\u201d and his flock to the British-built military housing that gave the area its name: Bow Barracks. After independence, the three-storey apartment blocks, green balconies and shutters contrasting with red brick, were taken over by Anglo-Indians, who love to keep their Christmas traditions alive. Round the corner on Metcalfe Street, we stop for a clay cup of chai. It\u2019s 8am and the streets are thronged: a man at a tiny desk offers use of a mobile phone to migrant workers; in an ironing parlour, irons that look like museum pieces are heating on a wood fire. This is Parsee territory: a large red and grey building is the Zoroastrian fire temple, where a sacred flame has burned since 1912. The main temple is out of bounds, but in the outer arcade we admire carvings and stained glass depicting the flame and the Faravahar winged disc symbol, and nod to a priest in snowy white robes. The Parsees originally fled persecution in Iran but now contentedly share a street with a subsect of Shia Islam: the Aga Khan Jamatkhana \u2013 place of worship for the Ismaili community \u2013 stands rights opposite. The main artery of Bowbazar is BB Ganguly Street. Plied by ancient creaking trams, it has several personalities: a loud and noisy wholesale vegetable market in the east, then a carpentry quarter, then the optical district, with glinting spectacles. But we\u2019re off to China \u2013 a short step away around Sun Yat Sen Street. Here, red flags hang over doorways bearing Chinese names, hawkers sell prawn crackers and water chestnuts and people are slurping Chinese breakfasts of fishball soup. We could be in Shanghai or Soho. There are noodles, incense sticks, dried mushrooms, and every other shop seems to be a butcher\u2019s, all pig carcasses and strings of Chinese sausage. To remind ourselves that we\u2019re in India we stop for sweet treats at Bancharam on Chatawala Gali. Mishti doi is delicate sweetened yoghurt set into small clay pots; even better are kacha golla, melt-in-your-mouth balls of curd with cardamom.     Men play a game of cards amid the bustle of the city. Photograph: Manjit Singh Hoonjan/Calcutta Photo Tours    Parsee Church Street (Manjit explains that any place of worship that wasn\u2019t a Hindu temple or mosque was referred to as a \u201cchurch\u201d) has a thriving recycling industry: people are busy pulling apart old pallets and boxes, piling the wood for reuse, and gathering nails with a magnet on a stick. On Pollock Street \u2013 known as Balloon Lane for its shops festooned with every party decoration Chinese manufacturing can think of \u2013 we stop for more nibbles. Gathia are deliciously bad-for-you lengths of gram flour dough, deep-fried on the spot and served with chillies and shreds of green papaya. There\u2019s more. A wedding cake of an Armenian church, and a green and baby pink building that is a Jain temple, one of the oldest faiths in the world, known for extreme non-violence. I keep my mind on that as we cross crazy Brabourne Road \u2013 believing in reincarnation probably helps. We\u2019re heading up Canning Street towards an imposing red and cream building. Vaguely Moorish-looking, but with a church-like spire, it is actually a synagogue, the Magen David, built in Kolkata\u2019s Raj heyday, when the then capital of India had 10,000 Jews.     The Magen David synagouge. Photograph: Manjit Singh Hoonjan/Calcutta Photo Tours    Today there are fewer than 30, and Kolkata\u2019s synagogues can rarely muster enough for a service. So in this sacred space, with its shadowy arches and air that smells a century old, a Muslim family light the Shabbat lamps and polish the brass. But rules are rules: men\u2019s heads must be covered. I watch the Islamic attendant of this shrine to Judaism respectfully pin a kippah on the head of our British companion, in the middle of a mostly Hindu city, and wish more places could take a leaf out of Bowbazar\u2019s chaotic, tolerant book. \u2022 Calcutta Photo Tours (+91 98 31 163482, calcuttaphototours.com) offers half-day walking tours from \u00a315pp. Accommodation in Kolkata was provided by the Park Hotel (+91 1800 102 7275, theparkhotels.com), which has doubles from \u00a369 room only", "tags": ["Kolkata holidays", "Walking holidays", "India holidays", "Asia", "Cultural trips", "Heritage", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-10T06:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/dec/12/nicki-minaj-the-pinkprint-first-listen-review", "sentences": ["Shanghai Is this sinogrime?", "Nicki carries on shit-talking where she left off on Big Daddy, circling the beat like the classic NYC battle rapper that she is deep down before letting herself sink into a hypnotic, drug-induced stupor: \u201cPop pills, now we Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai \u2026\u201d Win Again This is why we crave Mixtape Nicki: Win Again is a pretty standard example of the form, but the confidence and attitude on show is enough to carry it."], "title": "Nicki Minaj \u2013 The Pinkprint first-listen review: 'She has no idea what her strengths are'", "article": "All Things Go The opening track of Nicki Minaj\u2019s last album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded found her ricocheting between about 12 different voices, accents and characters, mimicking an exorcism by growling in guttural tongues and interpolating O Come All Ye Faithful over a beat that sounded like a possessed typewriter. By contrast, All Things Go consists of deep thoughts over barely-existent synth wisps delivered in clipped, serious-faced tones. From reminiscing about a relationship (more \u2013 oh, a lot more \u2013 of which later) to mourning her murdered cousin, there\u2019s a lot for Nicki to be emo about. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also a drizzly trudge to listen to: for all that Minaj can sound forced when contorting herself into outr\u00e9 new personae, she never sounds more stilted than when she\u2019s trying to play it straight.            I Lied Sometime this year, Minaj allegedly split from her alleged boyfriend of 10 years, Safaree Samuels \u2013 a relationship she\u2019s kept so private that she barely acknowledged him in public. There are still no names mentioned here, but it\u2019s shaping up to be Nicki Minaj\u2019s break-up album: All Things Go alluded to it, and I Lied is a full-on ballad of complicated regret. Well, Minaj\u2019s emotions may be complicated, but Mike Will Made It\u2019s torpid beat raises neither temperature nor tempo, and Minaj was clearly too overcome by her sad feelings to write a decent chorus: this one lists around in search of a hook before evaporating in a puff of embarrassment. The Crying Game (feat. Jessie Ware) At this point in my first listen to Roman Reloaded, my brain felt like it had been turned into exclamation marks. Three tracks into The Pinkprint, I\u2019m sliding off the sofa with boredom. A sinuous guitar line provides a flicker of interest before it morphs into a buzzsaw; crashing drums at the end attempt to manufacture drama out of nothing; Minaj continues to pore over the minutiae of her dead relationship and in conclusion delivers, with quite unwarranted sombre meaningfulness, a clich\u00e9 about loving and to be loved. And as nice as it is to hear Jessie Ware\u2019s voice, and as exciting as the idea of a Ware/Minaj collaboration was, let\u2019s be real: her underwritten chorus isn\u2019t going to go down as an essential moment in her catalogue, either.            Get On Your Knees (feat. Ariana Grande) Minaj opening with the purr from The Boys, one of her most underrated singles, is The Pinkprint\u2019s first sign of life, and \u2013 blessed relief \u2013 with Get On Your Knees, Emo Nicki finally takes her leave. She\u2019s still brooding and clipped, but more in a prowling, predatory way as she and Ariana Grande turn the tables on a year of bro-R&amp;B and demand cunnilingus of potential suitors. There\u2019s no playfulness here: it\u2019s a pure power move. Grande, oddly, gets the best lines: \u201cBefore I let you walk, you gotta show me how you crawl,\u201d dismissing the eternally useless sad boy culture in the chorus. But the song doesn\u2019t reach the heights it should. Grande sounds parachuted in from a different song and oblivious to her surroundings, although given that the song was originally intended for Katy Perry\u2019s album, perhaps we dodged a bullet anyway. Pity Nicki couldn\u2019t find the time to reword the song: her shout-out to Perry when she should be ushering in Grande is awkward for all involved. Feeling Myself (feat. Beyonc\u00e9) Ah, this is what we expect on a Nicki Minaj album: crazed voices, declarations of superiority that vibrate with outrage, unexpected shifts between menacing calm and multi-layered chorales. And they\u2019re all courtesy of Beyonc\u00e9, continuing her post-masterpiece celebrations of wilding out over bizarro beats in style. Nicki and Bey don\u2019t so much ride this beat, which mostly consists of a nagging whistle, as make it bend in accordance with the whims of their voices: \u201cI stop the world!\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 crows. \u201cWorld, stop!\u201d she commands, and in the ensuing pause you can almost hear her smirk. \u201cCarry on.\u201d Like Minaj\u2019s remix of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Flawless, Feeling Myself is bit of a mess that does away with structure and sense - this isn\u2019t a bad thing, necessarily - but the scattershot sensory overload that\u2019s been Minaj\u2019s trademark to date has been sorely missing from The Pinkprint, and this is the first track that brings it.      Only (feat. Drake, Lil\u2019 Wayne &amp; Chris Brown) And the album crashes into the ground again. Usually, Nicki uses the presence of inferior male MCs as a launching pad for greatness. Drake and Lil\u2019 Wayne surely set the bar low enough \u2013 the former masturbating uncontrollably in public (please, never make your voice squeak on the word \u201ctitties\u201d again), the latter mumbling incoherently like your creepy grandpa. Both pay lip service to Minaj\u2019s central point, that she didn\u2019t fuck her way to the top, but somehow manage to undermine it anyway via entitlement to her body. Meanwhile, she undermines herself with some of her most torturous puns and the worst \u201cgirls are my sons\u201d punchline to date.             Want Some More Nicki pulling funny faces and veering into doubletime flow over a Zaytoven beat: this is, in theory, what I\u2019ve been craving from this album. But even here, she seems to be going through the motions: nothing unexpected happens at any point during Want Some More. A pall has settled over The Pinkprint, in stark contrast to the gleeful barrage of head-spinning ideas that was the first third of Roman Reloaded. What\u2019s also sad is that Minaj began 2014 at the top of her game, releasing a stream of remixes, one-off tracks and guest spots that showed her at her most laser-focused and unstoppable - not to mention pissed off, especially with men. Everything pointed to The Pinkprint being a triumph, yet none of the spirit of those one-offs is really present here. Four Door Aventador Namedropping Shia LaBeouf as evidence of your Hollywood star power is strange to say the least. Nonetheless, the best track yet, and one that\u2019ll have Lil\u2019 Kim seething: ever since Nicki emerged, Kim\u2019s accusations that the younger woman has copied her have come thick and fast \u2013 and not always accurately, given how fundamentally different the two rappers\u2019 personae are. Four Door Aventador is the most Kim-like track Nicki has ever put her name to, from the sour snap of her tone to the Mafia imagery to the bumping, humming, low-key beat reminiscent of Kim\u2019s 2003 deep cut Tha Beehive. It\u2019s possibly instructive to compare The Pinkprint to that song\u2019s parent album, La Bella Mafia: both surprisingly subdued follow-ups to zany, technicolour hip-pop second albums (making Roman Reloaded the parallel of The Notorious K.I.M.), both released in the wake of long-term relationships crumbling (Kim famously split with her Junior M.A.F.I.A. crew after seven years in 2001). Let\u2019s hope that, like La Bella Mafia, The Pinkprint has saved its best for its second half. Favorite (feat. Jeremih) Yet another midtempo R&amp;B number that does absolutely nothing to pique the interest. Neither Nicki nor Jeremih seem to be making any effort. I\u2019ve listened to this three times in a row and nothing, aside from the plinky beat, has stuck. Buy A Heart (feat. Meek Mill) A song that sums up what an unfortunate venture The Pinkprint is turning out to be: originally a Meek Mill demo, the R&amp;B singer K Michelle was inspired enough to name her new album, Anybody Wanna Buy A Heart?, after it \u2013 but her version never made the final cut. Enter Nicki Minaj, whose lack of quality control apparently deems an inferior remix of another artist\u2019s offcut based on yet another artist\u2019s song acceptable for her own album. Worse, K Michelle\u2019s rejected version easily trumps this, mostly because K Michelle sounded a good deal more invested in the song\u2019s themes of heartbreak and numbness. Anybody Wanna Buy A Heart? is also the superior break-up album: whenever Minaj opens her heart, there\u2019s a sense of going through the motions, of carefully hitting conventional spots, whereas K Michelle is all unfiltered blood and guts, cursing the world as she tears everything around her down. Indeed, a Nicki Minaj/K Michelle collaboration is probably the most necessary outcome of all of this. Trini Dem Girls (feat. Lunchmoney Lewis) Finally. Nicki\u2019s dancehall side is seriously under-utilised, given how consistently she\u2019s peaked with it, from Beam Me Up Scotty to Hold Yuh (Remix) to Gun Shot. I\u2019m out of my chair and dancing around the kitchen for the first time during the album: those echoing handclaps bring back happy memories of the classic Diwali Riddim. Meanwhile, the chorus, which sounds dropped in from the kind of blaring RedOne production that\u2019s been absent from The Pinkprint so far, does a fine job of eliding Island Nicki and Pop Nicki (\u00e0 la her decision to give the Pound the Alarm video a Trinidad carnival setting) \u2013 two sides of Minaj that can seem diametrically opposed, but which both seem to have the effect of cutting her brashness loose. Anaconda It\u2019s remarkable how much better this album makes Anaconda sound: it\u2019s a blast of shameless vulgarity in an album curiously short on it (in terms of performance and sound, not just its words). As a song listened to sober and alone, it still goes on twice as long as it strictly needs to and feels somewhat haphazardly structured, but as a party track it\u2019s an unstoppable force, with those fire verses coming into their own. The thinkpieces have been done to death by now, but I for one appreciate how quickly Minaj can flip from \u201cstop looking at my ass\u201d (on Lookin\u2019 Ass) to \u201coh/ my/ God/ look at her butt\u201d here: appreciation of her body and bodies like it, with the sexuality that implies, but on her terms and not exclusively reducing herself to it. Minaj\u2019s relationship to the heterosexual male gaze is neither straightforward rejection nor submission, but rather playing with it on a whim, as a cat might play with a mouse.            The Night Is Still Young The trashy dance section of Roman Reloaded was much maligned initially, including by me, but I caved in to Starships and Pound the Alarm in the end, mostly because of booze. This perfunctory nod to that style is like revisiting the sites of your drunkenness through a hungover fug the following night in a doomed attempt to recapture the magic. No one\u2019s heart is in this, everyone just wants a quiet, contemplative night in instead. Pills N Potions But not this kid of quiet night in. This execrable single is where the wheels started to come off Nicki\u2019s 2014 and time has not improved it one jot. A third of its running time is comprised of a hook that\u2019s more like a space-filling ad lib; one of the biggest reasons Nicki Minaj\u2019s slow songs don\u2019t work is because the woman has no idea how to write a chorus beneath a certain tempo, and thinks honking \u201cI STILL LOVE I STILL LOVE I STILL LUH UH UH\u201d through Auto-Tune ad infinitum will suffice.            Bed Of Lies (feat. Skylar Grey) For once, Minaj seems to have put some thought into structuring an album. But when the arc has gone from boring break-up mush through varying levels of disappointment back to boring break-up mush, you start longing for Roman Reloaded\u2019s incoherent scattershot randomness. Jobbing industry songwriter Skylar Grey outdoes herself with a particularly stupid metaphor about thread counts in the song\u2019s bridge. Grand Piano The idea of Nicki Minaj closing an album with a full-on torch song would be more tantalising had that album not been as much of a slog as The Pinkprint. Nice violin, but this song is so underwritten lyrically and melodically that it feels less like an emotional climax and more of an afterthought; Minaj\u2019s careful, by-the-book and by-the-autotune performance doesn\u2019t exactly sell it, either. Big Daddy (feat. Meek Mill) Of course the album jolts into life with the bonus tracks, of course it does. An aggressive Meek Mill going hard over a demented fairground beat is one of the best sounds in rap, and Nicki raises her own ferocity levels to match him. Target, enjoyably: Iggy Azalea. Shanghai Is this sinogrime? It\u2019s the best beat yet, synthesised zithers and wonky digital oscillations leaning in and out of each other, sprinkled with odd squelches and percussion like water droplets; a violin emerges from nowhere to brilliant effect in the closing 20 seconds. Nicki carries on shit-talking where she left off on Big Daddy, circling the beat like the classic NYC battle rapper that she is deep down before letting herself sink into a hypnotic, drug-induced stupor: \u201cPop pills, now we Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai \u2026\u201d Win Again This is why we crave Mixtape Nicki: Win Again is a pretty standard example of the form, but the confidence and attitude on show is enough to carry it. Minaj doesn\u2019t say anything she hasn\u2019t said before, but she rages her way through it like a whirling dervish and ends by threatening to kill everything in her way. Mona Lisa If Nicki really wanted to make a sombre, serious break-up album, why couldn\u2019t it all have sounded like this? One of the strangest tracks she\u2019s put her name to, Mona Lisa is less a narrative or a song and more snatches of post-break-up mental detritus deformed almost to the point of intelligibility floating through space. (The latter comes courtesy of Drunk in Love producer Detail, and there\u2019s a cushiony depth to his beat that most of the submarine synths usually deployed for Sad Rap Feelings lack.) Mirroring the previous track, Mona Lisa also ends with Nicki threatening murder \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t wanna fight but I\u2019ll fuck around and end your life\u201d \u2013 but this time delicately and sadly (shades of rising Chicago rapper Dej Loaf and her breakthrough hit Try Me here). It\u2019s a more emotional and convincing depiction of Minaj\u2019s post-break-up state of mind than any of her more deliberate efforts on the main album, that\u2019s for sure. Put You In a Room As is this odd sing-song bonus: it\u2019s a curio, not a classic, but the spontaneity of Minaj\u2019s lyrics here are a welcome contrast to the rigidity of what she thinks a confessional album should be elsewhere. If nothing else, the chorus is thought-provokingly odd: \u201cPut you in a room/ You don\u2019t have to leave/ But you can\u2019t sleep with me.\u201d Physical abduction? Mental closure? Another reiteration that Minaj\u2019s sexuality exists only on her terms? Truffle Butter (feat. Drake &amp; Lil Wayne) Of all the samples to pop up on a Nicki Minaj record, I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting Maya Jane Coles\u2019 brilliant 2010 house anthem What They Say, but here we are - and after a slog like this, it\u2019s most welcome. Drake, Nicki and Wayne all begin their verses, \u201cThinkin\u2019 out loud,\u201d and if they\u2019re not actual freestyles they\u2019re convincing imitations of such; it\u2019s telling that in relaxed, spontaneous mode all three are so much less tiresome than on their official triple collaboration here. Pruning a 22-track Nicki Minaj album down to an EP\u2019s worth of bangers isn\u2019t an unexpected task, but even by those standards The Pinkprint is a let-down \u2013 and while Minaj might be the most exciting pop star around at her best, her insistence on confining her best work to random internet freebies and bonus tracks indicates that even after this long, she either has no idea what her strengths are or still hasn\u2019t worked out how to present them to the public.", "tags": ["Nicki Minaj", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Rap", "Hip-hop", "R&B", "Culture", "Beyonc\u00e9"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-12T15:14:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/15/10-best-city-books-2014", "sentences": ["Aaron Renn Shanghai Homes | Jie Li      This is a delightfully detailed study of the urban culture and history of Shanghai\u2019s vernacular alleyway neighborhoods, revealing a hive of familial secrets, often painful and unspoken.", "Focusing on the homes where her grandparents spent much of their lives, Li tracks the families and individuals who rose and fell during the political turmoil of a new socialist China, the violence of the Cultural Revolution and Shanghai\u2019s recent boom years."], "title": "The 10 best city books of 2014", "article": "Radical Cities | Justin McGuirk      No book better captures the Latin turn that urbanism seems to have taken this decade than Justin McGuirk\u2019s Radical Cities. Something of an urbanist Motorcycle Diaries, his fine study identifies a continental seam between the formal and informal, the planned and the expedient. He follows this seam from Argentina\u2019s Tupac Amaru housing collective to the work of activist/architect Teddy Cruz at the US-Mexican border, with visits along the way to Bogota\u2019s provocateur mayor Antanas Mockus, the favelas of Rio and Caracas\u2019s notorious vertical squat Torre David. You may well come away with renewed hope for the future of megacities \u2014 and will definitely understand why the most intriguing developments in contemporary urbanist practice all seem to have have un cierto sabor Latino. Adam Greenfield The Art of Stillness | Pico Iyer      This should be called the anti-city book. Pico Iyer, well-known globetrotter, attains travel nirvana and concludes that the best place to visit in these frenzied, overconnected times is ... nowhere. Subtitled Adventures in Going Nowhere, Iyer\u2019s book is a comment on urban living and resistance to the fad of incessant travelling. He is certainly an advocate for his own life: living in rural Japan without internet, television, mobile phone, car or Facebook. However, this is not a self-help book with meditation tips. (Iyer himself doesn\u2019t meditate and doesn\u2019t insist you do either.) Rather, it is a series of glances at the lives of those who have found peace, such as Leonard Cohen, who, after a life of indulgence, found the ultimate seduction in a monastic life. Benita Fernando On the Run | Alice Goffman      With the news from Ferguson and New York refusing to go away, Alice Goffman\u2019s On the Run becomes increasingly relevant. This study of how young black men survive in the vastly unequal American city is populated with real people and their everyday trials, brilliantly brought to life with academic attention to detail. One in three black men is likely to spend time in jail, and this is a searing portrait of the lives behind the statistics: constantly under threat from the police, courts and incarceration. It is the unacceptable testament to the impact of race and inequality on our modern cities. Leo Hollis The Responsive City | Stephen Goldsmith and Susan Crawford      Goldsmith and Crawford take on the potential of technology and data to help governments improve city services, better engage with citizens, and of course save money. But The Responsive City: Engaging Communities Through Data-Smart Governance also gives many examples of where this is already happening today, ranging from big wins \u2013 like saving lives by predicting what buildings will catch on fire in New York \u2013 to smaller blocking-and-tackling items, such as better rat management in Chicago. The book is definitely written by optimists, but in an era with so much cynicism, it is refreshing to read a \u201ccan do\u201d take on local governance. Aaron Renn Shanghai Homes | Jie Li      This is a delightfully detailed study of the urban culture and history of Shanghai\u2019s vernacular alleyway neighborhoods, revealing a hive of familial secrets, often painful and unspoken. Focusing on the homes where her grandparents spent much of their lives, Li tracks the families and individuals who rose and fell during the political turmoil of a new socialist China, the violence of the Cultural Revolution and Shanghai\u2019s recent boom years. Particularly revealing are the interviews and illustrations by the author\u2019s parents. They depict how an alleyway home was ruthlessly dissected over the decades into smaller rooms: initially built to house a single family over generations, the homes eventually accommodated assigned neighbours \u2013 condemned rightists, shamed intellectuals, rejuvenated proletariats, smug party members, petty urbanites and so on. Sue Anne Tay Oxford Street, Accra | Ato Quayson      What can a street teach us? In Oxford Street: City Life and the Itineraries of Transnationalism, Ato Quayson helps us go beyond the superficial spatial cues of this seemingly typical urban African street. He investigates the people and their interactions, in the past and present, and how these cumulatively create a sense of place. It\u2019s an anthropological framework for examining Accra from the ground up: not its concrete structures, but its migrations \u2013 of Ga, Osu, Afro-Brazilian, Danish and Lebanese, and today\u2019s traffic of Ghanaians and expats \u2013 and the social, economic and political forces that make the Osu neighborhood. Victoria Okoye Sunrise-to-High-Rise | Lucy Dalzell      Lucy Dalzell\u2019s beautifully illustrated \u201cwallbook\u201d takes us from Neolithic long houses and the Great Wall of China through to Tate Modern and Shigeru Ban\u2019s paper houses, via a 10-panel timeline that creates what is effectively a tapestry of a Calvino-esque fantastical city. The right kind of kid could spend hours obsessing over it and grow up to create their own addition to the pantheon \u2013 and with any luck a swanky house you can retire in. Chris Michael London: The Information Capital | James Cheshire and Oliver Uberti      In London: the Information Capital, UCL geographer James Cheshire and designer Oliver Uberti have created 100 visually stunning maps and graphics to help you see the capital through fresh eyes. The book draws heavily on census data \u2013 but the authors have also crunched data from other sources such as Twitter, Oyster cards and GPS tracks of planes, bikes and runners to visualise the city in beautiful and informative ways. My personal favourite transforms data from an ONS life satisfaction survey \u2013 stress, tiredness, satisfaction \u2013 into facial attributes. Compared with the smug \u2018rest of Britain\u2019, much of London does seem to have issues \u2013 but what Londoner would want to live anywhere else? Nick Mead The Interior Circuit | Francisco Goldman       It takes bravery, or at least fatalism, to drive in Mexico City. Having developed a bit of both in the years after his young wife\u2019s sudden death, Guatemalan-American writer Francisco Goldman took on the challenge of learning to navigate his adopted hometown by car as a way of extracting himself from the self-destructive lifestyle into which the tragedy plunged him. The Interior Circuit tells of not just his struggle for self- and urban mastery, but of the city\u2019s own \u2013 against its political corruption, its student unrest, its stark class divisions and its popular image as a crime-racked, death-obsessed, \u201csurreal\u201d sort of metropolis. Colin Marshall Urban Smellscapes | Victoria Henshaw      What does your city smell of? You might not have thought about it much, and that was precisely the motivation for urban planner and academic Victoria Henshaw, who died in October, to write this most intriguing book. Through a rigorous analysis of changing attitudes to smell \u2013 written in a style that can read like a PhD thesis \u2013 she unpicks the importance of aroma in shaping our perceptions of places.

A sports class is in full swing on the outskirts of Beijing. Herds of children charge after a football on an artificial pitch, criss-crossed with colourful markings and illuminated in high definition by the glare of bright white floodlights. It all seems normal enough \u2013 except for the fact that this familiar playground scene is taking place beneath a gigantic inflatable dome. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a change having to go through an airlock on the way to class,\u201d says Travis Washko, director of sports at the British School of Beijing. \u201cBut the kids love it, and parents can now rest assured their children are playing in a safe environment.\u201d The reason for the dome becomes apparent when you step outside. A grey blanket hangs in the sky, swamping the surroundings in a de-saturated haze and almost obscuring the buildings across the street. A red flag hangs above the school\u2019s main entrance to warn it\u2019s a no-go day: stay indoors at all costs. The airpocalypse has arrived.     A sports class inside the inflatable clean-air dome at the British School of Beijing.    Beijing\u2019s air quality has long been a cause of concern, but the effects of its extreme levels of pollution on daily life can now be seen in physical changes to the architecture of the city. Buildings and spaces are being reconfigured and daily routines modified to allow normal life to go on beneath the toxic shroud. Paper face masks have been common here for a long time, but now the heavy-duty kind with purifying canister filters \u2013 of the sort you might wear for a day of asbestos removal \u2013 are frequently seen on the streets. On bad days, bike lanes are completely deserted, as people stay at home or retreat to the conditioned environments of hermetically-sealed malls. It\u2019s as if the 21-million-strong population of the Chinese capital is engaged in a mass city-wide rehearsal for life on an inhospitable planet. Only it\u2019s not a rehearsal: the poisonous atmosphere is already here. The British School is the latest of Beijing\u2019s international colleges to go to the drastic lengths of building an artificial bubble in which to simulate a normal environment beneath the cloak of smog. Earlier this year, the nearby International School of Beijing lavished \u00a33m on a pair of domes covering an area of six tennis courts, with hospital-grade air-filtration systems, following the lead of the Beijing satellite of exclusive British private school Dulwich College, which opened its own clean-air dome last year.     Air Quality Index graphics by the Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Centte    \u201cPollution is what all the parents are talking about,\u201d says Nicole Washko, Travis\u2019s wife, who also works at the school where their two daughters go, too. \u201cMore and more ex-pat families are leaving this country for the sake of their kids\u2019 health. So if all the other schools have a dome, then we\u2019ve got to have a dome.\u201d A non-toxic learning environment is perhaps the least parents might expect, when they\u2019re paying \u00a320,000-a-year fees. The British School has recently undergone a complete filtration overhaul, as if preparing for atmospheric armageddon, with new air curtains installed above the doors and almost 200 ceiling-mounted air purifiers put in to complement the floor-standing kind in each classroom. Windows must remain closed, and pupils must adhere to the strict air safety code. Reception classes stay indoors when the air quality index (AQI) hits 180 \u2013 measured on an official scale of 500 by various sensors across the city. For primary kids the limit is 200, while the eldest students are allowed to brave the elements up to 250. Anything above 300 and school trips are called off. The World Health Organisation, meanwhile, recommends a safe exposure level of 25. \u201cWe were finding our sports fixtures were being cancelled so often, and kids were getting cabin fever from being kept in doors so much of the time,\u201d says Travis Washko. \u201cBut now we have the dome, it\u2019s perfect weather all year round.\u201d The day I arrive in Beijing, the AQI hits 460, just 40 points away from maximum doom. It\u2019s the kind of air that seems to have a thickness to it, like the dense fug in an airport smokers\u2019 cubicle. It sticks in the back of your throat, and if you blow your nose at the end of the day, it comes out black. Pedalling around the city (I am one of the only cyclists mad enough to be on the road) is an eerie experience \u2013 not just for the desolation, but for the strange neon glow coming from signs at the top of invisible buildings, like a supernatural, carcinogenic version of the northern lights. The midday sun hangs in the sky looking more like the moon, its glare filtered out by the haze.     Heavy-duty face masks are now frequently seen on Beijing\u2019s streets. Photograph: Imaginechina/Corbis    Daily talk of the AQI has become a national pastime amongst ex-pats and Chinese locals alike. Air-quality apps are the staple of every smartphone. Chinese microblogs and parenting forums are monopolised by discussions about the best air filters (sales of the top brands have tripled over the last year alone) and chatter about holidays to \u201cclean-air destinations\u201d like Fujian, Hainan and Tibet. This year\u2019s Beijing marathon, held on a day that exceeded 400 on the scale, saw many drop out when their face-mask filters turned a shade of grey after just a few kilometres. Some said it felt like running through bonfire smoke. With such hazardous conditions increasingly common, it\u2019s not surprising that foreign companies are now expected to pay a \u201chardship bonus\u201d of up to 20 or 30% to those willing to work in the Chinese capital. And yet denial still persists. Many Beijingers tend to use the word \u201cwumai\u201d (meaning haze), rather than \u201cwuran\u201d (pollution), to describe the poor air quality \u2013 and not just because it\u2019s the official Newspeak of weather reports. It\u2019s partly because, one local tells me, \u201cif we had to face up to how much we\u2019re destroying the environment and our bodies every day, it would just be too much.\u201d A recent report by researchers in Shanghai described Beijing\u2019s atmosphere as almost \u201cuninhabitable for human beings\u201d \u2013 not really something you want to be reminded of every day.     October\u2019s Beijing marathon saw many competitors drop out; some said it felt like running through bonfire smoke. Photograph: Imaginechina/Corbis    When I first came to Beijing in 2003, as a volunteer English teacher, my students told me that the city\u2019s air wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as London\u2019s. \u201cWe know about your \u2018pea-soupers\u2019,\u201d they would say, conjuring images of ye olde England shrouded in Dickensian gloom, happily ignoring the murky haze outside their own classroom window (then more often caused by sand storms than coal-burning power plants). Ten years later, the same former students are all too aware of the problem. \u201cWe never used to have days as bad as this,\u201d says Li Yutong, who has recently returned to Beijing after several years studying in Australia and working in Hong Kong. \u201cI used to play football outside and go running, but you just can\u2019t do that any more. School kids seem to get sick more often now \u2013 and they\u2019re much fatter because they don\u2019t play outside.\u201d Our school was sited across the street from the national Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which proved to be an alarming neighbour when SARS broke out and we watched the constant train of ambulances. Now its attentions have turned to an airborne threat of a different kind. In June, the centre released data which suggested that the average 18-year-old Beijinger will spend as much as 40% of their remaining years in ill-health \u2013 potentially suffering from cancer, cardiovascular or respiratory disease. Breaking the usual government silence on the issue, China\u2019s former health minister, Chen Zhu, spoke out in January to reveal that between 350,000 and 500,000 people die prematurely each year here as a result of air pollution. In response to mounting pressure, the government has introduced a host of new laws and regulations, increasing fines for environmental violations, and attempting to shut down high carbon-emission factories. But there is little to suggest any of their measures are having an effect. \u201cTo be able to monitor these factories, local officials are supposed to visit them in person,\u201d says Zhang Kai, lead campaigner on air pollution at Greenpeace East Asia. \u201cBut there is just no capacity to do that, and no policy in place to punish the polluting factories effectively.\u201d     British artist Matt Hope has designed a \u2018breathing bicycle\u2019 which filters air as you pedal, then feeds it into your mask. Photograph: Petar Kujundzic/Reuters    The national \u201cairmageddon\u201d has spawned a host of other attempts to solve the problem, ranging from the miraculous to the madcap. In the western city of Lanzhou, officially deemed by the World Health Organisation to have the worst air in China, officials have proposed digging great gullies into the surrounding mountains in the hope of trapping polluted air in a gigantic landscape gutter, like an atmospheric ha-ha. But Lanzhou\u2019s poor air quality is caused less by burning coal and car fumes than by the local penchant for blowing up mountains with dynamite. More than 700 peaks are being levelled to provide swathes of flat land for development, and blowing out a huge gulley would only add to the problem.  Other solutions proposed in Beijing have a more futuristic air. Environmental scientist Yu Shaocai has proposed fitting water sprinklers to the tops of tall buildings, to try and \u201cwash\u201d the smog out of the sky. \u201cWater should be sprayed into the atmosphere like watering a garden,\u201d Yu wrote in the journal Environmental Chemistry Letters, noting that most urban pollution hangs below 100m, so it could be caught by an artificial shower from the city\u2019s taller towers. An expert in \u201cwet deposition\u201d (how rain can clean particles from the air), he thinks he\u2019s got the science sorted, and the main challenge is just to \u201cdesign the specific spray system that can spray a good raindrop size and [ensure] the most scavenging efficiencies for the air pollution.\u201d But his hastily Photoshopped visuals of garden sprinklers stuck on top of skyscrapers don\u2019t do much to inspire confidence. In fact, wet deposition has long been hailed as a possible solution by higher powers, with their lofty pretensions to control the elements. China\u2019s Meteorological Administration issued a paper last year which ambitiously declared all local officials would be able to use artificial rain to clear away smog by 2015. And as the Washington Post reported, the idea might not be so far from reality: because of chronic water shortages, China has invested heavily in artificial rain since the late 1950s. The country now boats a battery of 7,000 cloud-seeding artillery guns, the same number of launchers for chemical-bearing rockets, and more than 50 planes \u2013 all manned by an army of 50,000 employees, ready to launch full-scale warfare on the weather.     Daan Roosegaarde\u2019s plan for a smog-free park uses buried coils of copper to create an electrostatic field that attracts smog particles. Illustration: studioroosegaarde.net    At the other end of the scale are the initiatives that aim to affect people\u2019s attitudes on the ground. Driven by an effort to raise awareness of the smog problem and spur the government into action, a host of critical art projects have been spawned. British artist Matt Hope has designed a \u201cbreathing bicycle\u201d, a home-made Heath Robinson-style contraption that filters air as you pedal along and feeds it through a tube into a fighter-pilot breathing mask. Cycling around the hutong alleys, looking like Darth Vader being attacked by a hoover, he\u2019s certainly attracted some funny looks. \u201cIt\u2019s a provocational prototype,\u201d Hope says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty archaic, but then burning coal is pretty archaic too. It\u2019s an intentionally ridiculous solution to a ridiculous problem.\u201d Another plucky Dutch designer thinks he can turn the pollution into a lucrative commodity. Over the past few months, Daan Roosegaarde has been meeting with the mayor of Beijing to talk through his plan for \u201celectronic vacuum cleaners\u201d to be installed in parks across the city, to suck smog from the skies. It might sound far-fetched, but he says his working prototype should be ready by next summer. \u201cI want to move away from statistics and the usual factsheet discussion,\u201d says Roosegaarde, talking at excitable break-neck speed, a man on a mission. \u201cIf you create a place that\u2019s 75% cleaner than the rest of the city, you create a powerful incentive for people to clean the whole city.\u201d     Roosegaarde\u2019s \u2018smog ring\u2019 houses 1,000 cubic metres of smog in a 1mm-cube carbon crystal.    His proposal, developed in partnership with scientists at the Technological University of Delft in the Netherlands, uses buried coils of copper to create an electrostatic field that attracts smog particles, creating a kind of halo of clean air above it. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to how static electricity attracts your hair,\u201d Roosegaarde says. \u201cWe charge the smog particles and suck them to the ground.\u201d He has also developed a mobile version which uses the same technology, but housed in a vertical totem-pole structure that sits atop a small temple-like pavilion, akin to those found in Beijing\u2019s parks. It\u2019s here where the real alchemy will happen. \u201cWe\u2019re going to turn dust into diamonds,\u201d Roosegaarde says. \u201cWe will condense a 1,000 cubic metres of smog down into a millimetre-cube carbon crystal \u2013 which we will set like a diamond on a ring.\u201d When you buy a smog ring, he says, you\u2019re effectively donating 1,000 cubic metres of clean air to the city. \u201cI like the idea that you can take a problem and turn it into something desirable,\u201d Roosegaarde adds. \u201cOf course it\u2019s not a practical solution, but I\u2019m hoping that smog jewellery will get people talking about the problem \u2013 and when they see these clear circles of blue sky above the parks, they\u2019ll demand clean air for the whole city.\u201d The volume of discontent has been rising since Beijingers got a chance to see exactly what clear blue skies looked like last month, when miraculous weather was laid on for visiting world leaders, in town for the high-profile Apec summit. With the kind of draconian measures unseen since the 2008 Olympics, the entire region was locked down to guarantee clear skies for the precious week. Production in all factories within a 125-mile radius of the city was suspended, half the cars were banned from the roads, schools were closed, and public-sector workers were given compulsory holidays. No weddings were registered, no passports issued, no taxes paid, no fresh products delivered, and no banks open. Bodies went uncremated and burials were partly suspended.

A climatic Potemkin facade of perfect blue skies \u2013 which soon became an internet meme, coining the term \u201cApec blue\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not sky blue or ocean blue. It\u2019s not Prussian blue or Tiffany blue,\u201d wrote one user of the microblogging site, Weibo. \u201cA few years ago it was Olympic blue, and now it\u2019s Apec blue.\u201d It quickly came to mean something of fleeting, artificial beauty, probably too good to be true. \u201cHe\u2019s not really into you,\u201d went one recurring online saying. \u201cIt\u2019s just an Apec blue.\u201d Returning to Beijing during the Apec week was like arriving in a completely different city. What had been a ghostly world of streets that disappeared if more than a block away, became a wide-open place of grand avenues terminating at distant mountains, visible for the first time. And back at the British School, the smog dome was empty. Pupils were enjoying a rare outdoor lesson beneath a different kind of artificial roof \u2013 the crystal clear canopy of Apec blue. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2015.

Her drip-drip approach to promoting The Pinkprint started back in June when Pills N Potions was released and was followed by a bumtastic video for Anaconda and another apparently inspired by Nazi imagery. Our critics listened to it and found an album that confused, impressed and depressed in equal measure. Ben Westhoff: \u2018Turns out Minaj can do a credible Elton John thing too\u2019  Nicki Minaj is so routinely trashed in comment sections that it\u2019s worth acknowledging just how extraordinary she is. She\u2019s an absolute beast of a rapper and can craft pop hits in a way that seems effortless. These are talents only a handful of earthlings possess, but hip-hop aficionados remain upset that she often lets her most base commercial instincts take over, rather than crafting masterpieces.  When at Summer Jam 2012 Peter Rosenberg dissed her song Starships as not being \u201creal hip-hop\u201d, it felt like a \u201chate isn\u2019t the opposite of love\u201d moment; many folks interpreted his words as a call for her to do what she\u2019s capable of. Coincidence or not, The Pinkprint seemed poised to do just that. With a title referencing Jay-Z\u2019s classic The Blueprint, early indications seemed to promise a return to the form she displayed early in her career. But advance singles dumped cold water on that premise, particularly Anaconda, whose nearly softcore video has more YouTube views than the US population, but contains everything her critics loathe: product placement, an obvious Sir Mix-a-Lot sample, and \u201canti-love, disharmonious messages.\u201d On \u201cOnly,\u201d meanwhile, Drake and Lil Wayne coarsely explain why they haven\u2019t had sex with her and what would happen if they do, while its lyric video contains Nazi imagery.  But elsewhere The Pinkprint delivers on its promise. Want Some More, Win Again and Feeling Myself all feature genuine spitting; they\u2019re self-affirming tracks that taunt her opponents in the classic hip-hop tradition, over compelling, exotic beats from producers such as Hit-Boy, Sak Pase, Zaytoven, and even former Love and Hip Hop Hollywood star Yung Berg. Then there\u2019s the handful of radio-friendly Dr Luke songs, which hip-hop fans will shrug off, though the island girls-tribute Trini Dem Girls really moves. And then there\u2019s a third section of the album, songs like All Things Go and Grand Piano, which are genuinely moving, emotionally wrenching ballads. Turns out Minaj can do a credible Elton John thing too, yet another impressive skill, though none of this really adds up to a compelling album. Inevitably everyone (meaning the young men who dominate internet discourse) will complain about The Pinkprint, even though everyone (meaning the young pop fans who actually spend money on music) will buy it. So while it\u2019s difficult to call The Pinkprint a good album, it re-establishes Minaj as, at the very least, unworthy of your barbs.  Ben Westhoff is the Guardian US hip-hop critic and author of Dirty South: Outkast, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, and the Southern Rappers Who Reinvented Hip-Hop  Amanda Holpuch: \u2018You are in Nicki Minaj\u2019s world and you aren\u2019t getting out, even with a fight\u2019 With only a toned-down dusting of the sugary EDM pop tracks that marked Nicki Minaj\u2019s past studio albums, The Pinkprint\u2019s simple flow opens the door for people who want to soak up the empowering lyrics Minaj has made her name with. Opening track All Things Go is Nicki at her most vulnerable, leaving everything on the table to get ready for the fight: six songs later she has dispelled rumours of sleeping with Drake and Lil Wayne (with their support), rapped angrily about breakups and sung with teen-bop sensation Ariana Grande about making their sexual partners \u201cbeg for it\u201d. \u201cYou my son, I\u2019m just not showing yet,\u201d she calls out on Want Some More, ripping apart critics as she heads into the inimitable rap speed that has kept her ahead of the competition. The motherhood theme runs throughout her catalog and while it is usually a reference to her influence on other rappers, on The Pinkprint it is a warning that you are in Nicki Minaj\u2019s world and you aren\u2019t getting out, even with a fight. This is because she is more than established in the rap game, as she reminds you every time a male is allowed on one of her tracks. On Big Daddy, Meek Mill raps about his patriarchal nickname but it is just a platform for Nicki to remind everyone that she is in charge. And when Jeremih asks if he can be hers on Favorite, the closest thing the album has to a love song, Nicki conditions that proposition: \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hype ya/But you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya.\u201d Strip the cotton candy hair and gloss-soaked lips from Minaj and you have the same versatile rapper with no time for your criticism and more powerful rhymes than you can bat a thick false eyelash at.

Since her 2010 full-length debut Pink Friday, we\u2019ve seen Minaj\u2019s flashes of brilliance \u2013 lacerating guest verses, the armour of theatrical Technicolor outfits and her breakneck speed flow among them. Whatever you may think of her wig collection or sizeable behind, she has undeniable skill as a rapper.  But somehow The Pinkprint ignores mounting pressure from both the hip-hop purists and the fans that hopped aboard the Minaj express when 2012\u2019s Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded catapulted her into dance-pop territory. It\u2019s a deeply personal collection of tracks, fonder of balladry and sung verses than either Lookin Ass sassy Nicki or Ellen Show-popular, borderline EDM Nicki. Mostly, The Pinkprint sounds like a breakup album dotted with a touch of big-up back-patting and sexual innuendo: palatable, sometimes forgettable but displaying a level of vulnerability we\u2019ve not really seen from a Minaj album before.  The music sweeps from trap-like Shanghai to completely sung slow jam Grand Piano, leaning towards bass-heavy production throughout. Producer Dr Luke, frequent Katy Perry hitmaker, works his formulaic pop magic on everything from Trini Dem Girls\u2019 thumping dancehall to Get On Your Knees \u2013 which has you sorted if you\u2019ve ever wanted to hear Ariana Grande wail about cunnilingus.      Amid reflections on fame, failed relationships, and what sounds like an allusion to an abortion or miscarriage on All Things Go, Minaj can still sound fierce, for example when bellowing: \u201cIs pigs flying? / Is these bitches tryin\u2019 me? / They think it\u2019s sweet / Oh, these bitches got diabetes?\u201d on Want Some More.  Though this album is far from perfect, weighed down by duds like Meek Mill-featuring Buy a Heart and The Night is Still Young\u2019s inane pseudo-dubstep, Minaj appears to have made an album on her own terms. That\u2019s not going to make everyone happy, but now that she\u2019s raked in that Starships and Moscato money she probably doesn\u2019t care that much.

That might look to be down on overseas openings for the previous instalments, An Unexpected Journey ($138m) and Desolation of Smaug ($135.4m), but it unrolled in nearly 10 fewer markets, so no cause for alarm. With methodical marketing that has emphasised the film as not only the culmination of the trilogy, but of 17 years on Tolkien duty for director Peter Jackson, it would be quite a shock if the film didn\u2019t see a rally from Desolation of Smaug\u2019s $958.4m worldwide take (a predictable middle-instalment slip from the first\u2019s $1.01bn). Next week\u2019s US opening will have a big say \u2013 perhaps why Warner opted to open the film internationally first, in order to reinforce the sense of a universal phenomenon that will fire up easily jaded American audiences. Five Armies would have to take $1.11bn to rule them all in terms of the entire Middle Earth sextet \u2013 that was Return of the King\u2019s eventual total, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of all time.              In terms of individual countries, Five Armies is doing best-ever Hobbit business in the UK, France, Mexico, New Zealand, probably in Russia (where admissions are high, but the rouble crisis is depressing its dollar-take) and, most resoundingly, in Germany. There, its $20.5m debut is not only a series high ($15m: Unexpected; $19m: Desolation), it\u2019s also topped the 2014 openings chart by some distance. Germany was the most lucrative non-US market, ahead, surprisingly, of the UK, for both of the other two Hobbit movies; a nice nod to the northern European cultural roots of JRR Tolkien\u2019s original myth-making. By the book     Christian Bale as Moses in Exodus: Gods and Kings. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar    US film-goers didn\u2019t exactly flock to Ridley Scott and Christian Bale\u2019s standard this weekend, with their Moses epic Exodus: Gods and Kings managing a half-hearted $24.1m at first pass. That\u2019s significantly short of the more radical Noah\u2019s $43.7m in March, $25.6m for Fox\u2019s Jesus outing Son of God in February \u2013 let alone the $83.8m for Passion of the Christ, which was in Aramaic, for you-know-who\u2019s sake. Thirty per cent of Exodus\u2019s audience identified themselves as \u201cvery religious\u201d, and distributor Fox will need them to continue turning out to bulk up box office over the Christmas season. But given that Noah rode out many squalls about its unorthodox spin on the Bible to an eventual $362.6m worldwide, whereas the only flak Exodus has received has been about its racial casting policy, perhaps Scott should have been more adventurous story-wise. Currently on $73.7m across all territories, it\u2019s not holding up especially well in the spate of Christian-dominated countries it kicked off in last week: -49% in South Korea, -53% in Spain, -53% in Mexico (even with The Hobbit yet to open in those three). Turkey and Israel opened, both down on Noah, this week \u2013 the most significant among a scattering of minor territories before most of western Europe and the Middle East weighs in around Christmas Day.

That was the name invoked in a fair few reviews for Chris Rock\u2019s third directorial effort Top Five, in which Woody-ish New York amblings and musings happen to comedian-actor Andre Allen (played by Rock) in the company of a beautiful journalist (Rosario Dawson) who spins his life around. Critics seem to agree that the film \u2013 staffed by superior talent, including director of photography Manuel Alberto Claro (Nymphomaniac), producers Jay Z and Kanye West and executive music producer Questlove (of the Roots) \u2013 is a cut above mainstream African-American output, tempering the typical raucous comedy with greater control and character subtleties. Rock also \u2013 like a certain Jewish icon \u2013 cannily refracts his leading role through the prism of his own star persona. And his huge fanbase almost appears to give him the edge in box-office terms over Allen in the US: $6.9m is far higher than any of the legend\u2019s openings (the best being $3.9m for Small Time Crooks), though inflation-corrected results for some of Allen\u2019s canonic works might rearrange the picture. Allen, though, isn\u2019t limited by a strongly ethnic fanbase, which has allowed him to notch up some significant worldwide tallies, especially recently (Midnight in Paris: $151.1m; Blue Jasmine: $97.5m). It\u2019s an exciting prospect that an African-American director could widen his appeal beyond his immediate constituency to land on similar levels of success: Top Five will get a limited release in mostly English-speaking countries early next year, which is a start. Now all Rock has to do is put in a hot-streak to match the one Allen enjoyed in the 70s and 80s.            The rest of the world There was no Rentrak data for India or China this week, which meant that weekend one for Rajinikanth\u2019s Tamil blockbuster Lingaa and weekend two for barnstorming Chinese schooldays drama Fleet of Time were a little hazy. There\u2019s been initial speculation that Lingaa had taken 102 crore ($16.2m), which would make it the fastest Tamil film to pass the 100-crore mark \u2013 but India\u2019s sketchy box-office reporting systems have thrown up much dust around that claim. Zhang Yibai\u2019s Fleet of Time looks to have reached an impressive $72.61m over its first week, closing the gap on Vicky Zhao\u2019s So Young, the film that started off the nostalgic college-days drama fad in 2013 and earned $116m. The two new international newcomers we do know about are Korean indie documentary My Love, Don\u2019t Cross That River, in 11th place globally; and Italian comedy Il Ricco, Il Povero e Il Maggiordomo (The Rich, The Poor and the Butler), in 15th place. Having opened two weeks ago and expanded massively since to climb up the charts in South Korea, the former follows a 98-year-old and an 89-year-old who have been married for 76 years. It\u2019s currently outpacing Interstellar and Exodus there \u2013 now that is what you call stamina.            The future Five Armies plants its hairy toes even further afield, including the US in mid-week and locales \u2013 such as South Korea and Spain \u2013 where it was ducking a first-week clash with Exodus. The big children\u2019s release for Christmas, a third Night at the Museum in the company of Ben Stiller, is wheeled out in about 30 markets, including the UK, Italy, Germany and most of the Middle East. Disney\u2019s manga-inflected Big Hero 6 has been hanging around the top 10 for nearly six weeks, and has quietly been amassing records for an animation in smaller Asian countries; its crosscultural ambitions get their first real test with a Japanese and Hong Kong release next frame. With other big markets en route (Italy, Spain, Brazil, Australia, South Africa before 2015), it should push on rapidly from an already sizeable global pot of $253.5m.

Talking of great expectations, actor-director Jiang Wen will be hoping to reclaim the Chinese local-film box-office record once held by his period comedy western Let the Bullets Fly. His newbie, Gone With the Bullets \u2013 an urban action-comedy this time centred around a 1920s Shanghai beauty pageant \u2013 had a spot of bother with the censors that nixed its premiere, but will open on schedule on Thursday. Costing $20m more than its precedessor at $48.8m, with involvement from Sony, it\u2019s another example of how budgets in China are ballooning in tandem with box office.

The Waigaoqiao coal-fired power plant located in Shanghai has been violating China\u2019s national standards for nitrogen oxides every week since new standards came into force in July, according to analysis of publicly available government data by researchers at Greenpeace East Asia. The data shows that phase two of the Waigaoqiao plant, which has a capacity of 1,800MW, has been emitting nitrogen oxides in excess of emission standards used by the local environmental protection bureau 18% of the time.  Research by Greenpeace also shows that the local regulator is not yet using the national standards on nitrogen oxides. If the new standards were being used, the group said the plant would be in violation almost all of the time. Waigaoqiao is often praised as the cleanest coal-powered plant in China and is seen as a showcase for other plants in the country. However such a large violation of emissions standards at this plant shows that China is still struggling with enforcing its environmental protection laws and regulations. \u201cThe gap in enforcement is still there,\u201d said Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, which also monitors pollution levels throughout China. The case shows that even in the well-developed coastal regions of China \u201cthere is still an enforcement gap, but the gap is bigger in the mid and western parts of China,\u201d he said.  Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior global coal campaigner with Greenpeace, said: \u201cthe systematic violations, in a mega power plant in the middle of China\u2019s most important economic centre and the failure by the regulator to effectively intervene illustrate the challenge that China faces in controlling emissions from its massive coal industry\u201d.     Heavy smog shrouds the Pudong Lujiazui financial district in Shanghai, China.  Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images    Greenpeace also looked at figures for the neighbouring province of Jiangsu and found that in July, half of the coal-fired plants were violating the regulations on nitrogen oxides. \u201cThis is not a single case but maybe in the whole country the power plants have the same problem,\u201d said Fang Lifeng, a coal expert with Greenpeace, based in Beijing. Nitrogen oxides are one of the main contributors to fine particulate pollution known as PM2.5 which is considered dangerous because it penetrates deep into the lungs. PM2.5 pollution was linked to 670,000 premature deaths in 2012, according to a study released in November.  While China has made progress in dealing with other components of air pollution including sulphur dioxide, it has only recently started to deal with the issue of nitrogen oxides. China is still facing many issues in terms of enforcement of its environmental regulations but there has been a lot of progress made on transparency of data and it is now publishing real-time data from a huge number of power and industrial plants. \u201cWith this I think China has made some remarkable progress and we need to recognise that. The real-time disclosure of the online monitoring data on such a massive scale, China is probably the first country to do that,\u201d said Ma Jun. \u201cIt demonstrates that in China there has been some real political will to try to deal with the problems.\u201d", "tags": ["Pollution", "Coal", "Fossil fuels", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Energy", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Greenpeace", "Environment", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2014-12-18T05:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2014/dec/19/primary-students-free-school-meals-text-talk-roma-children", "sentences": ["Ranked at number one for long home work hours was Shanghai, followed by Russia and then Singapore."], "title": "Free school meals take off, boys text talk and support for Roma students", "article": "Good week for School meals. 85% of primary school pupils are opting for free school meals according to new figures welcomed by the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg.

It looks like the artist Anish Kapoor has been let loose with his wax cannon again. But this, in fact, is what the making of Christmas looks like; this is the very heart of the real Santa\u2019s workshop \u2013 thousands of miles from the North Pole, in the Chinese city of Yiwu. Our yuletide myth-making might like to imagine that Christmas is made by rosy-cheeked elves hammering away in a snow-bound log cabin somewhere in the Arctic Circle. But it\u2019s not. The likelihood is that most of those baubles, tinsel and flashing LED lights you\u2019ve draped liberally around your house came from Yiwu, 300km south of Shanghai \u2013 where there\u2019s not a (real) pine tree nor (natural) snowflake in sight. Christened \u201cChina\u2019s Christmas village\u201d, Yiwu is home to 600 factories that collectively churn out over 60% of all the world\u2019s Christmas decorations and accessories, from glowing fibre-optic trees to felt Santa hats. The \u201celves\u201d that staff these factories are mainly migrant labourers, working 12 hours a day for a maximum of \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 a month \u2013 and it turns out they\u2019re not entirely sure what Christmas is.     Wei gets through at least 10 face masks each day, trying not to breathe in the cloud of red dust. Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex    \u201cMaybe it\u2019s like [Chinese] New Year for foreigners,\u201d says 19-year-old Wei, a worker who came to Yiwu from rural Guizhou province this year, speaking to Chinese news agency Sina. Together with his father, he works long days in the red-splattered lair, taking polystyrene snowflakes, dipping them in a bath of glue, then putting them in a powder-coating machine until they turn red \u2013 and making 5,000 of the things every day. In the process, the two of them end up dusted from head to toe in fine crimson powder. His dad wears a Santa hat (not for the festive spirit, he says, but to stop his hair from turning red) and they both get through at least 10 face masks a day, trying not to breathe in the dust. It\u2019s a tiring job and they probably won\u2019t do it again next year: once they\u2019ve earned enough money for Wei to get married, they plan on returning home to Guizhou and hopefully never seeing a vat of red powder again. Packaged up in plastic bags, their gleaming red snowflakes hang alongside a wealth of other festive paraphernalia across town in the Yiwu International Trade Market, aka China Commodity City, a 4m sq m wonder-world of plastic tat. It is a pound shop paradise, a sprawling trade show of everything in the world that you don\u2019t need and yet may, at some irrational moment, feel compelled to buy. There are whole streets in the labyrinthine complex devoted to artificial flowers and inflatable toys, then come umbrellas and anoraks, plastic buckets and clocks. It is a heaving multistorey monument to global consumption, as if the contents of all the world\u2019s landfill sites had been dug-up, re-formed and meticulously catalogued back into 62,000 booths.     The two men produce 5,000 red snowflakes a day, and get paid around \u00a3300 a month. Photograph: China Daily/Reuters    The complex was declared by the UN to be the \u201clargest small commodity wholesale market in the world\u201d and the scale of the operation necessitates a kind of urban plan, with this festival of commerce organised into five different districts. District Two is where Christmas can be found. There are corridors lined with nothing but tinsel, streets throbbing with competing LED light shows, stockings of every size, plastic Christmas trees in blue and yellow and fluorescent pink, plastic pine cones in gold and silver. Some of it seems lost in translation: there are sheep in Santa hats and tartan-embroidered reindeer, and of course lots of that inexplicable Chinese staple, Father Christmas playing the saxophone. It might look like a wondrous bounty, but the market\u2019s glory days seem to have passed: it\u2019s now losing out to internet giants like Alibaba and Made In China. On Alibaba alone, you can order 1.4m different Christmas decorations to be delivered to your door at the touch of a button. Yiwu market, by comparison, stocks a mere 400,000 products.     Santa hats galore \u2026 inside one of Yiwu\u2019s Christmas showrooms.

He might as well have been talking about himself. After studying in Sydney and then Pune, Angus followed Australian adventurer Morrison\u2019s footsteps from Shanghai to Rangoon in 1994 \u2013 a century after Morrison\u2019s own journey. It was a trip that established his name as a photojournalist and the book of his travels, The Five Foot Road, became an important document of the change wrought by conflict and revolution. It was in order to see yet more change that Angus, aged 50, persuaded me to return to Burma with him in 2013. Now it is called Myanmar, and the first Irrawaddy Literary Festival was being held in the capital, under the patronage of Aung San Suu Kyi. It was an event that would have been unimaginable just one year previously. Symbolic of the shiny new Myanmar, tourists thronged the city\u2019s Inya Lake gorging on copies of Daw Suu\u2019s books. Jung Chang and Vikram Seth ambled alongside guests in a giggly atmosphere of chaos and goodwill. As the sun set on the lake we were filled with hope not only for Myanmar\u2019s future, but for our own: Angus was in an unexpected remission from pancreatic cancer. It was when we journeyed to a hill station called Kalaw in southern Shan State, 5,000ft above sea level, that he began to tire. He insisted he was weary from the excitement of being back in Myanmar, a country still ill-equipped for independent travel, and how could I disagree? It was easy, in the mountains, to forget that he had in the previous nine months been diagnosed with cancer, had his digestive system rearranged, undergone chemotherapy, been told that his cancer was terminal with hungry lesions colonising his liver, and finally \u2013 the cherry on the cancer cake \u2013 had radioactive beads injected into this vital organ. When he told me with infinite patience and sweetness that he merely needed to rest, there was little for me to do other than to simply watch over him, as I always had.     The sun sets over fishermen on Inle Lake. This is one of the final photographs Angus McDonald ever took in Burma.    I snapped at the taxi driver not to stare at Angus, who had asked him to stop the car as he struggled to catch his breath. We were on our way to Yangon airport. Soon after breakfast he had complained of a heaviness in his chest before curling up in a chair until our taxi arrived. The night before he had taken my hands and told me that he thought the cancer had taken up lodgings in his lungs. Of course it was inevitable that the marauding army of cells would set up camp elsewhere soon enough. It was a well-trodden path: pancreas, liver, then lung. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d I asked. Angus nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Start the car,\u201d he said. Despite his protestations, I was anxious. His voice was several shades lighter, almost transparent. He seemed to be disappearing into himself, fading inwards in front of me. The car took us past the Shwedagon pagoda, shimmering elevated and imperious, past Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s house on University Road. While Angus appeared calm, large beads of sweat bubbled from his temples. His eyes were closed tight. We arrived at the airport and Angus suggested \u2013 in a very, very small voice \u2013 something that I had already planned to do: find a wheelchair. I tore through the terminal and into the airline office. The staff \u2013 lead-footed \u2013 moved so imperceptibly that I grabbed at a folded wheelchair, all the while barking commands. Suddenly, all was movement. Perhaps they sensed the hysteria that coated my every word and action. Angus was now slumped in his seat, colour drained. His shirt was wet through, his body was slack and clammy. \u201cIs there a doctor here? Where is he?\u201d \u201cYes, madam; here, madam.\u201d A man with a walkie-talkie motioned to the baggage reclaim area and I saw doors I had not noticed before. On one was a small sticker of a red cross. Angus\u2019s head had lolled towards his chest, and I gripped his hand. I crooned into his ear and heard a voice calm and low. The doctor\u2019s door was locked. The walkie-talkie man shrugged. Angus was beginning to sink. His cheeks were growing more concave with each laboured breath and a brief ache of fear lit his eyes as I looked at him and said: \u201cIt\u2019s OK, darling, we\u2019re here. The doctor is here.\u201d It was a lie. There was no one save the tourists filtering towards the baggage carousels. I ran towards them. \u201cA doctor? Is anyone a doctor? I need a doctor!\u201d My voice sounded giddy and high pitched. Someone had the grace to acknowledge me: \u201cNah, sorry.\u201d Most kept their eyes fixed on the empty carousel. A huddle of air hostesses closed in on itself, turning their backs on me. I glanced back \u2013 I couldn\u2019t leave Angus alone \u2013 and saw a man barely out of his teens, wearing a white coat, running towards us. Angus was fast losing consciousness. As gently as I could, I pushed my fingers into his mouth and forced apart his teeth, which had clamped shut, and the air whooshed in. He was moved on to a bed, where I took him in my arms and whispered that the doctor was here, that he\u2019d be all right. His eyes were closed now and his cheeks relaxed; I didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d heard me. In the undiluted terror of the young doctor\u2019s eyes I saw that this was a life-or-death moment. Perhaps, it occurred to me, that moment had already passed. \u201cDo something!\u201d It was between a whisper and a snarl. \u201cDo something!\u201d The doctor\u2019s hands shook as he shouted to a nurse who, by contrast, was unruffled and efficient. He stuttered and dropped the vial of liquid that he was trying to get into a syringe. I tore the syringe from his hands and ripped at the wrapper. I pulled off the vial\u2019s stopper with my teeth and pushed it into the syringe body, then the nurse took over. She pressed a stethoscope to his chest, and I looked in her eyes: \u201cHeartbeat.\u201d     Modern-day explorer: Angus\u2019s book India\u2019s Disappearing Railways is a homage to the country he grew up in.    \u201cThe\u2026 the\u2026 the ambulance it comes,\u201d whispered the doctor. \u201cI cannot\u2026 I cannot\u2026 I cannot\u2026 You go, now, good hospital. Foreigner hospital, good hospital.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I roared. \u201cYou cannot what?\u201d He shrugged, entirely lost and confused. \u201cYou. Are. Coming. With. Me. NOW.\u201d I marched him in front of me and somehow \u2013 I cannot remember how \u2013 we were at the rear of the airport and by an ambulance, doors swinging agape, two men standing uneasy in the back. This was little more than a minibus that had had its seats ripped out, with rough wooden slats along each side, a small First Aid kit. The stretcher was laid along the middle. I begged the nurse to come: Angus didn\u2019t have a chance with the adolescent in charge. \u201cNo. No. I cannot come,\u201d she said as she backed away. I cried and pleaded, but there was no time. Angus was on the floor of the ambulance, and they performed CPR. The doctor pressed his chest. He was still. Yet I held the hope that we would arrive at a state-of-the-art hospital in which he would be rescued. I collapsed next to him. I didn\u2019t know where we were going. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. Alternately I held his hand, murmured into his ear, placed my forehead on his arm, touched his hair\u2026 and then we arrived. A group of medics waited. One rushed into the cabin. There was a torrent of Burmese. He crouched down and checked Angus\u2019s pulse, listened to his stethoscope, lifted an eyelid, and shone a light into his eyes: the last time I would see the coppery agate of those eyes, the same colour as my own. And I looked down upon myself from above. I saw myself and the outline of my figure and, strangely, the body \u2013 just the body, merely that \u2013 of the one I loved. There I floated as gently as a see-sawing acorn leaf aloft on an invisible slipstream, in the hushed centre of a gathering tempest. I saw that the frantic activity of men and women in white coats seemed to be treacle-slow. Suspended still but sensing that soon I might fall, I was aware of an approaching sound, like the booming of a wave. I looked down and I saw two bodies, one of whose head covered the other\u2019s. These bodies lay congruent to one another, head pivoting over head. The body that was mine lay awkwardly with legs bent in a clumsy misery of confusion, shoulder blades angled sharply in torment. The body beneath mine was long and flat, legs slightly apart, feet limp, arms loose, hands open-palmed. The echo, the booming wave, grew louder. Its volume rose as the figures below quickened and sharpened and I plunged to the ground. I heard myself scream. The doctor turned to me and said just this: \u201cHe is already expired.\u201d     Final blessings are paid to Angus at the funeral home.    I know now that the hospital in which Angus and I came to rest that night was called North Okkalapa General Hospital and that the concrete room with two mattressless beds \u2013 where another doctor performed a cardiogram and again declared him dead \u2013 was the emergency ward. There I was forced to face up to certain duties: to answer the questions of a policeman who kept telling me to \u201cStay cool!\u201d; to meet the Australian embassy\u2019s doctor; to contact Angus\u2019s family in Sydney. After that, the Australian doctor drew me aside. \u201cWe need to know what your wishes are. Repatriation can be expensive. And it can take time. Here in Yangon, well\u2026 I don\u2019t know that you would want to leave Angus\u2019s body in the mortuary for too long.\u201d I guessed he meant that a corpse would deteriorate badly in the heat. \u201cThere are other options. Cremation, of course, is one. We could arrange that. And then we would only have to deal with the repatriation of the ashes.\u201d Mortuary. Cremation. Repatriation. Ashes. This is not how we had envisaged our departure from Myanmar. The doctor wore a Hawaiian shirt \u2013 it was the weekend and he had been called from his home \u2013 and into this I leant the weight of my grief and pressed my red face. I protested. Angus wouldn\u2019t sleep in a mortuary. He wouldn\u2019t stay here. He now lay on a trolley in the middle of the room. The Australian doctor had pulled a sheet over his face, although I could discern the tip of his glorious nose, the wonderful length of him. But Angus had left, long ago. \u201cCremation,\u201d was my answer. The Free Funeral Services Society (FFSS), a charity run by local Burmese who perform funerals and cremations for all, regardless of status, ethnicity or religion, sounded completely implausible. My Burmese acquaintance explained more. \u201cThe man who runs the charity, U Kyaw Thu, he is a hero for we Burmese people. He is a film star. You must visit this place. They can arrange for you the funeral of your husband. Sure, sure they will. Go there, it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d U Kyaw Thu \u2013 a heart-throb of the 80s and 90s and a Myanmar Academy award-winning actor and director starring in over 200 films \u2013 established the charity in 2001. He had had an epiphany when visiting a friend in hospital. When the old woman in the neighbouring bed was dying, her family vanished: they could not afford her funeral. It was then that he became a funeral philanthropist. Pictures of U Kyaw Thu showed a thick-set man with dramatic curly black locks, a goatee beard and a serious face. Some of his old film shots showed him wearing, variously, biker leathers, a silken kimono and, in another, a draped snake. My driver was excited to be in the grounds of U Kyaw Thu\u2019s organisation and insisted on accompanying me inside the large modern building set back from the main road in North Dagon township. A mass of discarded shoes lay at the top of carpeted marble steps and the building was a hive of activity: men and women, young and old, bustling about, all wearing dark longyi and white ingyi. The walls were covered with collages of photographs \u2013 wall upon wall of them \u2013 all of funerals and cremations showing glass coffins containing corpses: monks, children, older people. There were photographs of grieving families, polished black hearses and flowers. In almost all of them, the coffin was carried by U Kyaw Thu himself.     Angus McDonald\u2019s coffin with bouquets of flowers.    Three or four members of the FFSS materialised, their faces radiating benevolence. A woman roughly my own age, Ma Ayeyar, guided me into a private room where I stumbled through my story. I explained that I would like a simple cremation ceremony with Buddhist funeral rites and to make offerings to the local monastery so that they would say sanghika dana prayers for Angus on the seventh, 49th and 100th days after his death. \u201cYes,\u201d Ma Ayeyar said. \u201cWe will arrange all this. First we go to the mortuary and we will complete the documents to release the body. Then we will transport the body to Yay Way Crematorium, where we prepare the body for cremation. We will arrange the offerings for the monks. We can pay the donation for the prayers. We will do all these things.\u201d I was astounded. Within a couple of days, as soon as the paperwork had been completed and Angus\u2019s family had arrived, U Kyaw Thu himself arrived at the mortuary in a black hearse bearing a glass case. We, the bereaved, all stood forlornly outside the low-timbered building: me, Angus\u2019s father and mother, Tim and Gillian from Sydney, his younger sister Marnie from Vientiane, Hamish, his elder brother from Darwin. I had had to return to the airport to greet them, to avert my eyes from the baggage carousels and the door with the little red cross. Without acknowledging us U Kyaw Thu and two staff disappeared inside and returned carrying Angus in the glass case, over which they had draped an orange velvet covering. I saw the sole of one of his feet pressed up against the glass at one end; but of course, he was so tall! I could not laugh then but am amused now at the thought that Angus, who had always complained that Asian beds were so very short, should end his life squashed into a glass box that was once again too small for him. He was levered into the hearse. I handed over the clothes that I had prepared for him to wear, and his glasses, so that he could read the book he had almost finished \u2013 it was Fergal Keane\u2019s Road of Bones \u2013 which I asked them to place in his coffin. I didn\u2019t think that I would be able to look at him again. I wasn\u2019t sure that I wanted to. I was scared that he would be altered, his skin discoloured, that he would look \u2013 not asleep, but more obviously stone-cold dead. When we arrived at Yay Way the sun was high and hot. We carried with us the offerings of three sets of monks\u2019 robes and envelopes of money to donate to the local monastery. On the way we stopped at the flower market in downtown Yangon and chose a basket of red, white and yellow roses. My feet, so unwilling, dragged along parched earth. I had not yet seen that the room in which Angus lay was a wide, airy space filled with lilies. There was a long aisle, at the end of which sat the wooden coffin, into which he had been places. To the left were three monks with their heads bowed, carrying fans. One senior monk wore orange pamsukula robes; the other two, burgundy. In front of them was a low table piled with offerings and wide silver bowls heaped with bunches of bananas resting on mango leaves. Burmese men circled the coffin, lighting incense and candles, chanting with a barely audible hum. Rows of chairs lined the aisle. To the right of me were dozens of Burmese women; to the left, men. Later I discovered that these were members of the FFSS who had come to replace Angus\u2019s friends and family who could not be here. The room\u2019s walls contained wide eyelets looking on to gardens outside. Pink bougainvillea blushed in the outdoor heat, but the room was shady and cool.     Catherine Anderson and Angus McDonald on their last trip to Burma.    I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t see him. I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I leant on Angus\u2019s brother. His mother, father and sister were at the coffin. Once again I had the sense of being far, far from my body. And I saw that he was there, wearing the clothes I prepared, his hair neatly combed, creamy white blooms scattered around his head, across his chest and between the gaps of his arms and legs. I walked down the aisle to my dead fianc\u00e9. The coffin was trimmed with white lace, and on the side was painted the misspelling \u201cAngus McDonacd\u201d. Five of the older Burmese men who had circled the coffin knelt on the floor between us and the monks and began to pray. The monks chanted Pali verses on the impermanence of life and the transference of merit. The praying men motioned that we, the family members, should stand and each offer robes to the monks, during which they chanted contemplative verses. A plastic chair was placed in front of me on which was a tray, a jug of water and a bowl, all silver. I slowly poured the water into the bowl \u2013 an ancient Indian gesture that is a re-enactment of Siddhartha\u2019s calling of the earth to witness his store of merit. Each FFSS volunteer carried, in the form of a funeral cortege, an item from the room: one held Angus\u2019s framed photo aloft, another some roses, another the silver tray. The coffin, too, was carried towards the incinerator by volunteers, led by Angus\u2019s father and brother. He was carried into the sunshine with a polystyrene box of food propped on top of his coffin \u2013 noodles to ease any hunger pangs on his long journey into the next life. As the bell rang he slid easily into the incinerator. The monks had departed the hall ahead of us. The one who had led the chanting had stopped in front of me, and whispered three words: \u201cBe at peace.\u201d Angus McDonald\u2019s India\u2019s Disappearing Railways is published by Carlton Book at \u00a330.

Strauss did not realise the feed was being broadcast abroad while Sky Sports viewers in the UK were at a commercial break. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was my proudest moment,\u201d he said later. Lowest moral high ground The ECB thought they had the moral high ground over Kevin Pietersen. Then, in May, Paul Downton told Test Match Special: \u201cI watched every ball of the Sydney Test live, and I\u2019ve never seen anyone as disinterested or distracted. It looked very strange. I talked to every person on the management team and quite a few players, and I could not find one supporter who wanted Kevin to stay in the side.\u201d One week later, an ECB statement: \u201cSome comments were made in breach of a settlement agreement ... we apologise to Kevin Pietersen.\u201d Best genes Rugby siblings Richie and Jonny Gray marked their first Test together by scoring a try each in November \u2013 the first by brothers in a Scotland game since Gavin and Scott Hastings in 1995.

What needs to be explored now is whether the current US instigated \u201cinvestigation\u201d is genuinely intended to identify those responsible and bring them to account, or whether it is deception intended to cover over the cracks in America\u2019s reputation in the world. Given its historical record, I would expect another scapegoat will be found. It has already got Putin as a possible. I wonder who will be the next person used to get the US off the hook?Lavinia MooreAldgate, South Australia \u2022 For those who can help, therapeutic support for those who have been tortured must be the first priority. But surely, equally important is those who have tortured. Unless they are identified, and given the possibility of coming to confront their actions, aren\u2019t they bound to replicate horrific patterns learned, and to find disturbing ways of escaping their own feelings and memories, whether at home or at work? Isn\u2019t this too the human legacy?Fran BradshawLondon, UK Putin doesn\u2019t need the west The west\u2019s attempt to use cheap oil and an economic embargo to bankrupt Russia is unlikely to succeed in the long run (Rouble fall leaves Russia cold, 12 December). Vladimir Putin has already turned to China, signing dozens of trade and economic cooperation agreements. Russia has commenced building giant oil and gas pipelines to China. This is also beneficial to China because Russia is its next door neighbour and therefore will not have to depend on Middle East oil and attendant American geopolitical complexities. However, the west\u2019s approach may cause bankruptcy to western oil companies and the Saudi economy. Moreover, the Brics group of countries has taken steps to bypass the US dollar and pay in one another\u2019s domestic currencies. This is a blow to the US global financial hegemony. As Putin explains, this is part of \u201ca system of measures that would help prevent the harassment of countries that do not agree with some foreign policy decisions made by the United States and their allies\u201d.Bill MathewMelbourne, Australia Abbott must speak out I listened to our prime minister, Tony Abbott, after the Sydney hostage siege. I agree, our thoughts and sympathies must go to the friends and families of the victims. Mine do. But with the media saturation, and the world looking on, could an Australian leader please acknowledge that leaders from the Muslim community also came together to deplore this lone act of violence? Remind us of this fact as you call for calm and thoughtful reflection, and remind us that the perpetrator\u2019s actions were contrary to the teachings of the Islamic faith, and that a candlelight vigil for the hostages was held at the Lakemba mosque. And when that leader thanks the police and emergency services, let them also thank people like Rachael Jacobs (#illridewithyou) who also responded with courage, initiative and leadership. Let them ask us to think about this example as we process these tragic events. If there ever was a silver lining this was it. Please let that leader avoid tenuous and unnecessary links to Isis, and deplore the salacious, ill-informed media headlines. Ultimately,\u00a0fear is the weapon and this kind of reporting aids, abets and sates the perpetrators. It is their goal. And if that leader feels the need to say it was a politically motivated act, then please reinforce the knowledge that the perpetrator was also acting alone, and not as a sanctioned representative of any political party, religious group, state or country. Who will that leader be?Ian MeggittLewisham, NSW, Australia Radical grammar rules I was amused (or was it appalled?) by the word \u201cradical\u201d, as used in \u201cstudents, from a radical rural teacher training college\u201d (12 December). It\u2019s always like this: on many issues, we see society running into walls at high speed and those who suggest a change of direction, even a small one, are deemed to be the radicals. As for the Mexican students who were slaughtered by local police or the drugs gang working for the police, and apparently working for the mayor, they were the ones referred to as radical. That\u2019s an amusing irony, isn\u2019t it?Marc JachymLes Ulis, France \u2022 The headline to Hugh Muir\u2019s Comment is free In brief (Loaning the Elgin marbles to Russia is wrong, 12 December) is wrong. What happened to the word \u201clending\u201d? Last century, \u201cloan\u201d was a noun.

With hope, in the Guardian.Nicholas TolhurstKew, Victoria, Australia Commuting, Palestinian-style Commuting offers \u201conly minor frustrations\u201d, according to Joe Moran\u2019s book review (12 December). He should read the report of an Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel published in the Quaker magazine the Friend two years ago, entitled How was your commute today? It describes observing and recording Palestinian workers passing through a checkpoint to work in Israel. At 4am \u201calready there are as many as a dozen women and a hundred or so men squatting on the ground, silent or talking quietly, waiting for the gates to open\u201d.

I could go on quoting this report with all its horrors, but enough said. Perhaps Iain Gately should add another chapter to his book.Pat StapletonBeaumont du Ventoux, France We are being cooked slowly We human beings are so wired that in the event of imminent danger, the fight/ flight response kicks in and we respond by instant action (19 December). The other possible response to grave danger, is the lobster immersed in water, which is gradually getting hotter. He doesn\u2019t respond and gets cooked. In the case of immminent and potentially catastrophic climate change, the signs are visible everywhere but we don\u2019t quite get it. We behave more like a lobster than someone faced with imminent catastrophe. There is only one small planet and imminent danger affects every living creature. The severity of our situation must be felt by us all including our governments who will represent us in Paris next year. A lukewarm response is not an option. Titus FosterShoreham, UK Briefly \u2022 Regarding Kerry Smith, the Ukip candidate who resigned for making offensive remarks about gay people and foreigners while he was reportedly on sedatives (19 December): obviously the sedatives were not strong enough.

The country\u2019s implacable president and Communist party chief is forcefully driving China towards economic and geopolitical superpower status. But the social cost is mounting steadily. With the ruthless crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong still fresh in the memory, Xi\u2019s latest anti-democratic coup came in the form of expanded action to block Gmail, Google\u2019s email service, presumably because it gave users a degree of autonomy that Xi and his unelected party cadres find threatening. China already regularly blocks foreign websites such as Facebook and YouTube. Google pulled most of its business out of China in 2011 after a row over censorship. Attempting to justify the Gmail shutdown, the Global Times, which is close to the Communist party, accused Google of failing to comply with Chinese law. But an editorial also suggested China\u2019s action \u201cmust have been prompted by newly emerged security reasons\u201d including \u201cideological security\u201d. It then offered some specious reassurance: \u201cWe only need to have faith that China has its own logic in terms of internet policy and it is made and runs in accordance with the country\u2019s fundamental interests.\u201d For many Chinese, that is a big ask. Aspects of Xi\u2019s policy of \u201cautocracy with Chinese characteristics\u201d are familiar to the country\u2019s academic community, which is under renewed pressure to toe the party line. Instructions issued by the president after a higher education conference on Monday included the demand that universities do more to promote Marxist doctrine and Communist party ideological guidance, the Xinhua news agency reported. \u201cEnhancing [party] leadership and party-building in the higher learning institutions is a fundamental guarantee for running socialist universities with Chinese features well,\u201d Xi was quoted as saying. Political indoctrination is already a routine feature of university life for Chinese students, while their teachers are subject to monitoring to ensure political correctness. In an echo of the Stalinist era in the Soviet Union, this year reporters from state-controlled media were ordered to attend university lectures and detect and denounce teachers whose ideas might be considered \u201cscornful of China\u201d or pro-western. Prof Zhang Xuezhong, of East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai, and Prof Xia Yeliang, of Peking University in Beijing \u2013 both noted champions of free speech and the rule of law \u2013 were sacked in 2013 for what they said were political reasons. \u201cI\u2019m just a university faculty member who expresses his own opinions, thoughts and proposals, which is absolutely my right. This is an out-and-out witch-hunt,\u201d Zhang said. China\u2019s repression of political activists, writers, independent journalists, artists and religious groups who potentially challenge the party\u2019s monopoly of power has intensified since Xi took office nearly two years ago. In the most recent instance, on Tuesday a court sentenced Shen Yongping, a filmmaker, to a year in jail for running an illegal business. But Shen\u2019s supporters suggested his real offence was to have made a documentary recording the party\u2019s ongoing failure to uphold the country\u2019s constitution and laws. China\u2019s estimated 60-70 million Christians have not escaped persecution during the Christmas period, according to reports from Beijing suggesting their plight has worsened under the new leadership. Members of Shouwang, a Beijing Christian group, told Agence France-Presse that several pastors had been under house arrest since they tried to arrange Easter services in a public square in 2011. Most Chinese Christians shun state-run churches and worship in \u201chouse churches\u201d beyond government control. But official tolerance of such independent activity is waning, judging by a crackdown on 400 churches in eastern Zhejiang province, some of which were reportedly demolished. Offering an insight into paranoid party thinking, an official recently told Beijing worshippers to \u201cresolutely resist the use of Christianity by foreigners to infiltrate China\u201d. Crosses have been torn down at many churches and at a nursing home. The authorities have made an issue out of Christmas lights, which are increasingly popular in Chinese cities, saying they may pose a safety hazard. Many in China refuse to accept Xi\u2019s self-serving prescripts about what they may and may not do or say. A recent example was provided by the Sony Pictures comedy The Interview, which caused such offence to North Korea\u2019s dictatorship. Despite being condemned by Chinese state media, the film was gleefully (and illegally) downloaded by tens of thousands of Chinese within hours of its online release, according to the Washington Post. \u201cMany Chinese \u2018netizens\u2019 left positive reviews online, even without seeing the movie, as a gesture of protest against censorship, while others appeared to enjoy the lampooning of the North Korea regime. The country\u2019s leader is often mockingly referred to by Chinese web users as \u2018Fatty Kim III\u2019,\u201d the Post reported.

Towards the end of the 1960s, John was appointed Scandinavian librarian at University College London. This was his last full-time role, but he continued to work in the library after retirement. He made an outstanding contribution to the Viking Society for Northern Research, a group dedicated to the promotion of and research into ancient Scandinavian culture, which meets at UCL, becoming assistant secretary of the society in the early 1960s, a position he held for at least 10 years. He was later treasurer of the society (1979-87) and as president (1988-90) was host to the president of Iceland Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir.
